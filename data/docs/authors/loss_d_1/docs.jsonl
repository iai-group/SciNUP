Such states are\npossible because their light-like electrons come in spin pairs that are\nchiral,which means that their direction of propagation is tied to a quantity\ncalled pseudospin that describes their location in the crystal lattice. An\nemerging direction in quantum materials research is the manipulation of atomic\nspin-orbit coupling to simulate the effect of a spin dependent magnetic\nfield,in attempt to realize novel spin phases of matter. This effect has been\nproposed to realize systems consisting of unpaired Dirac cones that are\nhelical, meaning their direction of propagation is tied to the electron spin\nitself, which are forbidden to exist in graphene or bismuth.

In this paper we concentrate on the exchange interaction and\ngeneralize the functional bosonization formalism developed earlier for the\ncharging energy.

Rev.\nLett. 109, 160503 (2012)] is able to achieve lower logical error rates and\nhigher thresholds than MWPM, but requires a classical runtime complexity which\nis super-polynomial in L, the linear size of the code. In this work we present\nan MCMC algorithm that achieves significantly lower logical error rates than\nMWPM at the cost of a polynomially increased classical runtime complexity. For\nerror rates p close to the threshold, our algorithm needs a runtime complexity\nwhich is increased by O(L^2) relative to MWPM in order to achieve a lower\nlogical error rate. If p is below an L-dependent critical value, no increase in\nthe runtime complexity is necessary any longer. For p->0, the logical error\nrate achieved by our algorithm is exponentially smaller (in L) than that of\nMWPM, without requiring an increased runtime complexity. Our algorithm allows\nfor trade-offs between runtime and achieved logical error rates as well as for\nparallelization, and can be also used to correct in the case of imperfect\nstabilizer measurements. \n\n"}

In this paper we show that\nphase transitions characterized by universal singularities do occur in the time\nevolution of random spin chains. The sharpness of the transitions and integrity\nof the phases owes to many-body localization, which prevents thermalization in\nthese systems. Using a renormalization group approach, we solve the time\nevolution of random Ising spin chains with generic interactions starting from\ninitial states of arbitrary energy.

Defects often play a central role in ionic and electronic solids, not\nonly to limit reliability, but more importantly to enable the functionalities\nthat make these materials of critical importance. Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A\ncentral hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both\nshort-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density\nfunctional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these\nmaterials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic\nmethod to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals\nwith defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in\nan almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density\nfield as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. In regions far from the\ndefect, where the crystal is close-to-perfect, the polarization field serves as\na proxy that enables us to avoid accounting for the details of the charge\nvariation.

To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms.

This change of\nparadigm allows us to understand topological transitions and the emergence of\npairs of zero modes more broadly, in terms of exceptional point (EP)\nbifurcations of system eigenvalue pairs in the complex plane. Within this\nframework, we show that some zero energy ABSs are actually non-trivial, and\nshare all the properties of conventional MZMs, such as the recently observed\n$2e^2/h$ conductance quantization. From this point of view, any distinction\nbetween such ABS zero modes and conventional MZMs becomes artificial. The key\nfeature that underlies their common non-trivial properties is an asymmetric\ncoupling of Majorana components to the reservoir, which triggers the EP\nbifurcation. \n\n"}

The advantage of the tunneling injection\nprocess stems from the fact that it avoids hot carrier injection, which is a\nkey performance-limiting factor in all semiconductor lasers. The tunneling\ninjection process is not fully understood microscopically and therefore it is\ndifficult to optimize those laser structures. We present here a numerical study\nof the broad band carrier dynamics in a tunneling injection quantum dot gain\nmedium in the form of an optical amplifier operating at 1.55 um. Charge carrier\ntunneling occurs in a hybrid state that joins the quantum dot first excited\nstate and the confined quantum well - injection well states.

However, a careful\ncharacterisation of resilience to local noise goes beyond mere spatial\nseparation, and must also take into account the projection of wave-function\nspin. By considering the susceptibility of a given zero mode to different local\nperturbations, we find the relevant forms of spin-resolved wave-function\noverlaps that measure its resilience. We quantify these overlaps and study\ntheir dependence with nanowire parameters in several classes of experimentally\nrelevant configurations. These include nanowires with inhomogeneous depletion\nand induced pairing, barriers and quantum dots. Smooth inhomogeneities have\nbeen shown to produce near-zero modes, so-called pseudo-Majoranas, below the\ncritical Zeeman field in the bulk.

By\nproper engineering of the reservoirs and their couplings to a system, one may\ndrive the system towards desired quantum-correlated steady states, even in the\nabsence of internal Hamiltonian dynamics. An intriguing category of equilibrium\nmany-particle phases are those which are distinguished by topology rather than\nby symmetry. A natural question thus arises: which of these topological states\ncan be achieved as the result of dissipative Lindblad-type (Markovian)\nevolution? Beside its fundamental importance, it may offer novel routes to the\nrealization of topologically-nontrivial states in quantum simulators,\nespecially ultracold atomic gases.

We prove then sufficient conditions for TQO at both zero and finite\ntemperatures. The topological defects which are associated with the restoration\nof GLSs lead to TQO.

For large density\nimbalance, the interaction in the inter-subband Cooper channel may lead to a\nsuperconducting instability. The total charge-density mode, responsible for the\nconductance of an ideal wire, always remains gapless, which enforces the\ntwo-terminal conductance to be at the universal value of 2e^2/h per occupied\nsubband. On the contrary, the tunneling density of states (DOS) in the bulk of\nthe wire acquires a hard gap, above which the DOS has a non-universal\nsingularity.

Initially, we\ndemonstrate that a triangular optical lattice of two atomic species, bosonic or\nfermionic, can be employed to generate a variety of novel spin-1/2 models that\ninclude effective three-spin interactions. Such interactions can be employed to\nsimulate specific one or two dimensional physical systems that are of\nparticular interest for their condensed matter and entanglement properties. In\nparticular, connections between the scaling behaviour of entanglement and the\nentanglement properties of closely spaced spins are drawn. Moreover, three-spin\ninteractions are well suited to support quantum computing without the need to\nmanipulate individual qubits. By employing Raman transitions or the interaction\nof the atomic electric dipole moment with magnetic field gradients, one can\ngenerate Hamiltonians that can be used for the physical implementation of\ngeometrical or topological objects.

No measurements, or\nclassical operations, are required during the quantum computation. The\nproceeding version was very succinct, and here we fill all the missing details,\nand elaborate on many parts of the proof.
