The simplest model\nrelies on two scalar fields, whose entropy perturbation leads to a\nscale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations. The ekpyrotic solution has a\ntachyonic instability along the entropy field direction which, a priori,\nappears to require fine-tuning of the initial conditions. In this paper, we\nshow that these can be achieved naturally by adding a small positive mass term\nfor the tachyonic field and coupling to light fermions. Then, for a wide range\nof initial conditions, the tachyonic field gets stabilized with the appropriate\nvalues well before the onset of the ekpyrotic phase. Furthermore, we show that\nekpyrotic theory is successful in solving the flatness, horizon and homogeneity\nproblems of standard big bang cosmology. Motivated by the analysis of the\ntachyonic instability, we propose a simplification of the model in terms of new\nfield variables. Instead of requiring two exponential potentials, one for each\nscalar field, it suffices to consider a single nearly exponential potential for\none of the fields and a tachyonic mass term along the orthogonal direction in\nfield space. All other terms in the potential are essentially arbitrary. This\ngreatly widens the class of ekpyrotic potentials and allows substantial freedom\nin determining the spectral index and possible non-Gaussianity.

The most basic \"top-tag\" method based on jet mass\nmeasurement is considered in detail. To analyze the top-tagging method,\ntheoretical and experimental aspects of the QCD jet background are examined.\nBased on QCD factorization, we derive a simple analytic approximation for the\nshape of the QCD jet mass spectrum.

The D-particle foam model involves point-like brane defects\n(D-particles), which provide the topologically non-trivial foamy structures of\nspace-time. The D-particles can capture and emit stringy matter and this leads\nto a recoil of D-particles. It is indicated how one effect of such a recoil of\nD-particles is a back-reaction on the space-time metric of Finsler type which\nis stochastic. We show that such a type of stochastic space-time foam can lead\nto acceptable cosmologies at late epochs of the Universe, due to the\nnon-trivial properties of the supersymmetric (BPS like) D-particle defects,\nwhich are such so as not to affect significantly the Hubble expansion. The\nrestrictions placed on the free parameters of the Finsler type metric are\nobtained from solving the Boltzmann equation in this background for relic\nabundances of a Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) dark matter candidate.\nIt is demonstrated that the D-foam acts as a source for particle production in\nthe Boltzmann equation, thereby leading to enhanced thermal LSP relic\nabundances relative to those in the Standard LambdaCDM Cosmology.

We find that the most severe bound comes\nfrom neutral meson mixing of $B^{0}_{d}-\\bar{B^{0}_{d}}$. Large parameter space\nis excluded if the weak gauge boson mass generation is dominated by the\nfermophobic sector. However, the correlation between the Yukawa coupling and\ncharged scalar mass show that a factor of two enhancement in top Yukawa\ncoupling is still allowed for charged scalar heavier than 500 GeV. We use this\nas a benchmark point to study the phenomenology of the light scalar. It is\ninteresting that the destructive interference between the top quark loop and\nthe $W$-boson loop in the di-photon channel becomes significant and makes the\nchannel negligible. In the light scalar region, the search becomes much more\nchallenging than the conventional SM Higgs boson. \n\n"}

The previously\npublished work is as follows.\n  The optimally natural Higgs-stop sector in the MSSM in light of the 2012\ndiscovery of a Higgs boson is derived, namely that of almost maximal mixing,\nwith the scalar top partners almost as light as can be. The discovery is also\ninterpreted numerically in the NMSSM, with greater emphasis placed on the\nvisibility of the Higgs boson at the observed mass, i.e. on signal strengths. I\ninvestigate the role played by the mediation scale of GMSB: this is found to be\nas a control of the extent to which Yukawa couplings de-tune flavour-blind\nrelations set by gauge couplings. Finally, issues relating to the discovery or\nexclusion of Susy at colliders are discussed.

The data were\ntaken at proton beam energies of 920, 820, 575 and 460 GeV and an electron beam\nenergy of 27.5 GeV.

The correlations of the systematic\nuncertainties were evaluated and taken into account for the combination. The\ncombined cross sections were input to QCD analyses at leading order,\nnext-to-leading order and at next-to-next-to-leading order, providing a new set\nof parton distribution functions, called HERAPDF2.0.

The corresponding objects can\nall be expressed in terms of nested sums and recurrences depending on the\nMellin variable $N$ and the dimensional parameter $\\varepsilon$. Given these\nrepresentations, the desired Laurent series expansions in $\\varepsilon$ can be\nobtained with the help of our computer algebra toolbox. Here we rely on\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions and Mellin-Barnes representations, on\ndifference ring algorithms for symbolic summation, on an optimized version of\nthe multivariate Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm for symbolic integration, and on\nnew methods to calculate Laurent series solutions of coupled systems of\ndifferential equations. The solutions can be computed for general coefficient\nmatrices directly for any basis also performing the expansion in the\ndimensional parameter in case it is expressible in terms of indefinite nested\nproduct-sum expressions. This structural result is based on new results of our\ndifference ring theory. In the cases discussed we deal with iterative sum- and\nintegral-solutions over general alphabets. The final results are expressed in\nterms of special sums, forming quasi-shuffle algebras, such as nested harmonic\nsums, generalized harmonic sums, and nested binomially weighted (cyclotomic)\nsums.

Yet, despite its successes, the SM has shortcomings vis-\\`{a}-vis\ncosmological and other observations. At the same time, while the LHC restarts\nfor Run 2 at 13 TeV, there is presently a lack of direct evidence for new\nphysics phenomena at the accelerator energy frontier. From this state of\naffairs arises the need for a consistent theoretical framework in which\ndeviations from the SM predictions can be calculated and compared to precision\nmeasurements. Such a framework should be able to comprehensively make use of\nall measurements in all sectors of particle physics, including LHC Higgs\nmeasurements, past electroweak precision data, electric dipole moment, $g-2$,\npenguins and flavor physics, neutrino scattering, deep inelastic scattering,\nlow-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ scattering, mass measurements, and any search for\nphysics beyond the SM.

The first of these requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be\nHermitian. Rather, it forces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in\ncomplex conjugate pairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be\nconjugates of each other, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an anti-linear\nsymmetry. The latter two requirements then force this anti-linear symmetry to\nbe $CPT$, while forcing the Hamiltonian to be real rather than Hermitian.

The Weibel instability occurs in the\nplasma if there is an anisotropy in the particle distribution function of the\nparticles.

The creation mechanism makes the vector bosons' energy spectral\ndensity $\\rho_{cdm}/\\Delta E$ very high. Therefore, the dark electric dipole\ntransition rate in atoms is boosted if the energy gap between atomic states\nequals the mass of the vector bosons. By using the Zeeman effect, the energy\ngap between the 2S state and the 2P state in hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like\nions can be tuned. The $2S$ state can be populated with electrons due to its\nrelatively long life, which is about $1/7$s. When the energy gap between the\nsemi-ground $2S$ state and the 2P state matches the mass of the cosmic vector\nbosons, induced transitions occur and the 2P state subsequently decays into the\n1S state.

In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat, in addition to neutrino masses and dark matter, the scotogenic model also\nallows to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via low-scale\nleptogenesis. First, we consider the case of two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs)\nN_{1,2}, for which we provide an analytical argument why it is impossible to\npush the RHN mass scale below M_1^min ~ 10^10 GeV, which is identical to the\nvalue in standard thermal leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw scenario with the\nsame washout strength. Then, we present a detailed study of the three-RHN case\nbased on both an analytical and a numerical analysis. In the case of three\nRHNs, we obtain a lower bound on the N_1 mass of around 10 TeV. Remarkably\nenough, successful low-scale leptogenesis can be achieved without any\ndegeneracy in the RHN mass spectrum. The only necessary condition is a\nsuppression in the N_1 Yukawa couplings, which results in suppressed washout\nand a small active neutrino mass of around 10^-12 eV.

I open by\nexplaining why the bag of tools used regularly in analyzing hermitean random\nmatrices cannot be applied directly to analyze non-hermitean matrices, and then\nintroduce the Method of Hermitization, which solves this problem. Then, for\nrotationally invariant ensembles, I derive a master equation for the average\ndensity of eigenvalues in the complex plane, in the limit of infinitely large\nmatrices. This is achieved by resumming all the planar diagrams which appear in\nthe perturbative expansion of the hermitized Green function. Remarkably, this\nresummation can be carried {\\em explicitly} for any rotationally invariant\nensemble. I prove that in the limit of infinitely large matrices, the shape of\nthe eigenvalue distribution is either a disk or an annulus. This is the\ncelebrated ``Single-Ring'' Theorem. Which of these shapes is realized is\ndetermined by the parameters (coupling constants) which determine the ensemble.\nBy varying these parameters a phase transition may occur between the two\npossible shapes. I briefly discuss the universal features of this transition.\nAs the analysis of this problem relies heavily on summation of planar Feynman\ndiagrams, I take special effort at presenting a pedagogical exposition of the\ndiagrammatic method, which some readers may find useful. \n\n"}

Thus the\ndirect dark matter search, consisting of detecting the recoiling nucleus, is\ncentral to particle physics and cosmology. Modern particle theories naturally\nprovide viable cold dark matter candidates with masses in the GeV-TeV region.\nSupersymmetry provides the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), theories in\nextra dimensions the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) etc. In such theories\nthe expected rates are much lower than the present experimental goals. So one\nshould exploit characteristic signatures of the reaction, such as the\nmodulation effect and, in directional experiments, the correlation of the event\nrates with the sun's motion.\n  In standard non directional experiments the modulation is small, less than\ntwo per cent and the location of the maximum depends on the unknown particle's\nmass.\n  In directional experiments, in addition to the forward-backward asymmetry due\nto the sun's motion, one expects a larger modulation, which depends on the\ndirection of observation. We study such effects both in the case of a light and\na heavy target. Furthermore, since it now appears that the planned experiments\nwill be partly directional, in the sense that they can only detect the line of\nthe recoiling nucleus, but not the sense of direction on it, we study which of\nthe above mentioned interesting features, if any, will persist in these less\nambitious experiments. \n\n"}

The approach provides the means\nto follow the quantum dynamics in both space-time and energy-momentum, starting\nfrom an arbitrary initial configuration of high-momentum quarks and gluons.\nUsing a generalized functional integral representation and adopting the\n`closed-time-path' Green function techniques, a self-consistent set of\nequations of motions is obtained: a Ginzburg-Landau equation for a possible\ncolor background field, and Dyson-Schwinger equations for the 2-point functions\nof the gluon and quark fields. By exploiting the `two-scale nature' of\nlight-cone dominated QCD processes, i.e. the separation between the quantum\nscale that specifies the range of short-distance quantum fluctuations, and the\nkinetic scale that characterizes the range of statistical binary inter-\nactions, the quantum-field equations of motion are converted into a correspon-\nding set of `renormalization equations' and `transport equations'.

A new time scale emerges\nthat separates the linear from the non-linear regimes. This scale is non-\nperturbative in the coupling and initial amplitude. The non-perturbative\nevolution is studied in the large the N limit for the O(N) vector model. A\ncombination of numerical analysis and the multitime scale analysis reveals the\npresence of unstable bands in the nonlinear regime. These are associated with\npower law growth of quantum fluctuations, that result in power law relaxation\nand dissipation with non-universal and non-perturbative dynamical anomalous\nexponents.We find substantial particle production during this non-linear evolu-\ntion which is of the same order as that in the linear regime. The expectation\nvalue of the scalar field vanishes asymptotically transferring all of the\ninitial energy into produced particles via the non-linear resonances in the\nunbroken symmetry phase.The effective mass for the quantum modes tends asympto-\ntically to a constant plus oscillating O(1/t) terms. This slow decay causes the\npower behaviour in the modes which become free for t=infty.

In this relativistic approach, which realises\nconfinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, all physical values of\nmomentum transfer in the transition form factors are simultaneously accessible.\nOur results can be useful in the analysis and correlation of the large body of\ndata being accumulated at extant facilities, and thereby in probing the\nStandard Model and beyond. \n\n"}

With this ansatz we are able to self-consistently\ncalculate the freeze-out of the system and determine space-time hypersurfaces\nfor individual hadron species. The space-time domains of the freeze-out for\nseveral hadron species are found to be actually four-dimensional, and differ\ndrastically for the individual hadrons species. Freeze-out radii distributions\nare similar in width for most hadron species, even though the Omega-baryon is\nfound to be emitted rather close to the phase boundary and shows the smallest\nfreeze-out radii and times among all baryon species. The total lifetime of the\nsystem does not change by more than 10% when going from SPS to RHIC energies. \n\n"}
