We show that the calculation of Renyi entropies via the\nreplica trick for any orbifold theory includes a sum over orbifold twists on\nall cycles. In a modular-invariant theory of fermions, this amounts to a sum\nover spin structures. The result is that the Renyi entropies respect the\nstandard Bose-Fermi duality.

In each dimension d, a certain term in the\nentanglement entropy of a d-ball decreases along renormalization group (RG)\nflows. Given that most quantum many-body systems available in the laboratory\nare not Lorentz invariant, it is important to generalize these results if\npossible. In this work we demonstrate the impossibility of a wide variety of\nsuch generalizations. We do this by exhibiting a series of counterexamples with\nunderstood renormalization group flows which violate entanglement RG\nmonotonicity. We discuss bosons at finite density, fermions at finite density,\nand majorization in Lorentz invariant theories, among other results. \n\n"}

We use lattice\nMonte Carlo methods to determine essential quantities like the energy, which we\ncompute as a function of coupling strength and particle number in the regime\nfrom few to many particles. Many-fermion systems bound by hard walls display\nnon-trivial density profiles characterized by so-called Friedel oscillations\n(which are similar to those observed in harmonic traps). In non-interacting\nsystems, the characteristic length scale of the oscillations is set by (2\nkF)^(-1), where kF is the Fermi momentum, while repulsive interactions tend to\ngenerate Wigner-crystal oscillations of period (4 kF)^(-1). Based on the\nnon-interacting result, we find a remarkably simple parametrization of the\ndensity profiles of the attractively interacting case, which we generalize to\nthe one-body density matrix.

In the last decade the study\nof quantum quenches revealed that these two concepts are intricately\nintertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial\nstate maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the\nquench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble\nwith non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the\nentanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the\npost-quench entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in\nisolated quantum systems. An exact computation of the entanglement dynamics has\nbeen provided only for non-interacting systems, and it was believed to be\nunfeasible for genuinely interacting models. Conversely, here we show that the\nstandard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with\nintegrability-based knowledge of the asymptotic state, leads to a complete\nanalytical understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space-time scaling\nlimit. Our framework requires only knowledge about the steady state, and the\nvelocities of the low-lying excitations around it.

Such complexities form a hierarchy between information\nscrambling and Haar randomness. As a strong separation result, we prove the\nexistence of (state) 2-designs such that the R\\'enyi entanglement entropies of\nhigher orders can be bounded away from the maximum. However, we also show that\nthe min entanglement entropy is maximized by designs of order only logarithmic\nin the dimension of the system. In other words, logarithmic-designs already\nachieve the complexity of Haar in terms of entanglement, which we also call\nmax-scrambling. This result leads to a generalization of the fast scrambling\nconjecture, that max-scrambling can be achieved by physical dynamics in time\nroughly linear in the number of degrees of freedom. \n\n"}

Recently, a hydrodynamical description of\nOTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits, aspects of which are\nconjectured to be universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without\nrandomness. Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved\nquantities (e.g., energy).

We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation.

By comparing our\nresults with the recently developed bimetric formalism, we show that, at the\nlevel of the contracted Hall viscosity tensor, the mapping between tilted field\nand effective mass anisotropy holds only if we simultaneously modify the\nbackground perpendicular magnetic field; in other words, a simultaneous\nmeasurement of the density, contracted Hall viscosity, and Hall conductivity at\nfixed particle number can distinguish between tilted field and effective mass\nanisotropy. Additionally, we show that in the presence of a tilted magnetic\nfield, the stress tensor acquires an unusual anisotropic ground state average,\nleading to anomalous elastic response functions. We develop a formalism for\nprojecting a three-dimensional Hamiltonian with confining potential and\nmagnetic field to a two-dimensional Hamiltonian in order to further address the\nphenomenology of the tilted-field IQH fluid.

Hamiltonian in both protocols is\nfor 2-dimensional free scalar theory with time-dependent mass: the mass in one\ncase decreases monotonically and vanishes asymptotically (ECP), and that in the\nother decreases monotonically before t = 0, but increases monotonically\nafterward, and becomes constant asymptotically (CCP). We study the time\nevolution of the quantum correlations under those protocols in two different\nlimits of the mass quench; fast limit and slow limit depending on the speed\nwith which the mass is changed. We obtain the following two results: (1) For\nthe ECP, we find that the time evolution of logarithmic negativity is, when the\ndistance between the two subsystems is large enough, well-interpreted in terms\nof the propagation of relativistic particles created at a time determined by\nthe limit of the quench we take. On the other hand, the evolution of mutual\ninformation in the ECP depends not only on the relativistic particles but also\non slowly-moving particles. (2) For the CCP, both logarithmic negativity and\nmutual information oscillate in time after the quench. When the subsystems are\nwell-separated, the oscillation of the quantum correlations in the fast limit\nis suppressed, and the time evolution looks similar to that under the ECP in\nthe fast limit. \n\n"}

In\nour approach, we decouple the interaction by means of a suitable\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation (following the Hertz-approach), but do not\neliminate the fermions; instead, we derive an exact hierarchy of RG flow\nequations for the irreducible vertices of the resulting coupled field theory\ninvolving both fermionic and bosonic fields.

This is possible due to different initial temperatures\nof the spin and the bath, both positive (no spin population inversion) and is\nrealized by means of a suitable sequence of sharp pulses applied to the spin.\nThe extracted work can be of the order of the response energy of the bath,\ntherefore much larger than the energy of the spin. Moreover, the efficiency of\nextraction can be very close to its maximum, given by the Carnot bound, at the\nsame time the overall amount of the extracted work is maximal. Therefore, we\nget a finite power at efficiency close to the Carnot bound.\n  The effect comes from the backreaction of the spin on the bath, and it\nsurvives for a strongly disordered (inhomogeneously broadened) ensemble of\nspins. It is connected with generation of coherences during the work-extraction\nprocess, and we derived it in an exactly solvable model. All the necessary\ngeneral thermodynamical relations are derived from the first principles of\nquantum mechanics and connections are made with processes of lasing without\ninversion and with quantum heat engines. \n\n"}

The integration over k\nproviding the real-space wave function for a quantum walker corresponds to\nconsidering an orbital state of a Weyl particle, which is defined as a\nsuperposition (curvilinear integration) of the energy-momentum eigenstates of a\nfree Weyl equation along the orbit. Konno's novel distribution function of\nquantum-walker's pseudo-velocities in the long-time limit is fully controlled\nby the shape of the orbit and how the orbit is embedded in the\nthree-dimensional momentum space. The family of orbital states can be regarded\nas a geometrical representation of the unitary group U(2) and the present study\nwill propose a new group-theoretical point of view for quantum-walk problems. \n\n"}

We describe practical schemes to engineer\nseveral classes of pure and mixed three-mode states that stand out for their\ninformational and/or entanglement properties. In particular, we introduce a\nsimple procedure -- based on passive optical elements -- to produce pure\nthree-mode Gaussian states with {\\em arbitrary} entanglement structure (upon\navailability of an initial two-mode squeezed state). We analyze in depth the\nproperties of distributed entanglement and the origin of its sharing structure,\nshowing that the promiscuity of entanglement sharing is a feature peculiar to\nsymmetric Gaussian states that survives even in the presence of significant\ndegrees of mixedness and decoherence. Next, we discuss the suitability of the\nconsidered tripartite entangled states to the implementation of quantum\ninformation and communication protocols with continuous variables. This will\nlead to a feasible experimental proposal to test the promiscuous sharing of\ncontinuous-variable tripartite entanglement, in terms of the optimal fidelity\nof teleportation networks with Gaussian resources. We finally focus on the\napplication of three-mode states to symmetric and asymmetric telecloning, and\nsingle out the structural properties of the optimal Gaussian resources for the\nlatter protocol in different settings. Our analysis aims to lay the basis for a\npractical quantum communication with continuous variables beyond the bipartite\nscenario. \n\n"}
