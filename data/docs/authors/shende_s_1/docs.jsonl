We address this discrepancy by reexamining the superburst trigger\nmechanism. We first explore the hypothesis of Kuulkers et al. that exothermic\nelectron captures trigger superbursts. We find that all electron capture\nreactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are\nnot a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are\ninfeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much\nshallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm\nthe proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12C + 12C\ntriggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction\ncross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies,\nbut resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured\nenergy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a\nresonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical\n1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the\nresonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the\ntheoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in\nthis case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord\nwith model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters.

The\nheavy baryon approach, which relies on a non-relativistic expansion around the\nlimit of infinitely heavy baryon, recovers the usual power counting but\ndestroys some analytic properties of the scattering amplitude. Some years ago,\nBecher and Leutwyler proposed a Lorentz-invariant formulation of chiral\nperturbation theory that maintains the required analytic properties, but at the\nexpense of a less intuitive power counting.\n  Aware of the shortcomings of the heavy baryon formalism, the S\\~ao Paulo\ngroup derived the two-pion exchange component of the nucleon-nucleon potential\nin line with the works of Becher and Leutwyler.

In this talk I will discuss the origin of such failure and how\nit reflects in the asymptotics of the nucleon-nucleon interaction.

We study the formation\nof $Z(3)$ walls and associated strings in the initial transition from the\nconfining (hadronic) phase to the deconfining (QGP) phase via the so called\nKibble mechanism. Essential physics of the Kibble mechanism is contained in a\nsort of domain structure arising after any phase transition which represents\nrandom variation of the order parameter at distances beyond the typical\ncorrelation length. We implement this domain structure by using the Polyakov\nloop effective model with a first order phase transition and confine ourselves\nwith temperature/time ranges so that the first order C-D transition proceeds\nvia bubble nucleation, leading to a well defined domain structure. The\nformation of $Z(3)$ walls and associated strings results from the coalescence\nof QGP bubbles expanding in the confining background.

Of the many possibilities, three experiments are\ndescribed here that are clearly feasible and of high scientific importance.\nFirst, a direct measurement of the saturation scale is possible using the\nbroadening of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons produced in\nsemi-inclusive DIS. This connection to saturation physics will provide a\nquantitative measure of the degree to which this fundamental QCD phenomenon is\noccurring, and has important consequences in other high-energy scattering\nstudies. Second, the measurement of quark energy loss is feasible, either as a\ndirect measurement at a lower-energy EIC, or as an indirect measurement using\nhadron attenuation at higher energies. Such a measurement will offer the first\nexperimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a\nconsequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED. The third experiment is\nto determine the mechanisms of hadronization using the nucleus as a spatial\nanalyzer, intercomparing hadron attenuation for nuclei of a range of sizes.

Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first\nphase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant\nnuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the\nneutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process. At the end of this\nphase, the abundances follow a steady beta flow for the hot r-process and a\nsteady flow of neutron captures and beta decays for the cold r-process. After\nneutrons are almost exhausted, matter decays to stability and our results show\nthat in both cases neutron captures are key for determining the final\nabundances, the position of the r-process peaks, and the formation of the\nrare-earth peak.

Today, the properties\nof these myriad particles are understood to be the result of quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) with some modification by the electroweak interactions.\nDespite the discovery of this fundamental theory, the description of the\nhadronic spectrum has long been dominated by phenomenological models, due to\nthe difficulties of addressing QCD in the strong-coupling regime, where\nnonperturbative effects are essential. By making numerical calculations in\ndiscretized spacetime, lattice gauge theory enables the ab initio study of many\nlow-energy properties of QCD. Significant efforts are underway internationally\nto use lattice QCD to directly compute properties of ground and excited-state\nbaryons.

At the collision energies available at\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there is copious production of hard processes,\nsuch that high p_T jets may be differentiated from the heavy-ion underlying\nevent. The multipurpose Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is well designed\nto measure hard scattering processes with its high quality calorimeters and\nhigh precision silicon tracker. Jet quenching has been studied in CMS in PbPb\ncollisions at sqrt(s_NN)= 2.76 TeV. As a function of centrality, dijet events\nwith a high p_T leading jet were found to have an increasing momentum imbalance\nthat was significantly larger than predicted by simulations. The angular\ndistribution of jet fragmentation products has been explored by associating\ncharged tracks with the jets measured in the calorimeters. By projecting the\nmomenta of charged tracks onto the leading jet axis it is shown that the\napparent momentum imbalance of the leading dijet pair can be recovered if low\np_T tracks are considered.

The diffusion process is\nsimulated using relativistic Fokker-Planck dynamics for elastic scattering in a\nhydrodynamic background. The heavy-quark transport coefficients in the medium\nare obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix interactions which build up\nresonant correlations close to the transition temperature. The latter also form\nthe basis for hadronization of heavy quarks into heavy-flavor mesons via\nrecombination with light quarks from the medium. The pertinent resonance\nrecombination satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping\nbetween quark and meson distributions. The recombination probability is derived\nfrom the resonant heavy-quark scattering rate. Consequently, recombination\ndominates at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and yields to fragmentation at\nhigh $p_T$. Our approach thus emphasizes the role of resonance correlations in\nthe diffusion and hadronization processes.

A number of\nterrestrial neutrino detectors are based on inelastic neutrino-nucleus\nscattering and modeling of the respective cross sections allow predictions of\nthe expected detector reaction rates.\n  Purpose: To provide a self-consistent microscopic description of\nneutrino-nucleus cross sections involving a large pool of Z = 8 - 82 nuclei for\nthe implementation in models of nucleosynthesis and neutrino detector\nsimulations.\n  Methods: Self-consistent theory framework based on relativistic nuclear\nenergy density functional is employed to determine the nuclear structure of the\ninitial state and relevant transitions to excited states induced by neutrinos.\nThe weak neutrino-nucleus interaction is employed in the current-current form\nand a complete set of transition operators is taken into account.\n  Results: We perform large-scale calculations of charged-current\nneutrino-nucleus cross sections, including those averaged over supernova\nneutrino fluxes, for the set of even-even target nuclei from oxygen toward lead\n(Z = 8 - 82), spanning N = 8 - 182 (OPb pool).

For the first\nproblem where experimental data have already been observed, the classical\nstatistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the\nparameter {\\Delta}m^2_{32}. These intervals are deduced from the parent\ndistribution of the estimation of {\\Delta}m^2_{32} based on experimental data.\nDue to existing experimental constraints on |{\\Delta}m^2_{32}|, the estimation\nof {\\Delta}m^2_{32} is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution (a\nBinomial distribution with 1 trial) rather than a Gaussian distribution.\nTherefore, the Feldman-Cousins approach needs to be used instead of the\nGaussian approximation in constructing confidence intervals. Furthermore, as a\nresult of the definition of confidence intervals, even if it is correctly\nconstructed, its confidence level does not directly reflect how much one\nhypothesis of the MH is supported by the data rather than the other hypothesis.\nWe thus describe a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence provided by\nthe observed experimental data through the (posterior) probability that either\none hypothesis of MH is true. This Bayesian presentation of observed\nexperimental results is then used to develop several metrics to assess the\nsensitivity of future experiments.

Jets are produced in an early stage of the\ncollision from hard-scattered partons, which fragment into a spray of charged\nand neutral particles. The measurement of jet spectra in p-Pb collisions\nprovides an important way to quantify the effects of cold nuclear matter on jet\nproduction, fragmentation and hadronization. This is possible because the hot,\ndense medium produced in Pb-Pb collisions is not expected to form. Proton-Lead\ncollisions also provide an important constraint for the nuclear parton density\nfunctions. The exact evaluation of the background from the underlying event is\nan important ingredient to correct the measured jet spectra. The system size in\np-Pb collisions is much smaller than in Pb-Pb so that the methods for\nbackground estimation need to be refined. The analysis reported here is\nperformed on p-Pb data taken at sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV by the ALICE detector at\nthe LHC in the beginning of 2013. The focus of our analysis lies on the minimum\nbias charged jet spectra and their comparison to the spectra from pp\ncollisions.

All of these effects\nare expected to have a significant dependence on the size of the nuclear target\nand the impact parameter of the collision, also known as the collision\ncentrality. In this article, we detail a method for determining centrality\nclasses in p(d)+A collisions via cuts on the multiplicity at backward rapidity\n(i.e., the nucleus-going direction) and for determining systematic\nuncertainties in this procedure. For d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV we\nfind that the connection to geometry is confirmed by measuring the fraction of\nevents in which a neutron from the deuteron does not interact with the nucleus.\nAs an application, we consider the nuclear modification factors R_{p(d)+A}, for\nwhich there is a potential bias in the measured centrality dependent yields due\nto auto-correlations between the process of interest and the backward rapidity\nmultiplicity. We determine the bias correction factor within this framework.\nThis method is further tested using the HIJING Monte Carlo generator. We find\nthat for d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV, these bias corrections are\nsmall and vary by less than 5% (10%) up to p_T = 10 (20) GeV. In contrast, for\np+Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV we find these bias factors are an\norder of magnitude larger and strongly p_T dependent, likely due to the larger\neffect of multi-parton interactions. \n\n"}

Because this\njet-induced extra anisotropic flow is not related to the fluctuations of the\ninitial geometry of the collision, the correlation between the $v_2$ and $v_3$\ncoefficients and their corresponding eccentricities is considerably weakened.\nIn addition, we argue that the extra amount of direct flow induced by dijets\nmay be quantified by comparing the azimuthal dependence of dihadron\ncorrelations in dijet events with the corresponding quantity obtained in events\nwithout dijets. This comparison could be used to give a rough estimate of the\nmagnitude of the effective coupling between the jets and the medium. \n\n"}

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy.

In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1).

The behavior of the Polyakov\nloop close to the critical temperature is studied in terms of the color fields\ninside the clusters of overlapping strings, which are produced in high energy\nhadronic collisions. The non-Abelian nature of the color fields implies an\nenhancement of the transverse momentum and a suppression of the multiplicities\nrelative to the non overlapping case. The prediction of this framework are\ncompared with experimental results from the SPS, RHIC and LHC for $pp$ and AA\ncollisions.\n  Rapidity distributions, probability distributions of transverse momentum and\nmultiplicities, Bose-Einstein correlations, elliptic flow and ridge structures\nare used to evaluate these comparison. The thermodynamical quantities, the\ntemperature, and energy density derived from RHIC and LHC data and Color String\nPercolation Model (CSPM) are used to obtain the shear viscosity to entropy\ndensity ratio ($\\eta/s$).

For a given centrality class, the initial fluctuation spectrum\nis sensitive to the method chosen for binning the events into centrality\nclasses. We show that sorting events by total initial entropy or by total final\nmultiplicity yields event classes with equivalent statistical fluctuation\nproperties, in spite of viscous entropy production during the fireball\nevolution. With this initial entropy-based centrality definition we generate\nseveral classes of ultra-central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies and evolve\nthe events using viscous hydrodynamics with non-zero shear but vanishing bulk\nviscosity. Comparing the predicted anisotropic flow coefficients for charged\nhadrons with CMS data we find that both the Monte Carlo Glauber (MC-Glb) and\nMonte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models produce initial fluctuation\nspectra that are incompatible with the measured final anisotropic flow power\nspectrum, for any choice of the specific shear viscosity. In spite of this\nfailure, we show that the hydrodynamic model can qualitatively explain, in\nterms of event-by-event fluctuations of the anisotropic flow coefficients and\nflow angles, the breaking of flow factorization for elliptic, triangular and\nquadrangular flow measured by the CMS experiment. For elliptic flow, this\nfactorization breaking is large in ultra-central collisions.

With upgraded detectors at RHIC and LHC,\nit has become possible to measure hadrons beyond their ground states.\nTherefore, HIC provide a new method for studying exotic hadrons that are either\nhadronic molecular states or compact multiquark systems. Because their\nstructures are related to the fundamental properties of QCD, studying exotic\nhadrons is currently one of the most active areas of research in hadron\nphysics. Experiments carried out at various accelerator facilities have\nindicated that some exotic hadrons may have already been produced. The present\nreview is a summary of the current understanding of a selected set of exotic\nparticle candidates that can be potentially measured in HIC. It also includes\ndiscussions on the production of exotic hadrons in HIC based on the coalescence\nand statistical models. A more detailed discussion leads to the conclusion that\nthe yield of a hadron is typically an order of magnitude smaller when it is a\ncompact multiquark state than that of an excited hadronic state with normal\nquark numbers and/or a molecular configuration. Attention is also given to some\nof the proposed heavy exotic hadrons that could be produced with sufficient\nabundance in HIC because of the significant numbers of charm and bottom quarks\nproduced at RHIC and LHC, making it possible to study them in these\nexperiments. Further included in the discussion are the general formalism for\nthe coalescence model that involves resonance particles and its implication on\nthe present estimated yield for resonance production. Finally, a review is\ngiven on recent studies to constrain the hadron-hadron interaction through\ncorrelation measurements in HIC and their implications on the interpretation\nand the possible existence of exotic states in hadronic interactions. \n\n"}

To explore the currently-unknown territories in the nuclear\nchart far away from the stability, reliable theoretical predictions are\ninevitable.\n  Purpose: To provide a reliable prediction of production cross sections taking\ninto account secondary deexcitation processes, both particle evaporation and\nfission, a new method called TDHF+GEMINI is proposed, which combines the\nmicroscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory with a sophisticated\nstatistical compound-nucleus deexcitation model, GEMINI++.\n  Results: The method is applied for multinucleon transfer processes in\nlow-energy heavy ion reactions. It is shown that the inclusion of secondary\ndeexcitation processes, which are dominated by neutron evaporation in the\npresent systems, substantially improves agreement with the experimental data.\nThe magnitude of the evaporation effects is very similar to the one observed in\nGRAZING calculations.

Furthermore, proton density fluctuations are investigated as a possible\norder parameter of the second order phase transition in the neighbourhood of\nthe critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter.

A previous analysis of this sort revealed\nsignificant power-law fluctuations for the \"Si\"+Si system at 158A GeV measured\nby the NA49 experiment.

But as\nexperimental data never reach that limit, numerous methods for making the\nextraction have been proposed, though often the functions are determined after\nseeing the data which can lead to confirmation bias. To find functional forms\nthat will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety\nof functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming\nlow $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we\ncreate a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as\nvarious fitting functions. The input form factors are used to generate\npseudo-data with fluctuations intended to mimic the binning and random\nuncertainty of a given set of real data. All combinations of input functions\nand fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated\npseudo-data. Since the input radius is known, this allows us to find fit\nfunctions that are robust for radius extractions in an objective fashion. For\nthe range and uncertainty of the PRad data, we find that a two-parameter\nrational function, a two-parameter continued fraction and the second order\npolynomial expansion of $z$ can extract the input radius regardless of the\ninput charge form factor function that is used.

The set of jet shapes includes the first radial moment or angularity, $g$;\nthe momentum dispersion, $p_{\\rm T}D$; and the difference between the leading\nand sub-leading constituent track transverse momentum, $LeSub$. These\nobservables provide complementary information on the jet fragmentation and can\nconstrain different aspects of the theoretical description of jet-medium\ninteractions. The jet shapes were measured for a small resolution parameter $R\n= 0.2$ and were fully corrected to particle level. The observed jet shape\nmodifications indicate that in-medium fragmentation is harder and more\ncollimated than vacuum fragmentation as obtained by PYTHIA calculations, which\nwere validated with the measurements of the jet shapes in proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.

Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the parity doublet structure seen in the\nspectrum of highly excited baryons may be due to effective chiral symmetry\nrestoration for these states. We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that\nidentifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high\nexcitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into\nmultiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group. We\ndemonstrate that this is indeed the case for meson spectra in the large $N_c$\nlimit. All possible parity-chiral multiplets are classified for baryons and it\nis demonstrated that the existing data on highly excited $N$ and $\\Delta$\nstates at masses of 2 GeV and higher is consistent with approximate chiral\nsymmetry restoration.

We first present a model-independent analysis in which we\ndiagonalise each of these two mass matrix structures to leading order in\n$\\theta_{13}$ and extract the neutrino masses, mixing angles and phases. In\nthis analysis we express the MNS matrix to leading order in the small angle\n$\\theta_{13}$ including the neutrino {\\em and} charged lepton mixing angles and\nphases, the latter playing a crucial r\\^{o}le for allowing the inverted\nhierarchy case to be consistent with the LMA MSW solution.

We have examined the transverse momentum\nspectra of J/Psi, characterized by <p_T^2>, which result from the formation\nprocess in which the charm quark distributions are unchanged from their initial\nproduction in a pQCD process. This is contrasted with the case in which the\ncharm quarks have completely come into thermal equilibrium with an expanding\nmedium whose properties are determined by the spectra of produced light\nhadrons. We find that the resulting <p_T^2> of the formed J/Psi provide a\ndistinct signature of the underlying charm quark spectra, and that signature is\nessentially independent of the detailed dynamics of the in-medium formation\nreaction. In addition, both of these signatures are sufficiently separated from\nthe case in which no in-medium formation takes place.

Isotopically resolved yield distributions of projectile fragments in\nthe range Z=10-36 from these reaction pairs were measured with the MARS recoil\nseparator in the angular range 2.7-5.3 degrees. The velocities of the residues,\nmonotonically decreasing with Z down to Z~26-28, are employed to characterize\nthe excitation energy. The yield ratios R21(N,Z) for each pair of systems are\nfound to exhibit isotopic scaling (isoscaling), namely, an exponential\ndependence on the fragment atomic number Z and neutron number N. The isoscaling\nis found to occur in the residue Z range corresponding to the maximum observed\nexcitation energies. The corresponding isoscaling parameters are alpha=0.43 and\nbeta=-0.50 for the Kr+Sn system and alpha=0.27 and beta=-0.34 for the Kr+Ni\nsystem. For the Kr+Sn system, for which the experimental angular acceptance\nrange lies inside the grazing angle, isoscaling was found to occur for Z<26 and\nN<34. For heavier fragments from Kr+Sn, the parameters vary monotonically,\nalpha decreasing with Z and beta increasing with N.

The TRIUMF group analyzed the RMC rate in\nterms of the theoretical formula of Beder and Fearing, and found the surprising\nresult that the pseudoscalar coupling g_P is 1.5 times the value expected from\nPCAC. To assess the reliability of the theoretical framework used by the TRIUMF\ngroup to relate the RMC rate to the pseudoscalar form factor, we calculate the\nRMC rate in chiral perturbation theory, which provides a systematic framework\nto describe all the vertices involved in RMC, fulfilling gauge-invariance and\nchiral-symmetry requirements in a transparent manner. As a first step we\npresent a chiral perturbation calculation at tree level which includes\nsub-leading order terms. \n\n"}

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}

{"id": "nucl-th/9908013", "contents": "Title: Looking For Disoriented Chiral Condensates From Pion Distributions Abstract: We suggest two methods for the detection of the formation of disoriented\nchiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the\nnumber of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a\nsignature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}. The effects of multi-domain D$\\chi$C\nformation and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically\nincorporated. Potential applications to experiments and their limitations are\nbriefly discussed. \n\n"}
