After addressing how\nthe Bianchi identities are to be satisfied in such a set up, we turn our\nattention towards the cosmological consequences of degravitation. By\nconsidering the example filter function corresponding to a resonantly massive\ngraviton (with a filter scale larger than the present horizon scale), we show\nthat slow roll inflation, hybrid inflation and old inflation remain\nquantitatively unchanged.

The presence of a dark force implies a non-vanishing effect in Eotvos\ntests that could be probed by current and future experiments depending on the\nDM model. For scalar singlet DM scenarios, a dark force of astrophysically\nrelevant magnitude is ruled out in large regions of parameter space by the DM\nrelic density and WEP constraints.

The contributions of the\nscalar and vector fields of the standard K-K theory to the Ricci tensor and the\naffine connections are completely nullified by the contributions from torsion.\nAs a consequence, geodesic motions do not distinguish the torsion free 4D\nspace-time from a hypersurface of 5D space-time with torsion satisfying the\nconstraints. Since torsion is not an independent dynamical variable in this\nformalism, the modified Einstein equations are different from those in the\ngeneral Einstein-Cartan theory.

Performing such a transport along the null\ngeodesic of photons arriving from the galaxy, they found that the cosmological\nredshift is purely kinematic. Here we argue that one should rather transport\nthe velocity four-vector along the geodesic connecting the points of\nintersection of the world-lines of the galaxy and the observer with the\nhypersurface of constant cosmic time. We find that the resulting relation\nbetween the transported velocity and the redshift of arriving photons is not\ngiven by a relativistic Doppler formula. Instead, for small redshifts it\ncoincides with the well known non-relativistic decomposition of the redshift\ninto a Doppler (kinematic) component and a gravitational one. We perform such a\ndecomposition for arbitrary large redshifts and derive a formula for the\nkinematic component of the cosmological redshift, valid for any FLRW cosmology.\nIn particular, in a universe with Omega_m = 0.24 and Omega_Lambda = 0.76, a\nquasar at a redshift 6, at the time of emission of photons reaching us today\nhad the recession velocity v = 0.997c.

The main idea hinges on the fact that\nwe can form tensors from the difference, C^a_bc, of the Levi-Civita connections\nof the two metrics, and these act like gravitational accelerations. In the\ncontext of MOND we can form dimensionless `acceleration' scalars, and functions\nthereof, from contractions of C^a_bc/a0.

The theory\nnaturally gives MOND and \"dark energy\" effects from the same term in the\naction, both controlled by the MOND constant a0. As regards gravitational\nlensing by nonrelativistic systems--a holy grail for relativistic MOND\ntheories--the theory predicts that the same potential that controls\nmassive-particle motion also dictates lensing in the same way as in GR.

This widely used approximation assumes that the mass\nfunction can be expressed as a function of the matter density omega_m and the\nrms linear density fluctuation sigma only, with no explicit dependence on the\nproperties of dark energy or redshift. In order to test this hypothesis we run\na series of 15 high-resolution N-body simulations for different cosmological\nmodels. These consists of three LCDM cosmologies best fitting WMAP-1, 3 and 5\nyears data, and three toy-models characterized by a Ratra-Peebles quintessence\npotential with different slopes and amounts of dark energy density. These toy\nmodels have very different evolutionary histories at the background and linear\nlevel, but share the same sigma8 value. For each of these models we measure the\nmass function from catalogues of halos identified in the simulations using the\nFriend-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm. We find redshift dependent deviations from a\nuniversal behaviour, well above numerical uncertainties and of non-stochastic\norigin, which are correlated with the linear growth factor of the investigated\ncosmologies.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat.

This\nassumption is challenged by the growing evidence from optical and X-ray\nobservations that the total baryon mass fraction increases towards rich\nclusters.

To do so, we used a subsample of\nnineteen clusters extracted from the X-ray flux limited sample HIFLUGCS that\nhave available DR-7 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. From the optical\nanalysis we derived the stellar masses. Using XMM-Newton we derived the gas\nmasses. Then, adopting a scaling relation we estimate the total masses. Adding\nthe gas and the stellar mass fractions we obtain the total baryonic content\nthat we find to increase with cluster mass, reaching 7-year Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP-7) prediction for clusters with M_500 = 1.6 x 10^{15}\nM_sun.

Abstract: Recently an inflationary model with a vector field coupled to the inflaton\nwas proposed and the phenomenology studied for the Bianchi type I spacetime. It\nwas found that the model demonstrates a counter-example to the cosmic no-hair\ntheorem since there exists a stable anisotropically inflationary fix-point. One\nof the great triumphs of inflation, however, is that it explains the observed\nflatness and isotropy of the universe today without requiring special initial\nconditions. Any acceptable model for inflation should thus explain these\nobservations in a satisfactory way. To check whether the model meets this\nrequirement, we introduce curvature to the background geometry and consider\naxisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II,III and the Kantowski-Sachs metric.\nWe show that the anisotropic Bianchi type I fix-point is an attractor for the\nentire family of such spacetimes. The model is predictive in the sense that the\nuniverse gets close to this fix-point after a few e-folds for a wide range of\ninitial conditions. If inflation lasts for N e-folds, the curvature at the end\nof inflation is typically of order exp(-2N). The anisotropy in the expansion\nrate at the end of inflation, on the other hand, while being small on the\none-percent level, is highly significant. We show that after the end of\ninflation there will be a period of isotropization lasting for about 2N/3\ne-folds. After that the shear scales as the curvature and becomes dominant\naround N e-folds after the end of inflation. For plausible bounds on the reheat\ntemperature the minimum number of e-folds during inflation, required for\nconsistency with the isotropy of the supernova Ia data, lays in the interval\n(21,48).

Weak gravitational lensing is a\npromising tool for, on average, unbiased mass estimates.

The three nearby distance indicators -- cepheids, tip\nof the red giant branch (TRGB) stars, and water masers -- operate in\ngravitational fields of widely different strengths. This enables tests of\nscalar-tensor gravity theories because they are screened from enhanced forces\nto different extents. Inferred distances from cepheids and TRGB stars are\naltered (in opposite directions) over a range of chameleon gravity theory\nparameters well below the sensitivity of cosmological probes. Using published\ndata we have compared cepheid and TRGB distances in a sample of unscreened\ndwarf galaxies within 10 Mpc. As a control sample we use a comparable set of\nscreened galaxies.

The scalar field\npotential is the recently found to be compatible with the hairy generalization\nof the Plebanski-Demianski solution of general relativity. This paper describes\nthe spherically symmetric solutions that smoothly connect the Schwarzschild\nblack hole with its hairy counterpart. The geometry and scalar field are\neverywhere regular except at the usual Schwarzschild like singularity inside\nthe black hole. The scalar field energy momentum tensor satisfies the null\nenergy condition in the static region of the spacetime. The first law holds\nwhen the parameters of the scalar field potential are fixed under\nthermodynamical variation. Secondly, it is shown that an extra, dimensionless\nparameter, present in the hairy solution, allows to modify the gravitational\nfield of a spherically symmetric black hole in a remarkable way.

In the most extreme cones, f_gas can be\nbiased high by a factor of two at R_200 in massive clusters, thereby providing\na potential explanation for high f_gas measurements by Suzaku. While projection\nlowers this factor, there are other measurement biases that may (partially)\ncompensate. We find that at R_200, f_gas is biased high by 20% when assuming\nhydrostatic equilibrium masses, i.e., neglecting the kinetic pressure, and by\nanother ~10-20% due to the presence of density clumping. At larger radii, both\nmeasurement biases increase dramatically. While the cluster sample variance of\nthe true f_gas decreases to a level of 5% at R_200, the sample variance that\nincludes both measurement biases remains fairly constant at the level of\n10-20%. The constant redshift evolution of f_gas within R_500 for massive\nclusters is encouraging for using gas masses to derive cosmological parameters. \n\n"}

One approach works directly with the time domain data, and\nthe other works with a specially constructed Fourier transform of the data. The\nraw data was run through TEMPO2 to produce reduced timing residuals for the\nanalysis. Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques were used to produce\nsamples from the posterior distribution function for the model parameters. The\nmodel parameters include the gravitational wave amplitude and spectral slope,\nand the white noise amplitude for each pulsar in the array. While red timing\nnoise was only included in Dataset 3, I found that it was necessary to include\neffective red noise in all the analyses to account for some of the spurious\neffects introduced by the TEMPO2 timing fit. This added an additional amplitude\nand slope parameter for each pulsar, so my overall model for the 36 pulsars\nresiduals has 110 parameters. As an alternative to using an effective red noise\nmodel, I also tried to simultaneously re-fit the timing model model while\nlooking for the gravitational wave signal, but for reasons that are not yet\nclear, this approach was not very successful.

The existence of superluminal relative velocities of receding test\nparticles, in a particular cosmological model, suggests itself as a possible\ncriterion for expansion of space in that model. In this point of view,\nsuperluminal velocities of distant receding galaxy clusters result from the\nexpansion of space between the observer and the clusters. However, there is a\nfundamental ambiguity that must be resolved before this approach can be\nmeaningful.

Squeezing of primordial quantum\nfluctuations along with the mechanism of decoherence accounts for many aspects\nof this quantum to classical transition, although it remains a matter of debate\nas to whether this is sufficient to explain the issue of realization of a\nsingle outcome (i.e. the issue of macro-objectification) from a quantum\nensemble given that the universe is a closed system. A similar question of\nemergence of classical behavior of macroscopic objects exists also for\nlaboratory systems and apart from decoherence there have been attempts to\nresolve this issue through Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL), which is\na stochastic nonlinear modification of the non-relativistic Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation.

The collision of our bubble with\nanother could provide an important observational signature to test this\nscenario. We develop and implement an algorithm for accurately computing the\ncosmological observables arising from bubble collisions directly from the\nLagrangian of a single scalar field.

The evolution of the scale factor\nof the extra dimension (whose dynamics is influenced by the Gauss-Bonnet term)\nacts as the cause for the breaking of conformal invariance. Different cases\nhave been investigated, each of which is characterized by the number of higher\ndimensions, the value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter, and the cosmological\nconstant.

In particular, a scenario where the number of\nextra dimensions $D=4$ and the cosmological constant is non-zero, turns out to\nbe best suited for generating primordial magnetic fields.

In the search for short\nduration signals, such as coalescing compact binary inspirals or \"burst\"\nevents, noise transients can be problematic.

In order to\nperform a sensitive search for short-duration gravitational-wave signals it is\nimportant to identify these noise artifacts, and to \"veto\" them.

Abstract: The large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe is generally thought\nto imply a well defined background cosmological model. It may not. Smoothing\nover structure adds in an extra contribution, transferring power from small\nscales up to large. Second-order perturbation theory implies that the effect is\nsmall, but suggests that formally the perturbation series may not converge. The\namplitude of the effect is actually determined by the ratio of the Hubble\nscales at matter-radiation equality and today - which are entirely unrelated.\nThis implies that a universe with significantly lower temperature today could\nhave significant backreaction from more power on small scales, and so provides\nthe ideal testing ground for understanding backreaction. We investigate this\nusing two different N-body numerical simulations - a 3D Newtonian and a 1D\nsimulation which includes all relevant relativistic effects. We show that while\nperturbation theory predicts an increasing backreaction as more initial\nsmall-scale power is added, in fact the virialisation of structure saturates\nthe backreaction effect at the same level independently of the equality scale.\nThis implies that backreaction is a small effect independently of initial\nconditions.

This\nreminds us of the so-called fundamental \"constants\" of nature.

Strictly speaking they cannot in general be\ndescribed by an effective lagrangian; rather the appropriate `low-energy' limit\nis instead a Lindblad equation describing the evolution of the density matrix\nof the slow degrees of freedom. We derive the equation relevant to super-Hubble\nmodes of quantum fields in near-de Sitter spacetimes and derive two\nimplications.

In models where the linear matter power\nspectrum is suppressed by the scattering, we find that on nonlinear scales the\npower spectrum is strongly enhanced. This is due to the friction term\nincreasing the efficiency of gravitational collapse, which also leads to a\nscale-independent amplification of the concentration and mass functions of\nhalos. The opposite trend is found for models characterised by an increase of\nthe linear matter power spectrum normalisation.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse.

It is possible to show that the deceleration parameter\nchanges sign at a given redshift according to observational data. Furthermore,\na $f(R)$ gravity cosmological model can be constructed in brane-antibrane\nsystem starting from the very early universe and accounting for the\ncosmological redshift at all phases of cosmic history, from inflation to late\ntime acceleration. Here we propose a $f(R)$ model where transition redshifts\ncorrespond to inflation-deceleration and deceleration-late time acceleration\ntransitions starting froma BIon system. At the point where the universe was\nborn, due to the transition of $k$ black fundamental strings to the BIon\nconfiguration, the redshift is approximately infinity and decreases with\nreducing temperature ($z\\sim T^{2}$). The BIon is a configuration in flat space\nof a universe-brane and a parallel anti-universe-brane connected by a wormhole.\nThis wormhole is a channel for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our\nuniverse, occurring at inflation and decreasing with redshift as $z\\sim\nT^{4+1/7}$. Dynamics consists with the fact that the wormhole misses its energy\nand vanishes as soon as inflation ends and deceleration begins. Approaching two\nuniverse branes together, a tachyon is originated, it grows up and causes the\nformation of a wormhole. We show that, in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, the\ncosmological redshift depends on the tachyonic potential and has a significant\ndecrease at deceleration-late time acceleration transition point ($z\\sim\nT^{2/3}$). As soon as today acceleration approaches, the redshift tends to zero\nand the cosmological model reduces to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. \n\n"}

The other is due to uneven\nmagnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\\text{Differential}$\n$\\text{Magnification}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{DME}$). The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small. Using a\nsimple model, we derive these effects from first principles.\n  One application would be to the Bullet Cluster, whose large tangential\nvelocity may be inconsistent with the $\\Lambda CDM$ paradigm.

In this way, cosmography can be regarded a\nmodel-independent technique, able to fix cosmic bounds, although several issues\nlimit its use in various model reconstructions. The main purpose of this review\nis to focus on the key features of cosmography, emphasising both the strategy\nfor obtaining the observable cosmographic series and pointing out any drawbacks\nwhich might plague the standard cosmographic treatment. In doing so, we relate\ncosmography to the most relevant cosmological quantities and to several dark\nenergy models. We also investigate whether cosmography is able to provide\ninformation about the form of the cosmological expansion history, discussing\nhow to reproduce the dark fluid from the cosmographic sound speed. Following\nthis, we discuss limits on cosmographic priors and focus on how to\nexperimentally treat cosmographic expansions. Finally, we present some of the\nlatest developments of the cosmographic method, reviewing the use of rational\napproximations, based on cosmographic Pad\\'e polynomials. Future prospects\nleading to more accurate cosmographic results, able to better reproduce the\nexpansion history of the universe are also discussed in detail. \n\n"}

Based on this theory, we further review the corresponding cosmological\nand astrophysical applications. In particular, we study cosmological solutions\narising from f(T) gravity, both at the background and perturbation levels, in\ndifferent eras along the cosmic expansion. The f(T) gravity construction can\nprovide a theoretical interpretation of the late-time universe acceleration,\nand it can easily accommodate with the regular thermal expanding history\nincluding the radiation and cold dark matter dominated phases.

We simulate lens fields with realistic three-dimensional\nmass configurations (self-consistently including voids), and then fit mock\nlensing observables with increasingly complex lens models to quantify biases\nand uncertainties associated with different ways of treating the lens\nenvironment (ENV) and LOS. We identify the combination of mass, projected\noffset, and redshift that determines the importance of a perturbing galaxy for\nlensing. Foreground structures have a stronger effect on the lens potential\nthan background structures, due to nonlinear effects in the foreground and\ndownweighting in the background. There is dramatic variation in the net\nstrength of ENV/LOS effects across different lens fields; modeling fields\nindividually yields stronger priors for $H_0$ than ray tracing through $N$-body\nsimulations. Models that ignore mass outside the lens yield poor fits and\nbiased results. Adding external shear can account for tidal stretching from\ngalaxies at redshifts $z \\ge z_{\\rm lens}$, but it requires corrections for\nexternal convergence and cannot reproduce nonlinear effects from foreground\ngalaxies. Using the tidal approximation is reasonable for most perturbers as\nlong as nonlinear redshift effects are included. Even then, the scatter in\n$H_0$ is limited by the lens profile degeneracy.

At the early\nstages of reheating the inflationary scalar field transfers its energy to the\nnewly created matter particles, with the field energy decreasing to near zero.\nThe general equations governing the irreversible matter creation during\nreheating are obtained by combining the thermodynamics description of the\nmatter creation and the gravitational field equations. A dimensionless form of\nthe general system of the reheating equations is also introduced. The role of\nthe different inflationary scalar field potentials is analyzed by using\nanalytical and numerical methods, and the evolution of the matter and scalar\nfield densities, as well as of the cosmological parameters during reheating,\nare obtained. Typically, the values of the energy densities of relativistic\nmatter and dark matter reach their maximum when the Universe is reheated up to\nthe reheating temperature, which is determined for each case, as a function of\nthe scalar field decay width, the scalar field particle mass, and of the\ncosmological parameters. An interesting result is that particle production\nleads to the acceleration of the Universe during the reheating phase, with the\ndeceleration parameter showing a complex dynamics.

However, dynamics after the inflation turned out to have a\nnon-trivial dependence on $f$. For each G-axion model there exists a critical\nvalue of $f_c$ such that for $f>f_c$ we have the oscillating phase after\ninflation and for $f<f_c$ we have non-oscillatory phase.

Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a\ncritical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the\nwall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it\ndevelops ghost instabilities. For smaller initial radius, tension dominates and\nthe wall contracts towards the black hole horizon where it also develops ghost\ninstabilities. We also show, using the same analytical model and energetic\narguments that a global monopole is gravitationally attracted by a black hole\nwhile a cosmological constant induces a repulsive gravitational potential as in\nthe case of test particles. Finally we show that a global string loop with\nfinite thickness experiences gravitational repulsion due to the cosmological\nconstant which dominates over its tension for a radius larger than a critical\nradius leading to an expanding rather than contracting loop. \n\n"}

This quantity, the effective spin\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian\norder.

In this paper we focus on two important\ncomplications of using the effective spin to study astrophysical population\nproperties: (i) an astrophysical distribution for $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values\nwhich is symmetric does not necessarily lead to a symmetric distribution for\nthe detected effective spin values, leading to a \\emph{selection bias}; and\n(ii) the posterior distribution of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for individual events\nis \\emph{asymmetric} and it cannot usually be treated as a Gaussian.

Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to\ndetermine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 10^14 to 10^15\nsolar masses, and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with\nthe mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of\nstructure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models.\nSecond, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous\nmatter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active\ngalactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so\ndeep.

Although Tereno stops short of finding the precise value\nof V at r=2M, he concludes that V <1. It is pointed out with reference to\nEq.(13) of Tereno's work that since his delta = (r -2M)/r tends to 0 as r tends\nto 2M, V indeed tends to 1.

The underlying group-theoretical\nstructure allows a direct extension of such notions from a non-relativistic to\na special- relativistic context if one exploits the {\\it rest-frame instant\nform of dynamics}. The various known definitions of relativistic center of mass\nare recovered. The separation of suitable relative variables from the so-called\n{\\it canonical internal} center of mass leads to the correct kinematical\nframework for the relativistic theory of the orbits for a N-body system with\naction -at-a-distance interactions. The rest-frame instant form is also shown\nto be the correct kinematical framework for introducing the Dixon multi-poles\nfor closed and open N-body systems, as well as for continuous systems,\nexemplified here by the configurations of the Klein-Gordon field that are\ncompatible with the previous notions of center of mass. \n\n"}

We then consider\nwhether it is possible to construct spacetimes that have finite horizon area\nbut infinite volume, by sending the radius to infinity while making discrete\nidentifications to preserve the horizon area.

It is shown that some of such theories may\npass the Solar System tests. On the same time, it is demonstrated that they\nhave quite rich cosmological structure: they may naturally describe the\neffective (cosmological constant, quintessence or phantom) late-time era with a\npossible transition from decceleration to acceleration thanks to gravitational\nterms which increase with scalar curvature decrease. The possibility to explain\nthe coincidence problem as the manifestation of the universe expansion in such\nmodels is mentioned.

{"id": "hep-th/0604086", "contents": "Title: DGP Specteroscopy Abstract: We systematically explore the spectrum of gravitational perturbations in\ncodimension-1 DGP braneworlds, and find a 4D ghost on the self-accelerating\nbranch of solutions. The ghost appears for any value of the brane tension,\nalthough depending on the sign of the tension it is either the helicity-0\ncomponent of the lightest localized massive tensor of mass $0<m^2 < 2H^2$ for\npositive tension, the scalar `radion' for negative tension, or their admixture\nfor vanishing tension. Because the ghost is gravitationally coupled to the\nbrane-localized matter, the self-accelerating solutions are not a reliable\nbenchmark for cosmic acceleration driven by gravity modified in the IR. In\ncontrast, the normal branch of solutions is ghost-free, and so these solutions\nare perturbatively safe at large distance scales. We further find that when the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold symmetry is broken, new tachyonic instabilities, which\nare much milder than the ghosts, appear on the self-accelerating branch.\nFinally, using exact gravitational shock waves we analyze what happens if we\nrelax boundary conditions at infinity. We find that non-normalizable bulk\nmodes, if interpreted as 4D phenomena, may open the door to new ghost-like\nexcitations. \n\n"}

For high m, (high Hm\n-->c/\\alpha'), no phase transition occurs at the Anti de Sitter string\ntemperature T_{s} which is higher than the flat space (Hagedorn) temperature\nt_{s}. (the Hubble constant H acts as producing a smaller string constant and\nthus, a higher tension). T_s is the precise quantum dual of the semiclassical\n(QFT) Anti de Sitter temperature scale . We compute the quantum string emission\nby a black hole in Anti de Sitter space-time (bhAdS). In the early evaporation\nstage, it shows the QFT Hawking emission with temperature T_{sem~bhAdS},\n(semiclassical regime). For T_{sem~bhAdS}--> T_{s}, it exhibits a phase\ntransition into a Anti de Sitter string state. New string bounds on the black\nhole emerge in the bhAdS string regime. We find a new formula for the full\n(quantum regime included) Anti de Sitter entropy S_{sem}, as a function of the\nusual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{sem}^(0). For low H (semiclassical regime),\nS_{sem}^(0) is the leading term but for high H (quantum regime), no phase\ntransition operates, in contrast to de Sitter space, and the entropy S_{sem} is\nvery different from the Bekenstein-Hawking term S_{sem}^(0). \n\n"}
