(1) The\nlong-wavelength, low-frequency (\"hydrodynamic\") part of the theory of Andreev\nand Lifshitz has nine variables, and thus must have nine modes. We find a new\nmode associated with lattice point diffusion (and thus vacancy diffusion); it\nmay explain the absence of supersolid behavior in low-frequency pressure-driven\nflow. (2) The observed upper limit for the NCRI fraction (NCRIf) of about 20%,\nin disordered samples, is more-or-less the same as the already predicted upper\nlimit for the superfluid fraction of a well-ordered crystal; we argue that this\nmay not be a coincidence. (3) The negative experimental evidence for a second\npropagating hydrodynamic mode (expected to be fourth sound-like) may be due to\nthe long relaxation times $\\tau$ at low temperature $T$; only for frequencies\nsatisfying $\\omega\\tau\\ll1$ does the hydrodynamic theory apply. (4) The\nfundamental principles of quantum mechanics imply that Bose-Einstein\ncondensation is not necessary to define a quantum-mechanical phase; therefore\nthe absence of a finite condensate fraction $f_{0}$ does not necessarily imply\nthe absence of superfluidity. (5) Just as vortices should avoid occupied\nlattice sites to provide a vortex-lattice interaction, the lattice should\ninteract with the vortices to provide a lattice-vortex interaction; thus\ndislocations should interact with vortices, whose motion is affected by\nrotation. We discuss some experimental implications for the vortex liquid\nmodel, shear response, hysteresis, and relaxation. \n\n"}

In the case of optical\nmemories, such as CDs and DVDs, this discrimination involves lossy bosonic\nchannels and can be remarkably boosted by the use of nonclassical light\n(quantum reading). Here we generalize these concepts by extending the model of\nmemory from single-cell to multi-cell encoding. In general, information is\nstored in a block of cells by using a channel-codeword, i.e., a sequence of\nchannels chosen according to a classical code. Correspondingly, the readout of\ndata is realized by a process of \"parallel\" channel discrimination, where the\nentire block of cells is probed simultaneously and decoded via an optimal\ncollective measurement. In the limit of an infinite block we define the quantum\nreading capacity of the memory, quantifying the maximum number of readable bits\nper cell. This notion of capacity is nontrivial when we suitably constrain the\nphysical resources of the decoder. For optical memories (encoding bosonic\nchannels), such a constraint is energetic and corresponds to fixing the mean\ntotal number of photons per cell. In this case, we are able to prove a\nseparation between the quantum reading capacity and the maximum information\nrate achievable by classical transmitters, i.e., arbitrary classical mixtures\nof coherent states. In fact, we can easily construct nonclassical transmitters\nthat are able to outperform any classical transmitter, thus showing that the\nadvantages of quantum reading persist in the optimal multi-cell scenario. \n\n"}

Theoretical studies showed that ultrafast molecular rotation may\nchange the character of molecular scattering from solid surfaces, alter\nmolecular trajectories in external fields, make super rotors stable against\ncollisions, and lead to the formation of gas vortices. New ways of molecular\ncooling and selective chemical bond breaking by ultrafast spinning have been\nsuggested.

An efficient method of accelerating\nmolecular rotation with an \"optical centrifuge\" has been proposed and\nsuccessfully implemented, yet only indirect evidence of super rotors has been\nreported to date.

Specifically, quantum mechanics can be derived\nby combining the rules of Bayesian probability theory with only a single\nadditional law that explains the phases of complex probabilities.

We numerically and theoretically investigate the\ntime evolution of the momentum distribution of such quasi-particles when they\nare initially prepared in a quasi-monochromatic wave packet with a given mean\nmomentum. The parallel transport of the pseudo-spin degree of freedom along\nscattering paths in momentum space generates a geometrical phase which alters\nthe interference associated with reciprocal scattering paths. In the massless\ncase, a well-known dip in the momentum distribution develops at backscattering\n(respective to the Dirac point considered) around the transport mean free time.\nThis dip later vanishes in the honeycomb case because of trigonal warping.

In this article, we explore the\nholographic properties of networks of random tensors.

They are similar\nto spatial boundary conditions in Casimir phenomenon and therefore result in\nZPF spectrum change from continuous one to a discrete one and, as a\nconsequence, an effective temperature of the modified ZPF (Y. S. Levin ). The\naverage centripetal average force on the oscillator, originating from this\nmodified ZPF scattered by the oscillator in the near zone, is calculated in\nterms of the bilinear correlation functions of electromagnetic field. After\nrenormalization of the correlation function, which physically means extraction\nof a pure effect of periodicity, the force has a finite value. All calculations\nare carried out using the methodology of stochastic electrodynamics. The radial\ncomponent of the force is directed to the center of rotation. In non\nrelativistic case and for oscillator frequency smaller than rotation frequency,\nthe force turns out to be proportional to the rotation radius. Such result\ncould mean a possibility that micro motion of the oscillator in ZPF sustains\nits average circular motion without any other external forces.Though the\nestimation done for the point-like electron shows that the effect is not\nobservable because the radius of such circular electron motion would have been\nmuch smaller than the classical electron radius when our semi classical\napproach to the electromagnetic problem does not work. It is well expected\nresult and considered as the first step in the application of the idea in the\nquark world governed by non abelian colored fields, subject of the next paper. \n\n"}

To\ndate, much of the experimental focus has been on the realization of long-range\nIsing models, but generalizations to other spin models are highly desirable. In\nthis work, we explore a previously unappreciated connection between the\nrealization of an XY model by off-resonant driving of single sideband of boson\nexcitation (i.e.~a single-beam M{\\o}lmer-S{\\o}rensen scheme) and a\nboson-mediated Ising simulator in the presence of a transverse field. In\nparticular, we show that these two schemes have the same effective Hamiltonian\nin suitably defined rotating frames, and analyze the emergent effective XY spin\nmodel through truncated Magnus series and numerical simulations. In addition to\nXY spin-spin interactions that can be non-perturbatively renormalized from the\nnaive Ising spin-spin coupling constants, we find an effective transverse field\nthat is dependent on the thermal energy of the bosons, as well as other\nspin-boson couplings that cause spin-boson entanglement not to vanish at any\ntime. In the case of a boson-mediated Ising simulator with transverse field, we\ndiscuss the crossover from transverse-field Ising-like to XY-like spin behavior\nas a function of field strength. \n\n"}

The\nthree considered methods exploit different properties of the scattering matrix\n$S(\\mathscr{E};E)$ as a function of energy $E$: its poles, real values, and\nzeros of the second derivative of its phase. The essential feature of the\nmethod of zeroing the resolvent, which produces complex energies, is the\nunlimited growth of the wave function at infinity, which is, however,\neliminated by the time-dependent interpretation. The real energies at which the\nunitary scattering matrix becomes real correspond to the largest possible\ndistortion, $S=+1$, or its absence at $S=-1$ which in either case leads to the\nformation of quasibound states. Depending on their response to increasing\nelectric intensity, two types of field-induced positive energy quasibound\nlevels are identified: electron- and hole-like states.

This system is inspired by walking droplets experiments\nwith submerged barriers. We first show that a Poincar\\'e-Lorentz covariant\nformalization of the system causes inconsistency and contradiction.

This second loop feeds back to a secondary clock variable and\nultimately compensates for the perturbation of the clock frequency caused by\nthe measurements in the first loop. We show that such a two-loop scheme can\nlead to perfect compensation of measurement-induced light shifts and does not\nsuffer from the effects of relaxation, time-dependent pulse fluctuations and\nphase-jump modulation errors that are typical of other hyper-Ramsey schemes.\nSeveral variants of GABRS are explored based on different secondary variables\nincluding added relative phase shifts between Ramsey pulses, external\nfrequency-step compensation, and variable second-pulse duration.

We investigate the behaviour of the absorption coefficient of the\nisolated hydrogen atom in the neighbourhood of the Balmer limit.\n  Methods. We analytically computed the total cross-section arising from\nbound-bound and bound-free transitions in the isolated hydrogen atom at the\nBalmer limit, and established a simplified semi-analytical model for the\nsurroundings of that limit. We worked within the framework of the formalism of\nLandi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi (2004, Astrophys. Space Sci.

GSs of this\ntype dominate in the case of intra-gap solitons, with both components belonging\nto the first finite bandgap of the linear spectrum. Inter-gap solitons, with\none component residing in the second bandgap, and intra-gap solitons which have\nboth components in the second gap, are possible in a deeper periodic potential,\nwith the strength essentially exceeding the recoil energy of the atoms.\nInter-gap solitons are, typically, bound states of one tightly- and one\nloosely-bound components.

No additional noise arises from the\ntest masses' initial quantum state or from reduction of the test-mass state due\nto measurement of the interferometer output or from the uncertainty principle\nassociated with the test-mass state. Two features of interferometers are\ncentral to these conclusions: (i) The interferometer output (the photon number\nflux N(t) entering the final photodetector) commutes with itself at different\ntimes in the Heisenberg Picture, [N(t), N(t')] = 0, and thus can be regarded as\nclassical. (ii) This number flux is linear in the test-mass initial position\nand momentum operators x_o and p_o, and those operators influence the measured\nphoton flux N(t) in manners that can easily be removed by filtering -- e.g., in\nmost interferometers, by discarding data near the test masses' 1 Hz swinging\nfreqency. The test-mass operators x_o and p_o contained in the unfiltered\noutput N(t) make a nonzero contribution to the commutator [N(t), N(t')].
