These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

Our main focus is on a simple model system where the\ntotal density profile is that of an $n=1$ polytrope. We derive a partially\nanalytic solution for the superfluid analogue of the classical r-mode. This\nsolution is used to analyse the relevance of the vortex mediated mutual\nfriction damping, confirming that this dissipation mechanism is unlikely to\nsuppress the gravitational-wave driven instability in rapidly spinning\nsuperfluid neutron stars. Our calculation of the superfluid r-modes is\nsignificantly simpler than previous approaches, because it decouples the r-mode\nfrom all other inertial modes of the system. This leads to the results being\nclearer, but it also means that we cannot comment on the relevance of potential\navoided crossings (and associated \"resonances\") that may occur for particular\nparameter values. Our analysis of the mutual friction damping differs from\nprevious studies in two important ways.

Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are\ngenerally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive to\ncool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.\nterrestrial) planets.

Although the available\nmass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface\ndensity (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha < 2, the\naccretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances.\nEfficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution,\nwhen the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take\nplace. The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\nM_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can\naccrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.\nOur results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in\nextra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead\nto larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the\ncorrelation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity. Our\ncalculations also suggest that Jupiter could have formed at a larger radial\ndistance than its current location while still accreting the mass of heavy\nelements predicted by interior models.

The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the\nprimary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc\nat any separation less than the Hill radius.

We present a post-detection detrending algorithm, which filters\nout signal on other timescales than the period of the transit while preserving\nthe transit signal.\n  We compare the performance of this new filter to a well-established\npre-detection detrending algorithm, by applying both to a set of 20 simulated\nlight curves containing planetary transits, stellar variability, and\ninstrumental noise as expected for the CoRoT space mission, and performing\nanalytic fits to the transits.

The two\npopulations of planets to be detected through this channel are wide-separation\nplanets and free-floating planets. Although they appear as similar short\ntime-scale events, the two populations of planets are widely different in\nnature and thus distinguishing them is important. In this paper, we investigate\nthe lensing properties of events produced by planets with moderately wide\nseparations from host stars. We find that the lensing behavior of these events\nis well described by the Chang-Refsdal lensing and the shear caused by the\nprimary not only produces a caustic but also makes the magnification contour\nelongated along the primary-planet axis. The elongated magnification contour\nimplies that the light curves of these planetary events are generally\nasymmetric and thus the asymmetry can be used to distinguish the events from\nthose produced by free-floating planets. The asymmetry can be noticed from the\noverall shape of the light curve and thus can hardly be missed unlike the very\nshort-duration central perturbation caused by the caustic. In addition, the\nasymmetry occurs regardless of the event magnification and thus the bound\nnature of the planet can be identified for majority of these events. The close\napproximation of the lensing light curve to that of the Chang-Refsdal lensing\nimplies that the analysis of the light curve yields only the information about\nthe projected separation between the host star and the planet. \n\n"}

The available data demonstrate that the fraction of young stars\nwith optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopic\nevidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decay\nwith characteristic time ~2.5 Myr (half-life = 1.7 Myr). Large IR surveys of\n~2-5 Myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatter\nin the observed disk fractions as a function of age. Recent Spitzer surveys\nhave found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass and\nenvironment (binarity, proximity to massive stars, and cluster density).\nPerhaps most significantly for understanding the planeticity of stars, the disk\nfraction decay timescale appears to vary by stellar mass, ranging from ~1 Myr\nfor >1.3 Msun stars to ~3 Myr for <0.08 Msun brown dwarfs.

We use knowledge of hot Jupiters, mass\nloss estimates and models for the interior structure and evolution of planets\nto understand its composition, structure and evolution. The inferred mass and\nradius of CoRoT-7b are consistent with a rocky planet that would be depleted in\niron relative to Earth. However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_E) and\ndecrease in size (1.59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33%\niron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a\nsignificant amount of volatiles. An equally good fit to the data is found for a\nvapor envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10%) by mass above an Earth-like nucleus.\nBecause of its intense irradiation and small size, the planet cannot possess an\nenvelope of H and He of more than 1/10,000 of its total mass.

This leads to flow-dependent\ndeviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the\natmospheric medium. Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the\nradiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. We present\ntransmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which\nsuggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter\natmospheres. If winds are fast and bulk Doppler shifts are indeed important for\nthe global radiative balance, accurate modeling and reliable data\ninterpretation for hot Jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging: it would\ninvolve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupled\nradiation-hydrodynamical flow. On the bright side, it would also imply that the\nemergent properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres are more direct tracers of their\natmospheric flows than is the case for Solar System planets.\nRadiation-hydrodynamics may also influence radiative transfer in other classes\nof hot exoplanetary atmospheres with fast winds. \n\n"}

Planet\nformation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal\nmechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model.

If Aegaeon has similar\nsurface scattering properties as other nearby small Saturnian satellites\n(Pallene, Methone and Anthe), then its diameter is approximately 500 m. Orbit\nmodels based on numerical integrations of the full equations of motion show\nthat Aegaeon's orbital motion is strongly influenced by multiple resonances\nwith Mimas.

First, we\npresent a new numerical method for simulating dust coagulation and porosity\nevolution as an extension of the conventional Smoluchowski equation. This\nmethod follows the evolution of the mean porosity for each aggregate mass\nsimultaneously with the evolution of the mass distribution function. This\nmethod reproduces the results of previous Monte Carlo simulations with much\nless computational expense. Second, we propose a new collision model for porous\ndust aggregates on the basis of our N-body experiments on aggregate collisions.\nWe first obtain empirical data on porosity changes between the classical limits\nof ballistic cluster-cluster and particle-cluster aggregation. Using the data,\nwe construct a recipe for the porosity change due to general hit-and-stick\ncollisions as well as formulae for the aerodynamical and collisional cross\nsections.

Because the mass loss time scale by the MRI-driven disk\nwinds is proportional to the local Keplerian rotation period, a gas disk\ndynamically evaporates from the inner region with possibly creating a gradually\nexpanding inner hole, while a sizable amount of the gas remains in the outer\nregion.

A population of RR Lyrae stars\ndetermined to belong to M32 would prove the existence of an ancient population\nin that galaxy, a subject of some debate. We detected 17 RR Lyrae variables in\nF1 and 14 in F2. A 1-sigma upper limit of 6 RR Lyrae variables belonging to M32\nis inferred from these two fields alone. Use of our two ACS/WFC parallel fields\nprovides better constraints on the M31 background, however, and implies that\n$7_{-3}^{+4}$ (68 % confidence interval) RR Lyrae variables in F1 belong to\nM32.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.

We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc. We find this to be in principle\npossible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1.d-3 but then\nwe find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible\nonly if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal\ndissipation is very effective.

The main source\nof opacity in these objects is dust grains. We investigate two problems\ninvolving the effect of opacity on the evolution of planets of 3, 5, and 7 M_J.\nFirst, we pick three different overall metallicities for the planet and simply\nscale the opacity accordingly. We show that higher metallicity results in\nslower contraction as a result of higher opacity. It is found that the\npre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity. In this scenario,\nsurvival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to\nbe more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of\ncollapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a\nresult of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture\nplanetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects\nof opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same\nthree planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.\nWhen these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be\nof order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time\nscale calculated without these effects.

Thus, we compute the\ndifferential torque felt by a moonlet embedded in a two-dimensional disk of\nsolid particles, with flat surface density profile, both analytically and\nnumerically. We find that the corresponding migration rate is too small to\nexplain the observed variations of the propeller's orbit in Saturn's A-ring.\n  However, local density fluctuations (due to gravity wakes in the marginally\ngravitationally stable A-ring) may exert a stochastic torque on a moonlet. Our\nsimulations show that this torque can be large enough to account for the\nobservations, depending on the parameters of the rings. We find that on time\nscales of several years the migration of propellers is likely to be dominated\nby stochastic effects (while the former, non-stochastic migration dominates\nafter ~ 10^{4-5} years). In that case, the migration rates provided by\nobservations so far suggests that the surface density of the A ring should be\nof the order of 700 kg/m^2. The age of the propellers shouldn't exceed 1 to 100\nmillion years, depending on the dominant migration regime. \n\n"}

In such configuration, the system loses the axisymmetry\npresented in the aligned case, requiring a fully 3D approach. We perform 3D\nnumerical MHD simulations of stellar winds and study the effects caused by\ndifferent model parameters. The system reaches a periodic behavior with the\nsame rotational period of the star. We show that the magnetic field lines\npresent an oscillatory pattern and that by increasing the misalignment angle,\nthe wind velocity increases. Our wind models allow us to study the interaction\nof a magnetized wind with a magnetized extra-solar planet. Such interaction\ngives rise to reconnection, generating electrons that propagate along the\nplanet's magnetic field lines and produce electron cyclotron radiation at radio\nwavelengths. We find that a close-in Jupiter-like planet orbiting at 0.05AU\npresents a radio power that is ~5 orders of magnitude larger than the one\nobserved in Jupiter, which suggests that the stellar wind from a young star has\nthe potential to generate strong planetary radio emission that could be\ndetected in the near future with LOFAR.

Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr.

We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K.

For higher wind temperatures, the shock\nforms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star.

The method is based on the\nfact that a giant planet significantly perturbs the gas velocity flow in\naddition to distorting the disk surface density. We have calculated the\nemerging molecular line profiles by combining hydrodynamical models with\nsemianalytic radiative transfer calculations.

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass\nfor Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews\net al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an\nimportant role in the circumstellar gas dynamics. \n\n"}

A small neighborhood of the solar nebula is represented by an\norbiting patch of gas at a radius of 3 AU, and includes vertical stratification\nof the gas density. The differential rotation of the nebular gas is replaced by\na shear flow. Turbulence is driven by destabilization of the flow as a result\nof the magnetorotational instability (MRI), whereby magnetic field lines\nanchored to the gas are continuously stretched by the shearing motion. A\npassive contaminant mimics small dust grains that are aerodynamically well\ncoupled to the gas, and chondrules are modeled by Lagrangian particles that\ninteract with the gas through drag. Whenever a chondrule enters a region\npermeated by dust, its radius grows at a rate that depends on the local dust\ndensity and the relative velocity between itself and the dust. The local dust\nabundance decreases accordingly. Different chondrule volume densities lead to\nvarying depletion and rimmed-chondrule size growth times. Most of the dust\nsweep-up occurs within 1 gas scale height of the nebula midplane. Chondrules\ncan reach their asymptotic radius in 10 to 800 years.

As the conventional constraints for extrasolar planets\nlike mass, radius, and temperature allow for a large number of acceptable\nmodels, a new planetary parameter is desirable in order to further constrain\nplanetary models. Such a parameter may be the tidal Love number k2. In this\npaper we aim to study the capability of k2 to reveal further information about\nthe interior structure of a planet. With theoretical planetary models we\ninvestigate how the tidal Love number k2 responds to the internal density\ndistribution of a planet. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of the\ndegeneracy of k2 due to a density discontinuity in the envelope of a\nthree-layer planetary model. The effect of a possible outer density\ndiscontinuity masks the effect of the core mass on the Love number k2. Hence,\nthere is no unique relationship between the Love number k2 and the core mass of\na planet.

We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock\naround its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For\nWASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.\nObservational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal\nvariations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock\nand the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's\nmagnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding\nambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the\nknown eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets. We show that, because the distance\nfrom the star changes along the orbit of an eccentric planet, the shock\ncharacteristics are modulated by orbital phase. We predict time offsets between\nthe beginnings of the near-UV and optical light curves that are, in general,\nless than the transit duration. Variations in shock characteristics caused in\neccentric systems can only be probed if the shock is observed at different\norbital phases, which is, in general, not the case for transit observations.\nHowever, non-thermal radio emission produced by the interaction of the star and\nplanet should be modulated by orbital phase. We also quantify the response of\nthe shock to variations in the coronal material itself due to, e.g., a\nnon-axisymmetric stellar corona, planetary obliquity, intrinsic variations of\nthe stellar magnetic field.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit\ninteraction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme\nfor the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly.

Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc.

CO fundamental emission is a potentially powerful probe of\nthe disk/wind structure within a few AU of young protostars. In this paper, we\npresent high spectral (R=90,000) and spatial (0.3\") resolution VLT/CRIRES\nM-band spectra of 18 low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) with dense envelopes\nin nearby star-froming regions to explore the utility of CO fundamental 4.6\nmicron emission as a probe of very young disks. CO fundamental emission is\ndetected from 14 of the YSOs in our sample. The emission line profiles show a\nrange of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad,\nwarm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected\nmore frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 Lsun than those\nwith >15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm\n(~1000 K) inner AU of the disk. The CO emission from objects with high\nbolometric luminosity is produced in cooler (~320 K), narrow lines in 12CO and\nin rarer isotopologues. From some objects, the narrow lines are blueshifted by\nup to ~10 km/s, indicating a slow wind origin. For other sources the lines are\nlocated at the systemic velocity of the star and likely arise in the disk. For\na few YSOs, spatially-extended CO and H2 S(9) emission is detected up to 2\"\nfrom the central source and is attributed to interactions between the wind and\nsurrounding molecular material. Warm CO absorption is detected in the wind of\nsix objects with velocities up to 100 km/s, often in discrete velocity\ncomponents.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being\nof order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits. The results may also be applied to the problem of tidal capture of\nstars in young stellar clusters. \n\n"}

Irradiation is\nknown to weaken the strength of disc self-gravity, and can suppress it entirely\nif the disc is maintained above the threshold for linear instability. However,\nits impact on the susceptibility of the disc to fragmentation is less clear. We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times). In this regime, the power spectrum of the\nperturbations is uniquely set by the effective viscous alpha and not by the\ncooling rate.

We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure. Hence, a shell-like configuration of massive clumps does not\nimply that the C&C mechanism is at work. Rather, we find a hybrid form of\ntriggering, which combines elements of C&C and Radiatively Driven Implosion\n(RDI). In addition, we investigate the reliability of deriving clump masses\nfrom their 870 micron emission. We find that for clumps with more than 100\nM_sun the observational estimates are accurate to within a factor of two and\nthat, even at these long wavelengths, it is important to account for the\nradiative heating from triggered, embedded protostars. \n\n"}

As such the scattering process can be considered as\na series of three body problems during each of which the Tisserand parameter\nwith respect to the relevant planet is conserved. This constrains the orbital\nparameter space into which a particle can be scattered. Such arguments have\npreviously been applied to the process by which comets are scattered to the\ninner Solar System from the Kuiper belt. Our analysis generalises this for an\narbitrary planetary system. For particles scattered from an outer belt directly\nalong a chain of planets, based on the initial value of the Tisserand\nparameter, we find that it is possible to (i) determine which planets can eject\nthe particles from the system, (ii) define a minimum stellar distance to which\nparticles can be scattered, and (iii) constrain range of particle inclinations\n(and hence the disc height) at different distances.

For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population\nof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration\nand disk evolution.\n  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary\ninitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different\nroles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,\ngiant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both\nmore frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets\ncannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.\nIn contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot\nfor giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher\nplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be\ncompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low\nmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high\nmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of\nmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with\nmetallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of\ngiant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,\nbut migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate\nless. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than Hot\nJupiters.\n  Conclusions.

In the core accretion\nmodel of planet formation this is expected because heavy elements are needed to\nform the dust grains which settle into the midplane of the protoplanetary disk\nand coagulate to form the planetesimals from which planetary cores are\nassembled. As well, there is observational evidence that the lifetimes of\ncircumstellar disks are shorter at lower metallicities, likely due to greater\nsusceptibility to photoevaporation. Here we estimate the minimum metallicity\nfor planet formation, by comparing the timescale for dust grain growth and\nsettling to that for disk photoevaporation. For a wide range of circumstellar\ndisk models and dust grain properties, we find that the critical metallicity\nabove which planets can form is a function of the distance r at which the\nplanet orbits its host star. With the iron abundance relative to that of the\nSun [Fe/H] as a proxy for the metallicity, we estimate a lower limit for the\ncritical abundance for planet formation of [Fe/H]_crit ~ -1.5 + log(r/1 AU),\nwhere an astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\nThis prediction is in agreement with the available observational data, and\ncarries implications for the properties of the first planets and for the\nemergence of life in the early Universe.

Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse\ndepth depends on star metallicity is 0.981. The correlation is consistent with\nplanets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison\nwith their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars.

However, the only numerical\nevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field\nevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by\nLaplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the\ntransition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the\ntransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone\nboundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are\nreadily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass\naccretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active\nzones, at the $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure\nmaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A\npressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized\nvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic\ninstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either\nthe parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies\nvorticity faster than they can destroy it.

Terrestrial microlens parallax can\nbe measured whenever a microlensing event differs substantially as observed\nfrom two or more well-separated sites.

The fragmentation of self-gravitating\nprotostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to\ntens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by\ngrain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central\nstar and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar\ndisc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass,\ngrain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption.

The cumulative effect of close and\ndistant encounters on these planetary systems are investigated using Monte\nCarlo scattering experiments.

Under the assumption that these\nplanets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we use\npopulation synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of the\nH/He envelope are high, with metal mass fraction Z_env values commonly 0.6 to\n0.9, or ~100 to 400+ times solar. The high mean molecular weight of such\natmospheres (\\mu ~ 5-12) would naturally help to flatten the transmission\nspectrum of most LMLD planets.

By now more than 300 planets transiting their host star have been\nfound, and much effort is being put into measuring the properties of each\nsystem. Light curves of planetary transits often contain deviations from a\nsimple transit shape, and it is generally difficult to differentiate between\nanomalies of astrophysical nature (e.g. starspots) and correlated noise due to\ninstrumental or atmospheric effects. Our solution is to observe transit events\nsimultaneously with two telescopes located at different observatories.

We present the first photometric follow-up of the\ntransiting planet HAT-P-16 b, and new photometric observations of WASP-21 b,\nobtained simultaneously with two medium-class telescopes located in different\ncountries, using the telescope defocussing technique.

Aims: The\nsearch for transiting planets in these long time series is computationally\nintensive. We wish to optimize the search for both detection and computational\nefficiencies. Methods: We assume that the searched systems can be well\ndescribed by Keplerian orbits. We then propagate the effects of different\nsystem parameters to the detection parameters. Results: We show that the\nfrequency information content of the light curve is primarily determined by the\nduty cycle of the transit signal, and thus the optimal frequency sampling is\nfound to be cubic and not linear. Further optimization is achieved by\nconsidering duty-cycle dependent binning of the phased light curve. By using\nthe (standard) BLS one is either rather insensitive to long-period planets, or\nless sensitive to short-period planets and computationally slower by a\nsignificant factor of ~330 (for a 3yr long dataset).

In this scenario the MWA can be\nconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM\nbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. The FM broadcasts\npropagate into space, are reflected off debris in Earth orbit, and are received\nat the MWA.

Radio timing\nindicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, a\nlow-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. The eclipse\nfraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the Roche lobe size\ninferred for the companion.

Within the context of this picture, significant\norbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets\ncan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment\nwith the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital\nobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star\ninteractions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit\nmisalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum\ntransfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational\nevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and\naccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote\nparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that\nwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is\nlargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.\nspecific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface\nfields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of\nmagnitude). Subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics of\ndisk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and disk\nproperties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited in\nsystems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. Moreover, we show\nthat the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through an\nencounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and the\ndisk-torquing frequency. Cumulatively, the model developed herein opens up a\npreviously unexplored avenue towards understanding star-disk evolution and its\nconsequences in a unified manner. \n\n"}

Here we explore the second way using global, three-dimensional isothermal\nhydrodynamical simulations with 8 levels of nested grids around the planet. In\nour simulations the vertical inflow from the circumstellar disk (CSD) to the\nCPD determines the shape of the CPD and its accretion rate.

It is, however, extremely challenging to compute.\nThis paper presents a geometric-path Monte Carlo method, inspired by\nmulti-canonical Monte Carlo to evaluate the fully marginalized likelihood. We\nshow that the algorithm is very fast and easy to implement and produces a\njustified uncertainty estimate on the fully marginalized likelihood. The\nalgorithm performs efficiently on a trial problem and multi-companion model\nfitting for radial velocity data. For the trial problem, the algorithm returns\nthe correct fully marginalized likelihood, and the estimated uncertainty is\nalso consistent with the standard deviation of results from multiple runs. We\napply the algorithm to the problem of fitting radial velocity data from HIP\n88048 ($\\nu$ Oph) and Gliese 581.

Dynamical interactions with\nplanet(s) have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearing\nof the inner disk.

Wind\n  Solutions at the Inner Disk Abstract: The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by\nnon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the\nHall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind\nproperties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned\nand anti-aligned field geometries.

In ideal MHD simulations, the surface\ndensity evolution (except for dust that drifts fastest), turbulent diffusion,\nand vertical scale height of dust can all be reproduced by simple\none-dimensoinal and/or analytical models.

To understand this anomaly in more\ndetail, we carry out both unstratified and stratified local shearing box\nsimulations with Lagrangian particles, and find that turbulence in AD dominated\ndisks has very different properties (e.g., temporal autocorrelation functions\nand power spectra) than turbulence in ideal MHD disks, which leads to quite\ndifferent particle diffusion efficiency.

We construct interior structure models of\nSaturn, compute the corresponding mode frequencies, and compare them with the\nobserved mode frequencies. The fundamental mode frequencies of our models match\nthe observed frequencies (of the largest amplitude waves) to an accuracy of\n$\\sim 1 \\%$, confirming that these waves are indeed excited by Saturn's\nf-modes. The presence of the lower amplitude waves (finely split in frequency\nfrom the f-modes) can only be reproduced in models containing gravity modes\nthat propagate in a stably stratified region of the planet. The stable\nstratification must exist deep within the planet near the large density\ngradients between the core and envelope. Our models cannot easily reproduce the\nobserved fine splitting of the $m=-3$ modes, suggesting that additional effects\n(e.g., significant latitudinal differential rotation) may be important. \n\n"}

The orbital\ninclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace plane is ~8 deg, which is\nunexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from a\ncircumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process\nhas pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero\n(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to\n0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present\nvalue (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction\nfrom captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough). Our\nresults therefore imply that only 2 out of 10 instability cases (~20%) can\nexcite Iapetus's inclination to its present value (~30% of trials lead to >5\ndeg) while leaving its orbital eccentricity low. \n\n"}

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores.

This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)!

Some mechanisms can significantly\nshorten this lifetime, allowing a few stars to start spinning up much earlier\nthan other stars. In the present study, we aim to investigate how the\nproperties of the circumstellar environment can shorten the disc lifetime. We\nhave identified a few multiple stellar systems, composed of stars with similar\nmasses, which belong to associations with a known age. Since all parameters\nthat are responsible for the rotational evolution, with the exception of\nenvironment properties and initial stellar rotation, are similar for all\ncomponents, we expect that significant differences among the rotation periods\ncan only arise from differences in the disc lifetimes. A photometric timeseries\nallowed us to measure the rotation periods of each component, while\nhigh-resolution spectra provided us with the fundamental parameters, $v\\sin{i}$\nand chromospheric line fluxes. The rotation periods of the components differ\nsignificantly, and the component B, which has a closer companion C, rotates\nfaster than the more distant and isolated component A.

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,\nplanets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.\nCurrently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal\nphotoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The\ndistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much\nlonger periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of\nstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

The standard LK mechanism\nconsists of large-amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and inclination of a\nbinary subject to the quadrupole potential from an outer perturber. Recent work\nhas shown that when the octupole terms are included in the potential, the inner\nbinary can reach more extreme eccentricities as well as undergo orientation\nflips. It is known that pericenter precessions due to short-range effects, such\nas General Relativity and tidal and rotational distortions, can limit the\ngrowth of eccentricity and even suppress standard (quadrupolar) LK\noscillations, but their effect on the octupole-level LK mechanism has not been\nfully explored. In this paper, we systematically study how these short-range\nforces affect the extreme orbital behaviour found in octupole LK cycles. In\ngeneral, the influence of the octupole potential is confined to a range of\ninitial mutual inclinations Itot centered around 90deg (when the inner binary\nmass ratio is <<1), with this range expanding with increasing octupole\nstrength. We find that, while the short-range forces do not change the width\nand location of this \"window of influence\", they impose a strict upper limit on\nthe maximum achievable eccentricity. This limiting eccentricity can be\ncalculated analytically, and its value holds even for strong octupole potential\nand for the general case of three comparable masses. Short-range forces also\naffect orbital flips, progressively reducing the range of Itot within which\nflips are possible as the intensity of these forces increases. \n\n"}

Also, it was intensively monitored from widely separated\nlocations under clear skies at low air masses. Choi et al.

Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational\namplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their\nprojected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational\namplitudes of the Kepler KOIs with those of Kepler single stars can provide a\nmeasure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of\nKepler planets. We apply this technique to the large samples of 993 KOIs and\n33,614 single Kepler stars in temperature range of 3500-6500 K. We find with\nhigh significance that the amplitudes of cool KOIs are larger, on the order of\n10%, than those of the single stars. In contrast, the amplitudes of hot KOIs\nare systematically lower. After correcting for an observational bias, we\nestimate that the amplitudes of the hot KOIs are smaller than the single stars\nby about the same factor of 10%.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg.

At this distance and time the comet was not very\nactive and it was theoretically possible to detect photometric variations\nlikely due to the rotation of the cometary nucleus. The goal of this work is to\nobtain differential photometry of the comet inner coma using different aperture\nradii in order to derive a possible rotational period. Large field of view\nimages were obtained with a 4k x 4k CCD at the f/3 0.77m telescope of La Hita\nObservatory in Spain. Aperture photometry was performed in order to get\nrelative magnitude variation versus time. Using calibrated star fields we also\nobtained ISON's R-magnitudes versus time.

In the presence of a vertical magnetic\nfield, the disk remains laminar between 1-5au, and a magnetocentrifugal disk\nwind forms that provides an important mechanism for removing angular momentum.\nQuestions remain, however, about the establishment of a true physical wind\nsolution in the shearing box simulations because of the symmetries inherent in\nthe local approximation.

We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation.

Here we use a simple model of thermal\nemission from cold silicate/carbon dust at a range of dust grain temperatures\nand fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Crab Nebula as a test.\nThis can lower the derived dust mass for the Crab by ~50% and 30-40% for\nastronomical silicates and amorphous carbon grains compared to recently\npublished values (0.25M_sun -> 0.12M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.072M_sun,\nrespectively), but the implied dust mass can also increase by as much as almost\na factor of six (0.25M_sun -> 1.14M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.71M_sun) depending\non assumptions regarding the sizes/temperatures of the coldest grains. The\nlatter values are clearly unrealistic due to the expected metal budget, though.\nFurthermore, we show by a simple numerical experiment that if a cold-dust\ncomponent does have a grain-temperature distribution, it is almost unavoidable\nthat a two-temperature fit will yield an incorrect dust mass estimate. But we\nconclude that grain temperatures is not a greater uncertainty than the often\npoorly constrained emissivities (i.e., material properties) of cosmic dust,\nalthough there is clearly a need for improved dust emission models. The\ngreatest complication associated with deriving dust masses still arises in the\nuncertainty in the dust composition. \n\n"}

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution. \n\n"}

The\nfraction of planetary systems that remains intact as a cluster member, fbps, is\ngenerally well-described by the functional form fbps=f0(1+[a/a0]^c)^-1, where\n(1-f0) is the fraction of stars that escapes from the cluster, a0 the critical\nsemi-major axis for survival, and c a measure for the width of the transition\nregion. The effect of the initial amount of substructure over time can be\nquantified as fbps=A(t)+B(D), where A(t) decreases nearly linearly with time,\nand B(D) decreases when the clusters are initially more substructured. Provided\nthat the orbital separation of planetary systems is smaller than the critical\nvalue a0, those in clusters with a higher initial stellar density (but\nidentical mass) have a larger probability of escaping the cluster intact.

Abstract: Protoplanetary discs are now routinely observed and exoplanets, after the\nnumerous indirect discoveries, are starting to be directly imaged. To better\nunderstand the planet formation process, the next step is the detection of\nforming planets or of signposts of young planets still in their disc, such as\ngaps. A spectacular example is the ALMA science verification image of HL Tau\nshowing numerous gaps and rings in its disc. To study the observability of\nplanet gaps, we ran 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a gas and dust disc\ncontaining a 5 M J gap-opening planet and characterised the spatial\ndistribution of migrating, growing and fragmenting dust grains. We then\ncomputed the corresponding synthetic images for ALMA.

For SR21, the\nring model better fits the emission at 336GHz, conversely the vortex model\nbetter fits the 689GHz emission.

We assert that mass measurements derived\nfrom these two methods are comparably reliable---as the physics underlying\ntheir respective signals is well understood. Nevertheless, their sensitivity to\nplanet mass varies with the properties of the planets themselves. We find that\nfor a given planet size, the RV method tends to find planets with higher mass\nwhile the sensitivity of TTVs is more uniform.

A minimum level of nuclear activity is thought to be necessary\n--- but not sufficient --- for planets to be habitable. Extending previous work\nthat focused on short-lived nuclei, this paper considers the delivery of\nlong-lived radioactive nuclei to circumstellar disks in star forming regions.\nAlthough the long-lived nuclear species are always present, their abundances\ncan be enhanced through multiple mechanisms. Most stars form in embedded\ncluster environments, so that disks can be enriched directly by intercepting\nejecta from supernovae within the birth clusters. In addition, molecular clouds\noften provide multiple episodes of star formation, so that nuclear abundances\ncan accumulate within the cloud; subsequent generations of stars can thus\nreceive elevated levels of radioactive nuclei through this distributed\nenrichment scenario. This paper calculates the distribution of additional\nenrichment for $^{40}$K, the most abundant of the long-lived radioactive\nnuclei. We find that distributed enrichment is more effective than direct\nenrichment. For the latter mechanism, ideal conditions lead to about 1 in 200\nsolar systems being directly enriched in $^{40}$K at the level inferred for the\nearly solar nebula (thereby doubling the abundance).

Here, we study\nextended power sources which distribute heat from the photosphere to the deep\ninterior of the planet. Our analytical treatment is a generalization of a\nprevious analysis of localized \"point sources\". We model the deposition profile\nas a power law in the optical depth and find that planetary cooling and\ncontraction halt when the internal luminosity (i.e. cooling rate) of the planet\ndrops below the heat deposited in the planet's convective region. A slowdown in\nthe evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources\nwhich do not extend to the planet's center. We estimate the Ohmic dissipation\nresulting from the interaction between the atmospheric winds and the planet's\nmagnetic field, and apply our analytical model to Ohmically heated planets.

This concept, called as\ndensified pupil spectroscopy, allows us to perform high, stable\nspectrophotometry against telescope pointing jitter and deformation of the\nprimary mirror. This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The\nacquired multiple spectra are not principally moved on the detector against\nlow-order aberrations such as the telescope pointing jitter and any deformation\nof the primary mirror. The reliability of the observation result is also\nincreased by statistically treating them.

These\nsimulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric\nthree-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and\nTriangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an\nazimuthally symmetric GHZ.\n  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a\nlarge number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the\ngalactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being\nhabitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams\nand satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet\nformation.\n  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different\nevolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving\nbiospheres. For the Milky Way, this interquartile range begins as a narrow band\nat large radii, expanding to encompass much of the galaxy at intermediate times\nbefore settling at a range of 2-13kpc.

Previous studies using simulated\nphotometry of Earth show that continuous observations over most of a planet's\norbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general\nplanets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a\nsimple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity\nfrom light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the\nproduct of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the\nvisibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of\nillumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved\nphotometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which\nsweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's\nmovement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with\nnon-zero obliquity on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's\nlongitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct functions of obliquity and\naxial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects the\nkernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is\nEast-West uniform or spinning rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find\nthat perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital phases is usually\nsufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis. Surprisingly, we predict\nthat East-West albedo contrast is more useful for constraining obliquity than\nNorth-South contrast. \n\n"}

We explore the effect of radial drift of solids and viscous gas\naccretion onto the central star on the snowline locations of the main C and O\ncarriers in a protoplanetary disk, H2O, CO2 and CO, and their consequences for\nthe C/O ratio in gas and dust throughout the disk. We determine the snowline\nlocations for a range of fixed initial particle sizes and disk types. For our\nfiducial disk model, we find that grains with sizes ~0.5 cm < s < 7 m for an\nirradiated disk, and ~0.001 cm < s < 7 m for an evolving and viscous disk,\ndesorb at a size-dependent location in the disk, which is independent of the\nparticle's initial position. The snowline radius decreases for larger\nparticles, up to sizes of ~7 m. Compared to a static disk, we find that radial\ndrift and gas accretion in a viscous disk move the H2O snowline inwards by up\nto 40%, the CO2 snowline by up to 60%, and the CO snowline by up to 50%.

However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have\ndecreased below water condensation level well before the disk was\nphotoevaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is\npuzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be\ndirect condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the\nSun more slowly than the gas itself. The appearance of ice in a range of\nheliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial\ndrift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a sufficiently massive\nplanet is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because the\ndisk acquires a superKeplerian rotation just outside of the planetary orbit.\nFrom this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved about 20\nEarth masses when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively\nfossilized the snowline at that location. Although cooling, the disk inside of\nthe Jovian orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from\nthe outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that\nplanetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in\ntheir inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal disk at 0.7AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to\nexplain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its\norbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of\nthe phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus,\nwhen the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7AU\nwithout being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing\nplanetesimals. \n\n"}

Comparisons of dust masses from\nprotoplanetary and debris disks have revealed a stark downturn in mass in\nmillimetre-sized grains around a stellar age of 10 Myr, ostensibly in the\n\"transition disk\" phase, suggesting a period of rapid accretion of such grains\nonto planetesimals. This rapid formation phase is in keeping with radionucleide\nstudies of Kuiper Belt Objects in the solar system.

This\nfriction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial\nwaves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for\nthis friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent\neddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on\nvelocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into\naccount the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.\nTherefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and\ncharacteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been\nrecently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical\nsimulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal\nwaves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.\nFinally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary\nconvective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The\naction of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied\non tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number\nbelow 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of\nmagnitude. It may lead to a loss of efficiency of the viscous dissipation of\nthe equilibrium tide and to a more efficient complex and resonant dissipation\nof tidal inertial waves in the bulk of convective regions. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to have a completely coupled treatment of the tidal/rotational\nevolution of star-planet systems and multiple stars with a coherent treatment\nof the variations of tidal flows and of their dissipation as a function of\nrotation. \n\n"}

Here we present\ntheoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of\ndry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with grey radiative transfer and test them\nusing a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a\nradiative-convective model that captures surface temperatures of slowly\nrotating and cool atmospheres.

Third, we develop a radiative-convective-subsiding model which\nextends our radiative-convective model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find\nthat rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients at a ratio of\nwave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the\nvalue suggested by work on hot Jupiters.

We compare standard\nBLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, as well as\nto a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths,\nand we find that standard knots behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS\nmapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC.\nBLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically\napproximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method\nfor choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data. BLISS\nmapping gives fits that are usually more accurate than precise (i.e. they are\noverly conservative), and the routine is more precise than polynomial models\nfor significant eclipses or pixels with more varied sensitivities. BLISS\nmapping has better predictive power for most of these particular synthetic\ndata, depending on how one treats time-correlated residuals. Overall, we\nconclude that BLISS mapping can be a reasonable sensitivity model for IRAC\nphotometry. \n\n"}

High-eccentricity\nmigration involving Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's orbit induced by a\ndistant perturber is a possible channel for producing such misaligned HJ\nsystems. Previous works have shown that the dynamical evolution of the stellar\nspin axis during the high-$e$ migration plays a dominant role in generating the\nobserved spin-orbit misalignment. Numerical studies have also revealed various\npatterns of the evolution of the stellar spin axis leading to the final\nmisalignment. Here we develop an analytic theory to elucidate the evolution of\nspin-orbit misalignment during the Lidov-Kozai migration of planets in stellar\nbinaries. Secular spin-orbit resonances play a key role in the misalignment\nevolution. We include the effects of short-range forces and tidal dissipation,\nand categorize the different possible paths to spin-orbit misalignment as a\nfunction of various physical parameters (e.g. planet mass and stellar rotation\nperiod). We identify five distinct spin-orbit evolution paths and outcomes,\nonly two of which are capable of producing retrograde orbits. We show that\nthese paths to misalignment and the outcomes depend only on two dimensionless\nparameters, which compare the stellar spin precession frequency with the rate\nof change of the planet's orbital axis, and the Lidov-Kozai oscillation\nfrequency. Our analysis reveals a number of novel phenomena for the stellar\nspin evolution, ranging from bifurcation, adiabatic advection, to fully chaotic\nevolution of spin-orbit angles. \n\n"}

The ability for an\naccreting planet to enter a fast migration regime is found to depend strongly\non the planet growth rate, but can occur for values of the mass flux through\nthe disc of ${\\dot M}\\gtrsim 5\\times 10^{-8} \\;M_\\odot/yr$. We find that an\nepisode of runaway outward migration can cause an accreting planet formed in\nthe 5-10 AU region to temporarily orbit at star-planet separations as large as\n$\\sim$60-70 AU. However, increase in the amplitude of the Lindblad torque\nassociated with planet growth plus change in the streamline topology near the\nplanet systematically cause the direction of migration to be reversed. Our\nresults indicate that a planet can reach large orbital distances under the\ncombined effect of dynamical torques and gas accretion, but an alternative\nmechanism is required to explain the presence of massive planets on wide\norbits. \n\n"}

In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured.

The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of the\ndifferent methods used to deal with stellar signals to recover extremely\nlow-mass planets despite. However, because observed RV variations at the m/s\nprecision level or below is a combination of signals induced by unresolved\norbiting planets, by the star, and by the instrument, performing such a\ncomparison using real data is extremely challenging. To circumvent this\nproblem, we generated simulated RV measurements including realistic stellar and\nplanetary signals. Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV\nmeasurements, using their own method to recover planetary signals despite\nstellar RV signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams\nwith the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,\nit is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different methods.\nThe most efficient methods to recover planetary signals {take into account the\ndifferent activity indicators,} use red-noise models to account for stellar RV\nsignals and a Bayesian framework to provide model comparison in a robust\nstatistical approach. Using the most efficient methodology, planets can be\nfound down to K/N= K_pl/RV_rms*sqrt{N_obs}=5 with a threshold of K/N=7.5 at the\nlevel of 80-90% recovery rate found for a number of methods.

Subsequent analysis showed that at ~1.5\nEarth radii there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky\nsuper-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile\nenvelopes. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will\nbe critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency\nof potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky\nsuper-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have\nlost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes,\nor they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets,\nwhich never had significant envelopes. Using models of atmospheric\nphoto-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated\ncores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys\npush to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller\nless massive cores can be stripped. On the other hand, if most rocky planets\nformed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without\ninitial gaseous envelopes. In this case, we use N-body simulations of planet\nformation to show that the transition radius should increase with orbital\nperiod, due to the increasing solid mass available in their disks. Moreover, we\nshow that distinguishing between these two scenarios should be possible in\ncoming years with radial velocity follow-up of planets found by TESS. Finally,\nwe discuss the broader implications of this work for current efforts to measure\n$\\eta_{\\mathrm{\\oplus}}$, which may yield significant overestimates if most\nrocky planets form as evaporated cores. \n\n"}

We show that this process can be understood as a modified,\nPCA-like process that produces porous, but non-fractal particles whose filling\nfactor is chiefly determined by the porosity of the building blocks.\n  We also show that in a coagulation environment where relative velocities are\ndriven by turbulence, a logarithmically flat mass distribution (equal mass per\nmass decade) as it is typically found in environments where fragmentation\nreplenishes small grains, leads to a situation where small particles and\naggregates dominate the growth of large ones. Therefore, in such environments,\nhierarchical growth should be seen as the norm. Consequently, we predict that\nthe aggregates in such environments are not fractals with extremely low\ndensities as they would result from extrapolation fractal laws to large sizes.\nThe compactification of aggregates does not only result from collisions with\nenough energy to restructure aggregates - it starts already earlier by filling\nvoids in particles with smaller grains that contribute to the growth. \n\n"}

Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to\nbecome hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still\nacquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8.

Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer\nsimulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in\ndisks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio\n($h/r$): $\\delta_{\\rm max}\\approx((M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.\nWith current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum\nplanet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\\odot$\nstar at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more\nmassive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in\nobserved disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates\nfrom a different planet.

Given edge-on orbital\npaths for transiting planets, stellar inclinations can be interpreted as\nobliquities projected into the line of sight, which can be used to more clearly\nreveal the system architectures of small planets and the factors that drive\ntheir orbital evolution. To demonstrate the method, we use a sample of\nsimulated target stars for the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS) mission. Based on predicted characteristics of these stars and likely\nmeasurement uncertainties, we show that the expected TESS discoveries will\nallow us to finely differentiate the true underlying obliquity distribution.\nUnder conservative assumptions in our illustrative example--in which the true\ndistribution is assumed to contain systems drawn from both well-aligned and\nisotropic distributions (e.g., due to multiple migration channels)--the correct\nfractions can be determined to within $0.15$, thus enabling constraints on the\nevolutionary processes that shape system architectures. Moreover, because of\nthe excellent astrometric precision expected from Gaia, this technique will\nalso be applicable to the large number of planets already discovered by\n${\\textit Kepler}$ orbiting much more distant stars. \n\n"}

Framework for Radiation-hydrodynamical\n  Simulations and First Results Abstract: The key aspect determining the post-formation luminosity of gas giants has\nlong been considered to be the energetics of the accretion shock at the\nplanetary surface. We use 1D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to study the\nradiative loss efficiency and to obtain post-shock temperatures and pressures\nand thus entropies. The efficiency is defined as the fraction of the total\nincoming energy flux which escapes the system (roughly the Hill sphere), taking\ninto account the energy recycling which occurs ahead of the shock in a\nradiative precursor. We focus here on a constant equation of state to isolate\nthe shock physics but use constant and tabulated opacities. While robust\nquantitative results will require a self-consistent treatment including\nhydrogen dissocation and ionization, the results show the correct qualitative\nbehavior and can be understood semi-analytically. The shock is found to be\nisothermal and supercritical for a range of conditions relevant to core\naccretion (CA), with Mach numbers greater than ca. 3. Across the shock, the\nentropy decreases significantly, by a few entropy units (k_B/baryon). While\nnearly 100 percent of the incoming kinetic energy is converted to radiation\nlocally, the efficiencies are found to be as low as roughly 40 percent,\nimplying that a meaningful fraction of the total accretion energy is brought\ninto the planet.

This correlation suggests that HJ formation is affected by the\nstellar binary companion. A potential model is high-eccentricity migration, in\nwhich the binary companion induces high-eccentricity Lidov-Kozai (LK)\noscillations in the proto-HJ orbit, triggering orbital migration driven by\ntides. A pitfall of this `binary-LK' model is that the observed stellar\nbinaries hosting HJs are typically too wide to produce HJs in sufficient\nnumbers, because of suppression by short-range forces. We propose a\nmodification to the binary-LK model in which there is a second giant planet\norbiting the proto-HJ at a semimajor axis of several tens of AU. Such\ncompanions are currently hidden to observations, but their presence could be\nmanifested by a propagation of the perturbation of the stellar binary companion\ninwards to the proto-HJ, thereby overcoming the barrier imposed by short-range\nforces. Our model does not require the planetary companion orbit to be\neccentric and/or inclined with respect to the proto-HJ, but its semimajor axis\nshould lie in a specific range given the planetary mass and binary semimajor\naxis, and the inclination with respect to the binary should be near $40^\\circ$\nor $140^\\circ$.

Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass. This process could be relevant for planet\nformation in dense environments. \n\n"}

We find that ring torques and capture of moons\ninto mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends\noutward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively\nslow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis\ndistribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys.\nWe estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary\nimpactors during a late heavy bombardment.

Specifically, in the presence of\nlibration in longitude, the actual spectrum of Fourier tidal modes differs from\nthe conventional spectrum rendered by the Darwin-Kaula theory for a\nnon-librating celestial object. This necessitates derivation of formulae for\nthe tidal torque and the tidal heating rate, that are applicable under\nlibration.\n  We derive the tidal spectrum for longitudinal forced libration with one and\ntwo main frequencies, generalisation to more main frequencies being\nstraightforward. (By main frequencies we understand those emerging due to the\ntriaxiality of the librating body.) Separately, we consider a case of free\nlibration at one frequency (once again, generalisation to more frequencies\nbeing straightforward).\n  We also calculate the tidal torque. This torque provides correction to the\ntriaxiality-caused physical libration. Our theory is not self-consistent: we\nassume that the tidal torque is much smaller than the\npermanent-triaxiality-caused torque; so the additional libration due to tides\nis much weaker than the main libration due to the permanent triaxiality.\n  Finally, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate in a body experiencing\nforced libration at the main mode, or free libration at one frequency, or\nsuperimposed forced and free librations. \n\n"}

In the\npresent work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large\nprogram with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical\nsample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including 3 stars with sub-stellar\ncompanions.

Our work yields the largest sample of\nsystems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,\nplanetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs\nin non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their\nhost stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM. The few planets of our sample with\ncircular orbits and $\\alpha >5$ values may have migrated through disc-planet\ninteractions instead of HEM.

The volatiles might be returned back to the gas phase in the\ninner disk (within about 15 AU), which is consistent with current constraints.\nComparison with studies on disk dispersal due to photoevaporation indicates\nthat the timescale for volatile depletion is shorter than that of\nphotoevaporation. \n\n"}

One must consider\nthe various effects that alter the measured polarized signal, such as the shape\nof dust grains, the efficiency of grain alignment, the magnetic field\nproperties, and the projection of the signal along the line of sight.

The origin\nof this difference is still debated, with both radial drift of the dust and\noptical depth effects suggested in the literature. In this work, the feedback\nof realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular\nemissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. The\nradial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models\nthat include growth, fragmentation and radial drift. A new version of the code\nDALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence\nthe disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference\nof dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth\nof CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.\nThe effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the\ncontinuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission\ncan easily differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent\n$\\alpha$ ranging between typical values. Grain growth and settling concur in\nthermally decoupling the gas and dust components, due to the low collision rate\nwith large grains. As a result, the gas can be much colder than the dust at\nintermediate heights, reducing the CO excitation and emission, especially for\nlow turbulence values.

Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising\nalternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the\nrobustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas\nmass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.\nDeuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the\nthermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and\nvertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas\nmass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8.

For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses.

Unlike previous literature that reported the color of\nAU Mic's disk became increasingly more blue as a function of projected\nseparation beyond approximately 30 AU, we find the disk's optical color between\n35-45 AU to be uniformly blue on the southeast side of the disk and\ndecreasingly blue on the northwest side.

The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes.

Aims. We investigate here the\ncollisional history of asteroid (6) Hebe and challenge the idea that Hebe may\nbe the parent body of ordinary H chondrites, the most common type of meteorites\nfound on Earth (~34% of the falls). Methods. We observed Hebe with SPHERE as\npart of the science verification of the instrument. Combined with earlier\nadaptive-optics images and optical light curves, we model the spin and\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape of Hebe and check the consistency of the derived\nmodel against available stellar occultations and thermal measurements. Results.\nOur 3D shape model fits the images with sub-pixel residuals and the light\ncurves to 0.02 mag. The rotation period (7.274 47 h), spin (343 deg,+47 deg),\nand volume-equivalent diameter (193 +/- 6km) are consistent with previous\ndeterminations and thermophysical modeling.

To achieve the\nsensitivity required to detect Earth-sized exoplanets in the NIR, simultaneous\nmonitoring of precipitable water vapor (PWV) becomes necessary to mitigate the\nimpact of variable telluric lines on radial velocity measurements and transit\nlight curves. To address this issue, we present the Camera for the Automatic\nMonitoring of Atmospheric Lines (CAMAL), a stand-alone, inexpensive six-inch\naperture telescope dedicated to measuring PWV at the Fred Lawrence Whipple\nObservatory on Mount Hopkins. CAMAL utilizes three narrowband NIR filters to\ntrace the amount of atmospheric water vapor affecting simultaneous observations\nwith the MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) and MINERVA-Red\ntelescopes. Here we present the current design of CAMAL, discuss our data\nanalysis methods, and show results from 11 nights of PWV measurements taken\nwith CAMAL. For seven nights of data, we have independent PWV measurements\nextracted from high-resolution stellar spectra taken with the Tillinghast\nReflector Echelle Spectrometer (TRES) also located on Mount Hopkins.

This has been well\nstudied using both linear theory and numerical simulations, but so far, only\nfor the primary spiral arm -- the one directly attached to the planet. Using\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the secondary and\ntertiary arms driven by a planet can also open gaps as they steepen into\nshocks. The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with\ntime in a low viscosity disk ($\\alpha = 5\\times10^{-5}$), so even low-mass\nplanets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open\nmultiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed. Applying\nour results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet\nembedded in the ring at 68.8~au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the\npositions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly\nreproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm\ncontinuum.

For the first time, we show that the use of the SGL for communication\npurposes is possible.

We calculate point-spread functions, aperture sizes, heliocentric\ndistance, and optimum communication frequency. The best wavelength for nearby\n(<100 pc) interstellar communication is limited by current technology to the UV\nand optical band.

An ETI 'A' can communicate with\nETI 'B' if B is observing transiting planets in A's star system, either by\nbuilding structures to produce artificial transits observable by B, or by\nemitting signals at B during transit, at significantly lower energy consumption\nthan typical electromagnetic transmission schemes.\n  This can produce a network of interconnected civilisations, establishing\ncontact via observing each other's transits. Assuming that civilisations reside\nin a Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ), I conduct Monte Carlo Realisation\nsimulations of the establishment and growth of this network, and analyse its\nproperties in the context of graph theory.\n  I find that at any instant, only a few civilisations are correctly aligned to\ncommunicate via transits.

Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions.

This is consistent with\ncurrent theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory.

We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem.

Up to now, only a few embedded candidate protoplanets have\nbeen detected with semi-major axes of 20-50 au. Due to the small angular\nseparation from their central star, only long-baseline interferometry provides\nthe angular resolving power to detect disk asymmetries associated to\nprotoplanets at solar system scales in nearby star-forming regions. In\nparticular, infrared observations are crucial to observe scattered stellar\nradiation and thermal re-emission in the vicinity of embedded companions\ndirectly.

To study the dynamical evolution of the system, we\nsimulate the motions of Proxima and alpha Centauri A and B due to the\nperturbations from the Galactic tide and stellar encounters in a Monte Carlo\nfashion. From 100 clones, we find that 74% orbits of Proxima Centauri are bound\nto alpha Centauri A and B while 17% and 9% orbits become unbound in the\nsimulations over the past and future 5 Gyr. If the system migrated outward in\nthe Milky Way to its current location, more than 50% of clones could become\nunstable in backward simulations. The ratio of unstable clones increases with\nthe simulation time scale and encounter rate. This provides some evidence for a\ncapture scenario for the formation of the current triple system.

We perform a 3D SPH simulation of a circumbinary disc\nmisaligned by $60^\\circ$ with respect to the binary orbital plane.

As the inner disc precesses, the misalignment angle\nbetween the inner and outer discs varies by more than $100^\\circ$. Different\nsnapshots of the evolution are post-processed with a radiative transfer code,\nin order to produce observational diagnostics of the process.

Our survey, together with other ALMA\nstudies, have yielded null results for disks around young planet-mass\ncompanions and placed stringent dust mass upper limits, typically less than 0.1\nM_earth, when assuming dust continuum is optically thin. Such low-mass gas/dust\ncontent can lead to a disk lifetime estimate (from accretion rates) much\nshorter than the age of the system. To alleviate this timescale discrepancy, we\nsuggest that disks around wide companions might be very compact and optically\nthick, in order to sustain a few Myr of accretion yet have very weak\n(sub)millimeter flux so as to still be elusive to ALMA. Our order-of-magnitude\nestimate shows that compact optically-thick disks might be smaller than 1000\nR_jup and only emit ~micro-Jy of flux in the (sub)millimeter, but their average\ntemperature can be higher than that of circumstellar disks.

We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using\nanalytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We\ninvestigate three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The\nfirst two can release an energy up to $(0.2-1.2) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$, where\n$B_{0}$ is the surface field of the star, $R$ its radius, and $\\mu$ the\nmagnetic permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose\ncoronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by\nplanets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in\nweakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly\nopen field lines at the distance of their planets. The released energy is of\nthe order of $(0.002-0.1) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$ and depends on the ratio of the\nplanetary to the stellar fields, thus allowing an indirect measurement of the\nformer when the latter is known.

Delivery of planetesimals to the\nwhite dwarf by orbiting planets is a leading candidate to explain these\nphenomena. Here, we study systems of planets and planetesimals undergoing\nplanet-planet scattering triggered by the star's post-main sequence mass loss,\nand test whether this can maintain high rates of delivery over the several Gyr\nthat they are observed.

Abstract: Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness\ndistributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition\ndisks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms.

The study is based on the recognition that dust-gas mixtures are\ngenerically unstable to a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI), whenever the gas,\nabsent dust, supports undamped linear modes. We show that the \"streaming\ninstability\" is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides\nsimple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for\nits growth rates and fastest-growing wavelengths. We extend this analysis to\nmore general dust streaming motions and other waves, including buoyancy and\nmagnetohydrodynamic oscillations, finding various new instabilities. Most\nimportantly, we identify the disk \"settling instability,\" which occurs as dust\nsettles vertically into the midplane of a rotating disk. For small grains, this\ninstability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming\ninstability, with a growth rate that is independent of grain size. Growth\ntimescales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disk orbital\nperiod, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude\nlarger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate\nlarger masses). This suggests that in the process of settling, dust will band\ninto rings then filaments or clumps, potentially seeding dust traps,\nhigh-metallicity regions that in turn seed the streaming instability, or even\noverdensities that coagulate or directly collapse to planetesimals. \n\n"}

In addition to the transit features created by\nthe planets, the flux also includes the reflected light component of each\nplanet, which depends on the planetary albedo. This signal is typically\nreferred to as phase curve and could be easily identified if there were no\nadditional noise. As well as instrumental noise, stellar activity, such as\nspots, can create a modulation in the data, which may be very difficult to\ndistinguish from the planetary signal. We analyze the limitations imposed by\nthe stellar activity on the detection of the planetary albedo, considering the\nlimitations imposed by the predicted level of instrumental noise and the short\nduration of the observations planned in the context of the CHEOPS mission. As\ninitial condition, we have assumed that each star is characterized by just one\norbiting planet. We built mock light curves that included a realistic stellar\nactivity pattern, the reflected light component of the planet and an\ninstrumental noise level, which we have chosen to be at the same level as\npredicted for CHEOPS. We then fit these light curves to try to recover the\nreflected light component, assuming the activity patterns can be modeled with a\nGaussian process.We estimate that at least one full stellar rotation is\nnecessary to obtain a reliable detection of the planetary albedo. This result\nis independent of the level of noise, but it depends on the limitation of the\nGaussian process to describe the stellar activity when the light curve\ntime-span is shorter than the stellar rotation. Finally, in presence of typical\nCHEOPS gaps in the simulations, we confirm that it is still possible to obtain\na reliable albedo. \n\n"}

There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such\ndisks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the\nreconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The\nformation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has\ninteresting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and\nplanet formation. \n\n"}

These stellar\natmosphere models incorporate a new equation of state to describe spectral\nfeatures of low-temperature stellar atmospheres. Since T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H]\nshow degeneracies, the surface gravity is determined independently using\nstellar evolutionary models. We derive the stellar parameters for a total of\n300 stars. The fits achieve very good agreement between the PHOENIX models and\nobserved spectra. We estimate that our method provides parameters with\nuncertainties of {sigma} T_eff = 51 K, {sigma} log g = 0.07, and {sigma} [Fe/H]\n= 0.16, and show that atmosphere models for low-mass stars have significantly\nimproved in the last years. Our work also provides an independent test of the\nnew PHOENIX-ACES models, and a comparison for other methods using\nlow-resolution spectra.

To study these effects, dynamical disequilibrium has been\nparameterized using the quench and eddy diffusion approximations, but little\nwork has been done to explore how these approximations perform under realistic\nplanetary conditions in different dynamical regimes. As a first step in\naddressing this problem, we study the localized, small scale convective\ndynamics of planetary atmospheres by direct numerical simulation of fully\ncompressible hydrodynamics with reactive tracers using the Dedalus code. Using\npolytropically-stratified, plane parallel atmospheres in 2- and 3-D, we explore\nthe quenching behavior of different abstract chemical species as a function of\nthe dynamical conditions of the atmosphere as parameterized by the Rayleigh\nnumber. We find that in both 2- and 3-D, chemical species quench deeper than\nwould be predicted based on simple mixing length arguments. Instead, it is\nnecessary to employ length scales based on the chemical equilibrium profile of\nthe reacting species in order to predict quench points and perform chemical\nkinetics modeling in 1-D. Based on the results of our simulations, we provide a\nnew length scale, derived from the chemical scale height, which can be used to\nperform these calculations. This length scale is simple to calculate from known\nchemical data and makes reasonable predictions for our dynamical simulations. \n\n"}

Using spectroscopic metallicities, we\nshow that stars hosting Jupiter analogues have an average metallicity close to\nsolar, in contrast to their hot-Jupiter and eccentric cool Jupiter\ncounterparts, which orbit stars with super-solar metallicities. Furthermore,\nthe eccentricities of Jupiter analogues increase with host star metallicity,\nsuggesting that planet-planet scatterings producing highly eccentric cool\nJupiters could be more common in metal-rich environments. To investigate a\npossible explanation for these metallicity trends, we compare the observations\nto numerical simulations, which indicate that metal-rich stars typically form\nmultiple Jupiters, leading to planet-planet interactions and, hence, a\nprevalence of either eccentric cool Jupiters or hot-Jupiters with circularized\norbits.

The rates of tidal dissipation and tidal\nevolution of orbits are estimated, assuming an Earth-like rheology for the\nplanets. We find that under this assumption the planets b, d, e were captured\nin the 3:2 or higher spin-orbit resonances during the initial spin-down but\nslipped further down into the 1:1 resonance. Dependent on its rheology, the\ninnermost planet b may be captured in a stable pseudosynchronous rotation.\nNon-synchronous rotation ensures higher levels of tidal dissipation and\ninternal heating. The positive feedback between the viscosity and the\ndissipation rate -- and the ensuing runaway heating -- are terminated by a few\nself-regulation processes. When the temperature is high and the viscosity is\nlow enough, the planet spontaneously leaves the 3:2 resonance. Further heating\nis stopped either by passing the peak dissipation or by the emergence of\npartial melt in the mantle.

Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such\nstars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s.

We study how Jupiter-mass\nplanet-seeds (termed protoplanets) evolve in massive, but gravitationally\nstable (Q>1.5), discs using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc. Thereafter, it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer\ntimescale or starts migrating outwards. Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time). Due to the high gas accretion\nrate, the protoplanet generally grows above the deuterium-burning mass-limit.\nProtoplanet radiative feedback reduces its mass growth so that its final mass\nis near the brown dwarf-planet boundary.

Substantially warmer hot Jupiter exoplanets readily allow detections of\nH2O via transmission spectroscopy, but such signatures are often diminished by\nthe presence of clouds made of other species. In contrast, highly scattering\nH2O clouds can brighten planets in reflected light, enhancing molecular\nsignatures. Here, we present an extensive parameter space survey of the\nprominence of H2O absorption features in reflection spectra of cool (Teff<400K)\ngiant exoplanetary atmospheres.

We find prominent H2O\nfeatures around 0.94um, 0.83um, and across a wide spectral region from\n0.4-0.73um. The 0.94um feature is only detectable where high-altitude water\nclouds brighten the planet: T~150K, g>~20m/s^2, fsed>~3, m<~10xsolar.

High fsed enhances H2O features\naround 0.94um, and enables them to be detected at lower temperatures. High m\nresults in dampened H2O absorption features, due to H2O vapour condensing to\nform bright optically thick clouds that dominate the continuum.

Metallicities alone are\npossible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with\nthe literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,\nparticularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open\ncluster NGC 188, however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar\nisochrones. The ages derived for the cluster stars vary with evolutionary\nstage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant branch, and\nmetallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary\nappreciably depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation.\nWe identify the causes of these mismatches and show that improvements are\nneeded in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the creation and\ncalibration of synthetic near-UV photometry. Our results warn against applying\nisochrone fitting indiscriminately. In particular, the uncertainty on the\nstellar models should be quantitatively taken into account. Further efforts to\nimprove the models will result in significant advancements in our ability to\nstudy the Galaxy. \n\n"}

To date, simulation softwares have been\ndeveloped by individual researchers or research groups in each field, with a\nhuge amount of time and effort, even though numerical algorithms used are very\nsimilar. To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran. In order to support arbitrary\ndata types of particle in Fortran, we design the Fortran interface layer as\nfollows. Based on a given derived data type in Fortran representing particle, a\nPython script provided by us automatically generates a library that manipulates\nthe C++ core part of FDPS. This library is seen as a Fortran module providing\nAPI of FDPS from the Fortran side and uses C programs internally to\ninteroperate Fortran with C++. In this way, we have overcome several technical\nissues when emulating `template' in Fortran. By using the Fortran interface,\nusers can develop all parts of their codes in Fortran. We show that the\noverhead of the Fortran interface part is sufficiently small and a code written\nin Fortran shows a performance practically identical to the one written in C++. \n\n"}

This polarization feature is\ngenerally believed to be due to an inner aspherical core revealed in the late\nphase, while this polarization feature can also be contributed by the effect of\npolarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN. In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization\nincreases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally\nhigher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily\ndistinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which\npredicts almost no wavelength dependence. Moreover, we show that multi-band\npolarimetric observations for SNe IIP can constrain a parameter space in the CS\ndust mass and distance from the SNe. We thus encourage multi-band polarimetric\nobservations for SNe IIP. \n\n"}

Rapid recycling of the envelope\ngas of planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc has been proposed to delay the\ncooling and following accretion of disc gas. We compare isothermal and\nnon-isothermal 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet to\ninvestigate the influence on the feasibility of the recycling mechanism.\nRadiative cooling is implemented by using the beta cooling model. We find that,\nin either case, gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves\nthrough the midplane regions, or vice versa when disc gas rotates\nsub-Keplerian. However, in contrast to the isothermal case where the recycling\nflow reaches the deeper part of the envelope, the inflow is inhibited from\nreaching the deep envelope in the non-isothermal case. Once the atmosphere\nstarts cooling, buoyant force prevents the high-entropy disc gas from intruding\nthe low-entropy atmosphere.

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived.

The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

This paper focuses on the mid-IR\nspectral region between 9.7 um to 40 um for T Tauri stars. The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be\noptically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult.\nWe find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc\nsurface is important for the line formation. We briefly discuss the effects of\nC/O ratio and choice of chemical rate network on these results. Our analysis\noffers new ways to infer the chemical and temperature structure of T Tauri\ndiscs from future JWST/MIRI observations, and to possibly detect secondary\nilluminated disc walls based on their specific mid-IR molecular signature. \n\n"}

The planets are\nlikely involved in dynamically robust Laplace resonance chain. Hypothetical\nplanets with masses below the current detection limit of 0.1-3 Jupiter masses,\nwithin the observed inner, or beyond the outer orbit, respectively, do not\ninfluence the long term stability of the system.

Stellar orbits can be quantified by three dynamical\nactions, J_r, L_z, and J_z, which provide measures of the orbital eccentricity,\nguiding radius, and non-planarity, respectively. Changes in these dynamical\nactions over time reflect the strength and efficiency of the evolutionary\nprocesses that drive stellar redistributions. We examine how dynamical actions\nof stars are correlated with their age using two samples of stars with\nwell-determined ages: 78 solar twin stars (with ages to ~5%) and 4376 stars\nfrom the APOKASC2 sample (~20%). We compute actions using spectroscopic radial\nvelocities from previous surveys and parallax and proper motion measurements\nfrom Gaia DR2. We find weak gradients in all actions with stellar age, of (7.51\n+/- 0.52, -29.0 +/- 1.83, 1.54 +/- 0.18) kpc km/s/Gyr for J_r, L_z, and J_z,\nrespectively. There is, however, significant scatter in the action-age\nrelation. We caution that our results will be affected by the restricted\nspatial extent of our sample, particularly in the case of J_z. Nevertheless,\nthese action-age gradients and their associated variances provide strong\nconstraints on the efficiency of the mechanisms that drive the redistribution\nof stellar orbits over time and demonstrate that actions are informative as to\nstellar age. The shallow action-age gradients combined with the large\ndispersion in each action at a given age, however, renders the prospect of age\ninference from orbits of individual stars bleak. Using the precision\nmeasurements of [Fe/H] and [$\\alpha$/Fe] for our stars we investigate the\nabundance-action relationship and find weak correlations.

Exomoons will contribute to exoplanetary signals but are virtually\nundetectable with current methods. Aims: We identify and analyse traces of\nexomoons in the temporal variation of total and polarised fluxes of starlight\nreflected by an Earth-like exoplanet and its spatially unresolved moon across\nall phase angles, with both orbits viewed in an edge-on geometry. Methods: We\ncompute the total and linearly polarised fluxes, and the degree of linear\npolarization P of starlight that is reflected by the exoplanet with its moon\nalong their orbits, accounting for the temporal variation of the visibility of\nthe planetary and lunar disks, and including effects of mutual transits and\nmutual eclipses.

Polarization P shows regular peaks due to planetary transits and\nlunar eclipses, and P can increase and/or slightly decrease during lunar\ntransits and planetary eclipses. Changes in F and P will depend on the radii of\nthe planet and moon, on their reflective properties, and their orbits, and are\nabout one magnitude smaller than the smooth background signals.

The modeling of\nthe RV variations, with a semi-amplitude of K = 2.85-0.25/+0.16m/s yields a\nNeptune-like planet with a minimum mass of 12.2-1.4/+1.0 M_{Earth} on a\n105.90-0.10/+0.09d circumprimary orbit, which is partly located in the host\nstar's habitable zone.

Here we present\nthe combined results of ALMA (0.9 mm) and VLA (7 mm) dust continuum\nobservations toward the protoplanetary disk around the solar analogue GM Aur.\nBoth images clearly resolve the $\\sim$35 au inner cavity. The ALMA observations\nalso reveal a fainter disk that extends up to $\\sim250$ au. We model our\nobservations using two approaches: an analytical fit to the observed\ndeprojected visibilities, and a physical disk model that fits the SED as well\nas the VLA and ALMA observations. Despite not being evident in the deconvolved\nimages, the VLA and ALMA visibilities can only be fitted with two bright rings\nof radii $\\sim$40 and $\\sim$80 au. Our physical model indicates that this\nmorphology is the result of an accumulation or trapping of large dust grains,\nprobably due to the presence of two pressure bumps in the disk. Even though\nalternative mechanisms cannot be discarded, the multiple rings suggest that\nforming planets may have cleared at least two gaps in the disk. Finally, our\nanalysis suggests that the inner cavity might display different sizes at 0.9 mm\nand 7 mm. This discrepancy could be caused by the presence of free-free\nemission close to the star at 7 mm, or by a more compact accumulation of the\nlarge dust grains at the edge of the cavity. \n\n"}

This effect, typically\nneglected in general circulation models (GCMs), has been suggested as\nexplanation for discrepancies between observed infrared lightcurves and those\npredicted by GCMs: On the nightsides of several hot Jupiters, GCMs predict\noutgoing fluxes that are too large, especially in the Spitzer 4.5 $\\mu$m band.\nWe modified the SPARC/MITgcm to include disequilibrium abundances of CH$_4$, CO\nand H$_2$O by assuming that the CH$_4$/CO ratio is constant throughout the\nsimulation domain. We ran simulations of hot Jupiter HD 189733b with 8\nCH$_4$/CO ratios. In the more likely CO-dominated regime, we find temperature\nchanges $\\geq$50-100 K compared to the equilibrium chemistry case across large\nregions. This effect is large enough to affect predicted emission spectra and\nshould thus be included in GCMs of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures\nbetween 600K and 1300K. We find that spectra in regions with strong methane\nabsorption, including the Spitzer 3.6 and 8 $\\mu$m bands, are strongly impacted\nby disequilibrium abundances.

One\npossible explanation for these observations is a disc warp, which could be\ninduced by a planet on a misaligned orbit. We present three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc\nand a misaligned planet. For low planet masses we show that our simulations\naccurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate\ninclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is\nseparated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet\norbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc.

We find that passive\nregions of disks - i.e. the midplane temperature dominated by irradiation - are\nCOS unstable about one pressure scale height above the midplane and VSI\nunstable at radii $> 10 \\, \\text{au}$. Vortex amplification via SBI should\noperate in most parts of active and passive disks.

Abstract: When and how planets form in protoplanetary disks is still a topic of\ndiscussion. Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now\nproviding results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of\nconfirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the\nsame dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in ~1-3 Myr old\nstar-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates\nof their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and\nmultiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing\nto a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low\nmass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower\nthan the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses\nare comparable or higher than the most massive disks.

Therefore, we use the radiative transfer code LIME to produce\nline images of a $0.17\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ self-gravitating protosolar-like\ndisc. We note the limitations of using LIME and explore methods to improve upon\nthe default gridding. We synthesise noiseless observations to determine the\nsensitivities required to detect the spiral flux, and find that the line flux\ndistribution does not necessarily correlate to the abundance density\ndistribution; hence performing radiative transfer calculations is imperative.\nMoreover, the spiral features are seen in absorption, due to the GI-heated\nmidplane and high extinction, which could be indicative of GI activity.

To trigger this process, it has been\nargued that sedimentation of solids onto the mid-plane needs to be efficient\nand therefore that a quiescent gaseous environment is required. It is often\nsuggested that dead-zone or disk-wind structure created by non-ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects meets this requirement. However,\nsimulations have shown that the midplane of a dead zone is not completely\nquiescent. In order to examine the concentration of solids in such an\nenvironment, we use the local-shearing-box approximation to simulate a\nparticle-gas system with an Ohmic dead zone including mutual drag force between\nthe gas and the solids. We systematically compare the evolution of the system\nwith ideal or non-ideal MHD, with or without back-reaction drag force from\nparticles on gas, and with varying solid abundances. Similar to previous\ninvestigations of dead zone dynamics, we find that particles of dimensionless\nstopping time $\\tau_s=0.1$ do not sediment appreciably more than those in ideal\nmagneto-rotational turbulence, resulting in a vertical scale height an order of\nmagnitude larger than in a laminar disk. Contrary to the expectation that this\nshould curb the formation of planetesimals, we nevertheless find that strong\nclumping of solids still occurs in the dead zone when solid abundances are\nsimilar to the critical value for a laminar environment. This can be explained\nby the weak radial diffusion of particles near the mid-plane. The results imply\nthat the sedimentation of particles to the mid-plane is not a necessary\ncriterion for the formation of planetesimals by the streaming instability. \n\n"}

We focus on the\nstellar wind spinning down the star along its main sequence phase and tidal\ninteraction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent\nsignificant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric\ndescriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to\nintroduce simultaneously ab-initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking\ntorques, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. We\ndevelop a 1D numerical model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking\ninto account stellar structural changes, wind braking and tidal interaction and\nimplement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of the\nstellar rotation assuming a bi-layer internal structure, and of the semi-major\naxis of the orbit.

However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3.

In particular, the\ndust emission consists of a series of narrow and closely spaced rings in the\ninner $\\sim$60 au, two well-separated bright rings in the outer disk, centered\nat 74 and 120 au, and at least two fainter emission features at 90 and 130 au.\nWe model the visibilities with a parametric representation of the radial\nsurface brightness profile, consisting of a central core and 7 concentric\nGaussian rings. Recent hydro-dynamical simulations of low viscosity disks show\nthat super-Earth planets can produce the multiple gaps seen in AS 209\nmillimeter continuum emission.

This level of precision allows researchers\nto measure the loss of light due to exoplanet transits as well as the light\nemitted by an exoplanet, or planetary photometric emissions. The planetary\nphotometric emissions are due to the thermal emissions of the exoplanet, and\nreflected stellar light. In many cases it is assumed that the incident stellar\nlight may be modeled as plane parallel rays. For extremely close-in exoplanets\nthe finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account and the\nplane parallel ray model breaks down. One consequence of modeling the incident\nstellar radiation in this manner is the creation of three distinct zones as\nopposed to the two zones present in the plane parallel ray model. The three\nzones are the fully illuminated, penumbral, and un-illuminated zones. The\nexistence of the penumbral zone means that more than half of the exoplanet will\nbe at least partially illuminated by the host star.

Here\nwe derive analytical solutions to the overshoot of the mid-transit depth caused\nby stellar limb darkening compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate for arbitrary\ntransit impact parameters. In turn, this allows us to compute the true\nplanet-to-star radius ratio from the transit depth for a given parameterization\nof a limb darkening law and for a known transit impact parameter. We calculate\nthe maximum emerging specific stellar intensity covered by the planet in\ntransit and derive analytic solutions for the transit depth overshoot.\nSolutions are presented for the linear, quadratic, square-root, logarithmic,\nand non-linear stellar limb darkening with arbitrary transit impact parameters.\nWe also derive formulae to calculate the average intensity along the transit\nchord, which allows us to estimate the actual transit depth (and therefore\nR_p/R_s) from the mean in-transit flux. The transit depth overshoot of\nexoplanets compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate increases from about 15% for A\nmain-sequence stars to roughly 20% for sun-like stars and some 30% for K and M\nstars.

Nevertheless, assuming that planetary cores are present in\nthe inner disc, we then investigate the accretion of atmospheres onto cores and\ntheir subsequent photoevaporation.

{"id": "1901.05006", "contents": "Title: Formation of Hot Jupiters through Secular Chaos and Dynamical Tides Abstract: The population of giant planets on short-period orbits can potentially be\nexplained by some flavours of high-eccentricity migration. In this paper we\ninvestigate one such mechanism involving \"secular chaos\", in which secular\ninteractions between at least three giant planets push the inner planet to a\nhighly eccentric orbit, followed by tidal circularization and orbital decay. In\naddition to the equilibrium tidal friction, we incorporate dissipation due to\ndynamical tides that are excited inside the giant planet. Using the method of\nGaussian rings to account for planet-planet interactions, we explore the\nconditions for extreme eccentricity excitation via secular chaos and the\nproperties of hot Jupiters formed in this migration channel. Our calculations\nshow that once the inner planet reaches a sufficiently large eccentricity,\ndynamical tides quickly dissipate the orbital energy, producing an eccentric\nwarm Jupiter, which then decays in semi-major axis through equilibrium tides to\nbecome a hot Jupiter. Dynamical tides help the planet avoid tidal disruption,\nincreasing the chance of forming a hot Jupiter, although not all planets\nsurvive the process. We find that the final orbital periods generally lie in\nthe range of 2-3 days, somewhat shorter than those of the observed hot Jupiter\npopulation. We couple the planet migration to the stellar spin evolution to\npredict the final spin-orbit misalignments. The distribution of the\nmisalignment angles we obtain shows a lack of retrograde orbits compared to\nobservations. Our results suggest that high-eccentricity migration via secular\nchaos can only account for a fraction of the observed hot Jupiter population. \n\n"}

Our sample was\nconstructed from stars that have an infrared excess and/or signs of accretion\nand have been classified as Class II. For the binary and higher order multiple\nsystems observed, we detect $\\lambda = 1.3$ mm continuum emission from one or\nmore stars in all of our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of\nTaurus, our 21 new detections increase the fraction of millimeter-detected\ndisks to over 75% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries, and\ncompanions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the\nwealth of other information available for these stars, this has allowed us to\nstudy the impact of multiplicity with a much larger sample. While millimeter\nflux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies, we\nfind that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations\nof 30 to 4200 AU have lower values of millimeter flux as a function of stellar\nmass than single stars. We also find that for these systems, the circumstellar\ndisk around the primary star does not dominate the total disk mass in the\nsystem and contains on average 62% of the total mass. \n\n"}

We develop a Simplified Cometary Concentration Model\n(SCCM) to simulate the evaporation and concentration processes on the cometary\nsurface.We use 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as the benchmark of SCCM. We\ninvestigate the depth of the layer where non-volatile species concentrate after\nthe numerous passages of perihelion after the formation of the Solar System. As\na result, the SCCM explains the observed production rates of water and\nCH$_3$NH$_2$ at 100 comet years. SCCM results suggest that the non-volatile\nspecies would concentrate at depths between 0 and 100cm of comet surface within\n10 comet years. Our results also suggest that the non-volatile species would\nconcentrate several meters beneath the surface before it hit the early Earth.\nThis specific mass of non-volatile species may provide unique chemical\ncondition to the volcanic hot spring pools. \n\n"}

In this work, we present a new technique employing ALMA\nautocorrelation data (obtained simultaneously with the interferometric\nobservations), effectively treating the entire 12-m array as a collection of\nsingle-dish telescopes. Using combined autocorrelation spectra from 28 active\nantennas, we recovered extended HCN coma emission from comet C/2012 S1 (ISON),\nresulting in a fourteen-fold increase in detected line brightness compared with\nthe interferometer. This resulted in the first detection of rotational emission\nfrom H^13CN in this comet. Using a detailed coma radiative transfer model\naccounting for optical depth and non-LTE excitation effects, we obtained an\nH^12CN/H^13CN ratio of 88+-18, which matches the terrestrial value of 89,\nconsistent with a lack of isotopic fractionation in HCN during comet formation\nin the protosolar accretion disk. The possibility of future discoveries in\nextended sources using autocorrelation spectroscopy from the main ALMA array is\nthus demonstrated. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.08719", "contents": "Title: Searching for Super-Fast Rotators Using the Pan-STARRS 1 Abstract: A class of asteroids, called large super-fast rotators (large SFRs), have\nrotation periods shorter than 2 hours and diameters larger than ~ 0.3 km. They\npose challenges to the usual interior rubble-pile structure unless a relatively\nhigh bulk density is assumed. So far, only six large SFRs have been found.\nTherefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1\ntelescopes during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study\ntheir properties. A total of 876 reliable rotation periods are measured, among\nwhich seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory of known large\nSFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations\nin the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the\nlocation preference in the inner main belt of the six perviously known large\nSFRs could be a bias due to various observational limits. Interestingly, five\nout of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.\nConsidering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar\nsurveys (Chang et al., 2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the\nchance of detecting a large SFR in the inner main belt seems to be relatively\nlow. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less large SFRs\nthan the mid main belt. From our survey, we also found the drop in number\nappearing at f > 5 rev/day on the spin-rate distribution for the outer\nmain-belt asteroids of D < 3 km, which was reported for the inner and mid main\nbelt by (Chang et al., 2015, 2016). \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.10386", "contents": "Title: Clumpy dust rings around non-accreting young stars Abstract: We investigate four young, but non-accreting, very low mass stars in Orion,\nwhich show irregular eclipses by circumstellar dust. The eclipses are not\nrecurring periodically, are variable in depth, lack a flat bottom, and their\nduration is comparable to the typical timescale between eclipses. The dimming\nis associated with reddening consistent with dust extinction. Taken together\nthis implies the presence of rings around these four stars, with radii ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 40 AU, comprised of optically thin dust clouds. The stars also\nshow IR excess indicating the presence of evolved circumstellar disks, with\norders of magnitude more material than needed for the eclipses. However, the\nrings need to cover an opening angle of about 20 degrees to explain how common\nthese variable stars are in the coeval population in the same region, which is\nmore extended than a typical disk. Thus, we propose that the rings may not be\npart of the disks, but instead separate structures with larger scale heights.\nTo be sustained over years, the rings need to be replenished by dust from the\ndisk or gravitationally bound to an object (e.g., planets or planetesimals).\nThese four stars belong to a growing and diverse class of post-T Tauri stars\nwith dips or eclipses in their lightcurves. Dusty rings with scale heights\nexceeding those of disks may be a common phenomenon at stellar ages between 5\nand 10 Myr, in the transition from accretion disks to debris disks. These\nstructures could be caused by migrating planets and may be signposts for the\npresence of young planetary systems. \n\n"}
