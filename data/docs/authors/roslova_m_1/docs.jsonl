The momentum- and excitation\nenergy dependence of the anomalous high-energy dispersion, termed \"waterfalls\",\nis covered in full detail. Finally, the work describes the relation of ARPES\nwith other experimental methods, such as INS spectroscopy. For the optimally\ndoped bilayer Bi-based cuprate, the renormalized two-particle correlation\nfunction in the superconducting state is calculated from ARPES data within an\nitinerant model based on the random phase approximation (RPA). Additionally,\ntwo other applications of the same approach are briefly sketched: the relation\nof ARPES to FT-STS, and the nesting properties of Fermi surfaces in\ntwo-dimensional charge density wave compounds. \n\n"}

The theory assumes local SDW order, and associated electron and\nhole pocket Fermi surfaces of charge carriers in the normal state. We describe\nquantum and thermal fluctuations in the orientation of the local SDW order,\nwhich lead to d-wave superconductivity: we compute the superconducting critical\ntemperature and magnetic field in a `minimal' universal theory. We also\ndescribe the back-action of the superconductivity on the SDW order, showing\nthat SDW order is more stable in the metal. Our results capture key aspects of\nthe phase diagram of Demler et al. (cond-mat/0103192) obtained in a\nphenomenological quantum theory of competing orders. Finally, we propose a\nfinite temperature crossover phase diagram for the cuprates.

Specifically, we incorporate the presence\nof a Bloch/Neel domain walls and conical ferromagnetism, including spin-active\ninterfaces. The superconducting leads are assumed to be of s-wave type. We\ninvestigate how the 0-$\\pi$ transition is influenced by the inhomogeneous\nmagnetization texture and focus on the particular case where the charge-current\nvanishes while the spin-current is non-zero. In the case of a Bloch/Neel\ndomain-wall, the spin-current can be seen only for one component of the spin\npolarization, whereas in the case of conical ferromagnetism the spin-current\nhas the three components. We explain all of these results in terms of the\ninterplay between the triplet anomalous Green's function induced in the\nferromagnetic region and the local direction of the magnetization vector in the\nferromagnet.

The gravity dual that we employ is the ${\\rm\nAdS}_5$ Soliton background at zero temperature. We first analyze the normal\nmodes associated to the superconducting order parameter which are purely real\nsince the background has no horizon. We then study the full time evolution of\nthe order parameter after a quench. For sufficiently a weak and slow\nperturbation we show that the order parameter undergoes simple undamped\noscillations in time with a frequency that agrees with the lowest normal model\ncomputed previously. This is expected as the soliton background has no horizon\nand therefore, at least in the probe and large $N$ limits considered, the\nsystem will never return to equilibrium. For stronger and more abrupt\nperturbations higher normal modes are excited and the pattern of oscillations\nbecomes increasingly intricate. We identify a range of parameters for which the\ntime evolution of the order parameter become quasi chaotic. The details of the\nchaotic evolution depend on the type of perturbation used. Therefore it is\nplausible to expect that it is possible to engineer a perturbation that leads\nto the almost complete destruction of the oscillating pattern and consequently\nto quasi equilibration induced by superposition of modes with different\nfrequencies. \n\n"}

In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics.

In this\nsituation, small changes in the intra-pocket and inter-pocket interactions due\nto renormalizations by high-energy fermions give rise to a variety of different\ngap structures. We find four different configurations of the s-wave gap\nimmediately below Tc: the one in which superconducting gap changes sign between\ntwo inner hole pockets and between the outer hole pocket and two electron\npockets, the one in which the gap changes sign between two electron pockets and\nthree hole pockets, the one in which the gap on the outer hole pocket differs\nin sign from the gaps on the other four pockets, and the one in which the gaps\non two inner hole pockets have one sign, and the gaps on the outer hole pockets\nand on electron pockets have different sign. Different s-wave gap\nconfigurations emerge depending on whether the renormalized interactions\nincrease attraction within each subset or increase the coupling between\nparticular components of the two subsets.

The most remarkable characteristics in LiFeAs gap structure\nwould be that \"the largest gap emerges on the tiny hole-pockets around Z\npoint\".

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum.

The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties.

Recent experimental studies on a hole-doped version of BEDT\ncompounds reveal an enhancement of superconductivity and a rapid crossover\nbetween two different conducting phases above the superconducting dome. One of\nthese phases is a Fermi liquid, the other not. Using plaquette cellular\ndynamical mean field theory with state of the art continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations, we study this problem with the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel on the anisotropic triangular lattice. Phase diagrams as a function of\ntemperature $T$ and interaction strength $U/t$ are obtained for anisotropy\nparameters $t'=0.4t$, $t'=0.8t$ and various fillings. As for cuprates, we find,\nat finite doping, a first-order transition between two normal-state phases. For\n$T$ above the critical point of the first-order transition, there is a Widom\nline where crossovers occur. The results are in broad agreement with\nexperiment. This suggests that for compounds with intermediate to high\nfrustration, very light-doping should reveal the first-order transition and\nassociated crossovers. These crossovers could leave traces in the\nsuperconducting phase. We also predict that destroying the superconducting\nphase by a magnetic field should reveal the first-order transition. Finally, we\npredict that electron-doping should also lead to an increased range of $U/t$\nfor superconductivity but with a reduced maximum $T_c$. This work also clearly\nshows that the superconducting dome here is tied to the Mott transition and its\ncontinuation as a transition separating pseudogap phase from correlated metal\nin doped compounds, as in the cuprates. Contrary to heavy fermions for example,\nthe maximum $T_c$ is definitely not attached to an antiferromagnetic quantum\ncritical point. \n\n"}

The pseudogap appears as a\ndepression of the frequency dependent conductivity in the c-axis direction and\nseems to be related to a real gap in the density of states. It can also be seen\nin the Knight shift, photoemission and tunneling experiments. In underdoped\nsamples it appears near room temperature and does not close with temperature.\nAnother related phenomenon that has been studied by infrared is the depression\nin the ab-plane scattering rate. Two separate effects can be discerned. At high\ntemperatures there is broad depression of scattering below 1000 cm-1 which may\nbe related to the gap in the density of states. At a lower temperature a\nsharper structure is seen, which appears to be associated with scattering from\na mode at 300 cm-1, and which governs the carrier life time at low\ntemperatures. This mode shows up in a number of other experiments, as a kink in\nARPES dispersion, and a resonance at 41 meV in magnetic neutron scattering.\nSince the infrared technique can be used on a wide range of samples it has\nprovided evidence that the scattering mode is present in all high temperature\ncuprates and that its frequency in optimally doped materials scales with the\nsuperconducting transition temperature. The lanthanum and neodymium based\ncuprates do not follow this scaling and appear to have depressed transition\ntemperatures. \n\n"}
