We obtain sharp dispersive and Strichartz estimates for a\nlarge family of admissible pairs. As a first consequence, we get strong\nwell-posedness results for NLS. Specifically, for small intial data, we prove\n$L^2$ and $H^1$ global well-posedness for any subcritical nonlinearity (in\ncontrast with the Euclidean case) and with no gauge invariance assumption on\nthe nonlinearity $F$. On the other hand, if $F$ is gauge invariant, $L^2$\ncharge is conserved and hence, as in the Euclidean case, it is possible to\nextend local $L^2$ solutions to global ones. The corresponding argument in\n$H^1$ requires the conservation of energy, which holds under the stronger\ncondition that $F$ is defocusing. Recall that global well-posedness in the\ngauge invariant case was already proved by Banica, Carles & Staffilani, for\nsmall radial $L^2$ data and for large radial $H^1$ data. The second important\napplication of our global Strichartz estimates is \"scattering\" for NLS both in\n$L^2$ and in $H^1$, with no radial or gauge invariance assumption. Notice that,\nin the Euclidean case, this is only possible for the critical power\n$\\gamma=1+\\frac4n$ and can be false for subcritical powers while, on hyperbolic\nspaces, global existence and scattering of small $L^2$ solutions holds for all\npowers $1<\\gamma\\le1+\\frac4n$.

One of the principal reasons for the\nimportance of PSWFs is that they are a natural and efficient tool for computing\nwith bandlimited functions, that frequently occur in the abovementioned areas.\nThis is due to the fact that PSWFs are the eigenfunctions of the integral\noperator, that represents timelimiting followed by lowpassing.\n  Needless to say, the behavior of this operator is governed by the decay rate\nof its eigenvalues. Therefore, investigation of this decay rate plays a crucial\nrole in the related theory and applications - for example, in construction of\nquadratures, interpolation, filter design, etc.\n  The significance of PSWFs and, in particular, of the decay rate of the\neigenvalues of the associated integral operator, was realized at least half a\ncentury ago.

The new framework allows for the\nmodelling of populations consisting of competing strategies carried by\nindividuals who change across their life cycle. Firstly the discretization of\nthe McKendrick von Foerster model is derived. It is shown that the Euler--Lotka\nequation is satisfied when the new model reaches a steady state (i.e. stable\nfrequencies between the age classes). This discretization consists of the unit\nage classes and the timescale is chosen that only a fraction of individuals\nplay single game round. This implies linear dynamics within single time unit\nwhen individuals not killed during game round are moved from one age class to\nanother. Since its local linear behaviour the system is equivalent to large\nBernadelli-Lewis-Leslie matrix. Then the methodology of multipopulation games\nis used for the derivation of two, mutually equivalent systems of equations.\nThe first contains equations describing the evolution of the strategy\nfrequencies in the whole population completed by subsystems of equations\ndescribing the evolution of the age structure for each strategy. The second\nsystem contains equations describing the changes of the general population's\nage structure, completed with subsystems of equations describing the selection\nof the strategies within each age class. Then the obtained system of replicator\ndynamics is presented in the form of the mixed ODE-PDE system.

In\nthis case, the linearized system does qualitatively capture the dynamics in a\nsmall neighborhood of the hyperbolic steady state. However, one is often forced\nto consider non-hyperbolic steady states, for example in the context of\nbifurcation theory. A geometric technique to desingularize non-hyperbolic\npoints is the blow-up method. The classical case of the method is motivated by\ndesingularization techniques arising in algebraic geometry. The idea is to blow\nup the steady state to a sphere or a cylinder. In the blown-up space, one is\nthen often able to gain additional hyperbolicity at steady states. In this\npaper, we discuss an explicit example where we replace the sphere in the\nblow-up by hyperbolic space. It is shown that the calculations work in the\nhyperbolic space case as for the spherical case. This approach may be even\nslightly more convenient if one wants to work with directional charts.

TDM is a composite made by cold forging a mix of\nrubber fibers and grains, obtained by grinding scrap tires, and polyurethane\nbinder. The mechanical properties are highly influenced by the presence of\nvoids associated with the granular composition and low tensile strength due to\nthe weak connection at the grain-matrix interface. For these reasons, TDM use\nis restricted to applications concerning a limited range of deformations.\nExperimental tests show that a central feature of the response is connected to\nhighly nonlinear behavior of the material under volumetric deformation which\nconventional hyperelastic models fail in predicting. The strain energy function\npresented here is a variant of the exponentiated Hencky strain energy proposed\nby Neff et al., which for moderate strains is as good as the quadratic Hencky\nmodel and in the large strain region improves several important features from a\nmathematical point of view. The proposed form of the exponentiated Hencky\nenergy possesses a set of parameters uniquely determined in the infinitesimal\nstrain regime and an orthogonal set of parameters to determine the nonlinear\nresponse. The hyperelastic model is additionally incorporated in a finite\ndeformation viscoelasticity framework that accounts for the two main\ndissipation mechanisms in TDMs, one at the microscale level and one at the\nmacroscale level.

The method is applied to\ntwo problems on the border of fractal geometry and additive combinatorics.\nFirst, we consider attractors $X$ of compact families $\\Phi$ of similarities of\n$\\mathbb{R}$.

Given a prototype $\\gamma$, we consider the\nsystem \\[\\Psi_{c}=(L_{c\\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\\gamma^{[i]})_{i\\in\nI,k\\in\\Bbb{Z}^d}\\text{ with }\\gamma^{[i]}=|\\det T_i|^{1/2}\\,\nM_{b_i}(\\gamma\\circ T_i^T),\\] with translation $L_x$ and modulation $M_{\\xi}$.\nWe provide verifiable conditions on $\\gamma$ under which $\\Psi_c$ forms a\nBanach frame or an atomic decomposition for $\\D$, for small enough sampling\ndensity $c>0$. Our theory allows compactly supported prototypes and applies for\narbitrary $p,q\\in(0,\\infty]$.\n  Often, $\\Psi_c$ is both a Banach frame and an atomic decomposition, so that\nanalysis sparsity is equivalent to synthesis sparsity, i.e. the analysis\ncoefficients $(\\langle f,L_{c\\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\\gamma^{[i]}\\rangle)_{i,k}$ lie in\n$\\ell^p$ iff $f$ belongs to a certain decomposition space, iff\n$f=\\sum_{i,k}c_k^{(i)}\\cdot L_{c\\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\\gamma^{[i]}$ with\n$(c_k^{(i)})_{i,k}\\in\\ell^p$. This is convenient if only analysis sparsity is\nknown to hold: Generally, this only yields synthesis sparsity w.r.t. the dual\nframe, about which often only little is known. But our theory yields synthesis\nsparsity w.r.t. the well-understood primal frame.\n  In particular, our theory applies to $\\alpha$-modulation spaces and inhom.\nBesov spaces.

We show that the addits form a Hilbert space whose\ncodimension-one subspace of `roots' is isomorphic to the index space of the\nArveson system, and that the addits generate the type I part of the Arveson\nsystem. Consequently the isomorphism class of the Hilbert space of addits is\nindependent of the reference unit. The addits of a pointed inclusion system are\nshown to be in natural correspondence with the addits of the generated pointed\nproduct system. The theory of amalgamated products is developed using addits\nand roots, and an explicit formula for the amalgamation of pointed Arveson\nsystems is given, providing a new proof of its independence of the particular\nreference units.

Next, we develop a substitute for some classical\nestimates on harmonic measure in nontangentially accessible domains that works\nin semi-uniform domains.\n  We also show that semi-uniform domains with uniformly rectifiable boundary\nhave big pieces of chord-arc subdomains. We cannot hope for big pieces of\nLipschitz subdomains (as was shown for chord-arc domains by David and Jerison\n\\cite{DJ90}) due to an example of Hrycak, which we review in the appendix.\n  Finally, we combine these tools to study the $A_{\\infty}$-property of\nharmonic measure.

In addition, the underlying tensor field introduces an anisotropy\nleading to complex patterns which do not occur in isotropic models. Central to\nthis pattern formation are straight line patterns.

The\napproach was introduced by the author and Jos\\'e L.~Torrea in 2009\n(arXiv:0910.2569v1). The aim of this chapter is to show how the method works in\nthe particular case of the fractional Laplacian $L^s=(-\\Delta)^s$, $0<s<1$. The\nstarting point is the semigroup formula for the fractional Laplacian. From\nhere, the classical heat kernel permits us to obtain the pointwise formula for\n$(-\\Delta)^su(x)$. One of the key advantages is that our technique relies on\nthe use of heat kernels, which allows for applications in settings where the\nFourier transform is not the most suitable tool. In addition, it provides\nexplicit constants that are key to prove, under minimal conditions on $u$, the\nvalidity of the pointwise limits $$\\lim_{s\\to1^-}(-\\Delta)^su(x)=-\\Delta\nu(x)\\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad\\lim_{s\\to0^+}(-\\Delta)^su(x)=u(x).$$ The formula for\nthe solution to the Poisson problem $(-\\Delta)^su=f$ is found through the\nsemigroup approach as the inverse of the fractional Laplacian\n$u(x)=(-\\Delta)^{-s}f(x)$ (fundamental solution).

Finite\nconsecutive subsequences of biorthogonal polynomials (`windows'), of lengths\nequal to the degrees of the potentials, satisfy systems of ODE's with\npolynomial coefficients as well as PDE's (deformation equations) with respect\nto the coefficients of the potentials and recursion relations connecting\nconsecutive windows.

We begin by presenting new and more accurate numerical\nreconstructions of the $N$-soliton by inverse scattering (numerical linear\nalgebra) for N=5, 10, 20, and 40. We then recast the inverse-scattering problem\nas a Riemann-Hilbert problem and provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of this\nproblem in the large-N limit. For those $(x,t)$ where results have been\nobtained by other authors, we improve the error estimates from $O(N^{-1/3})$ to\n$O(N^{-1})$. We also analyze the Fourier power spectrum in this regime and\nrelate the results to the optical phenomenon of supercontinuum generation. We\nthen study the $N$-soliton for values of $(x,t)$ where analysis has not been\ncarried out before, and we uncover new phenomena. The main discovery of this\npaper is the mathematical mechanism for a secondary caustic (phase transition),\nwhich turns out to differ from the mechanism that generates the primary\ncaustic. The mechanism for the generation of the secondary caustic depends\nessentially on the discrete nature of the spectrum for the $N$-soliton, and\nmore significantly, cannot be recovered from an analysis of an ostensibly\nsimilar Riemann-Hilbert problem in the conditions of which a certain formal\ncontinuum limit is taken on an {\\em ad hoc} basis \n\n"}
