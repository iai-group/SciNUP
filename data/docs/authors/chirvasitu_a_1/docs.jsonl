We show that for a broad class of\nderived stacks, called perfect stacks, algebraic and geometric operations on\ntheir categories of sheaves are compatible.

The product in G gives rise to a coproduct on A making it a\nmultiplier Hopf algebra. In fact, because there exist integrals, we get an\nalgebraic quantum group.\n  Now let H be a finite subgroup of G and consider the subalgebra of functions\nin A that are constant on double cosets of H. The coproduct in general will not\nleave this algebra invariant but we can modify it so that it will leave the\nsubalgebra invariant (in the sense that the image is in the multiplier algebra\nof the tensor product of this subalgebra with itself). However, the modified\ncoproduct on the subalgebra will no longer be an algebra map. So, in general we\ndo not have an algebraic quantum group but a so-called algebraic quantum\nhypergroup.\n  Group-like projections in a *-algebraic quantum group A give rise, in a\nnatural way, to *-algebraic quantum hypergroups, very much like subgroups do as\nabove for a *-algebraic quantum group associated to a group. In this paper we\npush this result further. On the one hand, we no longer assume the *-structure\nwhile on the other hand, we allow the group-like projection to belong to the\nmultiplier algebra M(A) of A and not only to A itself. Doing so, we not only\nget some well-known earlier examples of algebraic quantum hypergroups but also\nsome interesting new ones. \n\n"}

Our second result is an explicit formula\nfor the character of an irreducible minimal support module in type A_{n-1} for\nc=m/n, and an expression of its quasispherical part (i.e., the isotypic part of\n\"hooks\") in terms of the HOMFLY polynomial of a torus knot colored by a Young\ndiagram. We use this formula and the work of Calaque, Enriquez and Etingof to\ngive explicit formulas for the characters of the irreducible equivariant\nD-modules on the nilpotent cone for SL_m. Our third result is the construction\nof the Koszul-BGG complex for the rational Cherednik algebra, which generalizes\nthe construction of the Koszul-BGG resolution by Berest-Etingof-Ginzburg and\nGordon, and the calculation of its homology in type A.

The simplest example comes from the fixed points of a group\naction $M^G \\subset M$, and subfactors can be thought of as fixed points of\nmore general group-like algebraic structures. These algebraic structures are\nclosely related to tensor categories and have played important roles in knot\ntheory, quantum groups, statistical mechanics, and topological quantum field\ntheory. There's a measure of size of a subfactor, called the index. Remarkably\nthe values of the index below 4 are quantized, which suggests that it may be\npossible to classify subfactors of small index. Subfactors of index at most 4\nwere classified in the '80s and early '90s. The possible index values above 4\nare not quantized, but once you exclude a certain family it turns out that\nagain the possibilities are quantized.

Abstract: For a large class of geometric objects, the passage to categories of\nquasi-coherent sheaves provides an embedding in the 2-category of abelian\ntensor categories. The notion of weakly Tannakian categories introduced by the\nauthor gives a characterization of tensor categories in the image of this\nembedding.\n  However, this notion requires additional structure to be present, namely a\nfiber functor. For the case of classical Tannakian categories in characteristic\nzero, Deligne has found intrinsic properties - expressible entirely within the\nlanguage of tensor categories - which are necessary and sufficient for the\nexistence of a fiber functor. In this paper we generalize Deligne's result to\nweakly Tannakian categories in characteristic zero. The class of geometric\nobjects whose tensor categories of quasi-coherent sheaves can be recognized in\nthis manner includes both the gerbes arising in classical Tannaka duality and\nmore classical geometric objects such as projective varieties over a field of\ncharacteristic zero.\n  Our proof uses a different perspective on fiber functors, which we formalize\nthrough the notion of geometric tensor categories.

In the sufficiently\npath connected case this is achieved by much the same construction employed in\nconstructing 1-covers, i.e. quotients of the path space by a groupoid.

Here we come to the notion of weak\nequivalence of gradings: two gradings are weakly equivalent if there exists an\nisomorphism between the graded algebras that maps each graded component onto a\ngraded component. The following question arises naturally: when a group grading\non a finite dimensional algebra is weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite\ngroup? It turns out that this question can be reformulated purely group\ntheoretically in terms of the universal group of the grading. Namely, a grading\nis weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite group if and only if the\nuniversal group of the grading is residually finite with respect to a special\nsubset of the grading group. The same is true for all the coarsenings of the\ngrading if and only if the universal group of the grading is hereditarily\nresidually finite with respect to the same subset. We show that if $n\\geqslant\n349$, then on the full matrix algebra $M_n(F)$ there exists an elementary group\ngrading that is not weakly equivalent to any grading by a finite (semi)group,\nand if $n\\leqslant 3$, then any elementary grading on $M_n(F)$ is weakly\nequivalent to an elementary grading by a finite group. \n\n"}

I Abstract: Verma modules of superconfomal algebras can have singular vector spaces with\ndimensions greater than 1. Following a method developed for the Virasoro\nalgebra by Kent, we introduce the concept of adapted orderings on\nsuperconformal algebras. We prove several general results on the ordering\nkernels associated to the adapted orderings and show that the size of an\nordering kernel implies an upper limit for the dimension of a singular vector\nspace. We apply this method to the topological N=2 algebra and obtain the\nmaximal dimensions of the singular vector spaces in the topological Verma\nmodules: 0, 1, 2 or 3 depending on the type of Verma module and the type of\nsingular vector. As a consequence we prove the conjecture of Gato-Rivera and\nRosado on the possible existing types of topological singular vectors (4 in\nchiral Verma modules and 29 in complete Verma modules). Interestingly, we have\nfound two-dimensional spaces of singular vectors at level 1. Finally, by using\nthe topological twists and the spectral flows, we also obtain the maximal\ndimensions of the singular vector spaces for the Neveu-Schwarz N=2 algebra (0,\n1 or 2) and for the Ramond N=2 algebra (0, 1, 2 or 3). \n\n"}

Therefore, spaces of\nsingular vectors may be two-dimensional for complete Verma modules whilst for\nG-closed Verma modules they can only be one-dimensional. We give all singular\nvectors for the levels 1/2, 1, and 3/2 for both complete Verma modules and\nG-closed Verma modules.
