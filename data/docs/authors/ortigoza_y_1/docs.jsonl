Due to the extra friction term\nintroduced in the inflaton background evolution generated by the dissipative\ndynamics, inflation can take place generically for smaller values of the field,\nand larger values of couplings and masses. When the dissipative dynamics\ndominates over the expansion, in the so-called strong dissipative regime,\ninflation proceeds with sub-planckian inflaton values. Models can be naturally\nembedded into a supergravity framework, with sugra corrections suppressed by\nthe Planck mass now under control, for a larger class of K\\\"ahler potentials.\nIn particular, this provides a simpler solution to the \"eta\" problem in\nsupersymmetric hybrid inflation, without restricting the K\\\"ahler potentials\ncompatible with inflation.

We discuss how the\npossible non-unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix may modify these relations\nand find in particular that corrections due to non-unitarity can exceed the\ncorrections due to mass splitting. We furthermore investigate constraints from\nneutrino-less double beta decay on mass and mixing parameters of heavy\nneutrinos in the type I see-saw mechanism.

A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat. For a certain value of the new coupling in the\n(N)MSSM, the K\\\"{a}hler potential is special, because it can be associated with\na certain shift symmetry for the Higgs doublets, a generalization of the shift\nsymmetry for singlets in earlier models.

We consider several implementations of\nthis idea. In one model, mass mixing is temporarily induced during a two-stage\nelectroweak phase transition in a two Higgs doublet model. In the other class\nof models, mass mixing is induced by large field vacuum expectation values at\nhigh temperatures - either moduli fields or even more generic kinetic terms.\nMass mixing models of this type can readily accommodate asymmetric dark matter\nmasses ranging from 1 GeV to 100 TeV and expand the scope of possible\nrelationships between the dark and visible sectors in such models. \n\n"}

One key technology for such\narrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many sensors\nsimultaneously on the same set of wires. This paper describes a\nfrequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for and\ndeployed on the APEX-SZ and South Pole Telescope millimeter wavelength\nreceivers. In this system, the detector array is divided into modules of seven\ndetectors, and each bolometer within the module is biased with a unique ~MHz\nsinusoidal carrier such that the individual bolometer signals are well\nseparated in frequency space. The currents from all bolometers in a module are\nsummed together and pre-amplified with Superconducting Quantum Interference\nDevices (SQUIDs) operating at 4 K.

In this scenario two basic mechanisms compete,\nthe modified Hubble expansion rate tending to increase the relic density and a\ndissipative force that tends to decrease it. The net effect can lead to an\noverall dramatic decrease of the predicted relic abundance, sometimes by\namounts of the order of O(10^2) or so. This feature is rather generic,\nindependent of any particular assumption on the underlying string dynamics,\nprovided dilaton dominates at early eras after the end of inflation but before\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The latter ensures that BBN is not upset by the\npresence of the dilaton.

In\norder to optimize the track reconstruction and to fully exploit the data of\nforthcoming directional detectors, we present a likelihood method dedicated to\n3D track reconstruction. This new analysis method is applied to the MIMAC\ndetector. It requires a full simulation of track measurements in order to\ncompare real tracks to simulated ones.

For this purpose, we use a source of alpha particles in the NEXT-DEMO\ntime projection chamber, the large scale prototype of the NEXT-100 neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay experiment, in three different drift electric field\nconfigurations. We measure the ionization electron drift velocity and\nlongitudinal diffusion, and compare our results to expectations based on\navailable electron scattering cross sections on pure xenon. In addition, two\ntypes of measurements addressing the connection between the ionization and\nscintillation yields are performed.

If interpreted in\nterms of dark matter (DM) annihilating into \\gamma\\gamma (\\gamma Z, \\gamma h),\nthis would correspond to a DM particle mass of roughly 130 GeV (145 GeV, 155\nGeV). The rate for these loop-suppressed processes, however, is larger than\ntypically expected for thermally produced DM. Correspondingly, one would\ngenerically expect even larger tree level production rates of standard model\nfermions or gauge bosons.

One of the major goals of the proposed\nupgrade is to extend the physics reach for rare probes at low transverse\nmomentum. The reconstruction of the rare probes requires a precise\ndetermination of the primary and secondary vertices that is performed in ALICE\nby the Inner Tracking System (ITS).

Several common\nradioisotopes in detector construction materials are found in long decay\nchains, notably those headed by 238U, 235U, and 232Th. Gamma radioassay using\nGe detectors identifies decay rates of a few of the radioisotopes in each\nchain, and typically assumes that the chain is in secular equilibrium. If the\nchains are out of equilibrium, detector background rates can be elevated\nsignificantly above expectation. In this work we quantify the increase in\nneutron and gamma production rates from an excess of various sub-chains of the\n238U decay chain. We find that the 226Ra sub-chain generates x10 higher neutron\nflux per decay than the 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain, in materials\nwith high (alpha,n) neutron yields. Typical gamma screening results limit\npotential 238U early sub-chain activity to x20-60 higher than 226Ra sub-chain\nactivity. Monte Carlo simulation is used to quantify the contribution of the\nsub-chains of 238U to low-energy nuclear recoil (NR) and electron recoil (ER)\nbackgrounds in simplified one tonne liquid Ar and liquid Xe detectors.

The equilibrium value is given\nby h_*~0.36 lambda^{-1/4}H_*, where lambda=0.09 ... 0.0005 is the higgs self\ncoupling at the scales H_*=10^4 ... 10^10 GeV. We show that the main decay\nchannel of the higgs condensate after inflation is the resonant production of\nStandard Model gauge bosons. For a set of parameters we find that a significant\npart of the condensate has decayed in between 340 and 630 Hubble times after\nthe onset of higgs oscillations, depending on H_* in a non-trivial way. The\nhiggs perturbations correspond to isocurvature modes during inflation but they\ncould generate significant adiabatic perturbations at a later stage for example\nthrough a modulation of the reheating stage. However, this requires that the\ninflaton(s) decay no later than a few hundred Hubble times after the onset of\nhiggs oscillations. \n\n"}

In the thermal case, the final abundance is set by the\nstandard freeze-out mechanism for large annihilation rates, irrespective of the\ninitial conditions. For smaller annihilation rates, it can be set by the\nfreeze-in mechanism, also independent of the initial abundance, provided it is\nsmall to begin with. For even smaller interaction rates, the DM decouples while\nbeing non-thermal, and the relic abundance will be essentially set by the\ninitial conditions.

Combination of a\nhigh position resolution of the LHCf detector and a high energy resolution of\nthe ZDC makes it possible to determine pT of forward neutrons with the ever\nbest resolution. This enables us to study the forward neutron spin asymmetry\ndiscovered at RHIC in more detail.\n  Another new experiment expected at RHIC is world-first light-ion collisions.\nCosmic-ray interaction models have been so far tested with accelerator data,\nbut colliders have provided only p-p and heavy-ion collisions. To simulate the\ninteraction between cosmic-ray particles and atmosphere, collision of light\nions like nitrogen is a ultimate goal for the cosmic-ray physics.

Ideal beam conditions are summarized in this\npaper. Our basic idea is to bring one of the LHCf detectors to RHIC and then\noperate from 2016 season at RHIC. \n\n"}

For specificity,\nthis paper focuses on a type of two-component explosive known as a\nnanothermite, consisting of a metal and an oxide in close proximity. When the\ntwo components interact they undergo a rapid exothermic reaction --- an\nexplosion. As a specific example, we consider metal nanoparticles of 5 nm\nradius embedded in an oxide. One cell contains more than a few million\nnanoparticles, and a large number of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detector\nmass. A WIMP interacts with a metal nucleus of the nanoparticles, depositing\nenough energy to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers.\nWhen one nanoparticle explodes it initiates a chain reaction throughout the\ncell.

Such a cosmology could arise naturally in the well-motivated moduli\nscenario in the context of supersymmetry (SUSY) -- in particular in models of\nSplit-SUSY. Sub-horizon dark matter perturbations grow linearly during the\nmatter dominated phase before reheating and can lead to an enhancement in the\ngrowth of substructure on small scales, even in the presence of dark matter\nannihilations. This suggests that a new scale (the horizon size at reheating)\ncould be important for determining the primordial matter power spectrum.\nHowever, we find that in many non-thermal models free-streaming effects or\nkinetic decoupling after reheating can completely erase the enhancement leading\nto small-scale structures. In particular, in the moduli scenario with wino or\nhiggsino dark matter we find that the dark matter particles produced from\nmoduli decays would thermalize with radiation and kinetically decouple below\nthe reheating temperature. Thus, the growth of dark matter perturbations is not\nsustained, and the predictions for the matter power spectrum are similar to a\nstandard thermal history. We comment on possible exceptions, but these appear\ndifficult to realize within standard moduli scenarios. We conclude that\nalthough enhanced structure does not provide a new probe for investigating the\ncosmic dark ages within these models, it does suggest that non-thermal\nhistories offer a robust alternative to a strictly thermal post-inflationary\nhistory. \n\n"}

The\npositions of these Detection Units, several hundred metres in length, and their\nattached Optical Modules for the detection of Cherenkov light have to be\nmonitored continously to provide the telescope with its desired pointing\nprecision. A standard way to do this is the utilisation of an acoustic\npositioning system using emitters at fixed positions and receivers distributed\nalong the Detection Units. The KM3NeT neutrino telescope comprises a\ncustom-made acoustic positioning system with newly designed emitters attached\nto the anchors of the Detection Units and custom-designed receivers attached to\nthe Detection Units. This article describes an approach for a receiver and its\nperformance. The proposed Opto-Acoustical Modules combine the optical sensors\nfor the telescope with the acoustical sensors necessary for the positioning of\nthe module itself. This combination leads to a compact design suited for an\neasy deployment of the numerous Detection Units. Furthermore, the instrumented\nvolume can be used for scientific analyses such as marine science and acoustic\nparticle detection. \n\n"}

In a large class of\nbaryogenesis models, the baryon asymmetry results from the out-of-equilibrium\ndecay of a new, massive particle. We highlight that in the interesting scenario\nwhere this particle has a weak scale mass, this out-of-equilibrium condition\nrequires a proper decay length larger than O(1) mm. Such new fields are within\nreach of the LHC, at which they can be pair produced leaving a distinctive,\ndisplaced-vertex signature. This scenario is realized in the recently proposed\nmechanism of baryogenesis where the baryon asymmetry is produced through the\nfreeze-out and subsequent decay of a meta-stable weakly interacting massive\nparticle (\"WIMP baryogenesis\"). In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP\ndark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles\nresponsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.\nIn our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP\nbaryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS\nwith 8 TeV LHC data. We also estimate the LHC reach at 13 TeV using current\nstrategies, and demonstrate that O(10) improvements in cross-section limits can\nbe achieved by requiring two displaced vertices while lowering kinematic\nthresholds. For meta-stable WIMPs produced through electroweak interactions,\nthe high luminosity LHC is sensitive to masses up to 2.5 TeV for lifetimes\naround 1 cm, while for singlets pair-produced through the off-shell-Higgs\nportal, the LHC is sensitive to production cross sections of O(50) ab for\nbenchmark masses around 150 GeV.

Although one can still tune the renormalizable potential to\nsub-Planckian values, higher order corrections from quantum gravity or sources\nof breaking of the Goldstone symmetry would ruin the predictivity of the model.\nIn this paper we show how in more realistic models of Natural Inflation one\ncould achieve inflation without a trans-Planckian excursion of the field.

In particular, the ability to relate experimental\nobservables to neutrino energy in previous experiments has relied solely on\ntheoretical models of neutrino-nucleus interactions, which currently suffer\nfrom very large theoretical uncertainties.\n  By observing charged current $\\nu_\\mu$ interactions over a continuous range\nof off-axis angles from 1 to 4 degrees, the nuPRISM water Cherenkov detector\ncan provide a direct measurement of the far detector lepton kinematics for any\ngiven set of oscillation parameters, which largely removes neutrino interaction\nmodeling uncertainties from T2K oscillation measurements. This naturally\nprovides a direct constraint on the relationship between lepton kinematics and\nneutrino energy. In addition, nuPRISM is a sensitive probe of sterile neutrino\noscillations with multiple energy spectra, which provides unique constraints on\npossible background-related explanations of the MiniBooNE anomaly.

Working in the\nnon-SUSY context we also consider radiative corrections to the inflationary\npotential due to a possible coupling of the inflaton to bosons or fermions. We\nfind ranges of the parameters, depending mildly on the renormalization scale,\nwith adjustable values of the spectral index ns, tensor-to-scalar ratio\nr=(2-4)x10^-3, and an inflaton mass close to 3x10^13 GeV.

For a given particle physics model and DM mass\nwe obtain a lower bound on the capture rate independent of the local DM\ndensity, velocity distribution, galactic escape velocity, as well as the\nscattering cross section.

In contrast to conventional\nsupersymmetric hybrid inflation, where non-thermal gravitino production imposes\nsevere constraints on the inflationary model, we find that the \"non-thermal\ngravitino problem\" is generically absent in models of tribrid inflation, mainly\ndue to two effects: (i) With the inflaton in tribrid inflation (after\ninflation) being lighter than the waterfall field, the latter has a second\ndecay channel with a much larger rate than for the decay into gravitinos. This\nreduces the branching ratio for the decay of the waterfall field into\ngravitinos. (ii) The inflaton generically decays later than the waterfall\nfield, and does not produce gravitinos when it decays.

Motivated by this little drawback, in this paper we\nconsider an extension of the MDM scenario by three right-handed neutrinos. Two\nspecific choices for the MDM multiplet are studied: a fermionic $SU(2)_L$\nquintuplet and a scalar $SU(2)_L$ septuplet. The lightest right-handed\nneutrino, with tiny Yukawa couplings, never reaches thermal equilibrium in the\nearly universe and is produced by freeze-in. This creates a link between dark\nmatter and neutrino physics: dark matter can be non-thermally produced by the\ndecay of the lightest right-handed neutrino after freeze-out, allowing to lower\nsignificantly the dark matter mass. We discuss the phenomenology of the\nnon-thermally produced MDM and, taking into account significant Sommerfeld\ncorrections, we find that the dark matter mass must have some specific values\nin order not to be in conflict with the current bounds from gamma-ray\nobservations. \n\n"}

However, many factors can significantly\nimpact their late-time cosmological abundances. For example, in cases where the\npotentials for these fields are generated dynamically --- such as during\ncosmological mass-generating phase transitions --- the duration of the time\ninterval required for these potentials to fully develop can have significant\nrepercussions. Likewise, in scenarios with multiple scalars, mixing amongst the\nfields can also give rise to an effective timescale that modifies the resulting\nlate-time abundances. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either\nthe first or the second timescale in isolation. In this paper, by contrast, we\nexamine the new features that arise from the interplay between these two\ntimescales when both mixing and time-dependent phase transitions are introduced\ntogether. First, we find that the effects of these timescales can conspire to\nalter not only the total late-time abundance of the system --- often by many\norders of magnitude --- but also its distribution across the different fields.\nSecond, we find that these effects can produce large parametric resonances\nwhich render the energy densities of the fields highly sensitive to the degree\nof mixing as well as the duration of the time interval over which the phase\ntransition unfolds. Finally, we find that these effects can even give rise to a\n\"re-overdamping\" phenomenon which causes the total energy density of the system\nto behave in novel ways that differ from those exhibited by pure dark matter or\nvacuum energy. All of these features therefore give rise to new possibilities\nfor early-universe phenomenology and cosmological evolution. They also\nhighlight the importance of taking into account the time dependence associated\nwith phase transitions in cosmological settings. \n\n"}

In particular, cosmic-ray muons are detected as long, straight\ntracks passing through multiple pixels. The distribution of track lengths can\nbe related to the thickness of the active (depleted) region of the camera image\nsensor through the known angular distribution of muons at sea level. We use a\nsample of cosmic-ray muon tracks recorded by the Distributed Electronic\nCosmic-ray Observatory to measure the thickness of the depletion region of the\ncamera image sensor in a commercial smart phone, the HTC Wildfire S. The track\nlength distribution prefers a cosmic-ray muon angular distribution over an\nisotropic distribution. Allowing either distribution, we measure the depletion\nthickness to be between 13.9~$\\mu$m and 27.7~$\\mu$m. The same method can be\napplied to additional models of image sensor. Once measured, the thickness can\nbe used to convert track length to incident polar angle on a per-event basis.\nCombined with a determination of the incident azimuthal angle directly from the\ntrack orientation in the sensor plane, this enables direction reconstruction of\nindividual cosmic-ray events. \n\n"}

We understand the physics of the radio\nemission in extensive air showers in detail and have developed analysis\nstrategies to accurately derive from radio signals parameters which are related\nto the astrophysics of the primary cosmic ray particles, in particular their\nenergy, arrival direction and estimators for their mass. In parallel to these\nsuccesses, limitations inherent in the physics of the radio signals have also\nbecome increasingly clear. In this article, we review the progress of the past\ndecade and the current state of the field, discuss the current paradigm of the\nradio emission physics and present the experimental evidence supporting it.\nFinally, we discuss the potential for future applications of the radio\ndetection technique to advance the field of cosmic ray physics. \n\n"}

By analogy\nto the standard WIMP paradigm, the dark matter (DM) freezes out through twin\nelectroweak interactions, and annihilates into a dark shower of light twin\nhadrons. These are either stable or decay predominantly to standard model (SM)\nphotons. We show that this 'hadrosymmetric' scenario can be consistent with all\napplicable astrophysical, cosmological and collider constraints. In order to\ndecay the twin hadrons before the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch, an additional\nportal between the SM and twin sector is required. In most cases we find this\nadditional mediator is within reach of either the LHC or future intensity\nfrontier experiments. Furthermore, we conduct simulations of the dark shower\nand consequent photon spectra.

A general consensus has been expressed on the need for a directional\nsensitive detector to confirm, with a complementary approach, the candidates\nfound in conventional searches and to finally extend their sensitivity beyond\nthe limit of neutrino-induced background. We propose here the use of a detector\nbased on nuclear emulsions to measure the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear\nrecoils. The production of nuclear emulsion films with nanometric grains is\nestablished. Several measurement campaigns have demonstrated the capability of\ndetecting sub-micrometric tracks left by low energy ions in such emulsion\nfilms. Innovative analysis technologies with fully automated optical\nmicroscopes have made it possible to achieve the track reconstruction for path\nlengths down to one hundred nanometers and there are good prospects to further\nexceed this limit.

Unlike the WIMP-nucleon scattering, where current\nexperiments probe typical interaction strengths much smaller than the Fermi\nconstant, the scattering on electrons requires a much stronger interaction to\nbe detectable, which in turn requires new light force carriers. We account for\nsuch new forces explicitly, by introducing a mediator particle with scalar or\nvector couplings to dark matter and to electrons.

In the simplest model, SM+D,\nwhich is the standard model plus a real singlet scalar named darkon acting as\nthe DM candidate, the LUX and PandaX-II limits rule out DM masses roughly from\n4 to 450 GeV, except a small range around the resonance point at half of the\nHiggs mass where the interaction cross-section is near the neutrino-background\nfloor. In the THDM II+D, which is the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model combined\nwith a darkon, the region excluded in the SM+D by the direct searches can be\nrecovered due to suppression of the DM effective interactions with nucleons at\nsome values of the ratios of Higgs couplings to the up and down quarks, making\nthe interactions significantly isospin-violating.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes.

Contrary to the\ncase of Q-balls, there is no evident conserved charge that stabilizes the\nlocalized configuration. Nevertheless, in many classical numerical simulations,\nit has been shown that they are extremely long-lived. In this paper, we clarify\nthe reason for the longevity, and show how the exponential separation of time\nscales emerges dynamically. Those solutions are time-periodic with a typical\nfrequency of a mass scale of a scalar field. This observation implies that they\ncan be understood by the effective theory after integrating out relativistic\nmodes. We find that the resulting effective theory has an approximate global\nU(1) symmetry reflecting an approximate number conservation in the\nnon-relativistic regime. As a result, the profile of those solutions is\nobtained via the bounce method, just like Q-balls, as long as the breaking of\nthe U(1) symmetry is small enough. We then discuss the decay processes of the\nI-ball/oscillon by the breaking of the U(1) symmetry, namely the production of\nrelativistic modes via number violating processes.

However, for a sub-MeV WIMP, the universe is\nsufficiently well understood at temperatures below 10 MeV that there is no room\nfor it to be a thermal relic. Avoiding thermalization is itself a strong\nconstraint with significant implications for direct detection. In this paper,\nwe explore the space of models of sub-MeV dark matter with viable cosmologies.\nThe parameter space of these models that is also consistent with astrophysical\nand lab-based limits is highly restricted for couplings to electrons but\nsomewhat less constrained for nuclei. We find that achieving nuclear\ncross-sections well-above the neutrino floor necessarily predicts a new\ncontribution to the effective number of neutrino species, $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} =\n0.09$ that will be tested by the next generation of CMB observations.

Microwave power applied\nto read out the device is absorbed by and heats the superconductor\nquasiparticles, changing the superconductor conductivity and hence the readout\npower absorbed in a positive or negative feedback loop. In this work, we\nexplore numerically the implications of an extensible theoretical model of a\ngeneric superconducting microresonator device for a typical KID, incorporating\nrecent work on the power flow between superconductor quasiparticles and\nphonons. This model calculates the large-signal (changes in operating point)\nand small-signal behaviour of a device, allowing us to determine the effect of\nelectrothermal feedback on device responsivity and noise characteristics under\nvarious operating conditions. We also investigate how thermally isolating the\ndevice from the bath, for example by designing the device on a membrane only\nconnected to the bulk substrate by thin legs, affects device performance. We\nfind that at a typical device operating point, positive electrothermal feedback\nreduces the effective thermal conductance from the superconductor\nquasiparticles to the bath, and so increases responsivity to signal\n(pair-breaking) power, increases noise from temperature fluctuations, and\ndecreases the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP). Similarly, increasing the thermal\nisolation of the device while keeping the quasiparticle temperature constant\ndecreases the NEP, but also decreases the device response bandwidth. \n\n"}

After the end of inflation,\nthe flat direction oscillates about the minimum of its potential, losing at\neach oscillation about 56% of its energy into bursts of gauge/gaugino and\nscalar quanta when crossing the origin. These particles then acquire a large\ninflaton VEV-induced mass and decay perturbatively into the MSSM quanta and\ngravitinos, transferring the inflaton energy very efficiently via instant\npreheating. Regarding thermalization, we show that the MSSM degrees of freedom\nthermalize very quickly, yet not immediately by virtue of the large vacuum\nexpectation value of the inflaton, which breaks the $SU(3)_C\\times U(1)_Y$\nsymmetry into a residual $U(1)$. The energy transfer to the MSSM quanta is very\nefficient, since full thermalization is achieved after only $\\mathcal{O}(40)$\ncomplete oscillations. The udd inflaton thus provides an extremely efficient\nreheating of the Universe, with a temperature\n$T_{reh}=\\mathcal{O}(10^8\\mathrm{GeV})$ that allows for instance several\nmechanisms of baryogenesis.

The array will consist of about\n1250 small-sized (3.6 m diameter) detector units distributed over a circular\narea of about 160 m in diameter. Each detector unit will consist of a water\nCherenkov detector and a liquid scintillation detector underneath which will\npreferentially identify muons, facilitating the background (cosmic ray)\nrejection, thereby improving the sensitivity. The background rejection will be\nfurther enhanced by the close-packed arrangement and the small size of the\ndetectors which will allow a fine sampling of air-shower footprints at the\nground. In this contribution, we present the Monte-Carlo simulation of the\nexperiment performed using CORSIKA and GEANT4 simulation packages.

Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\sigma$ confidence.\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\nfundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search\ncould confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in\nclear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter\nhalo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter.

COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel\ndetection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter\nreading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages\narise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear\nrecoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis.

We\nillustrate this point in three simple freeze-in models. The first one, which we\ncall kinematically induced freeze-in, is based on the observation that the\neffective mass of a scalar temporarily becomes very small as the scalar\npotential undergoes a second order phase transition. This opens dark matter\nproduction channels that are otherwise forbidden. The second model we consider,\ndubbed vev-induced freeze-in, is a fermionic Higgs portal scenario. Its scalar\nsector is augmented compared to the Standard Model by an additional scalar\nsinglet, $S$, which couples to dark matter and temporarily acquires a vacuum\nexpectation value (a two-step phase transition or `vev flip-flop'). While\n$\\langle S \\rangle \\neq 0$, the modified coupling structure in the scalar\nsector implies that dark matter production is significantly enhanced compared\nto the $\\langle S \\rangle = 0$ phases realised at very early times and again\ntoday.

We perform\nMonte Carlo simulations to determine the precise value of the critical cross\nsection for various direct detection experiments and compare them to other dark\nmatter constraints in the low mass regime. In this region we find parameter\nspace where typical underground and surface detectors are completely blind to\ndark matter. This \"hole\" in the parameter space can hardly be closed with an\nincrease in the detector exposure. Dedicated surface or high-altitude\nexperiments may be the only way to directly probe this part of the parameter\nspace. \n\n"}

These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$.

With our measurements of the\nbias dependence of the breakdown probability we are able to draw conclusions\nabout the location and spatial extension of the avalanche region.

For example, the decays of such particles can alter the\nratios of light-element abundances, give rise to distortions in the cosmic\nmicrowave background, alter the ionization history of the universe, and\ncontribute to the diffuse photon flux. Constraints on new physics from such\nconsiderations are typically derived for a single unstable particle species\nwith a single well-defined mass and characteristic lifetime. In this paper, by\ncontrast, we investigate the cosmological constraints on theories involving\nentire ensembles of decaying particles --- ensembles which span potentially\nbroad ranges of masses and lifetimes. In addition to providing a detailed\nnumerical analysis of these constraints, we also formulate a set of simple\nanalytic approximations for these constraints which may be applied to generic\nensembles of unstable particles which decay into\nelectromagnetically-interacting final states. We then illustrate how these\nanalytic approximations can be used to constrain a variety of toy scenarios for\nphysics beyond the Standard Model.

Despite the relatively small Yukawa coupling,\nCP-violating source terms involving taus are quite effective and can account\nfor the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. We obtain analytical and\nnumerical expressions for the total baryon asymmetry, the former providing\nimportant insight into what makes lepton CP violation relatively effective\ncompared to quark CP violation.

Especially, we consider the\ncase when two right-handed neutrinos are responsible to leptogenesis and the\nseesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses, and assume that the CP violation\noccurs only in the mixing matrix of active neutrinos. In this case the sign of\nthe baryon asymmetry depends on the Dirac and Majorana CP phases as well as the\nmixing angle of the right-handed neutrinos. It is shown how the yield of the\nbaryon asymmetry correlates with these parameters. In addition, we find that\nthe effective neutrino mass in the neutrinoless double beta decay receives an\nadditional constraint in order to account for the observed baryon asymmetry\ndepending on the masses and mixing angle of right-handed neutrinos. \n\n"}

The reason is that the initial\nmisalignment angles of the string axions follow the Bunch-Davies distribution\npeaked at the potential minima. As a result, the cosmological moduli problem\ninduced by the string axions can be significantly relaxed by low-scale\ninflation, and astrophysical and cosmological bounds are satisfied over a wide\nrange of the mass without any fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angles.\nSpecifically, the axion with its decay constant $f_\\phi = 10^{16}$\\,GeV\nsatisfies the bounds over $10^{-18}{\\rm \\, eV} \\lesssim m_\\phi \\lesssim\n10{\\rm\\,TeV}$ for $H_{\\rm inf} \\lesssim 10{\\rm\\,keV}- 10^{6}$\\,{\\rm GeV}.

Such a scenario is motivated by the longstanding $\\sim\n\\, 4 \\sigma$ discrepancy between the measured and predicted values of the\nmuon's anomalous magnetic moment, $(g-2)_\\mu$, as well as the tension between\nlate and early time determinations of the Hubble constant. If sufficiently\nlight, the $Z'$ population will decay to neutrinos, increasing the overall\nenergy density of radiation and altering the expansion history of the early\nuniverse. We identify two distinct regions of parameter space in this model in\nwhich the Hubble tension can be significantly relaxed. The first of these is\nthe previously identified region in which a $\\sim \\, 10-20$ MeV $Z'$ reaches\nequilibrium in the early universe and then decays, heating the neutrino\npopulation and delaying the process of neutrino decoupling. For a coupling of\n$g_{\\mu-\\tau} \\simeq (3-8) \\times 10^{-4}$, such a particle can also explain\nthe observed $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ anomaly. In the second region, the $Z'$ is very\nlight ($m_{Z'} \\sim 1\\,\\text{eV}$ to $\\text{MeV}$) and very weakly coupled\n($g_{\\mu-\\tau} \\sim 10^{-13}$ to $10^{-9}$). In this case, the $Z'$ population\nis produced through freeze-in, and decays to neutrinos after neutrino\ndecoupling. Across large regions of parameter space, we predict a contribution\nto the energy density of radiation that can appreciably relax the reported\nHubble tension, $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 0.2$. \n\n"}

The energy deposits were measured using a\nneutron-transmutation-doped Ge thermal sensor with a 17.7~eV (RMS) baseline\nheat energy resolution leading to a 60~eV analysis energy threshold.

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are among the best\nmotivated dark matter candidates. However, in light of non conclusive detection\nsignals and strong constraints from collider, direct and indirect detection\nexperiments, this thesis presents constraints on several realizations of the\nWIMP paradigm in the context of simplified dark matter models. More elaborated\nmodels considering extended gauge structures are discussed further on, such as\nconstructions involving generalized Chern-Simons couplings and a specific WIMP\nscenario motivated by recently observed flavour anomalies related to the\n$R_{K^{(*)}}$ observable. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the\ndiscussion of an alternative dark matter thermal production mechanism where an\nexplicit realization of the Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs)\nparadigm is discussed in the context of a non-Abelian hidden gauge structure.\nIn a last part, the possibility of producing non-thermally a dark matter\ncomponent via the \"freeze-in\" mechanism was investigated and the strong impact\nof the post-inflationary reaheating stage of the universe on such constructions\nillustrated by the specific case where dark matter density production is\nmediated by a heavy spin-2 field in addition to the standard graviton. \n\n"}

The decay of inflaton\nproduces high-energy particles that are thermalized to complete the reheating\nof the Universe. Before the thermalization is completed, DM can be produced\nfrom a collision between the high-energy particles and/or the ambient plasma.\nWe calculate the DM abundance produced from these processes for the case where\nthe cross section of the DM production is proportional to the $n$-th power of\nthe center of mass energy. We find that the collision between the high-energy\nparticles is almost always dominant for $n \\gtrsim 4$ while it is subdominant\nfor $n \\lesssim 2$.
