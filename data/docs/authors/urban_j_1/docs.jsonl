Since the release of the YR, the BESII\nprogram concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c\nflourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the\nTevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the\ndeconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,\nprecision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for\ncontinuing investigations.

For the canonical neutron star, the lower\nbound of the r-mode instability window is reduced in frequency by \\approx150 Hz\nfrom the softest to the stiffest symmetry energy used, independent of mass and\ntemperature. The instability window also drops by \\approx 100 Hz independent of\nEOS when the mass is raised from 1.4 M_{\\odot} to 2.0 M_{\\odot}.

This paper investigates how classical\ninference and learning tasks known from the graphical model community can be\ntackled for probabilistic logic programs. Several such tasks such as computing\nthe marginals given evidence and learning from (partial) interpretations have\nnot really been addressed for probabilistic logic programs before.\n  The first contribution of this paper is a suite of efficient algorithms for\nvarious inference tasks. It is based on a conversion of the program and the\nqueries and evidence to a weighted Boolean formula. This allows us to reduce\nthe inference tasks to well-studied tasks such as weighted model counting,\nwhich can be solved using state-of-the-art methods known from the graphical\nmodel and knowledge compilation literature. The second contribution is an\nalgorithm for parameter estimation in the learning from interpretations\nsetting. The algorithm employs Expectation Maximization, and is built on top of\nthe developed inference algorithms.\n  The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated. The results show that the\ninference algorithms improve upon the state-of-the-art in probabilistic logic\nprogramming and that it is indeed possible to learn the parameters of a\nprobabilistic logic program from interpretations. \n\n"}

Traveling-wave decelerators are\nuniquely suited to meet these challenges because of their ability to confine\nmolecules in three dimensions during deceleration and the versatility afforded\nby the analog control of the electrodes.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nis affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, so the combination of BBN\nand CMB can break some of the degeneracies.

In the low energy theory, the only probe comes from\nthe mixing of the Higgs fields in the standard model and twin sectors. However,\nan ultraviolet completion is required below ~ 10 TeV to remove residual\nlogarithmic divergences. In non-supersymmetric completions, new exotic fermions\ncharged under both the standard model and twin gauge symmetries have to be\npresent to accompany the top quark, thus providing a high energy probe of the\nmodel. Some of them carry standard model color, and may therefore be copiously\nproduced at current or future hadron colliders. Once produced, these exotic\nquarks can decay into a top together with twin sector particles. If the twin\nsector particles escape the detection, we have the irreducible stop-like\nsignals. On the other hand, some twin sector particles may decay back into the\nstandard model particles with long lifetimes, giving spectacular displaced\nvertex signals in combination with the prompt top quarks. This happens in the\nFraternal Twin Higgs scenario with typical parameters, and sometimes is even\nnecessary for cosmological reasons. We study the potential displaced vertex\nsignals from the decays of the twin bottomonia, twin glueballs, and twin\nleptons in the Fraternal Twin Higgs scenario. Depending on the details of the\ntwin sector, the exotic quarks may be probed up to ~ 2.5 TeV at the LHC and\nbeyond 10 TeV at a future 100 TeV collider, providing a strong test of this\nclass of ultraviolet completions. \n\n"}

In addition, high power\nconsumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of\ncloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases\ncooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should\nminimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an\nacceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and\npower management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system.\nMoreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher\ndimensions in state and action spaces.

Our hypothesis was based on\nexperimental data, which raised the idea of a finite formation time for the\nproduced medium. At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time\nreaches about 2 fm/c. All observed high p_t particles are produced in the\ncorona region and have a chance to escape during this 2 fm/c. After that, the\nformed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the\nnuclear modification factor R_{AA} should be independent on particle momentum\nand be flat versus p_t. At the same time, we describe the finite azimuthal\nanisotropy of high p_t particles, v_2. A separate prediction held that, at LHC\nenergy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller,\nabout 1 fm/c. New data at LHC show that R_{AA} is not flat and is rising with\np_t. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton\ntraversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift\nof about 7 GeV (I would call it as a parton binding energy) from the original\npower law p^{-6} production cross section in pp explains well all the observed\nR_{AA} dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV is also valid at RHIC energy,\nwhere the cross section follows a power law with about p^{-8} and this shift\nexplains a very slow rise of R_{AA} seen for neutral pions with p_t above 15\nGeV/c.

During the\nbouncing phase, the evolution is independent of not only the initial\nconditions, but also the inflationary potentials. In particular, the expansion\nfactor can be well described by the same exact solution in all the cases\nconsidered. In contrast, in the potential dominated case such a universality is\nlost. It is because of this universality that the linear perturbations are also\nindependent of the inflationary models and obtained exactly. During the\ntransition phase, the evolutions of the background and its linear perturbations\nare found explicitly, and then matched to the ones given in the other two\nphases. Hence, once the initial conditions are imposed, the linear scalar and\ntensor perturbations will be uniquely determined.

Due to the pre-inflationary dynamics, the scalar and tensor\npower spectra become scale-dependent.

In this\npaper we derive factorization formulae for groomed multi-prong substructure\nobservables, focusing in particular on the groomed $D_2$ observable, which is\nused to identify boosted hadronic decays of electroweak bosons at the LHC. Our\nfactorization formulae allow systematically improvable calculations of the\nperturbative $D_2$ distribution and the resummation of logarithmically enhanced\nterms in all regions of phase space using renormalization group evolution.

The couplings of many\nradially excited heavy vector mesons are measured, while the corresponding\ncouplings for light vector mesons are not known.

The method is suggested by\nour observation that the electromagnetic coupling of the $n$-th radial\nexcitation of $S$-wave heavy vector meson decouples from the $e^+e^-$\nannihilation with nearly exponential rate with $n$. It becomes natural to\nassume that the same effect takes place in the light vector mesons and this\nwould allow to estimate the unknown couplings.

For the robustness of detection\nsystems, more potential attack approaches are under research. In this paper, a\nframework of the generative adversarial networks, called IDSGAN, is proposed to\ngenerate the adversarial malicious traffic records aiming to attack intrusion\ndetection systems by deceiving and evading the detection.

The numeric\nestimation of the latter is only possible when the parameters of a $5D$ dual\nmodel are previously determined from consistency with other physical aspects,\nstandardly, providing a description of the QCD resonances. The traditional way\nto fix parameters in the simplest AdS/QCD models is to reproduce the mass of\nthe $\\rho$ meson or the slope of the approximate radial Regge trajectory of the\n$\\rho$ excitations. Motivated by a general idea that the slope value originates\nin gluodynamics, we propose calculating the deconfinement temperature using the\ntrajectory of scalar glueballs. We consider several holographic models and use\nthe recent idea of isospectral potentials to make an additional check of the\nrelevance of our approach. It is demonstrated that different models from an\nisospectral family (i.e. the models leading to identical predictions for\nspectrum of hadrons with fixed quantum numbers) result in different predictions\nfor the deconfinement temperature.

The evolution of the CC depends on the single\nparameter \\nu, which characterizes the running of the CC produced by the\nquantum effects of matter fields of the unknown high energy theory below the\nPlanck scale. The sign of \\nu indicates whether bosons or fermions dominate in\nthe running. The spectrum of perturbations is computed assuming an adiabatic\nregime and an isotropic stress tensor. Moreover, the perturbations of the CC\nterm are generated from the simplest covariant form suggested by the RG model\nunder consideration. The corresponding numerical analysis shows that for \\nu>0\nthere is a depletion of the matter power spectrum at low scales (large wave\nnumbers) as compared to the standard LCDM model, whereas for \\nu<0 there is an\nexcess of power at low scales. We find that the LSS data rule out the range\n|\\nu|> 10^{-4} while the values |\\nu|< 10^{-6} look perfectly acceptable.

It also may serve as a schematic model for\ndisorder in quantum systems. In this review, we discuss both types of\napplications of chiral random matrix theory to the QCD partition function. We\nshow that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking\ndetermine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the\nDirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of\nthe QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these\neigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with\nthe global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such\neigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume. The\nspectral density for larger eigenvalues (but still well below a typical\nhadronic mass scale) also follows from the same low-energy effective partition\nfunction. The validity of the random matrix approach has been confirmed by many\nlattice QCD simulations in a wide parameter range. Stimulated by the success of\nthe chiral random matrix theory in the description of universal properties of\nthe Dirac eigenvalues, the random matrix model is extended to nonzero\ntemperature and chemical potential. In this way we obtain qualitative results\nfor the QCD phase diagram and the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator.

Abstract: Prompted by recent solar and atmospheric data, we re-analyze the\nfour-neutrino description of current global neutrino oscillation data,\nincluding the LSND evidence for oscillations. The higher degree of rejection\nfor non-active solar and atmospheric oscillation solutions implied by the SNO\nneutral current result as well as by the latest 1489-day Super-K atmospheric\nneutrino data allows us to rule out (2+2) oscillation schemes proposed to\nreconcile LSND with the rest of current neutrino oscillation data. Using an\nimproved goodness of fit (gof) method especially sensitive to the combination\nof data sets we obtain a gof of only 1.6 times 10^{-6} for (2+2) schemes.\nFurther, we re-evaluate the status of (3+1) oscillations using two different\nanalyses of the LSND data sample. We find that also (3+1) schemes are strongly\ndisfavoured by the data. Depending on the LSND analysis we obtain a gof of 5.6\ntimes 10^{-3} or 7.6 times 10^{-5}. This leads to the conclusion that all\nfour-neutrino descriptions of the LSND anomaly, both in (2+2) as well as (3+1)\nrealizations, are highly disfavoured.

We develop, using the method of\ninfluence functional, how to deduce the density matrix of the quantum system\nincorporating the effect of environment. After introducing characterization of\nthe environment by spectral weight, we first devise schemes to approximate the\nspectral weight, and then a perturbation method in field theory models, in\norder to approximately describe the environment. All of these approximate\nmodels may be classified as extended Ohmic models of dissipation whose\ndifferences are in the high frequency part.\n  The quantum system we deal with in the present work is a general class of\nharmonic oscillators with arbitrary time dependent frequency. The late time\nbehavior of the system is well described by an approximation that employs a\nlocalized friction in the dissipative part of the correlation function\nappearing in the influence functional. The density matrix of the quantum system\nis then determined in terms of a single classical solution obtained with the\ntime dependent frequency. With this one can compute the entropy, the energy\ndistribution function, and other physical quantities of the system in a closed\nform.\n  Specific application is made to the case of periodically varying frequency.\nThis dynamical system has a remarkable property when the environmental\ninteraction is switched off: Effect of the parametric resonance gives rise to\nan exponential growth of the populated number in higher excitation levels, or\nparticle production in field theory models. The effect of the environment is\ninvestigated for this dynamical system and it is demonstrated that there exists \n\n"}

We investigate the\nconsequences of this supposition for high-energy collider experiments. We do\nthis by first compactifying the higher dimensional theory and constructing a\n3+1-dimensional low-energy effective field theory of the graviton Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations and their interactions with ordinary matter. We then consider\ngraviton production processes, and select photon plus missing energy and jet\nplus missing energy signatures for careful study.
