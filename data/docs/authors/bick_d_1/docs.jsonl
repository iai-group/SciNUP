Because only one stage\nof conversion is needed, the signal is of ${\\cal O}(g^2_{a\\gamma \\gamma})$, as\nopposed to ${\\cal O}(g^4_{a\\gamma \\gamma})$ for photon-regeneration\nexperiments, where $g_{a\\gamma \\gamma}$ is the coupling between ALPs and\nphotons.

These\nsimulations have mostly been run with a source beam outside the detector. In\nthe case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on\nthe detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From\nthis standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of\nsources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation\nframework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach\nto event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple\nradioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with\nthe entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.\nVarious levels of information can also be recorded from the individual\ncomponents, with these record levels also being set at runtime. This\nflexibility in both source generation and information recording is possible\nwithout the need to recompile, reducing the complexity of code management and\nthe proliferation of versions. Within the code itself, casting geometry objects\nwithin this new set of classes rather than as the default Geant4 classes\nautomatically extends this flexibility to every individual component. No\nadditional work is required on the part of the developer, reducing development\ntime and increasing confidence in the results.

Because of lunar librations, the surfaces of these arrays do not,\nin general, point directly at the Earth. This effect results in a spread of\narrival times, because each cube that comprises the retroreflector is at a\nslightly different distance from the Earth, leading to the reduced ranging\naccuracy. Thus, a single, wide aperture corner-cube could have a clear\nadvantage.

If the corresponding heavy gauge\nboson Z' mediates FCNC processes in the quark sector at tree-level, these new\nphysics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM expectations for\nFCNC processes depending only on Z' couplings to fermions and on its mass. This\nimplies stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 observables\nwhich govern the landscape of the allowed parameter space for Z'-models.\nAnticipating the Flavour Precision Era (FPE) ahead of us we illustrate this by\nsearching for allowed oases in this landscape assuming significantly smaller\nuncertainties in CKM and hadronic parameters than presently available. To this\nend we analyze Delta F=2 observables in K^0-bar K^0 and B^0_{s,d}-bar B^0_{s,d}\nsystems and rare K and B decays including both left-handed and right-handed\nZ'-couplings to quarks in various combinations. We identify a number of\ncorrelations between various flavour observables that could test and\ndistinguish these different Z' scenarios.

Low dark noise rates and dense module spacing will thereby allow to\nsubstantially decrease the energy threshold in future projects. We describe a\nfeasibility study of a novel type of single photon sensor that employs organic\nwavelength-shifting material (WLS) to capture Cherenkov photons and guide them\nto a PMT readout.

The models were computed with\nthe Vertex-CoCoNuT code, using three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino\ntransport in the ray-by-ray-plus approximation. Our results confirm the close\nsimilarity of the mean energies of electron antineutrinos and heavy-lepton\nneutrinos and even their crossing during the accretion phase for stars with\nM>10 M_sun as observed in previous 1D and 2D simulations with state-of-the-art\nneutrino transport.

We demonstrate\nthere is no trivial error cancellation, thus the flux systematic error can\nremain dominant even after the adoption of multi-detector configurations.\nHowever, three mechanisms for flux error suppression have been identified and\ncalculated in the context of Double Chooz, Daya Bay and RENO sites. Our\nanalysis computes the error {\\it suppression fraction} using simplified\nscenarios to maximise relative comparison among experiments. We have validated\nthe only mechanism exploited so far by experiments to improve the precision of\nthe published $\\theta_{13}$. The other two newly identified mechanisms could\nlead to total error flux cancellation under specific conditions and are\nexpected to have major implications on the global $\\theta_{13}$ knowledge\ntoday.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates.

Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind\nthe experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,\nthe statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models\nmay be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only\napparent.\n  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the\nimportant fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that\nit evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound\nstates, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound\nnuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons. Clearly statistical mechanics\ndoes not work for such finite system, neither does other theories applicable to\ncondensed matter systems. The richness of nuclear physics stems from these\nrestrictions. New theories and models are presently being developed. Theories\nof the structure and reactions of neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei, called\nexotic nuclei, halo nuclei, or Borromean nuclei deal with the wealth of\nexperimental data available in the last 35 years. Further, nuclear astrophysics\nand stellar and Big Bang nucleosynthesis have become a more mature subject. Due\nto limited space, this review only covers a few selected topics, mainly those\nwith which the authors have worked with. \n\n"}

Liquid\nargon had a minor (56 ppm) admixture of nitrogen, which allowed to understand,\ninter alia, the effect of N2 doping on the EL mechanism in rare-event\nexperiments using two-phase Ar detectors. The measurements were performed in a\ntwo-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) with EL gap located directly\nabove the liquid-gas interface. The EL gap was optically read out in the Vacuum\nUltraviolet (VUV), near 128 nm (Ar excimer emission), and in the near\nUltraviolet (UV), at 300-450 nm (N2 Second Positive System emission), via\ncryogenic PMTs and a Geiger-mode APD (GAPD). Proportional electroluminescence\nwas measured to have an amplification parameter of 109+-10 photons per drifting\nelectron per kV overall in the VUV and UV, of which 51+-6% were emitted in the\nUV. The measured EL threshold, at an electric field of 3.7+-0.2 kV/cm, was in\naccordance with that predicted by the theory.

Because of the classically conformal\nsymmetry, all dimensional parameters are forbidden. The $B-L$ gauge symmetry is\nradiatively broken through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass\nfor the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson ($Z^\\prime$ boson) and the right-handed\nneutrinos. Through a small negative coupling between the SM Higgs doublet and\nthe $B-L$ Higgs field, the negative mass term for the SM Higgs doublet is\ngenerated and the electroweak symmetry is broken. In this model context, we\ninvestigate the electroweak vacuum instability problem in the SM. It is known\nthat in the classically conformal U(1)$_{B-L}$ extension of the SM, the\nelectroweak vacuum remains unstable in the renormalization group analysis at\nthe one-loop level.

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and\ntopological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is\npossible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of\nexposure. Such a low background rate is an essential feature of the next\ngeneration of 0nbb experiments, aiming to fully explore the inverse hierarchy\nof neutrino masses. \n\n"}

{"id": "1509.03517", "contents": "Title: Exploring Flavor-Dependent Long-Range Forces in Long-Baseline Neutrino\n  Oscillation Experiments Abstract: The Standard Model gauge group can be extended with minimal matter content by\nintroducing anomaly free U(1) symmetry, such as $L_e-L_{\\mu}$ or\n$L_e-L_{\\tau}$. If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion. This feature invokes fake CP-asymmetry\nlike the SM matter effect and can severely affect the leptonic CP-violation\nsearches in long-baseline experiments. In this paper, we study in detail the\npossible impacts of these long-range flavor-diagonal neutral current\ninteractions due to $L_e-L_{\\mu}$ symmetry, when (anti-)neutrinos travel from\nFermilab to Homestake (1300 km) and CERN to Pyh\\\"asalmi (2290 km) in the\ncontext of future high-precision superbeam facilities, DUNE and LBNO\nrespectively.

At present it is not possible to\neven transfer most of this data from the four main particle detectors at the\nLHC to \"offline\" data facilities, much less to permanently store it for future\nprocessing. For this reason the LHC detectors are equipped with real-time\nanalysis systems, called triggers, which process this volume of data and select\nthe most interesting proton-proton collisions.

The complete description of these observables requires\nunderstanding both the limit in which hard substructure is resolved, as well as\nthe limit of a jet with a single hard core. In this paper we study in detail\nthe perturbative structure of two prominent jet substructure observables,\n$N$-subjettiness and the energy correlation functions, as measured on\nbackground QCD jets. In particular, we focus on the distinction between the\nlimits in which two-prong structure is resolved or unresolved. Depending on the\nchoice of subjet axes, we demonstrate that at fixed order, $N$-subjettiness can\nmanifest myriad behaviors in the unresolved region: smooth tails, end-point\nsingularities, or singularities in the physical region. The energy correlation\nfunctions, by contrast, only have non-singular perturbative tails extending to\nthe end point. We discuss the effect of hadronization on the various\nobservables with Monte Carlo simulation and demonstrate that the modeling of\nthese effects with non-perturbative shape functions is highly dependent on the\n$N$-subjettiness axes definitions. Our study illustrates those regions of phase\nspace that must be controlled for high-precision jet substructure calculations,\nand emphasizes how such calculations can be facilitated by designing\nsubstructure observables with simple singular structures. \n\n"}

To maximize the science return from such a rare\nevent, it is essential to have established classes of possible situations and\npreparations for appropriate observations. To this end, we use a long-term\nnumerical simulation of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) of a 17 solar-mass\nred supergiant progenitor to self-consistently model the multi-messenger\nsignals expected in GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic messengers. This\nsupernova model takes into account the formation and evolution of a\nprotoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction, and neutrino transport, all\nwithin a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation. With this, we\nseparately discuss three situations: (i) a CCSN at the Galactic Center, (ii) an\nextremely nearby CCSN within hundreds of parsecs, and (iii) a CCSN in nearby\ngalaxies within several Mpc. These distance regimes necessitate different\nstrategies for synergistic observations. In a Galactic CCSN, neutrinos provide\nstrategic timing and pointing information.

Since the classically conformal symmetry forbids all dimensional\nparameters in the model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry is broken by the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass terms of the U(1)' gauge boson\n($Z$' boson) and the right-handed neutrinos. Through a mixing quartic coupling\nbetween the U(1)' Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet field, the radiative\nU(1)' gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the breaking of the electroweak\nsymmetry. In this model context, we first investigate the electroweak vacuum\ninstability problem in the SM. Employing the renormalization group equations at\nthe two-loop level and the central values for the world average masses of the\ntop quark ($m_t=173.34$ GeV) and the Higgs boson ($m_h=125.09$ GeV), we perform\nparameter scans to identify the parameter region for resolving the electroweak\nvacuum instability problem. Next we interpret the recent ATLAS and CMS search\nlimits at the LHC Run-2 for the sequential $Z$' boson to constrain the\nparameter region in our model. Combining the constraints from the electroweak\nvacuum stability and the LHC Run-2 results, we find a bound on the $Z$' boson\nmass as $m_{Z'} \\gtrsim 3.5$ TeV. We also calculate self-energy corrections to\nthe SM Higgs doublet field through the heavy states, the right-handed neutrinos\nand the $Z$' boson, and find the naturalness bound as $m_{Z'} \\lesssim 7$ TeV,\nin order to reproduce the right electroweak scale for the fine-tuning level\nbetter than 10\\%.

The experiment is currently in the commissioning\nphase and will begin physics data taking later this year.

New baryon states were\ndiscovered largely based on the open strangeness production channels $\\gamma p\n\\to K^+ \\Lambda$ and $\\gamma p \\to K^+ \\Sigma^0$. The data illustrate the great\npotential of the kaon-hyperon channel in the discovery of higher mass baryon\nresonances in s-channel production.

To reach its projected sensitivity, the background has to be reduced\nby two orders of magnitude compared to its predecessor XENON100. This requires\na water Cherenkov muon veto surrounding the XENON1T TPC, both to shield\nexternal backgrounds and to tag muon-induced energetic neutrons through\ndetection of a passing muon or the secondary shower induced by a muon\ninteracting in the surrounding rock. The muon veto is instrumented with $84$\n$8\"$ PMTs with high quantum efficiency (QE) in the Cherenkov regime and the\nwalls of the watertank are clad with the highly reflective DF2000MA foil by 3M.\nHere, we present a study of the reflective properties of this foil, as well as\nthe measurement of its wavelength shifting (WLS) properties. Further, we\npresent the impact of reflectance and WLS on the detection efficiency of the\nmuon veto, using a Monte Carlo simulation carried out with Geant4. The\nmeasurements yield a specular reflectance of $\\approx100\\%$ for wavelengths\nlarger than $400\\,$nm, while $\\approx90\\%$ of the incoming light below\n$370\\,$nm is absorbed by the foil.

We\ndevelop a GEANT4-based model of the optical unit, based on first principles,\nand obtain the range of probable values for the expected number of detected\nphotoelectrons ($N_{\\rm PE}$) given the known systematic errors on the\nsimulation parameters.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC). Moreover, the 2 \\mum wavelength is optimal for a 2E = 1 TeV\ncollider, e.g., a possible ILC energy upgrade.

Until\nrecently, it was believed that proportional electroluminescence was fully due\nto VUV emission of noble gas excimers produced in atomic collisions with\nexcited atoms, the latter being in turn produced by drifting electrons.

An intensive R\\&D program was carried out with the focus on\nachieving an effective gain of at least 20. In the simulation study here\npresented for the first time not only the electron signal is considered but\nalso the ion backflow and the expected production of secondary scintillation\nlight is studied, because the latter might limit the capability of the detector\nto trigger on low energetic no-beam physics. It is found that the ion backflow\nand the light yield can be expected to be very large. The results for the\neffective gain show a discrepancy with experimental data, both in size and\nshape of the gain curve. Based on literature studies, it is argued that photon\nfeedback contributes to the gain in detectors filled with pure noble gases,\nespecially in the case of pure argon. \n\n"}
