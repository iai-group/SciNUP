There\nthe main interest is to identify a small number of infected people among a\nlarge population using collective samples. In viral epidemics, one way to\nacquire collective samples is by sending agents inside the population. While in\nclassical group testing, it is assumed that the sampling procedure is fully\nknown to the reconstruction algorithm, in this work we assume that the decoder\npossesses only partial knowledge about the sampling process. This assumption is\njustified by observing the fact that in a viral sickness, there is a chance\nthat an agent remains healthy despite having contact with an infected person.\nTherefore, the reconstruction method has to cope with two different types of\nuncertainty; namely, identification of the infected population and the\npartially unknown sampling procedure.\n  In this work, by using a natural probabilistic model for \"viral infections\",\nwe design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification\nof the infected population with overwhelming probability 1-o(1). We propose\nboth probabilistic and explicit design procedures that require a \"small\" number\nof agents to single out the infected individuals.

While the restricted isometry\nproperty is powerful for the analysis of recovering approximately sparse\nsignals with noisy measurements, the known bounds on the achievable sparsity\n(The \"sparsity\" in this paper means the size of the set of nonzero or\nsignificant elements in a signal vector.) level can be quite loose.

However, it is still not\nwell-understood; for example, existence of solutions to the conformal equations\nfor zero or negative Yamabe metrics is still unknown without the so-called\n``CMC'' or ``near-CMC'' assumptions. The first existence results without such\nassumptions, termed the ``far-from-CMC'' case, were obtained by Holst, Nagy,\nand Tsogtgerel in 2008 for positive Yamabe metrics. However, their results are\nbased on topological arguments, and as a result solution uniqueness is not\nknown. Indeed, Maxwell gave evidence in 2011 that far-from-CMC solutions are\nnot unique in certain cases. In this article, we provide further insight by\nestablishing a type of alternative theorem for general far-from-CMC solutions.\nFor a given manifold M that admits a metric of positive scalar curvature and\nscalar flat metric g(0) with no conformal Killing fields, we first prove\nexistence of an analytic, one-parameter family of metrics g(z) through g(0)\nsuch that R(g(z)) = z.

The\nregularity of this curve, the definition of F((phi,w),z), and the earlier\nfar-from-CMC results of Holst et al. allow us to then prove the following\nalternative theorem for far-from-CMC solutions: either (1) there exists a z_1\n>0 such that (positive Yamabe) solutions to the z_1-parameterized conformal\nequations are non-unique; or (2) there exists z_2 < 0 such that (negative\nYamabe) solutions to the z_2-parameterized conformal equations exist. \n\n"}

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario.

In this\nconstruction, one starts from a flat torus with $16$ orbifold points, and\nresolves the orbifold singularities by gluing in $16$ small Eguchi-Hanson\nmanifolds which all have the same orientation. This construction was carried\nout rigorously by Topiwala, LeBrun-Singer, and Donaldson.\n  In 1981, Page asked whether the above construction can be modified by\nreversing the orientations of some of the Eguchi-Hanson manifolds. This is a\nsubtle question: if successful, this construction would produce Einstein\nmetrics which are neither K\\\"ahler nor self-dual.\n  In this paper, we focus on a configuration of maximal symmetry involving $8$\nsmall Eguchi-Hanson manifolds of each orientation which are arranged according\nto a chessboard pattern.

The evaluation relies on\nsolving an \"optimal embedding equation\" whose solutions represent critical\npoints of the quasi-local energy.

In $3$-dimension, Shi-Tam's result is known to be\nequivalent to the Riemannian positive mass theorem.\n  In this paper, we provide a supplement to Shi-Tam's result by including the\neffect of minimal hypersurfaces on the boundary. More precisely, given a\ncompact manifold $\\Omega$ with nonnegative scalar curvature, assuming its\nboundary consists of two parts, $\\Sigma_h$ and $\\Sigma_o$, where $\\Sigma_h$ is\nthe union of all closed minimal hypersurfaces in $\\Omega$ and $\\Sigma_o$ is\nisometric to a suitable $2$-convex hypersurface $\\Sigma$ in a spatial\nSchwarzschild manifold of positive mass $m$, we establish an inequality\nrelating $m$, the area of $\\Sigma_h$, and two weighted total mean curvatures of\n$\\Sigma_o$ and $ \\Sigma$.

Comparison with\nthe observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in\nlow-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition.\nCombined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that\nlow-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still\nundergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets\nlosing all primordial H/He. For planets in this \"triangle of evaporation\" in\nthe distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced.

A procedure for constructing examples is given. The\ndiscussion of symplectic holonomy reductions of projective structures leads us\nmoreover to a new and simplifying approach to contact projective geometry.

In\nparticular, complete self-dual Einstein metrics are constructed on\nsimply-connected non-compact 4-manifolds with arbitrary second Betti number.\n  Deformations of these self-dual Einstein metrics are also constructed: they\ncome in families parameterized, roughly speaking, by free functions of one real\nvariable.\n  All the metrics constructed here are toric (that is, the isometry group\ncontains a 2-torus) and are essentially explicit. The key to the construction\nis the remarkable fact that toric self-dual Einstein metrics are given quite\ngenerally in terms of linear partial differential equations on the hyperbolic\nplane. \n\n"}

In particular we consider\nconnections defined in terms of pairs (A,B), where A is a connection for a\nfixed principal bundle P(M,G) and B is a 2-form on M. The relevant curvatures,\nparallel transports and holonomies are computed and their expressions in local\ncoordinates are exhibited. When the 2-form B is given by the curvature of A,\nthen the so-called non-abelian Stokes formula follows.\n  For a generic 2-form B, we distinguish the cases when the parallel transport\ndepends on the whole path of paths and when it depends only on the spanned\nsurface. In particular we discuss generalizations of the non-abelian Stokes\nformula. We study also the invariance properties of the (trace of the) holonomy\nunder suitable transformation groups acting on the pairs (A,B).\n  In this way we are able to define observables for both topological and\nnon-topological quantum field theories of the BF type. In the non topological\ncase, the surface terms may be relevant for the understanding of the\nquark-confinement problem.

{"id": "math/9812060", "contents": "Title: Donaldson invariants and wall-crossing formulas. I: Continuity of gluing\n  maps Abstract: The present article is the first in a series whose ultimate goal is to prove\nthe Kotschick-Morgan conjecture concerning the wall-crossing formula for the\nDonaldson invariants of a four-manifold with b^+ = 1. The conjecture asserts\nthat the wall-crossing terms due to changes in the metric depend at most on the\nhomotopy type of the four-manifold and the degree of the invariant. Our\nprincipal interest in this conjecture is due to the fact that its proof is\nexpected to resemble that of an important intermediate step towards a proof of\nWitten's conjecture concerning the relation between Donaldson and\nSeiberg-Witten invariants (hep-th/9411102, hep-th/9709193), using PU(2)\nmonopoles as described in (dg-ga/9709022, dg-ga/9712005). Moreover, it affords\nus another venue in which to address some of the technical difficulties arising\nin our work on Witten's conjecture. The additional difficulties in the case of\nPU(2) monopoles are due to the more complicated gluing theory, the presence of\nobstructions to deformation and gluing, and the need to consider links of\npositive-dimensional families of `reducibles' even in the presence of `simple\ntype' assumptions.
