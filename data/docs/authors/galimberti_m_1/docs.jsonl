The dependence of the critical Rm_c vs. the\nhydrodynamic Reynolds number Re is obtained for 1<Re<6700. In the limit Pm<<1,\nRm_c is ~3 times larger than for Pm>1.

By comparing the PN expansion of the energy flux to numerical\ncalculations in the perturbative Teukolsky formalism, we show that (i) the\ninclusion of higher multipoles is necessary to establish the accuracy of\nhigh-order PN terms, and (ii) the region of validity of PN theory is largest at\nrelative O(1/c^6) (3PN order).

The soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2\nkeV band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured Seyfert\n1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction we\nmeasure (R_disc ~0.4).

Our study serves as\na prelude to our analysis of the circular binary WDNS problem. We focus on\ncompact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a cold\ndegenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of such\nsystems. A fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realistic\nWDNS head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical time\nscales and length scales involved. For this reason, we construct an equation of\nstate (EOS) which captures the main physical features of NSs while, at the same\ntime, scales down the size of WDs. We call these scaled-down WD models\n\"pseudo-WDs (pWDs)\". Using pWDs, we can study these systems via a sequence of\nsimulations where the size of the pWD gradually increases toward the realistic\ncase. We perform two sets of simulations; One set studies the effects of the NS\nmass on the final outcome, when the pWD is kept fixed. The other set studies\nthe effect of the pWD compaction on the final outcome, when the pWD mass and\nthe NS are kept fixed.

Using multi-band photometry from GROND and\nSwift/UVOT, photo-zs are derived for five GRBs for which spectroscopic\nredshifts are not available. We use UV/optical/NIR data and synthetic\nphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometric\nredshifts of GRBs and their accuracy. Taking into account the afterglow\nsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometry\nto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. The\nmeasurement of photo-zs for GRB afterglows provides a quick, robust and\nreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly in\nthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/NIR range cannot be\nobtained. Given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, the\nrelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and better\nthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. We detail the approach on 5 sources without\nspectroscopic redshifts observed with UVOT on-board Swift and/or GROND. The\ndistance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be\n$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for GRB 080825B, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for GRB\n080906, $z=3.44^{+0.15}_{-0.32}$ for GRB 081228, $z=2.03^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ for\nGRB 081230 and $z=1.28^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for GRB 090530. Combining the response\nfrom UVOT with ground-based observatories and in particular GROND operating in\nthe optical/NIR wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z ~\n1.0 out to z ~ 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorable\ncases, provided that these GRBs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficiently\nbright afterglows and are not heavily obscured. \n\n"}

The\nmotivation comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of $\\sim\n10^{15}$G, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after the\nmagnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong toroidal magnetic\nfields. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidal\nmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of\nrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and\nrigidly rotating models. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler\ninstabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. For both\nnon-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary\ninstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The\ninterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is\nthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in\nthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,\nunstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is\ndeveloped. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.\nContrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an\nequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence. This conclusion\nsuggests that three-dimensional simulation is indispensable for exploring the\nformation of magnetars or prominence activities of magnetars such as giant\nflares. \n\n"}

If the\nmetric becomes degenerate (as in singular semi-Riemannian geometry), these\nconstructions no longer work, because they are based on the inverse of the\nmetric, and on related operations like the contraction between covariant\nindices. In this article we develop the geometry of singular semi-Riemannian\nmanifolds. First, we introduce an invariant and canonical contraction between\ncovariant indices, applicable even for degenerate metrics. This contraction\napplies to a special type of tensor fields, which are radical-annihilator in\nthe contracted indices. Then, we use this contraction and the Koszul form to\ndefine the covariant derivative for radical-annihilator indices of covariant\ntensor fields, on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds named\nradical-stationary. We use this covariant derivative to construct the Riemann\ncurvature, and show that on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds,\nnamed semi-regular, the Riemann curvature is smooth. We apply these results to\nconstruct a version of Einstein's tensor whose density of weight 2 remains\nsmooth even in the presence of semi-regular singularities. We can thus write a\ndensitized version of Einstein's equation, which is smooth, and which is\nequivalent to the standard Einstein equation if the metric is non-degenerate. \n\n"}

By means of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we\ninvestigate particle acceleration and magnetic field dissipation at the\ntermination shock of a relativistic striped wind. At the shock, the flow\ncompresses and the alternating fields annihilate by driven magnetic\nreconnection. Irrespective of the stripe wavelength \"lambda\" or the wind\nmagnetization \"sigma\" (in the regime sigma>>1 of magnetically-dominated flows),\nshock-driven reconnection transfers all the magnetic energy of alternating\nfields to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases by a factor of\nsigma with respect to the pre-shock value. The shape of the post-shock spectrum\ndepends primarily on the ratio lambda/(r_L*sigma), where r_L is the\nrelativistic Larmor radius in the wind. The spectrum becomes broader as the\nvalue of lambda/(r_L*sigma) increases, passing from a relativistic Maxwellian\nto a flat power-law tail with slope around -1.5, populated by particles\naccelerated by the reconnection electric field. Close to the equatorial plane\nof the wind, where the stripes are symmetric, the highest energy particles\nresulting from magnetic reconnection can escape ahead of the shock, and be\ninjected into a Fermi-like acceleration process.

The possibility of a single SMBHB being tracked first by PTA, through\ninspiral, and later by SLI, up to merger and ring down, has been previously\nsuggested. Although the bounding parameters are drawn by the current PTA or the\nupcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and by the New Gravitational Observatory\n(NGO), derived from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), this paper\nalso addresses sequential detection beyond specific project constraints.

The orbital evolution is thus equivalent to\nsolving the geodesic equations with time-dependent orbital elements, as\ndictated by the MPM radiation-reaction prescription. To complete the scheme,\nboth the orbital evolution and wave generation require to map the\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinates of the orbits to the harmonic coordinates in which\nthe different MPM quantities have been derived, a mapping that we provide\nexplicitly in this paper. This new kludge scheme is thus a combination of\napproximations that can be used to model generic inspirals of systems with\nextreme mass ratios to systems with more moderate mass ratios, and hence can\nprovide valuable information for future space-based gravitational-wave\nobservatories like LISA and even for advanced ground detectors. Finally, due to\nthe local character in time of our MPM self-force, this scheme can be used to\nperform studies of the possible appearance of transient resonances in generic\ninspirals. \n\n"}

In contrast, because of their higher charge, iron-peaked nuclei\nare still accelerated to the highest observed energies at later times, when the\nenvelope has become thin enough to allow their escape. Ultrahigh energy iron\nnuclei escape newly-born pulsars with millisecond periods and dipole magnetic\nfields of ~10^(12-13) G, embedded in core-collapse supernovae. Due to the\nproduction of secondary nucleons, the envelope crossing leads to a transition\nof composition from light to heavy elements at a few EeV, as observed by the\nAuger Observatory. The escape also results in a softer spectral slope than that\ninitially injected via unipolar induction, which allows for a good fit to the\nobserved UHECR spectrum. We conclude that the acceleration of iron-peaked\nelements in a reasonably small fraction (< 0.01%) of extragalactic\nrotation-powered young pulsars would reproduce satisfactorily the current UHECR\ndata. Possible signatures of this scenario are also discussed. \n\n"}

The\nChimera scheme is a hybrid method that combines tools from different\napproximation techniques in General Relativity: (i) A multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (the\ngravitational waveforms) and for the local prescription of the self-force; (ii)\na post-Newtonian expansion for the computation of the multipole moments in\nterms of the trajectories; and (iii) a BH perturbation theory expansion when\ntreating the trajectories as a sequence of self-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The\nEMRI trajectory is made out of Kerr geodesic fragments joined via the method of\nosculating elements as dictated by the multipolar post-Minkowskian\nradiation-reaction prescription.

Confirming previous studies, we find the\npresence of a high-energy MeV tail beyond a thermal-Comptonization spectrum;\nhowever, the tail is much softer and weaker than that recently published by\nLaurent et al. In spite of this difference, the observed high-energy tail could\nstill be due to the synchrotron emission of the jet of Cyg X-1, as claimed by\nLaurent et al.\n  To test this possibility, we study optically-thin synchrotron and\nself-Compton emission from partially self-absorbed jets. We develop formalisms\nfor calculating both emission of the jet base (which we define here as the\nregion where the jet starts its emission) and emission of the entire jet. We\nrequire the emission to match that observed at the turnover energy. The\noptically thin emission is dominated by that from the jet base, and it has to\nbecome self-absorbed within it at the turnover frequency. We find this implies\nthe magnetic field strength at the jet base of B_0 prop. to z_0^4, where z_0 is\nthe distance of the base from the black-hole centre. The value of B_0 is then\nconstrained from below by the condition that the self-Compton emission is below\nan upper limit in the GeV range, and from above by the condition that the\nPoynting flux does not exceed the jet kinetic power. This yields B_0 of the\norder of ~10^4 G and the location of the jet base at ~10^3 gravitational radii.\nUsing our formalism, we find the MeV tail can be due to jet synchrotron\nemission, but this requires the electron acceleration at a rather hard\npower-law index, p~1.3-1.6.

Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace. This includes a Chern-Simons parameter that controls the strength of\ngravitational deviations from General Relativity. We find that, if Dynamical\nChern-Simons Modified Gravity is the correct theory, an observatory like LISA\nor even eLISA/NGO should be able to measure the Chern-Simons parameter with\nfractional errors below 5%. If General Relativity is the true theory, these\nobservatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4\nkm, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds. \n\n"}

In terms of the\ndetection prospects of the background signal, we show that: (i) detection (a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 3) within one year of observation by the Advanced LIGO\ndetectors (H1-L1) requires a coalescence rate of $r_0 = 3 (0.2) Mpc^{-3}\nMyr^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars (binary black holes); (ii) this limit on\n$r_0$ could be reduced 3-fold for two co-located detectors, whereas the\ncurrently proposed worldwide network of advanced instruments gives only ~ 30%\nimprovement in detectability; (iii) the improved sensitivity of the planned\nEinstein Telescope allows not only confident detection of the background but\nalso the high frequency components of the spectrum to be measured.

If this\nscenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of\nstrong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,\nVirgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search.

A fading of the optical-infrared (IR) flux occurred\nas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening as\nit returned to the hard state. The optical-IR spectrum was consistent with a\npower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the X-ray\nspectrum was softest. By fitting the radio to optical spectra with a broken\npower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thin\nbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. The break gradually shifted to higher\nfrequencies as the source hardened at X-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x\n10^13 Hz. The radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared to\nbe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay\n(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seen\ndirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time.

In order to develop this investigation we construct the complete\nset of fermionic mode functions obeying a general quasiperiodicity condition\nalong the compactified dimension. The vacuum expectation value of the azimuthal\ncurrent density is decomposed into two parts. The first one corresponds to the\nuncompactified cosmic string geometry and the second one is the correction\ninduced by the compactification. For the first part we provide a closed\nexpression which includes various special cases previously discussed in the\nliterature. The second part is an odd periodic function of the magnetic flux\nalong the string axis with the period equal to the flux quantum and it is an\neven function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the string axis. The\ncompactification of the cosmic string axis in combination with the\nquasiperiodicity condition leads to the nonzero axial current density.

An \"off-axis\" GRB burst (i.e. whose relativistic jet points away\nfrom us) is expected to have late-time radio emission even in the absence of\nsignificant prompt gamma-ray emission.

Depending on the total initial mass of the system, and the NS\nequation of state (EOS), the post-merger phase can see a prompt collapse to a\nblack hole, or the formation of a supramassive NS, or even a stable NS. In the\ncase of post-merger NS (PMNS) formation, magnetic field amplification during\nthe merger will produce a magnetar with a large induced mass quadrupole moment,\nand millisecond spin. If the timescale for orthogonalization of the magnetic\nsymmetry axis with the spin axis is sufficiently short the NS will radiate its\nspin down energy primarily via GWs. Here we study this scenario for various\noutcomes of NS formation: we generalise the set of equilibrium states for a\ntwisted torus magnetic configuration to include solutions that, at a fixed\nexterior dipole field, carry a larger magnetic energy reservoir; we hence\ncompute their magnetic ellipticity and the strength of the expected GW signal\nas a function of the magnitude of the dipole and toroidal field. The relative\nnumber of GW detections from PMNSs and from binary NSs is a strong function of\nthe NS equation of state (EOS), being higher (~ 1%) for the stiffest EOSs and\nnegligibly small for the softest ones. For intermediate-stiffness EOSs, such as\nthe n=4/7 polytrope recently used by Giacomazzo \\& Perna or the GM1 used by\nLasky et al., the relative fraction is ~0.3%; correspondingly we estimate a GW\ndetection rate from stable PMNSs of ~ (0.1-1) yr$^{-1}$ with Advanced\ndetectors, and of ~ (100-1000) yr$^{-1}$ with third generation detectors such\nas the Einstein Telescope. Measurement of such GW signal would provide strong\nconstraints on the NS EOS and on the nature of the binary progenitors giving\nrise to SGRBs. \n\n"}

In this paper, we consider the evolution of\nlinear fluctuations around highly symmetric though inhomogeneous backgrounds.\nWe demonstrate that a large degree of asymmetry develops over time from tiny\nfluctuations superposed upon planar and SO(2,1) symmetric backgrounds.

We\nconsider the limit of two colliding planar walls, with fluctuation mode\nfunctions characterized by the wavenumber transverse to the collision direction\nand a longitudinal shape along the collision direction $x$, which we solve for.\nInitially, the fluctuations obey a linear wave equation with a time- and\nspace-dependent mass $m_{eff}(x,t)$.

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the universe is made of a single dark fluid\ndescribed by a logotropic equation of state $P=A\\ln(\\rho/\\rho_*)$, where $\\rho$\nis the rest-mass density, $\\rho_*$ is a reference density, and $A$ is the\nlogotropic temperature. The energy density $\\epsilon$ is the sum of two terms:\na rest-mass energy term $\\rho c^2$ that mimics dark matter and an internal\nenergy term $u(\\rho)=-P(\\rho)-A$ that mimics dark energy. This decomposition\nleads to a natural, and physical, unification of dark matter and dark energy,\nand elucidates their mysterious nature. The logotropic model depends on a\nsingle parameter $B=A/\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2$ where $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ is the\ncosmological density. For $B=0$, we recover the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Using\ncosmological constraints, we find that $0\\le B\\le 0.09425$. We consider the\npossibility that dark matter halos are described by the same logotropic\nequation of state. When $B>0$, pressure gradients prevent gravitational\ncollapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles, in\nagreement with the observations. The universal rotation curve of logotropic\ndark matter halos is consistent with the observational Burkert profile up to\nthe halo radius. Interestingly, if we assume that all the dark matter halos\nhave the same logotropic temperature $B$, we find that their surface density\n$\\Sigma=\\rho_0 r_h$ is constant.

The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is\nimaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to\nreconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the\nadvantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution. To\ntest the feasibility of our new method, we have carried out simulations with a\ntoy-model based on the geometrical parameters of ASTRI SST-2M, i.e. the imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescope currently under installation onto the Etna\nvolcano. Comparing the results of our simulations with previous experiments\nbased on particle detectors, we gain at least a factor of 10 in sensitivity.\nThe result of this study shows that we resolve an empty cylinder with a radius\nof about 100 m located inside a volcano in less than 4 days, which implies a\nlimit on the magma velocity of 5 m/h. \n\n"}

The Radio View Abstract: Gamma-ray detected radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (g-NLS1) galaxies\nconstitute a small but interesting sample of the gamma-ray loud AGN. The\nradio-loudest g-NLS1 known, PKS 2004-447, is located in the southern hemisphere\nand is monitored in the radio regime by the multiwavelength monitoring program\nTANAMI.

The TANAMI VLBI\nmonitoring program uses the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and telescopes\nin Antarctica, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa to monitor the jets of\nradio-loud active galaxies in the southern hemisphere. Lower resolution radio\nflux density measurements at multiple radio frequencies over four years of\nobservations were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).\nThe TANAMI VLBI image at 8.4 GHz shows an extended one-sided jet with a\ndominant compact VLBI core. Its brightness temperature is consistent with\nequipartition, but it is an order of magnitude below other g-NLS1s with the\nsample value varying over two orders of magnitude. We find a compact morphology\nwith a projected large-scale size <11 kpc and a persistent steep radio spectrum\nwith moderate flux-density variability. PKS 2004-447 appears to be a unique\nmember of the g-NLS1 sample. It exhibits blazar-like features, such as a flat\nfeatureless X-ray spectrum and a core dominated, one-sided parsec-scale jet\nwith indications for relativistic beaming. However, the data also reveal\nproperties atypical for blazars, such as a radio spectrum and large-scale size\nconsistent with Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) objects, which are usually\nassociated with young radio sources.

The computation entails a subtle interplay between\nthe near (or potential) and far (or radiation) zones. In particular, we find\nthat the tail contribution to the effective action is non-local in time, and\nfeatures both a dissipative and a `conservative' term. The latter includes a\nlogarithmic ultraviolet (UV) divergence, which we show cancels against an\ninfrared (IR) singularity found in the (conservative) near zone. The origin of\nthis behavior in the long-distance EFT is due to the point-particle limit\n-shrinking the binary to a point- which transforms a would-be infrared\nsingularity into an ultraviolet divergence. This is a common occurrence in an\nEFT approach, which furthermore allows us to use renormalization group (RG)\ntechniques to resum the resulting logarithmic contributions.

One important observational clue that remains not properly\ninterpreted so far is the existence of time lags of broad light curve pulses in\ndifferent energy bands, named \"spectral lags\".

Rather, the observed\nspectral lags demand the sweep of a spectral peak across the observing energy\nband in a specific manner.

To test this hypothesis\nwe have studied a ULX where the wind is strong enough to cause significant\nabsorption of the hard X-ray continuum: NGC 55 ULX. The RGS spectrum of NGC 55\nULX shows a wealth of emission and absorption lines blueshifted by significant\nfractions of the light speed (0.01 - 0.20)c indicating the presence of a\npowerful wind. The wind has a complex dynamical structure with the ionization\nstate increasing with the outflow velocity, which may indicate launching from\ndifferent regions of the accretion disk. The comparison with other ULXs such as\nNGC 1313 X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1 suggests that NGC 55 ULX is being observed at\nhigher inclination. The wind partly absorbs the source flux above 1 keV,\ngenerating a spectral drop similar to that observed in ULSs. The softening of\nthe spectrum at lower (~ Eddington) luminosities and the detection of a soft\nlag agree with the scenario of wind clumps crossing the line of sight, partly\nabsorbing and reprocessing the hard X-rays from the innermost region. \n\n"}

Abstract: General relativity is a set of physical and geometric principles, which lead\nto a set of (Einstein) field equations that determine the gravitational field,\nand to the geodesic equations that describe light propagation and the motion of\nparticles on the background.

What is the\nlargest scale on which matter can be coarse grained while following a geodesic\nof a solution to Einstein's equations? We address these questions. If the field\nequations are causal evolution equations, whose average on cosmological scales\nis not an exact solution of the Einstein equations, then some simplifying\nphysical principle is required to explain the statistical homogeneity of the\nlate epoch Universe. Such a principle may have its origin in the dynamical\ncoupling between matter and geometry at the quantum level in the early\nUniverse.

The\nmain focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component\nwhich are called rotating Sauter pulses.

In the previous work it\nwas proposed to extend the gravity theory to allow free initial conditions,\nwith a motivation to solve the cosmological constant problem.

In two-dimensional systems, Alfv\\'enic outflows expel\nenergetic electrons into flux ropes where they become trapped and disconnected\nfrom acceleration regions. However, in three-dimensional systems these flux\nropes develop axial structure that enables particles to leak out and return to\nacceleration regions.

Abstract: A notion of localization of information within quantum subsystems plays a key\nrole in describing the physics of quantum systems, and in particular is a\nprerequisite for discussing important concepts such as entanglement and\ninformation transfer. While subsystems can be readily defined for finite\nquantum systems and in local quantum field theory, a corresponding definition\nfor gravitational systems is significantly complicated by the apparent\nnonlocality arising due to gauge invariance, enforced by the constraints. A\nrelated question is whether \"soft hair\" encodes otherwise localized\ninformation, and the question of such localization also remains an important\npuzzle for proposals that gravity emerges from another structure such as a\nboundary field theory as in AdS/CFT. This paper describes different approaches\nto defining local subsystem structure, and shows that at least classically,\nperturbative gravity has localized subsystems based on a split structure,\ngeneralizing the split property of quantum field theory. This, and related\narguments for QED, give simple explanations that in these theories there is\nlocalized information that is independent of fields outside a region, in\nparticular so that there is no role for \"soft hair\" in encoding such\ninformation. Additional subtleties appear in quantum gravity.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

Here the\nquantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels\nof the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates\n$\\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event\ncorresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy\nlevel to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in\nturn spins-up the ambient medium.

The observed outflow energetics, in particular the large measured\nvalues of the momentum ratio ($\\dot{p}/(L/c) \\sim 10$) and energy ratio\n($\\dot{E}_k/L \\sim 0.05$), seems to favour the energy-driving mechanism; and\nmost observational works have focused their comparison with wind energy-driven\nmodels.

In particular,\nwe predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass outflow rate ($\\dot{M} \\propto\nL^{1/2}$) and a super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\\dot{E}_k \\propto\nL^{3/2}$), in agreement with the observational scaling relations reported in\nthe most recent compilation of AGN outflow data.

Its\ndynamical variables are a canonical conjugate pair of real symmetric\nthree-index tensors, and a question in this model was how to extract spacetime\npictures from the tensors. We give such an extraction procedure by using two\ntechniques widely known in data analysis. One is the tensor-rank (or CP, etc.)\ndecomposition, which is a certain generalization of the singular value\ndecomposition of a matrix and decomposes a tensor into a number of vectors. By\nregarding the vectors as points forming a space, topological properties can be\nextracted by using the other data analysis technique called persistent\nhomology, and geometries by virtual diffusion processes over points. Thus, time\nevolutions of the tensors in the CTM can be interpreted as topological and\ngeometric evolutions of spaces. We have performed some initial investigations\nof the classical equation of motion of the CTM in terms of these techniques for\na homogeneous fuzzy circle and homogeneous two- and three-dimensional fuzzy\nspheres as spaces, and have obtained agreement with the general relativistic\nsystem obtained previously in a formal continuum limit of the CTM.

However, most existing treatments of this background beyond GR\noverlook modifications to the energy carried by gravitational waves, or rely on\nGR assumptions that are invalid in other theories. This may lead to\nmistranslation between the observable cross-correlation of detector outputs and\ngravitational-wave energy density, and thus to errors when deriving\nobservational constraints on theories. In this article, we lay out a generic\nformalism for stochastic gravitational- wave searches, applicable to a large\nfamily of theories beyond GR.

As the target of detection, the\nanalytical spectrum of RGWs generated during inflation is described by three\nparameters: the tensor-scalar ratio, the spectral index and the running index.\nFor RGW detection, we analyze the auto-correlated signals for a single\ninterferometer, and the cross-correlated, integrated as well as un-integrated\nsignals for a pair of interferometers, and give SNR for RGW, and obtain lower\nlimits of the RGW parameters that can be detected. By suppressing noise level,\na pair has a sensitivity 2 orders better than a single for one year\nobservation. SNR of LISA will be 4-5 orders higher than that of Advanced LIGO\nfor the default RGW. To estimate the spectrum, we adopt the maximum likelihood\n(ML) estimation, calculate the mean and covariance of signals, obtain the\nGaussian probability density function (PDF) and the likelihood function, and\nderive the expressions for the Fisher matrix and the equation of the ML\nestimate for the spectrum. The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the\nequation by iteration. When the noise is dominantly large, a single LISA is not\neffective for estimating the RGW spectrum as the actual noise in signals is not\nknown accurately. For cross-correlating a pair, the spectrum can not be\nestimated from the integrated output signals either, and only one parameter can\nbe estimated with the other two being either fixed or marginalized. We use the\nensemble averaging method to estimate the RGW spectrum from the un-integrated\noutput signals. We also adopt a correlation of un-integrated signals to\nestimate the spectrum and three parameters of RGW in a Bayesian approach.

An assessment of\nLISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties\nof MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this\naim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within\ntheir host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the\nbinaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is\ndriven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel\nchannel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black\nhole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with\nphysically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the\norbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between $\\approx 25$ and\n$\\approx 75$ events per year depending on the seed model.

If those fields are light during inflation (this is a generic situation\nin the minimal models of supersymmetric inflation) they will fluctuate leading\nto density perturbations through the proposed mechanism.

We stress that we do not\nclaim to have a satisfactory answer to this question, rather our intention is\nto ignite a discussion by displaying the problems that have to be solved when\ncarrying out such a program. In the present paper we propose a scheme that one\nmight follow in order to arrive at such a limit. We discuss the technical and\nconceptual problems that arise in doing so and how they can be solved in\nprinciple. As to be expected, completely new issues arise due to the fact that\nQGR is a background independent theory. For instance, fundamentally the notion\nof a photon involves not only the Maxwell quantum field but also the metric\noperator - in a sense, there is no photon vacuum state but a \"photon vacuum\noperator\"!

A gyraton may be considered as a classical toy model\nfor a quantum wave packet of high-energy particles with spin. In this paper we\nstudy a head-on collision of two gyratons and black hole formation in this\nprocess. The goal of this study is to understand the role of the gravitational\nspin-spin interaction in the process of mini-black-hole formation in particle\ncollisions. To simplify the problem we consider several gyraton models with\nspecial profiles of the energy and spin density distribution. For these models\nwe study the apparent horizon (AH) formation on the future edge of a spacetime\nregion before interaction. We demonstrate that the AH forms only if the energy\nduration and the spin are smaller than some critical values, while the length\nof the spin distribution should be at least of the order of the system\ngravitational radius. We also study gravitational spin-spin interaction in the\nhead-on collision of two gyratons under the assumption that the values of\ngyraton spins are small. We demonstrate that the metric in the interaction\nregion for such gyratons depends on the relative helicities of incoming\ngyratons, and the collision of gyratons with oppositely directed spins allows\nthe AH formation in a larger parameter region than in the collision of the\ngyratons with the same direction of spins.

The starting point of the method is the direct\ncomputation of the functional derivatives of the Euclidean one-loop effective\naction with respect to the background metric. This method, when available,\ngives rise to a conserved stress tensor and produces the conformal anomaly\nformula directly. It is proven that the obtained stress tensor agrees with\nstatistical mechanics in the case of a finite temperature theory. The\nrenormalization procedure is controlled by the structure of the poles of the\nstress-tensor $\\zeta$ function. The infinite renormalization is automatic and\nis due to a ``magic'' cancellation of two poles. The remaining finite\nrenormalization involves conserved geometrical terms arising by a certain\nresidue. Such terms renormalize coupling constants of the geometric part of\nEinstein's equations (customary generalized through high-order curvature\nterms). The method is checked on particular cases (closed and open Einstein`s\nuniverse) finding agreement with other approaches.

This structure implies a natural division of the\nasymptotic domains of the moduli space into regions which can/cannot be mapped\nto Type II string theory or 11D Supergravity (SUGRA) with large radii.

The safe domain is the interior of the\nfuture light cone in the moduli space while the unsafe domain contains the\nspacelike region and the past light cone.

Also, there are some indications that the radical version of the\nholographic theory in the context of cosmology may have problems with unitarity\nand causality. Another formulation of the holographic principle, due to\nFischler and Susskind, implies that the entropy of matter inside the\npost-inflationary particle horizon must be smaller than the area of the\nhorizon.
