Top quarks were first\nobserved in pair production in 1995, and since then, single top quark\nproduction has been searched for in ever larger datasets. In this analysis, we\nselect events from a 0.9 fb-1 dataset that have an electron or muon and missing\ntransverse energy from the decay of a W boson from the top quark decay, and\ntwo, three, or four jets, with one or two of the jets identified as originating\nfrom a b hadron decay.

It is known that there are four types of\nsuch models corresponding to the possible different assignment of charges for\nthe discrete symmetry on quarks and leptons.

Recent observations from the\nSpitzer Space Telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess of\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the LMC. This is the first time we can\nquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from AGB stars over a complete\ngalaxy, fully based on observations. The integrated mass-loss rate over all\nintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich AGB candidates in the LMC is\n8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. This number\ncould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich stars\nare included. This is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,\nconsidering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass stars\nwhere formed, and the initial mass functions. AGB stars are one of the most\nimportant gas sources in the LMC, with supernovae (SNe), which produces about\n2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year.

We investigate how upcoming astrophysical experiments will\nexplore the existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10^-33eV to\n10^-10eV. Axions with masses between 10^-33eV to 10^-28eV cause a rotation of\nthe CMB polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted\nrotation angle is of order \\alpha~1/137. Axions in the mass range 10^-28eV to\n10^-18eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, that will be\nprobed by upcoming galaxy surveys.

Here, we estimate\nthe overall probabilities for lensing by substructures in a host halo closely\naligned to the line of sight to a background quasar.

However, during the contraction, in general the anisotropy of the\nuniverse grows and eventually leads to a chaotic mixmaster behavior.

In this letter we propose a new mechanism to solve the anisotropy\nproblem for any low-energy value of $w$ by arguing that high energy physics\nleads to a modification of the equation of state, with the introduction of\nnon-linear terms. In such a scenario, the anisotropy is strongly suppressed\nduring the high energy phase, allowing for a graceful isotropic bounce, even\nwhen the low-energy value of $w$ is smaller than unity. \n\n"}

The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2. The latter is described by a homogeneous,\nbut negative, refractive index. It has been suggested that the fisheye makes a\nperfect lens without negative refraction [Leonhardt, Philbin\narxiv:0805.4778v2]. However, we point out that the definition of\nsuper-resolution in such a heterogeneous medium should be computed with respect\nto the wavelength in a homogenized medium, and it is perhaps more adequate to\ntalk about a conjugate image rather than a perfect image (the former does not\nnecessarily contains the evanescent components of the source).

In\nparticular, it has been suggested by some authors that the pulsation growth\nrate in a RSG can be high enough to trigger an unusually strong wind (or a\nsuper-wind), when the luminosity to mass ratio becomes sufficiently large.\nUsing both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stellar evolution models with initial\nmasses ranging from 15 to 40 \\Msun, we investigate 1) how the pulsation growth\nrate depends on the global parameters of supergiant stars, and 2) what would be\nthe consequences of a pulsation-driven super-wind, if it occurred, for the late\nstages of massive star evolution. We suggest that such a super-wind history\nwould be marked by a runaway increase, followed by a sudden decrease, of the\nwinds mass loss rate. The impact on the late evolution of massive stars would\nbe substantial, with stars losing a huge fraction of their H-envelope even with\na significantly lower initial mass than previously predicted. This might\nexplain the observed lack of Type II-P supernova progenitors having initial\nmass higher than about 17 \\Msun.

Electroweak symmetry is broken at the UV (or Planck) scale where\nboundary mass terms are added to generate the fermion flavor structure.

Here we examine the distribution of various physical\nproperties as a function of r of 1040 luminous radio galaxies (RGs) at z<0.3\nfrom the SDSS, NVSS, and FIRST. About 2/3 of the RGs are lobe-dominated (LD),\nand 1/3 have prominent jets. If we follow the original definition of the FR\ntypes (a division based solely on r), FR I and FR II RGs overlap in their host\ngalaxy properties. However, the rare, LD sources with r>0.8 AND OIII5007 line\nluminosity >10^6 Lsun are markedly different on average from the rest of the\nRGs, in the sense that they are hosted in lower mass galaxies, live in\nrelatively sparse environments, and have higher accretion rates onto the\ncentral SMBH. Thus these objects and the rest of RGs form a well-defined\ndichotomy. Motivated by the stark differences in the nuclear emission line\nproperties of the RG subsamples, we suggest that the accretion rate onto the\nSMBH may play the primary role in creating the different morphologies. At\nrelatively high accretion rates, the accretion system may produce powerful jets\nthat create the \"classical double\" morphology (roughly corresponding to the LD\nsources with r>0.8 and emission lines); at lower accretion rates the jets from\na radiatively inefficient accretion flow generate radio lobes without apparent\n\"hot spots\" at the edge (corresponding to the majority of LD sources). At\nslightly lower accretion rates AND in galaxies with dense galactic structure,\nsources with prominent jets result. It is possible that while the high\naccretion rate systems could affect sub-Mpc scale environments, the jets from\nlower accretion rate systems may efficiently suppress activity within the host\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

I.\n  Classifying the Evolution of Size Distribution Abstract: Collisional growth of submicron-sized dust grains into macroscopic aggregates\nis the first step of planet formation in protoplanetary disks. These grains are\nexpected to carry nonzero negative charges in the weakly ionized disks, but its\neffect on their collisional growth has not been fully understood so far. In\nthis paper, we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust\nsize distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a\nweakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions.\nTo clarify the role of the size distribution, we divide our analysis into two\nsteps. First, we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming\na monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We show that the monodisperse\ngrowth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is\nmet, as is already expected in the previous work. Second, we numerically\nsimulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski's method to see how the outcome\nchanges when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve. We find that,\nunder certain conditions, the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a\nlimited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the\ndust mass in the system. This occurs because remaining small aggregates\nefficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being\nstrongly charged. We obtain a set of simple criteria that allows us to predict\nhow the size distribution evolves for a given condition. In Paper II\n(arXiv:1009.3101), we apply these criteria to dust growth in protoplanetary\ndisks. \n\n"}

The dense\ncores are identified in the simulated density data cube through a clumpfind\nalgorithm. We find that the core velocity dispersion does not show any clear\ndependence on the core size, in contrast to Larson's linewidth-size relation,\nbut consistent with recent observations. In the absence of a magnetic field,\nthe majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions. A\nmoderately-strong magnetic field reduces the dispersion to a subsonic or at\nmost transonic value typically. Most of the cores are out of virial\nequilibrium, with the external pressure dominating the self-gravity. The\nimplication is that the core evolution is largely controlled by the\noutflow-driven turbulence. Even an initially-weak magnetic field can retard\nstar formation significantly, because the field is amplified by the\noutflow-driven turbulence to an equipartition strength, with the distorted\nfield component dominating the uniform one. In contrast, for a\nmoderately-strong field, the uniform component remains dominant. Such a\ndifference in the magnetic structure is evident in our simulated polarization\nmaps of dust thermal emission; it provides a handle on the field strength.\nRecent polarization measurements show that the field lines in cluster-forming\nclumps are spatially well-ordered. It is indicative of a moderately-strong,\ndynamically important, field which, in combination with outflow feedback, can\nkeep the rate of star formation in embedded clusters at the\nobservationally-inferred, relatively-slow rate of several percent per free-fall\ntime. \n\n"}

The sample stars clearly trace a typical thick disk population with\npeaks at |Z|=1.26 kpc and [Fe/H]=-0.54. The vertical metallicity gradient of\nthe thick disk is estimated in two ways. One is a fit to the Gaussian peaks of\nthe metallicity histograms of the thick disk by subtracting minor contributions\nfrom the thin disk and the inner halo based on the Besancon Galaxy model. The\nresulting gradient is -0.12+-0.01 dex/kpc for 0.5 <|Z| <3 kpc. The other method\nis to linearly fit the data based on stars with 1 <|Z| <3 kpc being the main\ncomponent of the thick disk.

For\nevery linear model there exists a matrix representation for which the ReML\n(Restricted Maximum Likelihood) can be constructed from the elements of the\ncorresponding matrix. This method works in the standard manner when the\ncovariance structure is non-singular. It can also be used in the case where the\ncovariance structure is singular, because the method identifies particular\nnon-stochastic linear combinations of the observations which must be\nconstrained to zero.

This method is applied to the problem of determining the\nspatial size (vertex) for the Higgs Boson decay in the Higgs -> 4 lepton\nchannel. A comparison based on the Chi-Square variable from the vertex fit for\nHiggs signal and t-tbar background is presented and shows that the background\ncan be greatly suppressed using the Chi-Square variable.

Instead of considering a\nsingle tree per jet, we propose that multiple trees should be considered,\nweighted by an appropriate metric. Then each jet in each event produces a\ndistribution for an observable, rather than a single value. Advantages of this\napproach include: 1) observables have significantly increased statistical\nstability; and, 2) new observables, such as the variance of the distribution,\nprovide new handles for signal and background discrimination. For example, we\nfind that employing a set of trees substantially reduces the observed\nfluctuations in the pruned mass distribution, enhancing the likelihood of new\nparticle discovery for a given integrated luminosity. Furthermore, the\nresulting pruned mass distributions for (background) QCD jets are found to be\nsubstantially wider than that for (signal) jets with intrinsic mass scales,\ne.g. jets containing a W decay. A cut on this width yields a substantial\nenhancement in significance relative to a cut on the standard pruned jet mass\nalone. In particular the luminosity needed for a given significance requirement\ndecreases by a factor of two relative to standard pruning. \n\n"}

Dust formed in the ejecta then obscures the star.

Thereby the resonance character of hadronic\nexcitations is completely ignored. A more realistic description of hadron\nspectra can be achieved by including explicit mesonic degrees of freedom, which\ncouple directly to the constituent quarks. We will present a coupled-channel\nformalism that describes such hybrid systems in a relativistically invariant\nway and allows for the decay of excited hadrons. The formalism is based on the\npoint-form of relativistic quantum mechanics. If the confining forces between\nthe (anti)quarks are described by instantaneous interactions it can be formally\nshown that the mass-eigenvalue problem for a system that consists of dynamical\n(anti)quarks and mesons reduces to a hadronic eigenvalue problem in which the\neigenstates of the pure confinement problem (bare hadrons) are coupled via\nmeson loops. The only point where the quark substructure enters are form\nfactors at the meson-(bare) hadron vertices. The physical picture that emerges\nresembles the kind of hadronic resonance model that has been developed by Sato\nand Lee and is now heavily used at the Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) to\nfix $N^\\ast$ properties. Our approach, however, is in a certain sense inverse\nto the one of Sato and Lee. Whereas they want to undress physical resonances to\nend up with bare quantities, we rather want to dress the bound-states resulting\nfrom a pure constituent quark model to end up with quantities that can be\ndirectly compared with experiment. The way how our approach works will be\nexemplified by means of a simple quark-antiquark-meson system. \n\n"}

In such statistically limited searches,\ndatasets are often amassed over periods of several years, during which the\ntrigger characteristics evolve and system performance can vary significantly.\nReliable production cross-section measurements and upper limits must take into\naccount a detailed understanding of the effective trigger inefficiency for\nevery selected candidate event.

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the new particle that has been observed at\n125 GeV is not the Standard Model (SM) Higgs, but instead the dilaton\nassociated with an approximate conformal symmetry that has been spontaneously\nbroken. We focus on dilatons that arise from theories of technicolor, or from\ntheories of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), that involve\nstrong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet. In the pNGB case, we are\nconsidering a framework where the Higgs particle is significantly heavier than\nthe dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed. In each of the technicolor\nand pNGB scenarios, we study both the case when the SM fermions and gauge\nbosons are elementary, and the case when they are composites of the strongly\ninteracting sector.

Since the AdS/CFT correspondence relates\nthe radion in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models to the dilaton, our results also\napply to RS models with the SM fields localized on the infrared brane, or in\nthe bulk.

The central\ntheme of the overview is to explore the implications of the recent discovery of\na Higgs like particle regarding the prospects for the discovery of\nsupersymmetry assuming that it is indeed the spin 0 CP even boson that enters\nin the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. The high mass of the\nHiggs like boson at $\\sim 125$ GeV points to the weak scale of supersymmetry\nthat enters in the loop correction to the Higgs boson mass, to be relatively\nhigh, i.e., in the TeV region. However, since more than one independent mass\nscales enter in softly broken supersymmetry, the allowed parameter space of\nsupersymmetric models can allow a small Higgs mixing parameter $\\mu$ and light\ngaugino masses consistent with a $\\sim 125$ GeV Higgs boson mass.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\\gamma}$ depend weakly on the\nassumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current\nexperimental bounds on these quantities. We apply this method and ALP\nparameters found from fitting 3C454.3 data to another flat-spectrum radio\nquasar PKS1222+216 (4C+21.35) data up to 400 GeV, as a consistency check, and\nfound good fit.

Observations of polarized radio emission show that large-scale\n(regular) magnetic fields in spiral galaxies are not axisymmetric, but\ngenerally stronger in interarm regions. In some nearby galaxies such as NGC\n6946 they are organized in narrow magnetic arms situated between the material\nspiral arms. Aims. The phenomenon of magnetic arms and their relation to the\noptical spiral arms (the material arms) call for an explanation in the\nframework of galactic dynamo theory. Several possibilities have been suggested\nbut are not completely satisfactory; here we attempt a consistent\ninvestigation. Methods. We use a 2D mean-field dynamo model in the no-z\napproximation and add injections of small-scale magnetic field, taken to result\nfrom supernova explosions, to represent the effects of dynamo action on smaller\nscales. This injection of small scale field is situated along the spiral arms,\nwhere star-formation mostly occurs. Results. A straightforward explanation of\nmagnetic arms as a result of modulation of the dynamo mechanism by material\narms struggles to produce pronounced magnetic arms, at least with realistic\nparameters, without introducing new effects such as a time lag between Coriolis\nforce and {\\alpha}-effect. In contrast, by taking into account explicitly the\nsmall-scale magnetic field that is injected into the arms by the action of the\nstar forming regions that are concentrated there, we can obtain dynamo models\nwith magnetic structures of various forms that can be compared with magnetic\narms.

We conclude that magnetic arms can be considered\nas coherent magnetic structures generated by large-scale dynamo action, and\nassociated with spatially modulated small-scale magnetic fluctuations, caused\nby enhanced star formation rates within the material arms. \n\n"}

This is independent of the mechanism responsible for SUSY breaking.\nAny model will have one Lightest SUSY Particle (LSP), and one Next to Lightest\nSUSY Particle (NLSP). In models with conserved R-parity, the NLSP must decay\nsolely to the LSP and the SM partner of the NLSP. Therefore, studying NLSP\nproduction and decay can be regarded as a \"simplified model without\nsimplification\": Any SUSY model will have such a process.\n  The NLSP could be any sparticle: a slepton, an electroweak-ino, or even a\nsquark. However, since there are only a finite number of sparticles, one can\nsystematically search for signals of all possible NLSP:s. This way, the entire\nspace of models that have a kinematicall y reachable NLSP can be covered. For\nany NLSP, the \"worst case\" can be determined, since the SUSY principle allows\nto calculate the cross-section once the NLSP nature and mass are given.

As a result, we\nfound 1547 superflares on 279 G-type dwarfs, which are much more than previous\n365 superflares on 148 stars.

It is interesting that this distribution is roughly on the\nsame line as that for solar flares. In the case of the Sun-like stars (with\nsurface temperature 5600-6000K and slowly rotating with a period longer than 10\ndays), the occurrence frequency of superflares with energy of 10^34 -10^35 erg\nis once in 800-5000 years.\n  We also studied long term (500 days) stellar brightness variation of these\nsuperflare stars, and found that in some G-type dwarfs the occurrence frequency\nof superflares was extremely high, ~ 57 superflares in 500 days (i.e., once in\n10 days).

Depending on\nthe structure of the stellar progenitor, each of these instabilities can\ndominate the evolution of the gain region prior to the onset of explosion, with\nimplications for the ensuing asymmetries. Here we examine the flow dynamics in\nthe neighborhood of explosion by means of parametric two-dimensional,\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic simulations for which the linear stability\nproperties are well understood. We find that systems for which the convection\nparameter is sub-critical (SASI-dominated) develop explosions once large-scale,\nhigh-entropy bubbles are able to survive for several SASI oscillation cycles.\nThese long-lived structures are seeded by the SASI during shock expansions.\nFinite-amplitude initial perturbations do not alter this outcome qualitatively,\nthough they can lead to significant differences in explosion times.\nSupercritical systems (convection-dominated) also explode by developing\nlarge-scale bubbles, though the formation of these structures is due to buoyant\nactivity.

The compressed mass spectrum and\nassociated low energy release from \\tw_1 and \\tz_2 three-body decay makes\nhiggsinos difficult to detect at LHC14, while the other sparticles might be\nheavy, and possibly even beyond LHC14 reach.

This\nproblem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass\nfractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic\nmean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a\nsignificant contribution from these regions. Here, we use a large suite of\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the clumpiness of density and\npressure and employ different variants of simulated physics, including\nradiative gas physics and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. We find\nthat density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of\nradius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial\nradius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous\ninfall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.\nDensity and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which\nprobes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of\nassembling. The angular power spectra of gas density and pressure show that the\nclumping signal is dominated by comparably large substructures with scales\n>R200/5, signaling the presence of gravitationally-driven \"super-clumping\". In\ncontrast, the angular power spectrum of the dark matter (DM) shows an almost\nuniform size distribution due to unimpeded subhalos. The quadrupolar anisotropy\ndominates the signal and correlates well across different radii as a result of\nthe prolateness of the DM potential. We provide a synopsis of the radial\ndependence of the clusters' non-equilibrium measures (kinetic pressure support,\nellipticity, and clumping) that all increase sharply beyond R200. \n\n"}

First of all, we evaluate expected\nexcluded regions for the mass of additional neutral Higgs bosons from direct\nsearches at the LHC with the 14 TeV collision energy in the two Higgs doublet\nmodels with a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry. Second, precision measurements of\nthe Higgs boson couplings at future experiments can be used for the indirect\nsearch of extended Higgs sectors if measured coupling constant with the gauge\nboson slightly deviates from the standard model value. In particular, in the\ntwo Higgs doublet model with the softly-broken discrete symmetry, there are\nfour types of Yukawa interactions, so that they can be discriminated by\nmeasuring the pattern of deviations in Yukawa coupling constants. Furthermore,\nwe can fingerprint various extended Higgs sectors with future precision data by\ndetecting the pattern of deviations in the coupling constants of the\nstandard-model-like Higgs boson.

A simple thermal\nfield theory analysis confirms that, under certain general conditions, this\ncomponent would develop a Bose-Einstein condensate in the early universe that,\nfor appropriate model parameters, could survive the ensuing cosmological\nevolution until now. The condensation of a dark matter component in equilibrium\nwith the thermal plasma is a relativistic process, hence the amount of matter\ndictated by the charge asymmetry is complemented by a hot relic density frozen\nout at the time of decoupling. Contrary to the case of ordinary WIMPs, dark\nmatter particles in a condensate must be lighter than a few tens of eV so that\nthe density from thermal relics is not too large. Big-Bang nucleosynthesis\nconstrains the temperature of decoupling to the scale of the QCD phase\ntransition or above.

Second, the computational loads should\nbe kept feasible even for millions of time series.

Isotropy and statistics of the CMB Abstract: We test the statistical isotropy and Gaussianity of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropies using observations made by the Planck satellite.\nOur results are based mainly on the full Planck mission for temperature, but\nalso include some polarization measurements.\n  In particular, we consider the CMB anisotropy maps derived from the\nmulti-frequency Planck data by several component-separation methods. For the\ntemperature anisotropies, we find excellent agreement between results based on\nthese sky maps over both a very large fraction of the sky and a broad range of\nangular scales, establishing that potential foreground residuals do not affect\nour studies.\n  Tests of skewness, kurtosis, multi-normality, N-point functions, and\nMinkowski functionals indicate consistency with Gaussianity, while a power\ndeficit at large angular scales is manifested in several ways, for example low\nmap variance. The results of a peak statistics analysis are consistent with the\nexpectations of a Gaussian random field. The \"Cold Spot\" is detected with\nseveral methods, including map kurtosis, peak statistics, and mean temperature\nprofile. We thoroughly probe the large-scale dipolar power asymmetry, detecting\nit with several independent tests, and address the subject of a posteriori\ncorrection.

Measurements of large-scale B-modes of\nthe CMB are considered to be the best method for probing gravitational waves\nfrom the cosmic inflation. Future CMB experiments will, however, suffer from\ncontamination by non-primordial B-modes, one source of which is the lensing\nB-modes. Delensing, therefore, will be required for further improvement of the\ndetection sensitivity for gravitational waves. Analyzing the use of the\ntwo-dimensional map of galaxy distribution provided by the SKA RC survey as a\nlensing mass tracer, we find that joint delensing using near future CMB\nexperiments and the SKA phase 1 will improve the constraints on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio by more than a factor of $\\sim 2$ compared to those\nwithout the delensing analysis.

The performance in\nmeasuring the ZH cross section using events in which the Higgs boson recoils\nagainst a Z boson which decays into a pair of muons or electrons has been\ndemonstrated based on full simulation of the ILD detector for three center of\nmass energies 250, 350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations (Pe-,Pe+)\n=(-80%, +30%) and (+80%, -30%).

With the\napproximation that the production vertex of the Higgs boson and toponia is\ncontact, and neglecting the P-wave toponia, we analytically calculated the\ndensity matrix for the production and decay of the toponia. Under these\nassumptions, the production spectrum of the toponia is solely determined by the\nspin quantum number, therefore the toponia can be either singlet or triplet. We\nfind that the production rate of the singlet toponium is highly suppressed, and\nbehaves just like the production of a P-wave toponia. In the case of the\ntriplet toponium, three completely independent CP observables, namely azimuthal\nangles of lepton and anti-lepton in the toponium rest-frame as well as their\nsum, are predicted based on our analytical results, and checked by using the\ntree-level event generator. The non-trivial correlations come from the\nlongitudinal-transverse interferences for the azimuthal angles of leptons, and\nthe transverse-transverse interference for their sum.

Tree level matching conditions for each case are worked out in the large\nmediator mass limit, defining a one to one correspondence between the effective\noperator coefficients and the simplified model parameters for weakly\ninteracting models. Utilizing such a mapping, we compute the dark matter\nannihilation rate in the early universe, as well as other low-energy\nobservables like nuclear recoil rates using the effective operators, while the\nsimplified models are used to compute the dark matter production rates at high\nenergy colliders like LEP, LHC and future lepton colliders.

We\ninterpret the decline phase of the cycles as a diffusion process.\n  The activity level of a given cycle begins to decline when the centers of its\nequatorward propagating activity belts come within their width (at half\nmaximum) from the equator. This happens earlier for stronger cycles because\ntheir activity belts are wider. From that moment on, the activity and the belt\nwidth decrease in the same manner for all cycles, independent of their maximum\nactivity level. In terms of diffusive cancellation of opposite-polarity\ntoroidal flux across the equator, we infer the turbulent diffusivity\nexperienced by the toroidal field, wherever it is located, to be in the range\n150--450~km$^2$s$^{-1}$. Strong diffusive latitudinal spreading of the toroidal\nflux underneath the activity belts can be inhibited by an inflow towards the\ntoroidal field bands in the convection zone with a magnitude of several meters\nper second.\n  The inferred value of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity affecting the\ntoroidal field agrees, to order of magnitude, with estimates based on\nmixing-length models for the solar convection zone. This is at variance with\nthe requirement of flux-transport dynamo models. The inflows required to keep\nthe toroidal field bands together before they approach the equator are similar\nto the inflows towards the activity belts observed with local helioseismology. \n\n"}

Strong spiral structures are\ngenerated with large material streams extending inwards. A small fraction\naccretes onto the circumstellar disks, with most returning to the torus.\nStructures also propagate outwards, generating net outwards mass flow and\neventually losing coherence at large distances. The torus becomes significantly\neccentric in shape.

Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to\nthe local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these\noperators can be truncated at a low order.

Here\nwe extend this analysis in three important directions: (i) we show that this\nresult applies to a large class of exotic compact objects with a photon sphere\nfor generic orbits in the test-particle limit; (ii) we investigate the\nlate-time ringdown in more detail, showing that it is universally characterized\nby a modulated and distorted train of \"echoes\" of the modes of vibration\nassociated with the photon sphere; (iii) we study for the first time\nequal-mass, head-on collisions of two ultracompact boson stars and compare\ntheir gravitational-wave signal to that produced by a pair of black-holes.

Suppression of\nhadron production at high transverse momenta ($p_{\\rm T}$) in HIC has been\nexplained by the energy loss of the partons produced in the hard scattering\nprocesses which traverse the deconfined quantum chromodynamic (QCD) matter. The\ndependence of the observed suppression on the $p_{\\rm T}$ of the measured\nhadron towards higher $p_{\\rm T}$ is an important input for the theoretical\nunderstanding of jet quenching effects in the QGP and the nature of the energy\nloss, while suppression towards lower $p_{\\rm T}$ gives information about\ncollective behaviour.

The experiment is being designed with an\ninitial sensitivity to nuclear recoil cross sections ~ 1 x 10$^{-43}$ cm$^2$\nfor a dark matter particle mass of 1 GeV/c$^2$, and with capacity to continue\nexploration to both smaller masses and better sensitivities. The phonon\nsensitivity of the HV detectors will be sufficient to detect nuclear recoils\nfrom sub-GeV dark matter. A detailed calibration of the detector response to\nlow energy recoils will be needed to optimize running conditions of the HV\ndetectors and to interpret their data for dark matter searches. Low-activity\nshielding, and the depth of SNOLAB, will reduce most backgrounds, but\ncosmogenically produced $^{3}$H and naturally occurring $^{32}$Si will be\npresent in the detectors at some level. Even if these backgrounds are x10\nhigher than expected, the science reach of the HV detectors would be over three\norders of magnitude beyond current results for a dark matter mass of 1\nGeV/c$^2$.

Traditional gating techniques based on capacitive coupling\nthrough a gate dielectric cannot generate strong and uniform electric fields at\nthis scale due to divergence of the fields in dielectrics. This field\ndivergence limits the gating strength, boundary sharpness, and pitch size of\nperiodic structures, and restricts possible geometries of local gates (due to\nwire packaging), precluding certain device concepts, such as plasmonics and\ntransformation optics based on metamaterials. Here we present a new gating\nconcept based on a dielectric-free self-aligned electrolyte technique that\nallows spatially modulating charges with nanometer resolution.

Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses.

Abstract: The possibility of the existence of right-handed neutrinos remains one of the\nmost important open questions in particle physics, as they can help elucidate\nthe problems of neutrino masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry, and dark matter.\nInterest in this topic has been increasing in recent years with the proposal of\nnew experimental avenues by which right-handed neutrinos with masses below the\nelectroweak scale could be detected directly using displaced-vertex signatures.\nAt the forefront of such endeavours, the proposed SHiP proton beam-dump\nexperiment is designed for a large acceptance to new weakly-coupled particles\nand low backgrounds. It is capable of probing right-handed neutrinos with\nmasses below 5~GeV and mixings several orders of magnitude smaller than current\nconstraints, in regions favoured by cosmology. To probe higher masses (up to\n30~GeV), a promising novel approach is to identify displaced vertices from\nright-handed neutrinos produced in $W$ decays at LHC experiments. \n\n"}

This discrepancy, known as the reactor antineutrino\nanomaly, is significant at the 2.5{\\sigma} level.\n  Several new experiments are searching for the origin of this observed\nneutrino deficit. One hypothesis to be tested is an oscillation to another\nneutrino state. In a three flavor model reactor neutrinos do not oscillate at\nbaselines below 100 m.

Previous attempts to quantify the effect of turbulence on reconnection\nusually prescribed Alfv\\'enic or other low-frequency fluctuations or\ninvestigated collisionless kinetic effects in just two-dimensional\nconfigurations and antiparallel magnetic fields. In view of this, we analyzed\nthe kinetic turbulence self-generated by three-dimensional guide-field\nreconnection through force-free current sheets in frequency and wavenumber\nspaces, utilizing 3D particle-in-cell code numerical simulations. Our\ninvestigations reveal reconnection rates and kinetic turbulence with features\nsimilar to those obtained by current in-situ spacecraft observations of MMS as\nwell as in the laboratory reconnection experiments MRX, VTF and\n\\textsc{Vineta}-II. In particular we found that the kinetic turbulence\ndeveloping in the course of 3D guide-field reconnection exhibits a broadband\npower-law spectrum extending beyond the lower-hybrid frequency and up to the\nelectron frequencies.

One possibility\nwould be a spin-2 object called the colorphilic graviton--a spin-2\ncolor-singlet particle which couples exclusively to the quark and gluon\nstress-energy tensors. We assess the possibility of this state's discovery in\nthe dijet channel as an s-channel resonance, and report the regions of\nparameter space where colorphilic gravitons have not yet been excluded by\nLHC-13 data but still may be discovered in the dijet channel at LHC-14 for\nintegrated luminosities of 0.3, 1, and 3 ab$^{-1}$.

We\ndiscover that--despite the strong constraints unitarity imposes on collider\nsearches--the colorphilic graviton remains potentially discoverable in the LHC\ndijet channel.

Such an effect is independent of the\nchoice of gauge-fixing, if the quartic Higgs coupling is decoupled from the\nother ones in the contexts considered. Notably, a combination of these two\ndi-Higgs productions is important for optimizing the collider sensitivities to\nprobe the quartic Higgs coupling.

As such they are intrinsically nonlinear phenomena and are much\nmore complex than linear counterparts such as the vacuum or MSW oscillations.\nThey obey integro-differential equations, numerical solutions of which are also\nvery challenging. If one focuses on the onset of the collective oscillations,\non the other hand, the equations can be linearized and the technique of linear\nanalysis can be employed. Unfortunately, however, it is well known that such an\nanalysis, when applied with discretizations of continuous angular\ndistributions, suffers from the appearance of so-called spurious modes,\nunphysical eigenmodes of the discretized linear equations. In this paper, we\nanalyze in detail the origin of these unphysical modes and present a simple\nsolution to this annoying problem.

However, these techniques\nare time consuming and their convergence to the posterior could be difficult to\ndetermine. In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to\nsolve the above problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter\nestimation and model selection in Astrophysics. Variational inference converts\nthe inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the\nposterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence to characterize the difference. It takes advantage of fast\noptimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets and\nmakes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform. We also derive a new\napproximate evidence estimation based on variational posterior, and importance\nsampling technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for the\ncalculation of evidence (PWISE), which is useful to perform Bayesian model\nselection. As a proof of principle, we apply variational inference to five\ndifferent problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques were\npreviously used.

This leads us to consider the other slow roll\nparameter $\\eta_V$ more closely, and we are lead to conjecture that the bound\nis not necessarily on $\\epsilon_V$, but on slow roll itself. A natural\nrefinement of the de Sitter swampland conjecture is therefore that slow roll is\nviolated at ${\\cal O}(1)$ in Planck units in any UV complete theory. A\ncorollary is that $\\epsilon_V$ need not necessarily be ${\\cal O}(1)$, if\n$\\eta_V \\lesssim -{\\cal O}(1)$ holds.

While the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey and accompanying Deep\nDrilling and mini-surveys will be ground-breaking for each of these areas,\nthere remain competing demands on the survey area, depth, and temporal coverage\namid a desire to maximize all three. In this white paper, we seek to address a\nprincipal source of tension between the different LSST science collaborations,\nthat of the survey area and depth that they each need in the parts of the sky\nthat they care about. We present simple tools which can be used to explore\ntrades between the area surveyed by LSST and the number of visits available per\nfield and then use these tools to propose a change to the baseline survey\nstrategy. Specifically, we propose to reconfigure the WFD footprint to consist\nof low-extinction regions (limited by galactic latitude), with the number of\nvisits per field in WFD limited by the LSST Science Requirements Document (SRD)\ndesign goal, and suggest assignment of the remaining LSST visits to the full\nvisible LSST sky.

Towards these goals, deterministic control of optomechanical\ninteractions in the strong coupling regime represents an important strategy for\nefficient utilization of quantum degrees of freedom in mechanical systems.\nWhile strong coupling has been demonstrated in both electromechanical and\noptomechanical systems, it has proven difficult to identify a robust\noptomechanical system that features the low loss and high coupling rates\nrequired for more sophisticated control of mechanical motion. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate robust strong coupling between multiple long-lived phonon modes of\na bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonator and a single optical cavity mode. We show\nthat this so-called \"multimode strong coupling\" regime can be a powerful tool\nto shape and control decoherence pathways through nontrivial forms of mode\nhybridization. Using frequency- and time-domain measurements, we identify\nhybridized modes with lifetimes that are significantly longer than that of any\nmode of the uncoupled system. This surprising effect, which results from the\ninterference of decay channels, showcases the use of multimode strong coupling\nas a general strategy to mitigate extrinsic loss mechanisms. Moreover, the\nphonons supported by BAW resonators have a collection of properties, including\nhigh frequencies, long coherence times, and robustness against thermal\ndecoherence, making this optomechanical system particularly enticing for\napplications such as quantum transduction and memories.

The three hottest known DAs (surface gravity log g $\\geq$\n7.0) have effective temperatures around Teff = 140,000 K, followed by only five\nobjects in the range 104,000 - 120,000 K. They are by far outnumbered by forty\nnon-DAs with Teff = 100,000 - 250,000 K, giving a DA/non-DA ratio of 0.2. In\ncontrast, this ratio is the inverse of that for the cooler WDs. One reason for\nthis discrepancy could be uncertainties in the temperature determination of hot\nDAs using Balmer-line spectroscopy. Recent investigations involving\nmetal-ionization balances in ultraviolet (UV) spectra indeed showed that the\ntemperatures of some DAs were underestimated, but the paucity of extremely hot\nDAs prevailed. Here we present the results of a UV spectral analysis of one of\nthe three hottest DAs, PG0948+534. We find that its temperature was strongly\noverestimated by recent Balmer line analyses. We correct it downward to 105,000\n$\\pm$ 5000 K, aggravating the hot-DA paucity. The Balmer-line problem\nencountered previously is not resolved by our non-LTE line-blanketed model\natmospheres.

This is supported by the V-band variability that shows a\nperiod of P=3.45 d (amplitude 0.19 mag), which we interpret as the star's\nrotation period. The metal abundances in PG0948+534 are affected by atomic\ndiffusion and we conclude that the onset of diffusion in hot DAs occurs when\nthey cool below Teff about 105,000 K.

GRB021004 is the first afterglow whose spectrum is\ndominated by absorption lines from high ionization species with multiple\nvelocity components separated by up to 3000 km/s. We argue that these lines are\nlikely to come from shells around a massive progenitor star. The high\nvelocities and high ionizations arise from a combination of acceleration and\nflash-ionization by the burst photons and the wind velocity and steady\nionization by the progenitor. We also analyze the broad-band spectrum and the\nlight curve. We distinguish six components along the line of sight: (1) The\nz~2.293 absorption lines arise from the wind of a massive star. For a mass loss\nrate of ~6 x 10^{-5} solar masses per year, this component also provides the\nexternal medium to create the afterglow light. (2) A second shell produces\nabsorption lines with a relative velocity of 560 km/s, and this is associated\nwith the shell created by the fast massive star wind blowing a bubble in the\npreceding slow wind at a radial distance of order 10 pc. (3) More distant\nclouds within the host galaxy lie between 30-2500 pc, where they have been\nionized by the burst.

Based on our\nprevious work regarding such a joint evolutionary scheme and the consequential\nblack hole to bulge mass correlation, we use the X-ray luminosity function of\nAGN and the cosmological evolution rate which are from ROSAT X-ray surveys to\nestimate the cosmic star formation history associated with the black hole\ngrowth. By the Basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs during\nthe luminous AGN phase, the luminosity function of AGNs as a function of\nredshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also the\ncosmic star formation history of the spheroids.\n  Although the space density of the especially luminous QSOs is very low, we\nshow that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive black\nhole growth is almost the same as that of Lyman Break Galaxies detected by the\ncurrent optical deep surveys. We thus argue that the optical deep surveys may\nmiss about half of the net star formation in our Universe, This is probably due\nto in part significant dust extinction as well as the small field of view of\nprevious optical surveys which cannot sample such rare events with relatively\nshort time scale.

We demonstrate the phenomenon of I-front trapping inside\nminihalos, in which the weak, R-type fronts which traveled supersonically\nacross the IGM decelerated when they encountered the dense, neutral gas inside\nminihalos, becoming D-type I-fronts, preceded by shock waves. For a minihalo\nwith virial temperature T_vir < 10^4 K, the I-front gradually burned its way\nthrough the minihalo which trapped it, removing all of its baryonic gas by\ncausing a supersonic, evaporative wind to blow backwards into the IGM, away\nfrom the exposed layers of minihalo gas just behind the advancing I-front. Such\nhitherto neglected feedback effects were widespread during reionization. N-body\nsimulations and analytical estimates of halo formation suggest that sub-kpc\nminihalos such as these, with T_vir < 10^4 K, were so common as to cover the\nsky around larger-mass source halos and possibly dominate the absorption of\nionizing photons.

This new algorithm, which we call hybrid characteristics, introduces a\nnovel form of ray tracing that can neither be classified as long, nor as short\ncharacteristics, but which applies the underlying principles, i.e. efficient\nexecution through interpolation and parallelizability, of both. Primary\napplications of the hybrid characteristics method are radiation hydrodynamics\nproblems that take into account the effects of photoionization and heating due\nto point sources of radiation. The method is implemented in the hydrodynamics\npackage FLASH. The ionization, heating, and cooling processes are modelled\nusing the DORIC ionization package. Upon comparison with the long\ncharacteristics method, we find that our method calculates the column density\nwith a similarly high accuracy and produces sharp and well defined shadows. We\nshow the quality of the new algorithm in an application to the photoevaporation\nof multiple over-dense clumps. We present several test problems demonstrating\nthe feasibility of our method for performing high resolution three-dimensional\nradiation hydrodynamics calculations that span a large range of scales. Initial\nperformance tests show that the ray tracing part of our method takes less time\nto execute than other parts of the calculation (e.g. hydrodynamics and adaptive\nmesh refinement), and that a high degree of efficiency is obtained in parallel\nexecution. Although the hybrid characteristics method is developed for problems\ninvolving photoionization due to point sources, the algorithm can be easily\nadapted to the case of more general radiation fields. \n\n"}

This scatter alone is comparable to\nthat observed. It rises steeply with redshift and is of order unity by z ~ 6,\neven on ~ 50 Mpc/h scales. This arises because: i) at z ~ 6, transmission\nspectra, which are sensitive mainly to rare voids, are highly biased (with a\nlinear bias factor b >~ 4-5) tracers of underlying density fluctuations, and\nii) projected power from small-scale transverse modes is aliased to long\nwavelength line-of-sight modes.

A suitable mechanism to produce non-spherical winds seems\nto be rapid rotation, and at least for three B[e] supergiants in the Magellanic\nClouds rotation velocities at a substantial fraction of their critical velocity\nhave been found. Aims: We want to find suitable recombination distances in the\nequatorial plane of rapidly rotating stars that explain the observed huge\namounts of neutral material in the vicinity of B[e] supergiants. Methods: We\nperform ionization structure calculations in the equatorial plane around\nrapidly rotating luminous supergiants. The restriction to the equatorial plane\nallows us to treat the ionization balance equations 1-dimensionally, while the\nstellar radiation field is calculated 2-dimensionally, taking into account the\nlatitudinal variation of the stellar surface parameters. The stellar parameters\nused correspond to those known for B[e] supergiants.

Our solution\nshows explicitly that recoil sources an absorption feature, whose magnitude\nincreases with the relative importance of recoil compared to Doppler\nbroadening. This spectrum depends on the Lyman-alpha line profile, but\napproximating it with the absorption profile appropriate to the Lorentzian\nwings of natural broadening accurately reproduces the results for a full Voigt\nprofile so long as T<1000 K in the IGM.

This may be explained through the production of\na new light spin-zero particle coupled to two photons. In this Letter of\nIntent, we propose to test this hypothesis by setting up a photon regeneration\nexperiment which exploits the photon beam of the Vacuum-UltraViolet\nFree-Electron Laser VUV-FEL, sent along the transverse magnetic field of a\nlinear arrangement of dipole magnets of size B L ~ 30 Tm. The high photon\nenergies available at the VUV-FEL increase substantially the expected photon\nregeneration rate in the mass range implied by the PVLAS anomaly, in comparison\nto the rate expected at visible lasers of similar power. We find that the\nparticle interpretation of the PVLAS result can be tested within a short\nrunning period. The pseudoscalar vs. scalar nature can be determined by varying\nthe direction of the magnetic field with respect to the laser polarization. The\nmass of the particle can be measured by running at different photon energies.\nThe proposed experiment offers a window of opportunity for a firm establishment\nor exclusion of the particle interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly before other\nexperiments can compete. \n\n"}

Most of the observables, with the notable\nexception of the forward-backward asymmetry of the bottom quark, point towards\na Higgs mass far below its current experimental bound. The disagreement, within\nthe SM, between the values for the weak mixing angle as obtained from the\nmeasurement of the leptonic and hadronic asymmetries at lepton colliders, may\nbe taken to indicate new physics contributions to the precision electroweak\nobservables. In this article we investigate the possibility that the inclusion\nof additional bottom-like quarks could help resolve this discrepancy. Two\ninequivalent assignments for these new quarks are analysed. The resultant fits\nto the electroweak data show a significant improvement when compared to that\nobtained in the SM. While in one of the examples analyzed, the exotic quarks\nare predicted to be light, with masses below 300 GeV, and the Higgs tends to be\nheavy, in the second one the Higgs is predicted to be light, with a mass below\n250 GeV, while the quarks tend to be heavy, with masses of about 800 GeV.

We first point out that such hadron colliders will\nbecome the ``neutralino factory'' producing 10^6--10^9 neutralinos/yr, if\ngluinos and/or squarks actually exist below O(1) TeV. The lightest neutralino\n(\\neu), usually assumed to be stable, will be unstable if lighter\nsuperparticles such as the gravitino (\\gra) or axino (\\axi) exist, or R-parity\nis not conserved. The decay signal would, however, be missed in usual collider\nexperiments, particularly when the decay mostly occurs outside the detector.
