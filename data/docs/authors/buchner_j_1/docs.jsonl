The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

The self-regulating\nmechanism is based on the interplay of two effects. First, plasma density\ncontrols coronal energy release via the transition between the slow collisional\nSweet-Parker regime and the fast collisionless reconnection regime. This\ntransition takes place when the Sweet--Parker layer becomes thinner than the\ncharacteristic collisionless reconnection scale. I present a simple criterion\nfor this transition in terms of the upstream plasma density (n_e), the\nreconnecting (B_0) and guide (B_z) magnetic field components, and the global\nlength (L) of the reconnection layer: L < 6.10^9 cm [n_e/(10^{10}/cm^3)]^(-3)\n(B_0/30G)^4 (B_0/B_z)^2. Next, coronal energy release by reconnection raises\nthe ambient plasma density via chromospheric evaporation and this, in turn,\ntemporarily inhibits subsequent reconnection involving the newly-reconnected\nloops. Over time, however, radiative cooling gradually lowers the density again\nbelow the critical value and fast reconnection again becomes possible. As a\nresult, the density is highly inhomogeneous and intermittent but,\nstatistically, does not deviate strongly from the critical value which is\ncomparable with the observed coronal density. Thus, in the long run, the\ncoronal heating process can be represented by repeating cycles that consist of\nfast reconnection events (i.e., nanoflares), followed by rapid evaporation\nepisodes, followed by relatively long periods (1-hour) during which magnetic\nstresses build up and simultaneously the plasma cools down and precipitates. \n\n"}

As shown in this paper, no such problems are faced by\nthe models which involve Comptonization of radiation provided by a broad\nline-region, or dusty molecular torus. The lack or weakness of bulk Compton and\nKlein-Nishina features indicated by the presently available data favors\nproduction of gamma-rays via up-scattering of infrared photons from hot dust.\nThis implies that the blazar emission zone is located at parsec-scale distances\nfrom the nucleus, and as such is possibly associated with the extended,\nquasi-stationary reconfinement shocks formed in relativistic outflows. This\nscenario predicts characteristic timescales for flux changes in luminous\nblazars to be days/weeks, consistent with the variability patterns observed in\nsuch systems at infrared, optical and gamma-ray frequencies. We also propose\nthat the parsec-scale blazar activity can be occasionally accompanied by\ndissipative events taking place at sub-parsec distances and powered by internal\nshocks and/or reconnection of magnetic fields. These could account for the\nmultiwavelength intra-day flares occasionally observed in powerful blazars\nsources. \n\n"}

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

The mechanisms are the breakout of the\nthermonuclear burning front as it reaches the surface of the white dwarf and\nthe interaction of the rapidly expanding envelope with an accretion disk. Based\non the delayed-detonation scenario and detailed radiation-hydro calculation\nwhich include nuclear networks, we find that both mechanisms produce ~1 second\nflashes of high energy radiation with peak luminosities of 10^48 to 10^50\nerg/sec with fast rises and exponential declines. The X- and gamma-ray\nvisibility of a SN-Ia will depend strongly on self absorption within the\nprogenitor system, specifically on the properties of the accretion disk and its\norientation towards the observer. Such X-ray and gamma-ray flashes could be\ndetected as triggered events by Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) detectors on satellites,\nwith events in current GRB catalogs. We have searched through the GRB catalogs\n(for the BATSE, HETE, and Swift experiments) for GRBs that occur at the\nextrapolated time of explosion and in the correct direction for known Type Ia\nsupernovae with radial velocity of less than 3,000 km/s.

We consider the energy dissipation, that results if the recoiling\nblack hole is surrounded by a thin circumbinary disc. Our results differ\nsignificantly from those of previous investigations. We show analytically that\nthe dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in the\nouter disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii. Thus, dimensional\nestimates, that include only the kinetic energy gained by the disc gas,\nunderestimate the real energy loss. This underestimate can exceed an order of\nmagnitude, if the recoil is directed close to the disc plane. We use three\ndimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and two dimensional\nfinite difference simulations to verify our analytic estimates.

They develop a k^{-3} spectrum,\nextending from scales somewhat larger than \\rho_i to the maximum scale that\ngrows secularly with time (~t^{1/2}); the relative pressure anisotropy\n(\\pperp-\\ppar)/\\ppar tends to the marginal value -2/\\beta_i. The marginal state\nis achieved via changes in the magnetic field, not particle scattering. When a\nparallel ion heat flux is present, the firehose mutates into the new\ngyrothermal instability (GTI), which continues to exist up to firehose-stable\nvalues of pressure anisotropy, which can be positive and are limited by the\nheat flux. The nonlinear evolution of the GTI also features secular growth of\nmagnetic fluctuations, but the spectrum is eventually dominated by modes around\nthe scale ~\\rho_i l_T/\\lambda_{mfp}, where l_T is the scale of the parallel\ntemperature variation.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

The initial conditions are either an X-point configuration\nembedded in 3D, the so-called Orszag-Tang vortex, or an\nArn'old-Beltrami-Childress configuration with a fully helical velocity and\nmagnetic field. In each case two snapshots are analyzed, separated by one\nturn-over time, starting just after the peak of dissipation. We show that the\nalgorithm is able to select a large number of structures (in excess of 8,000)\nfor each snapshot and that the statistical properties of these clusters are\nremarkably similar for the two snapshots as well as for the two flows under\nstudy in terms of scaling laws for the cluster characteristics, with the\nstructures in the vorticity and in the current behaving in the same way.

We aim at\nperforming a detailed study of abundance ratios of high redshift objects and\ntheir dust properties. We focus on Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) and Quasar (QSO)\nhosts and likely progenitors of low- and high-mass present-day elliptical\ngalaxies, respectively. We have adopted a chemical evolution model for\nelliptical galaxies taking account the dust production from low and\nintermediate mass stars, supernovae Ia, supernovae II, QSOs and both dust\ndestruction and accretion processes. By means of such a model we have followed\nthe chemical evolution of ellipticals of different baryonic masses. Our model\ncomplies with chemical downsizing. We made predictions for the abundance ratios\nversus metallicity trends for models of differing masses that can be used to\nconstrain the star formation rate, initial mass function and dust mass in\nobserved galaxies. We predict the existence of a high redshift dust\nmass-stellar mass relationship. We have found a good agreement with the\nproperties of LBGs if we assume that they formed at redshift z=2-4.

However, because of\ncomplexity of sunspot regions local helioseismology diagnostics require careful\nanalysis of systematic uncertainties and physical interpretation of the\ninversion results. We present new results of comparison of the ring-diagram\nanalysis and time-distance helioseismology for active region NOAA 9787, for\nwhich a previous comparison showed significant differences in the subsurface\nsound-speed structure, and discuss systematic uncertainties of the measurements\nand inversions. Our results show that both the ring-diagram and time-distance\ntechniques give qualitatively similar results, revealing a characteristic\ntwo-layer seismic sound-speed structure consistent with the results for other\nactive regions. However, a quantitative comparison of the inversion results is\nnot straightforward. It must take into account differences in the sensitivity,\nspatial resolution and the averaging kernels. In particular, because of the\nacoustic power suppression, the contribution of the sunspot seismic structure\nto the ring-diagram signal can be substantially reduced.

Intergalactic Globular Clusters and\n  the Massive Globular Cluster System at the Core of the Coma Galaxy Cluster Abstract: Intracluster stellar populations are a natural result of tidal interactions\nin galaxy clusters. Measuring these populations is difficult, but important for\nunderstanding the assembly of the most massive galaxies. The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1. The fraction of red IGCs (20%), and the red\ncolor of those GCs, implies that IGCs can originate from the halos of\nrelatively massive, L* galaxies, and not solely from the disruption of dwarf\ngalaxies.

It can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshift\nranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, and\nnaturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelength\nphotometry. We build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying the\nextreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. By\nintegrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities in\ndifferent redshift ranges. This approach allows for efficient, consistent, and\nfast classification and photometric redshift estimation. This is achieved by\ncombining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basis\nof our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through the\nuse of many simple components with many parameters. We show that this technique\nis competitive with the best photometric quasar classification\ntechniques---which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and high\nsignal-to-noise ratio data---and with the best photometric redshift techniques\nwhen applied to broadband optical data. We demonstrate that the inclusion of UV\nand NIR data significantly improves photometric quasar--star separation and\nessentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent to\nthe ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noise\nratio.

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes. Cosmic\nrays are likely to increase the global level of ionisation, but their influence\ndecreases if a strong, large scale magnetic field is present as on Brown\nDwarfs.\n  We suggest that although thermal gas ionisation declines in objects across\nthe fully-convective boundary, dust charging by collisional processes can play\nan important role in the lowest mass objects. The onset of atmospheric dust may\ntherefore correlate with the anomalous X-ray and radio emission in atmospheres\nthat are cool, but charged more than expected by pure thermal ionisation. \n\n"}

Such a bifurcation is\nmore probable in a region of zero magnetic shear than one of finite magnetic\nshear because in the former case the component of the sheared toroidal flow\nthat is perpendicular to the magnetic field has the strongest suppressing\neffect on the turbulence. In the zero-magnetic-shear regime, there are no\ngrowing linear eigenmodes at any finite value of flow shear. However,\nsubcritical turbulence can be sustained, owing to the transient growth of modes\ndriven by the ion temperature gradient (ITG) and the parallel velocity gradient\n(PVG). Nonetheless, in a parameter space containing a wide range of temperature\ngradients and velocity shears, there is a sizeable window where all turbulence\nis suppressed. Combined with the relatively low transport of momentum by\ncollisional (neoclassical) mechanisms, this produces the conditions for a\nbifurcation from low to high temperature and velocity gradients. The path of\nthis bifurcation is mapped out using interpolation from a large number of\nsimulations. Numerical simulations are also used to construct a parametric\nmodel which accurately describes the combined effect of the temperature\ngradient and the flow gradient over a wide range of their values. Using this\nparametric model, it is shown that in this reduced-transport state, heat is\ntransported almost neoclassically, while momentum transport is dominated by\nsubcritical PVG turbulence. It is further shown that for any given input of\ntorque, there is an optimum input of heat which maximises the temperature\ngradient. The parametric model describes both the behaviour of the subcritical\nturbulence and the complicated effect of the flow shear on the transport\nstiffness.

Here we further explore this\nscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (CR)\ndiffusion on the morphology and CR distribution of the bubbles. We show that\neven a relatively low level of viscosity (\\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or\n~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,\nresulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces\ncirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the\nCR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus\nviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important\ningredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness\ndistribution. Generically, such a CR distribution often produces a\nlimb-brightened gamma-ray intensity distribution. However, we show that by\nincorporating CR diffusion which is strongly suppressed across the bubble\nsurface (as inferred from sharp bubble edges) but is close to canonical values\nin the bubble interior, we obtain a reasonably flat gamma-ray intensity\nprofile. The similarity of the resulting CR bubble with the observed Fermi\nbubbles strengthens our previous result in Paper I that the Fermi bubbles were\nproduced by a recent AGN jet event.

The observed X-ray flux (and polarization state)\nis fundamentally a convolution of the cross-section for the hard X-ray emission\nprocess(es) in question with the electron distribution function, which is in\nturn a function of energy, direction, spatial location and time. To address the\nproblems of particle propagation and acceleration one needs to infer as much\ninformation as possible on this electron distribution function, through a\ndeconvolution of this fundamental relationship. This review presents recent\nprogress toward this goal using spectroscopic, imaging and polarization\nmeasurements, primarily from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI). Previous conclusions regarding the energy, angular (pitch\nangle) and spatial distributions of energetic electrons in solar flares are\ncritically reviewed.

Taking into account the\neffects of albedo, these show that the low energy cut-off to the electron\npower-law spectrum is typically below tens of keV, confirming that the\naccelerated electrons contain a large fraction of the energy released in\nflares. RHESSI has detected a high coronal hard X-ray source that is filled\nwith accelerated electrons whose energy density is comparable to the\nmagnetic-field energy density. This suggests an efficient conversion of energy,\npreviously stored in the magnetic field, into the bulk acceleration of\nelectrons.

Neutron Stars Abstract: A moderately spinning neutron star acquires an oblate shape and a spacetime\nwith a significant quadrupole moment.

In this paper, we develop a ray-tracing\nalgorithm to calculate the apparent surface areas of moderately spinning\nneutron stars making use of the Hartle-Thorne metric. This analytic metric\nallows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way that\ndepends only on its macroscopic properties and not on the details of its\nequation of state. We use this algorithm to calculate the changes in the\napparent surface area, which could play a role in measurements of neutron star\nradii and, therefore, in constraining their equation of state. We show that\nwhether the spinning neutron star appears larger or smaller than its\nnon-rotating counterpart depends primarily on its equatorial radius. For\nneutron stars with radii ~10 km, the corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime\ncause the apparent surface area to increase with spin frequency. In contrast,\nfor neutron stars with radii ~15 km, the oblateness of the star dominates the\nspacetime corrections and causes the apparent surface area to decrease with\nincreasing spin frequency.

Until very recently, observed samples of PCEBs\nhave been too small to fully explore this potential, however the recently\nidentified large and relatively homogenous sample of PCEBs from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) has significantly changed this situation. We here\nanalyze the orbital period distributions of PCEBs containing He- and C/O-core\nWDs separately and investigate whether the orbital period of PCEBs is related\nto the masses of their stellar components. We performed standard statistical\ntests to compare the orbital period distributions and to determine the\nconfidence levels of possible relations.

Most of the existing\nmethods use some information about the spatial distribution of components,\ne.g., closeness to an external template, independence of components etc., in\norder to separate them. In this paper we propose a method where one puts\nconditions on the spectra only. The advantages of our method are: 1) it is\ninternal: the maps of the components are constructed as combinations of data in\ndifferent energy bins, 2) the components may be correlated among each other, 3)\nthe method is semi-blind: in many cases, it is sufficient to assume a\nfunctional form of the spectra and determine the parameters from a maximization\nof a likelihood function.

The School's theme\nwas \"Secular Evolution of Galaxies\" and my task was to present the underlying\nstellar-dynamical theory. Other lecturers were speaking on the role of bars and\nchemical evolution, so these topics are avoided here. We start with an account\nof the connections between isolating integrals, quasiperiodicity and\nangle-action variables - these variables played a unifying role throughout the\nlectures. This leads on to the phenomenon of resonant trapping and how this can\nlead to chaos in cuspy potentials and phase-space mixing in slowly evolving\npotentials. Surfaces of section and frequency analysis are introduced as\ndiagnostics of phase-space structure. Real galactic potentials include a\nfluctuating part that drives the system towards unattainable thermal\nequilibrium. Two-body encounters are only one source of fluctuations, and all\nfluctuations will drive similar evolution. We derive the orbit-averaged\nFokker-Planck equation and relations that hold between the second-order\ndiffusion coefficients and both the power spectrum of the fluctuations and the\nfirst-order diffusion coefficients. From the observed heating of the solar\nneighbourhood we show that the second-order diffusion coefficients must scale\nas J^{1/2}. We show that periodic spiral structure shifts angular momentum\noutwards, heating at the Lindblad resonances and mixing at corotation. The\nequation that would yield the normal modes of a stellar disc is first derived\nand then used to discuss the propagation of tightly-wound spiral waves. The\nwinding up of such waves is explains why cool stellar discs are responsive\nsystems that amplify ambient noise.

Acceleration in reconnection sites has attracted the attention of\nresearchers recently. In this letter we analyze the energy distribution\nevolution of test particles injected in three dimensional (3D)\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of different magnetic reconnection\nconfigurations. When considering a single Sweet-Parker topology, the particles\naccelerate predominantly through a first-order Fermi process, as predicted in\nprevious work (de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian, 2005) and demonstrated\nnumerically in Kowal, de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian (2011). When turbulence is\nincluded within the current sheet, the acceleration rate, which depends on the\nreconnection rate, is highly enhanced. This is because reconnection in the\npresence of turbulence becomes fast and independent of resistivity (Lazarian &\nVishniac, 1999; Kowal et al., 2009) and allows the formation of a thick volume\nfilled with multiple simultaneously reconnecting magnetic fluxes. Charged\nparticles trapped within this volume suffer several head-on scatterings with\nthe contracting magnetic fluctuations, which significantly increase the\nacceleration rate and results in a first-order Fermi process. For comparison,\nwe also tested acceleration in MHD turbulence, where particles suffer\ncollisions with approaching and receding magnetic irregularities, resulting in\na reduced acceleration rate.

A fraction of these are\nlikely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of\nstellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular\nevolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with\nhighly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly\naffected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at\nthe highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission\nbecomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and\ncoalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than\nsimilar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of\nSMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of\nbinaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries\nwould be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation\nof GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging\nbinaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still\nvery eccentric (e>~0.5). The efficient gravitational wave analysis for such\nsystems would therefore require the use of eccentric templates. We also find\nthat binaries very close to the MBH could evolve through a complex dynamical\n(non-secular) evolution leading to emission of several GW pulses during only a\nfew yrs (though these are likely to be rare). Finally, we note that the\nformation of close stellar binaries, X-ray binaries and their merger products\ncould be induced by similar secular processes, combined with tidal friction\nrather than GW emission as in the case of compact object binaries. \n\n"}

The reconnection process is made\nasymmetric along the inflow direction by allowing the initial upstream magnetic\nfield strengths and densities to differ, and along the outflow direction by\nplacing the initial perturbation near a conducting wall boundary that\nrepresents the photosphere. When the upstream magnetic fields are asymmetric,\nthe post-flare loop structure is distorted into a characteristic skewed candle\nflame shape. The simulations can thus be used to provide constraints on the\nreconnection asymmetry in post-flare loops. More hard X-ray emission is\nexpected to occur at the footpoint on the weak magnetic field side because\nenergetic particles are more likely to escape the magnetic mirror there than at\nthe strong magnetic field footpoint. The footpoint on the weak magnetic field\nside is predicted to move more quickly because of the requirement in two\ndimensions that equal amounts of flux must be reconnected from each upstream\nregion. The X-line drifts away from the conducting wall in all simulations with\nasymmetric outflow and into the strong magnetic field region during most of the\nsimulations with asymmetric inflow. There is net plasma flow across the X-line\nfor both the inflow and outflow directions. The reconnection exhaust directed\naway from the obstructing wall is significantly faster than the exhaust\ndirected towards it. The asymmetric inflow condition allows net vorticity in\nthe rising outflow plasmoid which would appear as rolling motions about the\nflux rope axis. \n\n"}

We aim to obtain the Galactic trajectory of LS 5039 and PSR J1825-1446 to\nfind their origin in the Galaxy, and in particular to check their association\nwith SNR G016.8-01.1 to restrict their age. Methods. By means of radio and\noptical observations we obtained the proper motion and the space velocity of\nthe sources. Results. The proper motion of PSR J1825-1446 corresponds to a\ntransverse space velocity of 690 km/s at a distance of 5 kpc. Its Galactic\nvelocity at different distances is not compatible with the expected Galactic\nrotation. The velocity and characteristic age of PSR J1825-1446 make it\nincompatible with SNR G016.8-01.1. There are no clear OB associations or SNRs\ncrossing the past trajectory of PSR J1825-1446. We estimate the age of the\npulsar to be 80-245 kyr, which is compatible with its characteristic age. The\nproper motion of LS 5039 is 7.09 and -8.82 mas/yr in right ascension and\ndeclination, respectively. The association of LS 5039 with SNR G016.8-01.1 is\nunlikely, although we cannot to discard it. The system would have had to be\nformed in the association Ser OB2 (at 2.0 kpc) if the age of the system is\n1.0-1.2 Myr, or in the association Sct OB3 (distance 1.5-2 kpc) for an age of\n0.1-0.2 Myr. If the system were not formed close to Ser OB2, the\npseudo-synchronization of the orbit would be unlikely. Conclusions. PSR\nJ1825-1446 is a high-velocity isolated pulsar ejected from the Galaxy. The\ndistance to LS 5039, which needs to be constrained by future astrometric\nmissions such as Gaia, is a key parameter for restricting its origin and age. \n\n"}

We further argue that if\nmagnetic fields should be present in such clouds at a level that could affect\nthe stability properties, they need to be strong enough to compete with the\nradiation pressure on the cloud. This would imply magnetic field values of a\nfew Gauss for a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei we draw from the literature.\nWe then investigate the effect of several magnetic configurations on cloud\nstability in axi-symmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations. For a purely\nazimuthal magnetic field which provides the dominant pressure support, the\ncloud first gets compressed by the opposing radiative and gravitational forces.\nThe pressure inside the cloud then increases, and it expands vertically.\nKelvin-Helmholtz and column density instability lead to a filamentary\nfragmentation of the cloud. This radiative dispersion continues until the cloud\nis shredded down to the resolution level. For a helical magnetic field\nconfiguration, a much more stable cloud core survives with a stationary density\nhistogram which takes the form of a power law.

The half-mass radius of star clusters increases\nsystematically with galactocentric distance but levels off when star clusters\norbit the galaxy beyond ~40 kpc. These simulations show that the half-mass\nradius of individual star clusters varies significantly as they evolve over a\nHubble time, more so for clusters with shorter relaxation times, and remains\nconstant through several relaxation times only in certain situations when\nexpansion driven by the internal dynamics of the star cluster and the influence\nof the host galaxy tidal field balance each other.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

Using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most\nprominent tidal tail formed during the first passage, which is gas-rich and\ncontains old and metal poor stars. We discovered several striking coincidences\nafter comparing its location and motion to those of the Milky Way (MW) and of\nthe Magellanic Clouds (MCs). First, the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively\nsmall volume in which the MW precisely lies. Because the geometry of the merger\nis somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the Giant Stream (GS), we\nevaluate the chance of the MW to be at such a rendez-vous with this gigantic\ntidal tail to be 5 %. Second, the velocity of the tidal tail matches the LMC\nproper motion, and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum\nproperties of the MW dwarfs, i.e. the so-called disk of satellites, better\ncalled Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Third, the simulation of the tidal tail\nreveals one of the formed TDG with mass and location almost comparable to those\nof the LMC.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic.

In this paper I simulated long-term\nthree-dimensional nonlinear evolution of a thin, planar current sheet subject\nto fast oblique tearing instability using direct numerical simulations of\nresistive-viscous MHD. The late-time evolution resembles generic turbulence\nwith -5/3 power spectrum and scale-dependent anisotropy, so I conclude that the\ntearing-driven reconnection becomes turbulent reconnection. The turbulence is\nlocal in scale, so microscopic diffusivity should not affect large-scale\nquantities. This is confirmed by convergence of the reconnection rate towards\n$\\sim 0.015 v_A$ with increasing Lundquist number. In this spontaneous\nreconnection with mean field and without driving the dissipation rate per unit\narea also converge to $\\sim 0.006 \\rho v_A^3$, the dimensionless constants\n$0.015$ and $0.006$ are governed only by self-driven nonlinear dynamics of the\nsheared magnetic field. Remarkably, this also means that thin current sheet has\na universal fluid resistance depending only on its length to width ratio and to\n$v_A/c$. \n\n"}

However, this assumption seems invalid in BLR models that\nconsists of an accretion disk and its wind. The disk is likely Keplerian and\ntherefore virialized. However, the wind material must, beyond a certain point,\nbe dominated by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. Here, we\nanalyze hydrodynamic simulations of four different disk winds: an isothermal\nwind, a thermal wind from an X-ray heated disk, and two line-driven winds, one\nwith and the other without X-ray heating and cooling. For each model, we check\nwhether gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing the\nvolume-integrated quantities that appear in the virial theorem: internal,\nkinetic, and gravitational energies, We find that in the first two models, the\nwinds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are virialized\nup to a relatively large distance. The line-driven winds are virialized because\nthey accelerate slowly so that the rotational velocity is dominant and the wind\nbase is very dense. For the two virialized winds, the so-called projected\nvirial factor scales with inclination angle as $1/ \\sin^2{i}$. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that an outflow from a Keplerian disk becomes unvirialized more\nslowly when it conserves the gas specific angular momentum -- as in the models\nconsidered here, than when it conserves the angular velocity -- as in the\nso-called magneto-centrifugal winds. \n\n"}

The white-noise case,\n$\\tau_\\alpha = 0\\,$, is solved exactly, and it is concluded that the necessary\ncondition for dynamo action is identical to the Kraichnan-Moffatt model without\nshear; this is because white-noise does not allow for memory effects, whereas\nshear needs time to act.

We propose that the magnetic field was amplified to this values\nalready during the formation and the early evolution of the galaxies.\nTurbulence in young galaxies is driven by accretion as well as by supernova\n(SN) explosions of the first generation of stars. The small-scale dynamo can\nconvert the turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy and amplify very weak\nprimordial magnetic seed fields on short timescales. The amplification takes\nplace in two phases: in the kinematic phase the magnetic field grows\nexponentially, with the largest growth on the smallest non-resistive scale. In\nthe following non-linear phase the magnetic energy is shifted towards larger\nscales until the dynamo saturates on the turbulent forcing scale. To describe\nthe amplification of the magnetic field quantitatively we model the\nmicrophysics in the interstellar medium (ISM) of young galaxies and determine\nthe growth rate of the small-scale dynamo. We estimate the resulting saturation\nfield strengths and dynamo timescales for two turbulent forcing mechanisms:\naccretion-driven turbulence and SN-driven turbulence. We compare them to the\nfield strength that is reached, when only stellar magnetic fields are\ndistributed by SN explosions. We find that the small-scale dynamo is much more\nefficient in magnetizing the ISM of young galaxies.

The internal energy of such systems lacks extensivity and\nadditivity. Although the extensivity can be restored by scaling the interaction\npotential with the number of particles, the non-additivity still remains. Lack\nof additivity leads to inequivalence of statistical ensembles. Before relaxing\nto thermodynamic equilibrium, isolated systems with LR forces become trapped in\nout-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary state (qSS), the lifetime of which diverges\nwith the number of particles. Therefore, in thermodynamic limit LR systems will\nnot relax to equilibrium. The qSSs are attained through the process of\ncollisionless relaxation.

Most of it likely\nderives from the combination of the Mdust-SFR and Mstar-SFR correlations.

It has\npreviously been classified as a low-peaked BL Lac object based on its broadband\nemission and the absence of optical emission lines. Optical measurements,\nhowever, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronounced\nshort-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for a\nblazar. We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to\nreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For\nthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its\nspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations\nfrom the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength\ndata in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far. Sparse (u, v)-coverage at 22.3GHz prevents an\nunambiguous modeling of the source morphology. IR measurements reveal an excess\nin the spectral energy distribution (SED), which can be modeled with a\nblackbody with a temperature of about 1600K, and which is usually not present\nin blazar SEDs. The VLBI data and the shape of the SED challenge the current\nblazar classification. PMNJ1603-4904 seems to be either a highly peculiar BL\nLac object or a misaligned jet source. In the latter case, the intriguing VLBI\nstructure opens room for a possible classification as a gamma-ray bright CSO. \n\n"}

In particular, magnetic\nreconnection during collisionless, stressed $X$-point collapse for varying\nout-of-plane guide-fields is studied using a kinetic, 2.5D, fully\nelectromagnetic, relativistic particle-in-cell numerical code. Cases for both\nopen and closed boundary conditions are investigated, where magnetic flux and\nparticles are lost and conserved respectively. It is found that reconnection\nrates and out-of-plane currents in the $X$-point increase more rapidly and peak\nsooner in the closed boundary case, but higher values are reached in the open\nboundary case. The normalized reconnection rate is fast: 0.10-0.25. In the open\nboundary case an increase of guide-field yields later onsets in the\nreconnection peak rates, while in the closed boundary case initial peak rates\noccur sooner but are suppressed. The reconnection current increases for low\nguide-fields but then decreases similarly. In the open boundary case, for\nguide-fields of the order of the in-plane magnetic field, the generation of\nelectron vortices occurs. Possible causes of the vortex generation, based on\nthe flow of particles in the diffusion region and localized plasma heating, are\ndiscussed. Before peak reconnection onset, oscillations in the out-of-plane\nelectric field at the $X$-point are found, ranging in frequency from\napproximately 1 to 2 $\\omega_{pe}$ and coinciding with oscillatory\nreconnection. These oscillations are found to be part of a larger wave pattern.\nMapping the out-of-plane electric field over time and applying 2D Fourier\ntransforms reveals that the waves predominantly correspond to the ordinary mode\nand may correspond to observable radio waves such as solar radio burst fine\nstructure spikes. \n\n"}

Comparison to\ntheoretical models suggests that the object could be a low-gravity L dwarf with\na solar or higher than solar metallicity. Nonetheless, the match of such fits\nto the spectrum is rather poor and this and other peculiar red L dwarfs pose\nnew challenges for the modeling of ultracool atmospheres. We determined the\nproper motion of ULAS J222711-004547 using the data available in the\nliterature, and we find that its kinematics do not suggest membership of any of\nthe known young associations. We show that applying a simple de-reddening curve\nto its spectrum allows it to resemble the spectra of the L7 spectroscopic\nstandards.

This energy transfer is due to the electric field of the\nwake set up in the background plasma by the relativistic particle.

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting\nprograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially\nretrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although\ntheoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that\nretrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for\ncertain radio quasars.

Converting these observations to an estimate of the CO J=1-0 intensity,\nand thus inferring H2 gas masses, requires knowledge of the CO excitation\nladder, or spectral line energy distribution (SLED). The few available multi-J\nCO observations of galaxies show a very broad range of SLEDs, even at fixed\ngalaxy mass and star formation rate, making the conversion to J=1-0 emission\nand hence molecular gas mass highly uncertain. Here, we combine numerical\nsimulations of disk galaxies and galaxy mergers with molecular line radiative\ntransfer calculations to develop a model for the physical parameters that drive\nvariations in CO SLEDs in galaxies. An essential feature of our model is a\nfully self-consistent computation of the molecular gas temperature and\nexcitation structure. We find that, while the shape of the SLED is ultimately\ndetermined by difficult-to-observe quantities such as the gas density,\ntemperature, and optical depth distributions, all of these quantities are\nwell-correlated with the galaxy's mean star formation rate surface density\n(Sigma_SFR), which is observable.

EXors, a loosely\ndefined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitive\noutbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. The relationship between the\ntwo classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequence\nevolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinct\nclasses, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occur\nin the same evolutionary phases?

However, a general constraint is\nnot necessarily integrable, which precludes the existence of an appropriate\nCasimir element; the circulation is an example of such an invariant. In this\nwork, we formulate a systematic method to embed a Hamiltonian system in an\nextended phase space; we introduce mock fields and extend the Poisson algebra\nso that the mock fields are Lie-dragged by the flow vector. A mock field\ndefines a new Casimir element, a cross helicity, which represents topological\nconstraints including the circulation. Unearthing a Casimir element brings\nabout immense advantage in the study of dynamics and equilibria -- the\nso-called energy-Casimir method becomes ready available. Yet, a mock field does\nnot a priori have a physical meaning. Here we proffer an interpretation of a\nCasimir element obtained, e.g., by such a construction as an adiabatic\ninvariant associated with a hidden \"microscopic\" angle variable, and in this\nway give the mock field a physical meaning. We proceed further and consider a\nperturbation of the Hamiltonian by a canonical pair, composed of the Casimir\nelement and the angle, that causes the topological constraint to be unfrozen.\nThe theory is applied to the tearing modes of MHD. \n\n"}

At very high energy, the contribution from semi-leptonic\ndecays of charmed hadrons, known as the prompt neutrino flux, dominates over\nthe conventional flux from pion and kaon decays. This is due to the very short\nlifetime of the charmed hadrons, which therefore do not lose energy before they\ndecay. The calculation of this process is difficult because the Bjorken-x at\nwhich the parton distribution functions are evaluated is very small. This is a\nregion where QCD is not well understood, and large logarithms must be resummed.\nAvailable parton distribution functions are not known at such small x and\nextrapolations must be made.

Whether\nlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of\nan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic\nactivity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic\nfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution\nfor both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic\nproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic\nenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic\nhelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the\nlargest scale available. Here I discuss how magnetic helicity has come to help\nus understand the saturation of and sustenance of large scale dynamos, the need\nfor either local or global helicity fluxes to avoid dynamo quenching, and the\nassociated observational consequences.

Some stripped galaxies, in particular in merging\nclusters, develop spectacular star-forming tails, giving them a jellyfish-like\nappearance.

However, there is still a debate about\ntheir stellar masses and their nature in the context of the general galaxy\npopulation. To test the reliability of their stellar mass determinations, we\nused a sample of simulated submm galaxies for which we derived stellar masses\nvia spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling (with Grasil, Magphys, Hyperz\nand LePhare) adopting various star formation histories (SFHs). We found that\nthe assumption of SFHs with two independent components leads to the most\naccurate stellar masses. Exponentially declining SFHs (tau) lead to lower\nmasses (albeit still consistent with the true values), while the assumption of\nsingle-burst SFHs results in a significant mass underestimation. Thus, we\nconclude that studies based on the higher masses inferred from fitting the SEDs\nof real submm galaxies with double SFHs are most likely to be correct, implying\nthat submm galaxies lie on the high-mass end of the main sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies. This conclusion appears robust to assumptions of whether\nor not submm galaxies are driven by major mergers, since the suite of simulated\ngalaxies modelled here contains examples of both merging and isolated galaxies.\nWe identified discrepancies between the true and inferred stellar ages (rather\nthan the dust attenuation) as the primary determinant of the success/failure of\nthe mass recovery. Regardless of the choice of SFH, the SED-derived stellar\nmasses exhibit a factor of ~2 scatter around the true value; this scatter is an\ninherent limitation of the SED modelling due to simplified assumptions.\nFinally, we found that the contribution of active galactic nuclei does not have\nany significant impact on the derived stellar masses. \n\n"}

In this regime electric fields parallel to B\naccelerate particles directly while those perpendicular to B do so through\ngradient-B and curvature drifts. The curvature drift drives parallel heating\nthrough Fermi reflection while the gradient B drift changes the perpendicular\nenergy through betatron acceleration. We present simulations in which we\nevaluate each of these mechanisms in space and time in order to quantify their\nrole in electron heating. For a case with a small guide field (20 % of the\nmagnitude of the reconnecting component) the curvature drift is the dominant\nsource of electron heating. However, for a larger guide field (equal to the\nmagnitude of the reconnecting component) electron acceleration by the curvature\ndrift is comparable to that of the parallel electric field. In both cases the\nheating by the gradient B drift is negligible in magnitude. Heating by the\ncurvature-drift dominates in the outflow exhausts where bent field lines expand\nto relax their tension and is therefore distributed over a large area. In\ncontrast, the parallel electric field is localized near X-lines. Acceleration\nby parallel electric fields may play a smaller role in large systems where the\nX-line occupies a vanishing fraction of the system. The curvature drift and the\nparallel electric field dominate the dynamics and drive parallel heating. A\nconsequence is that the electron energy spectrum becomes extremely anisotropic\nat late time, which has important implications for quantifying the limits of\nelectron acceleration due to synchrotron emission. An upper limit on electron\nenergy gain that is substantially higher than earlier estimates is obtained by\nbalancing reconnection drive with radiative loss. \n\n"}

We describe the propagation of free\nenergy in phase space using forwards and backwards propagating Hermite modes\nrecently developed for gyrokinetics [Schekochihin et al. (2014)]. The change in\nthe electric field corresponds to the net Hermite flux via a free energy\nevolution equation. In linear Landau damping, decay in the electric field\ncorresponds to forward propagating Hermite modes; in nonlinear damping, the\ninitial decay is followed by a growth phase characterised by the generation of\nbackwards propagating Hermite modes by the nonlinear term. The free energy\ncontent of the backwards propagating modes increases exponentially until\nbalancing that of the forward propagating modes. Thereafter there is no\nsystematic net Hermite flux, so the electric field cannot decay and the\nnonlinearity effectively suppresses Landau damping. These simulations are\nperformed using the fully-spectral 5D gyrokinetics code SpectroGK [Parker et\nal. 2014], modified to solve the 1+1D Vlasov-Poisson system. This captures\nLandau damping via an iterated L\\'enard-Bernstein collision operator or via\nHou-Li filtering in velocity space.

We show\nthat both protons and electrons are accelerated in the shock and that these\naccelerated particles generate large-amplitude Alfv\\'{e}nic waves in the\nupstream region of the shock. After the upstream waves have grown sufficiently,\nthe local structure of the collisionless shock becomes substantially similar to\nthat of a quasi-perpendicular shock due to the large transverse magnetic field\nof the waves. A fraction of protons are accelerated in the shock with a\npower-law-like energy distribution. The rate of proton injection to the\nacceleration process is approximately constant, and in the injection process,\nthe phase-trapping mechanism for the protons by the upstream waves can play an\nimportant role. The dominant acceleration process is a Fermi-like process\nthrough repeated shock crossings of the protons. This process is a `fast'\nprocess in the sense that the time required for most of the accelerated protons\nto complete one cycle of the acceleration process is much shorter than the\ndiffusion time. A fraction of the electrons is also accelerated by the same\nmechanism, and have a power-law-like energy distribution.

The useful property of\nthis variational principle is that it allows independent transformations of\nparticle coordinates and velocities, i.e., transformations in particle phase\nspace.

We\nconsider magnetic reconnection in realistic 3D geometry in the presence of\nturbulence. This turbulence in most astrophysical settings is of pre-existing\nnature, but it also can be induced by magnetic reconnection itself. In this\nsituation turbulent magnetic field wandering opens up reconnection outflow\nregions, making reconnection fast. We discuss Lazarian \\& Vishniac (1999) model\nof turbulent reconnection, its numerical and observational testings, as well as\nits connection to the modern understanding of the Lagrangian properties of\nturbulent fluids.

If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact\nstars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the\nlimiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars\nmade of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation\nis carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of\nstructure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is\nproportional to the energy density. The approach relies on Volkoff and Misner's\nmethod to solve the TOV equation. For zero charge one gets the interior\nSchwarzschild limit, and supposing incompressible boson or fermion matter with\nconstituents with masses of the order of the neutron mass one gets that the\nmaximum mass is the Misner mass. For a small electric charge, our analytical\napproximating scheme valid in first order in the star's electric charge, shows\nthat the maximum mass increases relatively to the uncharged case, whereas the\nminimum possible radius decreases, an expected effect since the new field is\nrepulsive aiding the pressure to sustain the star against gravitational\ncollapse. \n\n"}

In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

We consider {\\em Swift} events of $15$ SGRBs, $7$ SGRBEEs, 3\nLGRBNs and 230 LGRBs. The spectral-energy properties of the initial pulse of\nboth SGRBEE and LGRBNs are found to coincide with those of SGRBs.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

The result\ngeneralises reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and kinetic RMHD (Schekochihin\net al. 2009) for pressure-anisotropic plasmas, allowing for species drifts---a\nsituation routinely encountered in the solar wind and presumably ubiquitous in\nhot dilute astrophysical plasmas (e.g. intracluster medium). Two main\nobjectives are achieved. First, in a non-Maxwellian plasma, the relationships\nbetween fluctuating fields (e.g., the Alfven ratio) are order-unity modified\ncompared to the more commonly considered Maxwellian case, and so a quantitative\ntheory is developed to support quantitative measurements now possible in the\nsolar wind. The main physical feature of low-frequency plasma turbulence\nsurvives the generalisation to non-Maxwellian distributions: Alfvenic and\ncompressive fluctuations are energetically decoupled, with the latter passively\nadvected by the former; the Alfvenic cascade is fluid, satisfying RMHD\nequations (with the Alfven speed modified by pressure anisotropy and species\ndrifts), whereas the compressive cascade is kinetic and subject to\ncollisionless damping. Secondly, the organising principle of this turbulence is\nelucidated in the form of a generalised kinetic free-energy invariant. It is\nshown that non-Maxwellian features in the distribution function reduce the rate\nof phase mixing and the efficacy of magnetic stresses; these changes influence\nthe partitioning of free energy amongst the various cascade channels. As the\nfirehose or mirror instability thresholds are approached, the dynamics of the\nplasma are modified so as to reduce the energetic cost of bending\nmagnetic-field lines or of compressing/rarefying them. Finally, it is shown\nthat this theory can be derived as a long-wavelength limit of non-Maxwellian\nslab gyrokinetics. \n\n"}

Finding\nradio-loud quasars at the highest accessible redshifts (z~6) is important to\nstudy their properties and environments at even earlier cosmic time.

In this paper we search for 5.5 < z < 7.2 quasars by\ncross-matching the optical Pan-STARRS1 and radio FIRST surveys. The radio\ninformation allows identification of quasars missed by typical color-based\nselections. While we find no good 6.4 < z <7.2 quasar candidates at the\nsensitivities of these surveys, we discover two new radio-loud quasars at z~6.\nFurthermore, we identify two additional z~6 radio-loud quasars which were not\npreviously known to be radio-loud, nearly doubling the current z~6 sample.

Using the available data in the literature, we constrain the\nradio-loud fraction of quasars at z~6, using the Kaplan--Meier estimator, to be\n$8.1^{+5.0}_{-3.2}\\%$. This result is consistent with there being no evolution\nof the radio-loud fraction with redshift, in contrast to what has been\nsuggested by some studies at lower redshifts. \n\n"}

This flare occurred in a massive,\nstar forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks to\nrepeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. By taking\ndifference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year SDSS Stripe-82\nlight-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum over\nthe course of the outburst. The tidal disruption event (TDE) interpretation is\nconsistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, which\ndisplays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (with\na clear superimposed re-brightening flare).

The field\nhas a central region, comprising of the well-known qaudrupolar field\n(quadrupolar components), as well as four additional poles of reversed polarity\ncloser to the corners of the domain (octupolar components). In this extended\nwork, the dependence of the octupolar structure on domain size and ion mass\nvariation is investigated. Simulations show that the strength and spatial\nstructure of the generated octupolar magnetic field is independent of ion to\nelectron mass ratio. Thus showing that ion currents play a significant role in\nout-of-plane magnetic structure generation in physically realistic scenarios.\nSimulations of different system sizes show that the width of the octupolar\nstructure remains the same and has a spacial extent of the order of the ion\ninertial length. The width of the structure thus appears to be independent on\nboundary condition effects. The length of the octupolar structure however\nincreases for greater domain sizes, prescribed by the external system size.\nThis was found to be a consequence of the structure of the in-plane magnetic\nfield in the outflow region halting the particle flow and thus terminating the\nin-plane currents that generate the out-of-plane field. The generation of\noctupolar magnetic field structure is also established in a tearing-mode\nreconnection scenario. The differences in the generation of the octupolar field\nand resulting qualitative differences between $X$-point collapse and\ntearing-mode are discussed. \n\n"}

For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size.

The integrated radio and IR\nluminosity of W33 - when combined with the direct detection of methanol masers,\nthe protostellar object W33A, and protocluster embedded within the radio source\nW33 main - mark the region out as a site of vigorous ongoing star formation.

Moreover as a UV resonance line, Lya\npossesses several unique characteristics that make it useful to study the ISM\nand ionizing stellar population at all cosmic epochs. In this review I present\na summary of Lya observations of galaxies in the nearby universe. At UV\nmagnitudes reachable with current facilities, only ~5% of the local galaxy\npopulation shows a Lya equivalent width (EW_Lya) that exceeds 20\\AA. This\nfraction increases dramatically at higher z, but only in the local universe can\nwe study galaxies in detail and assemble unprecedented multi-wavelength\ndatasets. I discuss many local Lya observations, showing that when galaxies\nshow net Lya emission, they ubiquitously produce large halos of scattered Lya,\nthat dominate the integrated luminosity. We discuss how global EW_Lya and the\nLya escape fraction (fescLya) are higher (EW_Lya >~ 20\\AA\\ and fescLya> 10%) in\ngalaxies that represent the less massive and younger end of the distributions\nfor local objects. This is connected with various properties, such that\nLya-emitters have lower metallicities (median value of 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.1) and\ndust reddening. However, the presence of galactic outflows is also vital to\nDoppler shift the Lya line out of resonance with the HI, as high EW_Lya is\nfound only among galaxies with winds faster than ~50km/s. The evidence is then\nassembled into a coherent picture, and the requirement for star formation\ndriven feedback is discussed in the context of an evolutionary sequence where\nthe ISM is accelerated and/or subject to fluid instabilities, which reduce the\nscattering of Lya.

This process is\nknown as the turbulent dynamo and depends on the properties of turbulence, i.e.\non the hydrodynamical Reynolds number and the compressibility of the gas, and\non the magnetic diffusivity. While we know the growth rate the magnetic energy\nin the linear regime, the saturation level, i.e. the ratio of magnetic energy\nto turbulent kinetic energy that can be reached, is not known from analytical\ncalculations. In this paper we present the first scale-dependent saturation\nmodel based on an effective turbulent resistivity which is determined by the\nturnover timescale of turbulent eddies and the magnetic energy density. The\nmagnetic resistivity increases compared to the Spitzer value and the effective\nscale on which the magnetic energy spectrum is at its maximum moves to larger\nspatial scales. This process ends when the peak reaches a characteristic\nwavenumber k* which is determined by the critical magnetic Reynolds number. The\nsaturation level of the dynamo also depends on the type of turbulence and\ndiffers for the limits of large and small magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm.

The progenitors are\nselected using abundance matching techniques to account for the mass growth.\nThe morphologies strongly evolve from z~3. At z<1, the population matches the\nmassive end of the Hubble sequence, with 30% of spheroids, 50% of galaxies with\nequally dominant disk and bulge components and 20% of disks. At z~2-3 there is\na majority of irregular systems (~60-70%) with still 30% of spheroids.\n  We then analyze the SFRs, gas fractions and structural properties for the\ndifferent morphologies independently. Our results suggest two distinct channels\nfor the growth of bulges in massive galaxies.\n  Around 30-40% were already bulges at z~2.5, with low average SFRs and\ngas-fractions (10-15%), high Sersic indices (n>3-4) and small effective radii\n($R_e$~1 kpc) pointing towards an early formation through gas-rich mergers or\nVDI. Between z~ 2.5 and z~0, they rapidly increase their size by a factor of\n~4-5, become all passive but their global morphology remains unaltered. The\nstructural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is\ndriven by ex-situ events.\n  The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from\nclumpy disks to more regular bulge+disks systems, essentially happening at z>1.\nIt results in the growth of a significant bulge component (n~3) for 2/3 of the\nsystems possibly through the migration of clumps while the remaining 1/3 keeps\na rather small bulge (n~1.5-2).

This direct collapse process is a leading\ncandidate for rapid formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high\nz. To circumvent the Courant condition at small radii, we have used the sink\nparticle method, and focus on the evolution on scales ~0.01-10 pc. The collapse\nproceeds in two stages, with the secondary runaway happening within the central\n10 pc, and with no detected fragmentation. The sink particles form when the\ncollapsing gas requires additional refinement of the grid size at the highest\nrefinement level. Their mass never exceeds ~10^3 Mo, with the sole exception of\nthe central seed which grows dramatically to ~ 2 x 10^6 Mo in ~2 Myr,\nconfirming the feasibility of this path to the SMBH. The time variability of\nangular momentum axis in the accreted gas results in the formation of two\nmisaligned disks --- a small inner disk, and a more massive, outer disk which\nis inclined by ~45^o to the inner disk. The self-gravity of these disks is\nheavily diluted --- both disks lie within the Roche limit of the central seed.\nWhile the inner disk is geometrically thin and weakly asymmetric, the outer\ndisk flares due to turbulent motions as a result of the massive inflow along a\npair of penetrating filaments. The geometry of inflow via filaments determines\nthe dominant and secondary Fourier modes in this disk --- these modes have a\nnon-self-gravitational origin. We do not confirm that m=1 is a principal mode\nthat drives the inflow in the presence of a central massive object. While the\npositions of the disks depend on the scale chosen to break the self-similar\ncollapse, the overall configuration appears to be generic, and is expected to\nform when the central seed becomes sufficiently massive. \n\n"}

We show that\nanisotropic alpha particles can drive a parallel fire hose instability\nanalogous to that generated by protons, but that, remarkably, the instability\ncan be triggered also when the parallel plasma beta of alpha particles is below\nunity. The wave activity generated by the alpha anisotropy affects the\nevolution of the more abundant protons, leading to their anisotropic heating.\nWhen both ion species have sufficient parallel anisotropies both of them can\ndrive the instability, and we observe generation of two distinct peaks in the\nspectra of the fluctuations, with longer wavelengths associated to alphas and\nshorter ones to protons. If a non-zero relative drift is present, the unstable\nmodes propagate preferentially in the direction of the drift associated with\nthe unstable species. The generated waves scatter particles and reduce their\ntemperature anisotropy to marginally stable state, and, moreover, they\nsignificantly reduce the relative drift between the two ion populations.

The\nanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies have\ntangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the BCG. The mass-size\nrelation of low-mass passive ETGs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,\nand its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies. Low-mass\ngalaxies are also more compact within the scale radius of 0.65 Mpc. The ratio\nbetween stellar and number density profiles shows a mass segregation in the\ncenter. The comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profiles\nindicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction. Our results are\nconsistent with a scenario in which the \"environmental quenching\" of low-mass\ngalaxies is due to mechanisms such as harassment out to R200, starvation and\nram-pressure stripping at smaller radii, as supported by the analysis of the\nmass function, of the dynamical orbits and of the mass-size relation of passive\nearly-types in different regions. Our analyses support the idea that the\nintra-cluster light is formed through the tidal disruption of subgiant\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

This\nwork extends and significantly generalizes earlier work on incompressible Euler\nand ideal MHD. It involves a micro-scale cutoff length lambda which is a\nfunction of density, unlike in the incompressible case. In MHD, it can be taken\nto be of order the electron collisionless skin depth c/omega_pe.

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored.

In the\nlimit in which the spherical Jeans equation is assumed to be valid for a given\ntracer stellar population, we study the solution of this equation having the\nDark Matter mass profile as an output rather than as a trial parametric input.\nWithin our new formulation, we address to what level dwarf spheroidal galaxies\nfeature a reliable mass estimator. We assess then possible extrapolation of the\ndensity profiles in the inner regions and -- keeping explicit the dependence on\nthe orbital anisotropy profile of the tracer population -- we derive general\ntrends on the line-of-sight integral of the density profile squared, a quantity\ncommonly dubbed $J$-factor and crucial to estimate fluxes from prompt Dark\nMatter pair annihilations.

At\nthe same time, if one goes back to a fixed trial parametric form for the\ndensity, e.g. using a NFW or Burkert profile, we show that the minimal $J$ can\nhardly be reduced by more than a factor of 1.5. \n\n"}

Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have commonly been considered as a source of the\nobserved PeV cosmic rays (CRs) or a Galactic PeV particle accelerator\n(\"Pevatron\"). In this work, we study Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which is the\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, as another\npossible canditate of the Pevatron, because it sometimes became very active in\nthe past. We assume that a large number of PeV CRs were injected by Sgr A* at\nthe outburst about 10^7 yr ago when the Fermi bubbles were created. We\nconstrain the diffusion coefficient for the CRs in the Galactic halo on the\ncondition that the CRs have arrived on the Earth by now, while a fairly large\nfraction of them have escaped from the halo. Based on a diffusion-halo model,\nwe solve a diffusion equation for the CRs and compare the results with the CR\nspectrum on the Earth. The observed small anisotropy of the arrival directions\nof CRs may be explained if the diffusion coefficient in the Galactic disk is\nsmaller than that in the halo. Our model predicts that a boron-to-carbon ratio\nshould be energy-independent around the knee, where the CRs from Sgr A* become\ndominant.

We detected a\nyoung cluster in the center of the HII region with a limiting magnitude of K =\n18.0 mag (10sigma), which corresponds to a mass detection limit of ~0.2 M_sun.\nThis enables the comparison of star-forming properties under low metallicity\nwith those of the solar neighborhood. We identified 89 cluster members. From\nthe fitting of the K-band luminosity function (KLF), the age and distance of\nthe cluster are estimated to be ~0.5 Myr and ~4 kpc, respectively. The\nestimated young age is consistent with the detection of strong CO emission in\nthe cluster region and the estimated large extinction of cluster members (Av ~\n4--25 mag). The observed KLF suggests that the underlying initial mass function\n(IMF) of the low-metallicity cluster is not significantly different from\ncanonical IMFs in the solar neighborhood in terms of both high-mass slope and\nIMF peak (characteristic mass). Despite the very young age, the disk fraction\nof the cluster is estimated at only 27pm6 %, which is significantly lower than\nthose in the solar metallicity.

Therefore, the break\nfrequency \\nu_b in an intermediate polar power spectrum gives another relation\nin the M - R_m plane.

This\nfriction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial\nwaves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for\nthis friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent\neddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on\nvelocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into\naccount the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.\nTherefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and\ncharacteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been\nrecently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical\nsimulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal\nwaves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.\nFinally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary\nconvective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The\naction of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied\non tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number\nbelow 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of\nmagnitude.

It is well known that large-Reynolds-number plasmas easily\nbecome turbulent. We address the question whether turbulence enhances the\nenergy conversion rate of plasmoid-unstable current sheets. We carry out\nappropriate numerical MHD simulations, but resolving simultaneously the\nrelevant large-scale (mean-) fields and the corresponding small-scale,\nturbulent, quantities by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) is not\npossible. Hence we investigate the influence of small scale turbulence on large\nscale MHD processes by utilizing a subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence model. We\nverify the applicability of our SGS model and then use it to investigate the\ninfluence of turbulence on the plasmoid instability. We start the simulations\nwith Harris-type and force-free CS equilibria in the presence of a finite guide\nfield in the direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. We use the DNS\nresults to investigate the growth of the plasmoid instability. The energy and\ncross-helicity due to turbulence are obtained in terms of the mean fields by a\nGaussian filtering formulation from a Reynolds averaging turbulence model. The\ninfluence of turbulence on the reconnection rate of the plasmoid instability is\ninvestigated. To verify the predictions of the SGS-model, the electromotive\nforce (${\\bf\\cal{E}}$) is calculated for the coarse data obtained by filtering\nand compared to the SGS-model. The symmetry breakage with respect to the guide\nfield direction causes a turbulent helicity which reduces the influence of the\napparent turbulent resistivity. The reduced reconnection rate of guide field\nplasmoid reconnection is attributed to a balancing between the different\nphysical effects related to turbulence. \n\n"}

We find that the distribution\nof dust is consistent with an exponential at all radii with a gradient of ~-1.7\ndex R$_{25}^{-1}$. Our dust temperature declines linearly from ~25 K in the\ncentre to 15 K at R$_{25}$ from where it remains constant out to ~2.0 R$_{25}$.\nThe surface-density of dust declines with radius at a similar rate to the\nsurface-density of stars but more slowly than the surface-density of the\nstar-formation rate.

Abstract: Successful phenomenological models of pulsar wind nebulae assume efficient\ndissipation of the Poynting flux of the magnetized electron-positron wind as\nwell as efficient acceleration of the pairs in the vicinity of the termination\nshock, but how this is realized is not yet well understood. The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would\nfurther preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to\nequipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high\nmagnetization to values of order unity. Furthermore, it is speculated that the\nturbulence generated by the corrugation pattern may sustain a relativistic\nFermi process, accelerating particles close to the radiation reaction limit, as\nobserved in the Crab nebula. The required corrugation could be induced by the\nfast magnetosonic modes of downstream nebular turbulence; but it could also be\nproduced by upstream turbulence, either carried by the wind or seeded in the\nprecursor by the accelerated particles themselves. \n\n"}

In order to detect and analyse these signals, accurate\nwaveform templates which include the effects of the compact object's\ngravitational self-force are required. For computational efficiency, adiabatic\ntemplates are often used. These accurately reproduce orbit-averaged\ntrajectories arising from the first-order self-force, but neglect other\neffects, such as transient resonances, where the radial and poloidal\nfundamental frequencies become commensurate. During such resonances the flux of\ngravitational waves can be diminished or enhanced, leading to a shift in the\ncompact object's trajectory and the phase of the waveform.

The behavior of\noptimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice\nof the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the\nmean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak\nsignal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and\nare perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity\nexpected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our\nknowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic\nnatural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a\nperceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content\nloss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold\nusing a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the\nsuper-resolved images and original photo-realistic images.

We investigate resonant interaction of\nenergetic electrons with dispersive, right-handed waves. For the interaction of\nparticles and a single wave a variable transformation into the rest frame of\nthe wave can be performed. Here, wellestablished analytic models derived in the\nframework of magnetostatic quasi-linear theory (QLT) can be used as a reference\nto validate simulation results. However, this approach fails as soon as several\ndispersive waves are involved.

In reality, the\nprocess must be ubiquitous as astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions\nof fluid elements necessarily entail crossing of magnetic frozen-in field lines\nand magnetic reconnection. In the presence of turbulence, the reconnection is\nindependent of microscopic plasma properties, and may be much faster than\npreviously thought, as proposed in Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) and tested in\nKowal et al. (2009, 2012). However, the considered turbulence in the\nLazarian-Vishniac model was imposed externally. In this work we consider\nreconnection-driven magnetized turbulence in realistic three-dimensional\ngeometry initiated by stochastic noise. We demonstrate through numerical\nsimulations that the stochastic reconnection is able to self-generate\nturbulence through interactions between its outflows. We analyze the\nstatistical properties of velocity fluctuations using power spectra and\nanisotropy scaling, which demonstrates that the reconnection produces\nKolmogorov-like turbulence, compatible with Goldreich-Sridhar (1995) model.\nAnisotropy statistics are, however, strongly affected by the dynamics of\nreconnection outflows.

This pair-dominated plasma can block the laser transport and trigger an\navalanche-like QED cascade, efficiently transfering the laser energy to\nphotons. This renders a 1-$\\rm\\mu m$-scalelength, underdense preplasma\ncompletely opaque to laser pulses at this power level. The QED-induced opacity\ntherefore sets much higher contrast requirements for such pulse in solid-target\nexperiments than expected by classical plasma physics.

But the cosmic opacity can degrade the quality of standard candles. In\nthis paper, we use the latest observations, including type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) from JLA sample and Hubble parameters, to probe the opacity of the\nuniverse. In order to avoid the cosmological dependence of SNe Ia luminosity\ndistances, a joint fitting of the SNe Ia light-curve parameters, cosmological\nparameters and opacity is used. In order to explore the cosmic opacity at high\nredshifts, the latest gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are used. At high redshifts,\ncosmic reionization process is considered. We find that the sample supports an\nalmost transparent universe for flat $\\Lambda$CDM and XCDM models. Meanwhile,\nfree electrons deplete photons from standard candles through the (inverse)\nCompton scattering, known as an important component of opacity.

After the normalisation with\nrespect to environment density and redshift, several residual dependencies of\ngalaxy properties still remain. Most notable is the trend of morphology\ntransformations, resulting in a higher elliptical-to-spiral ratio while moving\nfrom voids towards filament spines, bringing along a corresponding increase in\nthe $g-i$ colour index and a decrease in star formation rate.

A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was applied to describe the\nbroad-band spectral energy distribution. IC 310 showed an extraordinary TeV\nflare at the beginning of the campaign, followed by a low, but still detectable\nTeV flux. Compared to previous measurements, the spectral shape was found to be\nsteeper during the low emission state. Simultaneous observations in the soft\nX-ray band showed an enhanced energy flux state and a harder-when-brighter\nspectral shape behaviour. No strong correlated flux variability was found in\nother frequency regimes. The broad-band spectral energy distribution obtained\nfrom these observations supports the hypothesis of a double-hump structure. The\nharder-when-brighter trend in the X-ray and VHE emission is consistent with the\nbehaviour expected from a synchrotron self-Compton scenario. The\ncontemporaneous broad-band spectral energy distribution is well described with\na one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model using parameters that are comparable\nto those found for other gamma-ray-emitting misaligned blazars. \n\n"}

Our results show that magnetic field\nleads to enhancement in elliptic flow for small impact parameters while it\nsuppresses it for large impact parameters (which may provide a signal for\ninitial stage magnetic field).

These and many new\nquestions can now be answered numerically where the nonlinear simulations even\nprovide the instability-induced values of several transport coefficients. The\ncylindrical containers are axially unbounded and penetrated by magnetic\nbackground fields with axial and/or azimuthal components.

The potential flow subject to axial fields becomes unstable\nagainst axisymmetric perturbations for a certain supercritical value of the\naveraged Reynolds number $\\overline{Rm}=\\sqrt{Re\\cdot Rm}$ (with $Re$ the\nReynolds number of rotation, $Rm$ its magnetic Reynolds number).

Consistent\nwith recent studies, the dynamo action is found to be sensitive to the aspect\nratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the\ndirection normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial\ndirection). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To\nexplain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a\nlong box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most\nefficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a\nresult, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal\n(stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux\nspreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are\npermeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the\ninstability. In agreement with this picture, the cases when the dynamo is\nefficient are characterized by a strong intermittency of the local azimuthal\nmagnetic fluxes. \n\n"}

Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet is disrupted\nand fast reconnection can occur.

The continuity equation\nrequires two specific inputs gauged on observations: (i) the star formation\nrate functions determined on the basis of the latest UV+far-IR/sub-mm/radio\nmeasurements; (ii) average star-formation histories for individual galaxies,\nwith different prescriptions for discs and spheroids. The continuity equation\nalso includes a source term taking into account (dry) mergers, based on recent\nnumerical simulations and consistent with observations. The stellar mass\nfunction derived from the continuity equation is coupled with the halo mass\nfunction and with the SFR functions to derive the star formation efficiency and\nthe main sequence of star-forming galaxies via the abundance matching\ntechnique. A remarkable agreement of the resulting stellar mass function for\nactive and quiescent galaxies, of the galaxy main sequence and of the\nstar-formation efficiency with current observations is found; the comparison\nwith data also allows to robustly constrain the characteristic timescales for\nstar formation and quiescence of massive galaxies, the star formation history\nof their progenitors, and the amount of stellar mass added by in-situ star\nformation vs. that contributed by external merger events.

To understand the emission, we have used the moving mesh\ncode Arepo to perform magneto-hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations with\nself-consistent CR physics. Our galaxy models exhibit a first burst of star\nformation that injects CRs at supernovae. Once CRs have sufficiently\naccumulated in our Milky-Way like galaxy, their buoyancy force overcomes the\nmagnetic tension of the toroidal disk field. As field lines open up, they\nenable anisotropically diffusing CRs to escape into the halo and to accelerate\na bubble-like, CR-dominated outflow. However, these bubbles are invisible in\nour simulated gamma-ray maps of hadronic pion-decay and secondary\ninverse-Compton emission because of low gas density in the outflows.

Motivated by the\ntransition region in the solar atmosphere the temperature and density ratio of\nthe plasmas is chosen as 100 and 0.01, respectively. For better understanding\nof studied processes we make two types of computations: a) without any\ninteractions among plasma particles (free expansion) and b) with the full\nelectromagnetic interactions. In both the cases we found that the flux of cold\nplasma electrons and protons from colder plasma to hotter one dominates over\nthe flux of hot plasma electrons and protons in the opposite direction. Thus,\nthe plasma in the hotter part of the system becomes colder and denser during\ntime evolution. In the case without any interactions among particles the cold\nplasma electrons and protons freely penetrate into the hot plasma. But, the\ncold plasma electrons are faster than cold plasma protons and therefore they\npenetrate deeper into the hotter part of the system than the protons. Thus, the\ncooling of the electron and proton components of the plasma in the hotter part\nof the system is different. On the other hand, in the case with the\nelectromagnetic interactions, owing to the plasma property, which tries to keep\nthe total electric current constant everywhere (close to zero in our case), the\ncold plasma electrons penetrate into the hotter part of the system together\nwith the cold plasma protons.

By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension\nreduction techniques to construct new high-information stellar activity\nindicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al.

At scales above the ion Larmor radius,\nthe theory reduces to the pressure-anisotropic generalization of kinetic\nreduced magnetohydrodynamics (KRMHD) formulated by Kunz et al. (2015). At\nscales at and below the ion Larmor radius, three main objectives are achieved.\nFirst, we analyse the linear response of the pressure-anisotropic gyrokinetic\nsystem, and show it to be a generalisation of previously explored limits. The\neffects of pressure anisotropy on the stability and collisionless damping of\nAlfvenic and compressive fluctuations are highlighted, with attention paid to\nthe spectral location and width of the frequency jump that occurs as Alfven\nwaves transition into kinetic Alfven waves. Secondly, we derive and discuss a\ngeneral free-energy conservation law, which captures both the KRMHD free-energy\nconservation at long wavelengths and dual cascades of kinetic Alfven waves and\nion entropy at sub-ion-Larmor scales. We show that non-Maxwellian features in\nthe distribution function change the amount of phase mixing and the efficiency\nof magnetic stresses, and thus influence the partitioning of free energy\namongst the cascade channels.

Abstract: In the Hall magnetohydrodynamics, the onset condition of the Kelvin Helmholtz\ninstability is solely determined by the Hall effect and is independent of the\nnature of shear flows. In addition, the physical mechanism behind the super and\nsub Alfvenic flows becoming unstable is quite different: the high frequency\nright circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic\nflows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave\nbecomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate\nof the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than\nthe corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the\nHall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)\nchannel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become\nKelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller\nthan the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of\nthe flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the\ninduction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a\nnew overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin\nHelmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the\nadvection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven\nMach number and is independent of the Hall diffusion coefficient. Further, the\ngrowth rate in this case linearly increase with the Alfven frequency with\nsmaller slope for sub Alfvenic flows. \n\n"}

Considering a blast wave moving with a Lorentz factor\n$\\Gamma$, we show that an off-axis observer, namely an observer at\n$\\theta_{obs}>1/\\Gamma$, sees a light curve rising faster than $F_\\nu\\propto\nt^3$. Therefore, the observed rise, $F_\\nu\\propto~t^{0.78}$, implies that at\nall times we have seen an on-axis emission. Namely, the emitting matter was\nwithin $\\theta_{obs}<1/\\Gamma$ at the time of observations (even if it was\noff-axis beforehand).

Assuming\nsingle-star evolution, the minimum mass of CCSNe is $7.33^{+0.02}_{-0.16}$\n$\\text{M}_\\odot$, the slope of the progenitor mass distribution is $\\alpha =\n-2.96^{+0.45}_{-0.25}$, and the maximum mass is greater than\n$\\text{M}_\\textrm{max} > 59$ $\\text{M}_\\odot$ with a 68% confidence. While\nthese results are consistent with previous inferences, they also provide\ntighter constraints. The progenitor distribution is somewhat steeper than a\nSalpeter initial mass function ($\\alpha$ = -2.35). This suggests that either\nSNR catalogs are biased against the youngest SF regions, or the most massive\nstars do not explode as easily as lower mass stars. If SNR catalogs are biased,\nit will most likely affect the slope but not the minimum mass. The\nuncertainties are dominated by three primary sources of uncertainty, the SFH\nresolution, the number of SF bursts, and the uncertainty on SF rate in each age\nbin.

It has recently been proposed\nthat N-rich quasars may result from tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars by\nsupermassive black holes. The rapid enhancement of nitrogen and the depletion\nof carbon due to the carbon--nitrogen--oxygen cycle in supersolar mass stars\ncould naturally produce high N/C. However, the TDE hypothesis predicts that the\nN/C should change with time, which has never hitherto been observed.

Most of the\nnon-thermal ECE comes from runaway electrons in the low-energy regime with\nlarge pitch angle, which are strongly scattered by the excited whistler waves.\nThe power of ECE from runaway electrons is obtained using a synthetic\ndiagnostic model based on the reciprocity method. The electron distribution\nfunction is calculated using a kinetic simulation model including the whistler\nwave instabilities and the quasilinear diffusion effects. Simulations based on\nDIII-D low-density discharge reproduces the rapid growth of the ECE signals\nobserved in DIII-D experiments.

Mirror Langmuir probes (MLPs) are a\nnovel diagnostic that uniquely allow to sample the plasma parameters on a time\nscale shorter than the characteristic time scale of their fluctuations. Sudden\nlarge-amplitude fluctuations in the plasma degrade the precision and accuracy\nof the plasma parameters reported by MLPs for cases in which the probe bias\nrange is of insufficient amplitude. While some data samples can readily be\nclassified as valid and invalid, we find that such a classification may be\nambiguous for up to 40% of data sampled for the plasma parameters and bias\nvoltages considered in this study. In this contribution we employ an\nautoencoder (AE) to learn a low-dimensional representation of valid data\nsamples. By definition, the coordinates in this space are the features that\nmostly characterize valid data. Ambiguous data samples are classified in this\nspace using standard classifiers for vectorial data. This way, we avoid to\ndefine complicate threshold rules to identify outliers, which requires strong\nassumptions and introduce biases in the analysis. Instead, these rules are\nlearned from the data by statistical inference By removing the outliers that\nare identified in the latent low-dimensional space of the AE, we find that the\naverage conductive and convective radial heat flux are between approximately 5\nand 15% lower as when removing outliers identified by threshold values. For\ncontributions to the radial heat flux due to triple correlations, the\ndifference is up to 40%. \n\n"}

In particular, molecules that contain\nnitrogen are interesting due to the role nitrogen plays in the development of\nlife and the compact scales such molecules have been found to trace around\nforming protostars. The goal of this work is to determine the inventory of one\nfamily of nitrogen-bearing organic molecules, complex nitriles (molecules with\na $-$CN functional group) towards two hot corino sources in the low-mass\nprotostellar binary IRAS 16293$-$2422. This work explores the abundance\ndifferences between the two sources, the isotopic ratios, and the spatial\nextent derived from molecules containing the nitrile functional group. Using\ndata from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) obtained with\nALMA we determine abundances and excitation temperatures for the detected\nnitriles. We also present a new method for determining the spatial structure of\nsources with high line density and large velocity gradients $-$\nVelocity-corrected INtegrated emission (VINE) maps. We detect methyl cyanide\n(CH$_3$CN) as well as 5 of its isotopologues, including the detection of\nCHD$_2$CN which is the first detection in the ISM. We also detect ethyl cyanide\n(C$_2$H$_5$CN), vinyl cyanide (C$_2$H$_3$CN), and cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N). We\nfind that abundances are similar between IRAS 16293A and IRAS 16293B on small\nscales except for vinyl cyanide which is only detected towards the latter\nsource. This suggests an important difference between the sources either in\ntheir evolutionary stage or warm-up timescales. We also detect a spatially\ndouble-peaked emission for the first time in molecular emission in the A\nsource, suggesting that this source is showing structure related to a rotating\ntoroid of material. \n\n"}

The precision of the $H_{0}$ measurement depends on\nthe uncertainties in the time-delay measurements, the mass distribution of the\nmain deflector(s), and the mass distribution along the line of sight.

If real, this effect could significantly broaden the uncertainty\non the time delay measurements by up to $30\\%$ for lens systems such as\nPG1115+080, which have relatively short time delays and monitoring over several\ndifferent epochs. In this paper we develop a new technique that uses the\ntime-delay ratios and simulated microlensing maps within a Bayesian framework\nin order to limit the allowed combinations of microlensing delays and thus to\nlessen the uncertainties due to the proposed effect.

In contrast,\nquasi-perpendicular shocks do not efficiently accelerate ions. We model this\nobliquity-dependent acceleration process in a spherically expanding blast wave\nsetup with the moving-mesh code {\\sc arepo} for different magnetic field\nmorphologies, ranging from homogeneous to turbulent configurations. A\nSedov-Taylor explosion in a homogeneous magnetic field generates an oblate\nellipsoidal shock surface due to the slower propagating blast wave in the\ndirection of the magnetic field. This is because of the efficient cosmic ray\n(CR) production in the quasi-parallel polar cap regions, which softens the\nequation of state and increases the compressibility of the post-shock gas. We\nfind that the solution remains self-similar because the ellipticity of the\npropagating blast wave stays constant in time. This enables us to derive an\neffective ratio of specific heats for a composite of thermal gas and CRs as a\nfunction of the maximum acceleration efficiency. We finally discuss the\nbehavior of supernova remnants expanding into a turbulent magnetic field with\nvarying coherence lengths. For a maximum CR acceleration efficiency of about 15\nper cent at quasi-parallel shocks (as suggested by kinetic plasma simulations),\nwe find an average efficiency of about 5 per cent, independent of the assumed\nmagnetic coherence length. \n\n"}

A key issue is the proportion of the stellar ionizing\nradiation that escapes the galaxies in which it is produced. Spectroscopy of\ngamma-ray burst afterglows can be used to determine the neutral hydrogen\ncolumn-density in their host galaxies and hence the opacity to extreme\nultra-violet radiation along the lines-of-sight to the bursts. Thus, making the\nreasonable assumption that long-duration GRB locations are representative of\nthe sites of massive stars that dominate EUV production, one can calculate an\naverage escape fraction of ionizing radiation in a way that is independent of\ngalaxy size, luminosity or underlying spectrum. Here we present a sample of NH\nmeasures for 138 GRBs in the range 1.6<z<6.7 and use it to establish an average\nescape fraction at the Lyman limit of <fesc>~0.005, with a 98% confidence upper\nlimit of ~0.015. This analysis suggests that stars provide a small contribution\nto the ionizing radiation budget of the IGM at z<5, where the bulk of the\nbursts lie. At higher redshifts, z>5, firm conclusions are limited by the small\nsize of the GRB sample, but any decline in average HI column-density seems to\nbe modest. We also find no indication of a significant correlation of NH with\ngalaxy UV luminosity or host stellar mass, for the subset of events for which\nthese are available. We discuss in some detail a number of selection effects\nand potential biases. Drawing on a range of evidence we argue that such\neffects, while not negligible, are unlikely to produce systematic errors of\nmore than a factor ~2, and so would not affect the primary conclusions.

We present an improved postprocessing framework to estimate the\nabundance of atomic and molecular hydrogen and apply it to the IllustrisTNG\nsimulations. We compare five different models for the atomic-to-molecular\ntransition, including empirical, simulation-based, and theoretical\nprescriptions. Most of these models rely on the surface density of neutral\nhydrogen and the ultraviolet (UV) flux in the Lyman-Werner band as input\nparameters. Computing these quantities on the kiloparsec scales resolved by the\nsimulations emerges as the main challenge. We show that the commonly used Jeans\nlength approximation to the column density of a system can be biased and\nexhibits large cell-to-cell scatter. Instead, we propose to compute all surface\nquantities in face-on projections and perform the modeling in two dimensions.\nIn general, the two methods agree on average, but their predictions diverge for\nindividual galaxies and for models based on the observed midplane pressure of\ngalaxies. We model the UV radiation from young stars by assuming a constant\nescape fraction and optically thin propagation throughout the galaxy. With\nthese improvements, we find that the five models for the atomic-to-molecular\ntransition roughly agree on average but that the details of the modeling matter\nfor individual galaxies and the spatial distribution of molecular hydrogen.

This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty\nsystems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early\nUniverse was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward\nevolution galaxy model described by Casey et al.

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar\nmedium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,\nH$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

These exospheres are formed by surface\nparticles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar\nwind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are\ndriven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained\nby Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most\nwell constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii. For planet b, the column density of OI\nalong the line of sight reaches 10^{13}/cm2, with the highest values found\nahead of its orbital motion.

This rapid mixing underlies Landau damping of these\nfluctuations in a quiescent plasma-one of the most fundamental physical\nphenomena that make plasma different from a conventional fluid. Nevertheless,\nbroad power-law spectra of compressive fluctuations are observed in turbulent\nastrophysical plasmas (most vividly, in the solar wind) under conditions\nconducive to strong Landau damping. Elsewhere in nature, such spectra are\nnormally associated with fluid turbulence, where energy cannot be dissipated in\nthe inertial scale range and is therefore cascaded from large scales to small.\nBy direct numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, it is shown here\nthat turbulence of compressive fluctuations in collisionless plasmas strongly\nresembles one in a collisional fluid and does have broad power-law spectra.\nThis \"fluidization\" of collisionless plasmas occurs because phase mixing is\nstrongly suppressed on average by \"stochastic echoes\", arising due to nonlinear\nadvection of the particle distribution by turbulent motions. Besides resolving\nthe long-standing puzzle of observed compressive fluctuations in the solar\nwind, our results suggest a conceptual shift for understanding kinetic plasma\nturbulence generally: rather than being a system where Landau damping plays the\nrole of dissipation, a collisionless plasma is effectively dissipationless\nexcept at very small scales.

We have investigated\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and MERLIN radio maps of powerful jet\nsources for morphological evidence of geodetic precession. For perhaps the best\nstudied source, Cygnus A, we find strong evidence for geodetic precession.\nProjection effects can enhance precession features, for which we find\nindications in strongly projected sources. For a complete sample of 33 3CR\nradio sources we find strong evidence for jet precession in 24 cases (73 per\ncent).

Hot\natmospheres and radio jets and lobes are the ingredients of radio-mechanical\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. While a consensus has emerged that such\nfeedback suppresses cooling of hot cluster atmospheres, less attention has been\npaid to massive galaxies where similar mechanisms are at play. Observation\nindicates that the atmospheres of elliptical and S0 galaxies were accreted\nexternally during the process of galaxy assembly and augmented significantly by\nstellar mass loss. Their atmospheres have entropy and cooling time profiles\nthat are remarkably similar to those of central cluster galaxies.

Quantitatively, the fluctuation level and the field-line geometry can be\nstudied in terms of the statistics of the field strength and of the field-line\ncurvature. In the kinematic limit, the distribution of the field strength is an\nexpanding lognormal, while that of the field-line curvature K is stationary and\nhas a power tail K^{-13/7}. The field strength and curvature are\nanticorrelated, i.e. the growing fields are mostly flat, while the sharply\ncurved fields remain relatively weak. The field, therefore, settles into a\nreduced-tension state. Numerical simulations demonstrate three essential\nfeatures of the nonlinear regime.

Next, I argue that the force-free\ncondition implies that the magnetic field be produced in, and anchored by, a\nnearby dense massive object, e.g., a star or a disk, strongly stratified by\ngravity.

We estimate an event rate\nfor such \\emph{intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals} (IMRIs) of up to $\\sim\n10$--$30 \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Our numerical simulations show that if the central\nbody is not a black hole but its metric is stationary, axisymmetric, reflection\nsymmetric and asymptotically flat then the waves will likely be tri-periodic,\nas for a black hole. We report generalizations of a theorem due to Ryan (1995)\nwhich suggest that the evolutions of the waves' three fundamental frequencies\nand of the complex amplitudes of their spectral components encode (in\nprinciple) a full map of the central body's metric, full details of the energy\nand angular momentum exchange between the central body and the orbit, and the\ntime-evolving orbital elements. We estimate that Advanced LIGO can measure or\nconstrain deviations of the central body from a Kerr black hole with modest but\ninteresting accuracy. \n\n"}

We present a model for the emission of radiation by elongated\npolarized dust grains under the influence of both an external electromagnetic\nwave and a constant background magnetic field. The dust, exhibiting rotational\nmotion at the external electromagnetic field frequency w0 as well as quivering\nmotion at frequency W0, proportional to the em field amplitude, will radiate\nwith frequencies that will depend on the external field wavelength and\namplitude. The radiated spectra exibits a frequency around w0, and sidebands at\nw0+-W0 and w0+-2W0. Since the amplitude and the frequency of the background\nelectromagnetic field are independent parameters, this model establishes a\ncorrelation between different spectral components of galactic dipolar emission,\nwhich may help to explain the correlation between a component of the Galactic\nmicrowave emission and the 100micons thermal emission from interstellar dust,\nthat has been recently measured. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0603085", "contents": "Title: On the effects of turbulence on a screw dynamo Abstract: In an experiment in the Institute of Continuous Media Mechanics in Perm\n(Russia) an non--stationary screw dynamo is intended to be realized with a\nhelical flow of liquid sodium in a torus. The flow is necessarily turbulent,\nthat is, may be considered as a mean flow and a superimposed turbulence. In\nthis paper the induction processes of the turbulence are investigated within\nthe framework of mean--field electrodynamics. They imply of course a part which\nleads to an enhanced dissipation of the mean magnetic field. As a consequence\nof the helical mean flow there are also helical structures in the turbulence.\nThey lead to some kind of $\\alpha$--effect, which might basically support the\nscrew dynamo. The peculiarity of this $\\alpha$--effect explains measurements\nmade at a smaller version of the device envisaged for the dynamo experiment.\nThe helical structures of the turbulence lead also to other effects, which in\ncombination with a rotational shear are potentially capable of dynamo action. A\npart of them can basically support the screw dynamo. Under the conditions of\nthe experiment all induction effects of the turbulence prove to be rather weak\nin comparison to that of the main flow. Numerical solutions of the mean--field\ninduction equation show that all the induction effects of the turbulence\ntogether let the screw dynamo threshold slightly, at most by one per cent,\nrise. The numerical results give also some insights into the action of the\nindividual induction effects of the turbulence. \n\n"}

The dynamical behavior of the electrons is similar to the one\ndescribed by conventional models of stars clusters dynamics. The single mass\ncomponent, the spherical symmetry and no stars evolution are here accurate\nassumptions. The analog of binary stars formations in the cluster case is\nthree-body recombination in Rydberg atoms in the plasma case with the same\nHeggie's law: soft binaries get softer and hard binaries get harder. We\ndemonstrate that the evolution of such an ultracold plasma is dominated by\nFokker-Planck kinetics equations formally identical to the ones controlling the\nevolution of a stars cluster. The Virial theorem leads to a link between the\nplasma temperature and the ions and electrons numbers. The Fokker-Planck\nequation is approximate using gaseous and fluid models. We found that the\nelectrons are in a Kramers-Michie-King's type quasi-equilibrium distribution as\nstars in clusters.
