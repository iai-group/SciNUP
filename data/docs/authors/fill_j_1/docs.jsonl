In dimension d=3, the large deviation is due to a ``distant\nattracting galaxy'' but a phase transition occurs when f_3(gamma)=1 (at that\npoint, the fluctuations due to individual stars dominate). When d>=5, the large\ndeviation is due to a thin tube (a ``wormhole'') along which the star density\nincreases monotonically, until the point f_d(gamma)=1 (where again fluctuations\ndue to individual stars dominate). In dimension 4 we find a double phase\ntransition, where the transition between low-dimensional behavior (attracting\ngalaxy) and high-dimensional behavior (wormhole) occurs at gamma=4/3.\n  As consequences, we determine the tail behavior of the distance from a star\nto a uniform point in its cell, and prove a sharp lower bound for the tail\nprobability of the cell's diameter, matching our earlier upper bound. \n\n"}

Diffusion as a stochastic\nprocess of an overdamped individual particle immersed in a fluid, initiated by\nEinstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin and Wiener, has no momentum since its path is\nnowhere differentiable. In this exposition, we illustrate how analytical\nmechanics arises in stochastic dynamics from a randomly perturbed ordinary\ndifferential equation $dX_t=b(X_t)dt+\\epsilon dW_t$ where $W_t$ is a Brownian\nmotion. In the limit of vanishingly small $\\epsilon$, the solution to the\nstochastic differential equation other than $\\dot{x}=b(x)$ are all rare events.\nHowever, conditioned on an occurence of such an event, the most probable\ntrajectory of the stochastic motion is the solution to Lagrangian mechanics\nwith $\\mathcal{L}=\\|\\dot{q}-b(q)\\|^2/4$ and Hamiltonian equations with\n$H(p,q)=\\|p\\|^2+b(q)\\cdot p$. Hamiltonian conservation law implies that the\nmost probable trajectory for a \"rare\" event has a uniform \"excess kinetic\nenergy\" along its path. Rare events can also be characterized by the principle\nof large deviations which expresses the probability density function for $X_t$\nas $f(x,t)=e^{-u(x,t)/\\epsilon}$, where $u(x,t)$ is called a large-deviation\nrate function which satisfies the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. An\nirreversible diffusion process with $\\nabla\\times b\\neq 0$ corresponds to a\nNewtonian system with a Lorentz force $\\ddot{q}=(\\nabla\\times b)\\times\n\\dot{q}+1/2\\nabla\\|b\\|^2$.

One starts\nwith the empty graph and at each stage two edges are chosen uniformly at\nrandom. One of the two edges is then placed into the system according to a\ndecision rule based on the sizes of the components containing the four\nvertices. For bounded-size rules, all components of size greater than some\nfixed $K\\geq 1$ are accorded the same treatment. Writing $\\BS(t)$ for the state\nof the system with nt/2 edges, Spencer and Wormald proved that for such rules,\nthere exists a critical time t_c such that when t< t_c the size of the largest\ncomponent is of order $\\log{n}$ while for $t> t_c$, the size of the largest\ncomponent is of order $n$. In this work we obtain upper bounds (that hold with\nhigh probability) of order $n^{2\\gamma} \\log ^4 n$, on the size of the largest\ncomponent, at time instants $t_n = t_c-n^{-\\gamma}$, where $\\gamma\\in (0,1/4)$.\nThis result for the barely subcritical regime forms a key ingredient in the\nstudy undertaken in \\cite{amc-2012}, of the asymptotic dynamic behavior of the\nprocess describing the vector of component sizes and associated complexity of\nthe components for such random graph models in the critical scaling window.

By contrast, it has been\nargued in the science literature that such networks are highly vulnerable to a\ntargeted attack, and removing a small number of key nodes in the network will\ndramatically change the topological structure. Here we analyse a class of\npreferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main\nresults supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion\nepsilon>0 of the oldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has\nexponential instead of power law tails; (2) the largest degree in the network\ndrops from being of the order of a power of the network size n to being just\nlogarithmic in n; (3) the typical distances in the network increase from order\nlog log n to order log n; and (4) the network becomes vulnerable to random\nremoval of nodes. Importantly, all our results explicitly quantify the\ndependence on the proportion epsilon of removed vertices. For example, we show\nthat the critical proportion of nodes that have to be retained for survival of\nthe giant component undergoes a steep increase as epsilon moves away from zero,\nand a comparison of this result with similar ones for other networks reveals\nthe existence of two different universality classes of robust network models.\nThe key technique in our proofs is a local approximation of the network by a\nbranching random walk with two killing boundaries, and an understanding of the\nparticle genealogies in this process, which enters into estimates for the\nspectral radius of an associated operator. \n\n"}

{"id": "1403.2448", "contents": "Title: Finitely dependent coloring Abstract: We prove that proper coloring distinguishes between block-factors and\nfinitely dependent stationary processes. A stochastic process is finitely\ndependent if variables at sufficiently well-separated locations are\nindependent; it is a block-factor if it can be expressed as an equivariant\nfinite-range function of independent variables. The problem of finding\nnon-block-factor finitely dependent processes dates back to 1965. The first\npublished example appeared in 1993, and we provide arguably the first natural\nexamples. More precisely, Schramm proved in 2008 that no stationary 1-dependent\n3-coloring of the integers exists, and conjectured that no stationary\nk-dependent q-coloring exists for any k and q. We disprove this by constructing\na 1-dependent 4-coloring and a 2-dependent 3-coloring, thus resolving the\nquestion for all k and q.\n  Our construction is canonical and natural, yet very different from all\nprevious schemes. In its pure form it yields precisely the two finitely\ndependent colorings mentioned above, and no others. The processes provide\nunexpected connections between extremal cases of the Lovasz local lemma and\ndescent and peak sets of random permutations. Neither coloring can be expressed\nas a block-factor, nor as a function of a finite-state Markov chain; indeed, no\nstationary finitely dependent coloring can be so expressed. We deduce\nextensions involving d dimensions and shifts of finite type; in fact, any\nnon-degenerate shift of finite type also distinguishes between block-factors\nand finitely dependent processes. \n\n"}

A crucial point is that the evolution\noperator L may have singular and nonsmooth coefficients. This allows the\napplication of the method e.g. to degenerate and singular particle systems\narising in Mathematical Physics. As far as we know in such singular cases the\nrelaxation to equilibrium can't be discussed with the help of existing\napproaches using hypoellipticity, hypocoercivity or stochastic Lyapunov type\ntechniques. The method is formulated in an L2-Hilbert space setting and is\nbased on an interplay between Functional Analysis and Stochastics.

Both classes were introduced---with Brownian-time-type\nkernel formulations---by Allouba in a series of articles starting in 2006,\nwhere he presented class (2) in its rigorous stochastic integral equations\nform. He proved existence, uniqueness, and sharp spatio-temporal H\\\"older\nregularity for the above two classes of equations in $d=1,2,3$. We show that\nboth classes are $(1/2)^-$ H\\\"older continuously differentiable in space when\n$d=1$, and we give the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity for the\ngradient in both cases. This is unprecedented for SPDEs driven by space-time\nwhite noise. Our results on exact moduli show that the half-derivative SPIDE is\na critical case.

Starting from the observation that quantum physics\nunavoidably has to deal with high dimensional objects, basically two routes can\nbe taken: either try and reduce their study to that of lower dimensional ones,\nor try and understand what kind of universal properties might precisely emerge\nin this regime. We actually do not choose which of these two attitudes to\nfollow here, and rather oscillate between one and the other.

In our model, the agents form some initial belief (probability\ndistribution) about the unknown state and then refine their beliefs in\naccordance with their private observations, as well as the beliefs of their\nneighbors. An agent learns the unknown state when her belief converges to a\npoint mass that is concentrated at the true state.

The dispatcher therefore aims to\nevenly distribute the tasks across the various server pools. Specifically, when\na task arrives, the dispatcher assigns it to the server pool with the minimum\nnumber of tasks among $d(N)$ randomly selected server pools. This assignment\nstrategy is called the JSQ$(d(N))$ scheme, as it resembles the power-of-$d$\nversion of the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy, and will also be referred\nto as such in the special case $d(N) = N$.\n  We construct a stochastic coupling to bound the difference in the system\noccupancy processes between the JSQ policy and a scheme with an arbitrary value\nof $d(N)$.

Specifically, Part I\ndeals with the Lindberg method of influence functions in free probability\nspaces. By providing a general multidimensional invariance principle for\nhomogeneous sums in freely independent variables, a class of universal laws for\nsemicircular and free Poisson approximations will be derived that satisfies\nalso the so-called Fourth Moment phenomenon. It is known that the fourth moment\nphenomenon for homogeneous sums applies, for instance, when X is Gaussian,\nPoisson, semicircular or free Poisson distributed. Is there a characterizing\nproperty enabling this phenomenon, or does it occur accidentally? The goal of\nPart II is the characterization of random variables X such that homogeneous\nsums based on i.i.d. copies of X verify the Fourth Moment Theorem, both for\nclassical and free probability spaces.

In this paper we show that $T(H, G_n)$\nconverges to $\\mathrm{Pois}(\\lambda)$ whenever $\\mathbb E T(H, G_n) \\rightarrow\n\\lambda$ and $\\mathrm{Var} T(H, G_n) \\rightarrow \\lambda$, that is, the\nasymptotic Poisson distribution of $T(H, G_n)$ is determined just by the\nconvergence of its mean and variance. Moreover, this condition is necessary if\nand only if $H$ is a star-graph. In fact, the second-moment phenomenon is a\nconsequence of a more general theorem about the convergence of $T(H,G_n)$ to a\nfinite linear combination of independent Poisson random variables. As an\napplication, we derive the limiting distribution of $T(H, G_n)$, when $G_n\\sim\nG(n, p)$ is the Erd\\H os-R\\'enyi random graph. Multiple phase-transitions\nemerge as $p$ varies from 0 to 1, depending on whether the graph $H$ is\nbalanced or unbalanced. \n\n"}

It is known that these so-called\nballs-in-bins processes with feedback have a monopolistic regime: if f(x)=x^p\nfor p>1, then there is a finite time after which one of the bins will receive\nall incoming balls.\n  Our goal in this paper is to quantify the onset of monopoly. We show that the\ninitial number of balls is large and bin 1 starts with a fraction \\alpha>1/2 of\nthe balls, then with very high probability its share of the total number of\nballs never decreases significantly below \\alpha. Thus a bin that obtains more\nthan half of the balls at a \"large time\" will most likely preserve its position\nof leadership. However, the probability that the winning bin has a\nnon-negligible advantage after n balls are in the system is ~ C n^{1-p}, and\nthe number of balls in the losing bin has a power-law tail. Similar results\nalso hold for more general functions f. \n\n"}

A commonly studied case where there\nare two bins and f(n) = n^p for p > 0, and our goal is to study the fine\nbehavior of this process with two bins and a large initial number t of balls.\nPerhaps surprisingly, Brownian Motions are an essential part of both our\nproofs.\n  For p>1/2, it was known that with probability 1 one of the bins will lead the\nprocess at all large enough times. We show that if the first bin starts with\nt+\\lambda\\sqrt{t} balls (for constant \\lambda\\in \\R), the probability that it\nalways or eventually leads has a non-trivial limit depending on \\lambda.\n  For p\\leq 1/2, it was known that with probability 1 the bins will alternate\nin leadership.

Our approach is based on studying the\ncorrelation functions of certain related point stochastic processes.\n  In the present paper we consider the so-called tail point processes which\ndescribe the limit behavior of the Thoma parameters (coordinates on the Thoma\nsimplex) with large numbers. The tail processes turn out to be stationary\nprocesses on the real line. Their correlation functions have determinantal form\nwith a kernel which generalizes the well-known sine kernel arising in random\nmatrix theory. Our second result is a law of large numbers for the Thoma\nparameters. We also produce Sturm-Liouville operators commuting with the\nWhittaker kernel introduced in Part II and with the generalized sine kernel. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/9809145", "contents": "Title: Scaling Limits for Minimal and Random Spanning Trees in Two Dimensions Abstract: A general formulation is presented for continuum scaling limits of stochastic\nspanning trees. A spanning tree is expressed in this limit through a consistent\ncollection of subtrees, which includes a tree for every finite set of endpoints\nin $\\R^d$. Tightness of the distribution, as $\\delta \\to 0$, is established for\nthe following two-dimensional examples: the uniformly random spanning tree on\n$\\delta \\Z^2$, the minimal spanning tree on $\\delta \\Z^2$ (with random edge\nlengths), and the Euclidean minimal spanning tree on a Poisson process of\npoints in $\\R^2$ with density $\\delta^{-2}$. In each case, sample trees are\nproven to have the following properties, with probability one with respect to\nany of the limiting measures: i) there is a single route to infinity (as was\nknown for $\\delta > 0$), ii) the tree branches are given by curves which are\nregular in the sense of H\\\"older continuity, iii) the branches are also rough,\nin the sense that their Hausdorff dimension exceeds one, iv) there is a random\ndense subset of $\\R^2$, of dimension strictly between one and two, on the\ncomplement of which (and only there) the spanning subtrees are unique with\ncontinuous dependence on the endpoints, v) branching occurs at countably many\npoints in $\\R^2$, and vi) the branching numbers are uniformly bounded. The\nresults include tightness for the loop erased random walk (LERW) in two\ndimensions. The proofs proceed through the derivation of scale-invariant power\nbounds on the probabilities of repeated crossings of annuli. \n\n"}
