Non-thermal\n  scaling relations and comparison to observations Abstract: Complementary views of galaxy clusters in the radio synchrotron, hard X-ray\ninverse Compton, and high-energy gamma-ray regimes are critical in calibrating\nthem as high-precision cosmological probes. We present predictions for scaling\nrelations between cluster mass and these non-thermal observables.

Calibrating the\nmagnetic fields of our model with Faraday rotation measurements (RM), the\nsynchrotron emission of our relativistic electron populations matches the radio\nsynchrotron luminosities and morphologies of observed giant radio halos and\nmini-halos surprisingly well. Using the complete sample of the brightest X-ray\nclusters observed by ROSAT in combination with our gamma-ray scaling relation,\nwe predict GLAST will detect about ten clusters allowing for Eddington bias due\nto the scatter in the scaling relation.

We provide an absolute\nlower flux limit for the gamma-ray emission of Coma in the hadronic model which\ncan be made tighter for magnetic field values derived from RM values to match\nthe GLAST sensitivity, providing thus a unique test for the possible hadronic\norigin of radio halos. Our predicted hard X-ray emission, due to inverse\nCompton emission of shock accelerated and hadronically produced relativistic\nelectrons, falls short of the detections in Coma and Perseus by a factor of 50.\nThis casts doubts on the inverse Compton interpretation and reinforces the\nknown discrepancy of magnetic field estimates from Faraday RM values and those\nobtained by combining synchrotron and inverse Compton emission.

The boost factors, corresponding\nto an enhancement of the signal and linked to the clumpiness properties of the\ndark matter distribution, have been taken as high as thousands in the past. The\ndramatic impact of these boost factors for indirect detection of antiparticles,\nfor instance with the PAMELA satellite or the coming AMS-02 experiment, asks\nfor their detailed calculation. We take into account the results of high\nresolution N-body dark matter simulations to calculate the most likely energy\ndependent boost factors linked to the cosmic ray propagation properties, for\nanti-protons and positrons. Starting from the mass and space distributions of\nsub-halos, the anti-proton and positron propagators are used to calculate the\nmean value and the variance of the boost factor for the primary fluxes. We take\nadvantage of the statistical method introduced in Lavalle et al. (2007) and\ncross-check the results with Monte Carlo computations. By spanning some extreme\nconfigurations of sub-halo and propagation properties, we find that the average\ncontribution of the clumps is negligible compared to that of the smooth dark\nmatter component. Sub-halos do not lead to enhancement of the signals, unless\nthey are taken with some extreme (unexpected) properties. This result is\nindependent of the nature of the self-annihilating dark matter candidate\nconsidered, and provides precise estimates of the theoretical and the\nstatistical uncertainties of the antimatter flux from dark matter\nsubstructures. Spectral distortions can still be expected in antimatter flux\nmeasurements, but scenarios invoking large and even mild clumpiness boost\nfactors are strongly disfavoured by our analysis. \n\n"}

Using a simple analytic model for the evolution of\nICM CRs, which are produced by accretion shocks (primary CRs), we find that\nbeta_{core} ~ eta_{p}/200, nearly independent of GC mass and with a scatter\nDelta ln(beta_{core}) ~ 1 between GCs of given mass.

But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of\nmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is\nmore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been\naltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate a\nmoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of\nmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.\nInstead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initial\nfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of the\nluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this\nmechanism could be efficient.

Abstract: We compute the effect of an orbiting gas disc in promoting the coalescence of\na central supermassive black hole binary. Unlike earlier studies, we consider a\nfinite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gas\nnecessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i.e.\nthat the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre--existing accretion\ndisc. We consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary's\ngravitational radiation. We study the effects of star formation in the gas disc\nin a simple energy feedback framework. The disc spectrum differs in detail from\nthat found before. In particular, tidal torques from the secondary black hole\nheat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. These\nrims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, but\ncan on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light from\nthe disc. This may lead to detectable high--photon--energy variability on the\nrelatively long orbital timescale of the secondary black hole, and thus offer a\nprospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary. We also find that the\ndisc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable timescale only if its mass\nis at least comparable with that of the secondary black hole, and if the\ninitial binary separation is relatively small, i.e. $a_0 \\lesssim 0.05$ pc.\nStar formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc.\nIn the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the disc\nmass. As a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratio\nis $\\la 0.001$. Gas discs thus appear not to be an effective solution to the\n`last parsec' problem for a significant class of mergers. \n\n"}

Wino annihilation does not describe the Fermi e+ + e- data\n(except partially below ~ 100 GeV).

We find that the MF\nevolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM<10.6) is mostly explained\nby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation\nactivities. The low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger per\ngalaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). We find that ETGs increase\nin number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing Mstar, with a median\n\"building redshift\" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.\nFor LTGs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remains\nalmost constant from z~1. Instead, the most extreme population of active star\nforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. We suggest a\ntransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into blue\nquiescent and successively (1-2 Gyr after) into red passive types.

Assuming that\nthe excess of high-z GRB rate is due to the cosmic metallicity evolution or\nunknown LGRB rate increase parameterized as (1+z)^delta, we find that although\nthe two scenarios alone can improve the consistency between our simulations and\nobservations, incorporation of them gives much better consistency. We get\n0.2<epsilon<0.6 and delta<0.6, where epsilon is the metallicity threshold for\nthe production of LGRBs. The best consistency is obtained with a parameter set\n(epsilon, delta)=(~0.4, ~0.4), and BAT might trigger a few LGRBs at z~14. With\nincreasing detections of GRBs at z>4 (~15% of GRBs in current Swift LGRB sample\nbased on our simulations), a window for very early Universe is opening by Swift\nand up-coming SVOM missions. \n\n"}

The campaign consists of 7 observations. We analyze the\nresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizing\nflux variations. Despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impinging\ncontinuum, the soft X-ray spectra of the source show little spectral\nvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. A detailed time\nmodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing component\nwith high ionization. Instead, the models tentatively suggest that the\nionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changing\nwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.\nUsing the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e <2.0E7 cm-3 for the\nelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocity\ncomponent. This implies a large distance from the continuum source (R > 0.033\npc). If the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e\n>9.8E4 cm-3 and R < 3 pc. We discuss our results in terms of two different\nscenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of the\naccretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out. Given\nthe large distance of the wind, the implied mass outflow rate is also large (Mw\n> 0.08 Maccr). The associated total kinetic energy deployed by the wind in the\nhost galaxy (>1.2E56 erg) can be enough to disrupt the interstellar medium,\npossibly regulating large scale star formation. The total mass and energy\nejected by the wind is still lower than the one required for cosmic feedback,\neven when extrapolated to quasar luminosities. Such feedback would require that\nwe are observing the wind before it is fully accelerated. \n\n"}

The XMM-Newton spectrum of\nthe source can be modelled by at least three components, multicoloured disc\nemission, thermal emission from the NS surface and thermal Comptonization\nemission. Spectral fit of the XMM-Newton data and of the RXTE data, taken in a\nsimultaneous temporal window, constrain the Comptonization parameters: the\nelectron temperature, kT_e=51(+6,-4) keV, is rather high, while the optical\ndepth (tau=1.34(+0.03,-0.06)) is moderate. The energy dependence of the pulsed\nfraction supports the interpretation of the cooler thermal component as coming\nfrom the accretion disc, and indicates that the Comptonizing plasma surrounds\nthe hot spots on the NS surface, which provide the seed photons. Signatures of\nreflection, such as a broadened iron K-alpha emission line and a Compton hump\nat 30 keV ca., are also detected.

That is why both phenomena should be\ntaken into account at once, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since,\nunder the above transition, the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum (filled up with\ngluon- and chiral $q\\bar q$-condensates) turns into the \"empty\" (perturbation)\nsubhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, the formerly (very high) pressure falls\ndown rather abruptly, the formerly cold nuclear medium starts imploding almost\nfreely into the new vacuum. If the star mass is sufficiently large, then this\nimplosion is shown to result in an enormous heating - up to the temperature\nabout 100 MeV or, may be, even higher - and growth of the inner pressure due to\ndegeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair production which withstands the\ngravitational compression (remind that the highest temperatures of supernovae\nbursts, as well as of the \"normal\" NS, are, at least, of one order lower).

During the subsequent evolution, the accretion disk, which\nis truncated at the tidal radius because of the tidal torque, also shrinks as\nthe orbital decay. Assuming that the disk mass changed by this process is all\naccreted, the disk becomes radiatively inefficient when the semi-major axis is\nseveral hundred Schwarzschild radii. The high-energy radiations, in spite of a\nlow bolometric luminosity, are emitted from an accretion disk around each black\nhole long before the black hole coalescence as well as the gravitational wave\nsignals. The synchrotron process can notably produce potentially observable\nradio emissions at large distances if there is a strong, dipole magnetic field\naround each black hole. In unequal mass-ratio binaries, step-like light\nvariations are seen in the observed light curve because the luminosity is\nhigher and its duration time are shorter in the radio emission by the disk\naround the secondary black hole than those of the primary black hole.

We have built a mixed\ndwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarf\ngalaxies (Draco, Ursa Minor, Wilman 1 and Segue 1) and local galaxy clusters\n(Perseus, Coma, Ophiuchus, Virgo, Fornax, NGC5813 and NGC5846), and then\ncompute their DM annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latest\nmodeling of their DM density profiles. We also include in our calculations the\neffect of DM substructure. Willman 1 appears as the best candidate in the\nsample. However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other\ncandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor\nand Segue 1, might be better options. As for galaxy clusters, Virgo represents\nthe one with the highest flux. However, its large spatial extension can be a\nserious handicap for IACT observations and posterior data analysis. Yet, other\nlocal galaxy cluster candidates with more moderate emission regions, such as\nPerseus, may represent good alternatives.

Assuming cold dark\nmatter with a substructure mass distribution down to an Earth mass and using\nextended Fermi upper limits, we rule out the leptophilic models in their\npresent form in 28 clusters, and limit the boost from SFE in M49 and Fornax to\nbe < 5.

In this {\\it Letter}, we\npresent the results of an analysis of a RXTE observation of a Z source GX~5-1,\nwhere the 6 Hz NBO is simultaneously detected along with a HBO at 51 Hz. The\nvariations in the intensity and the associated power density spectrum indicate\nthat the HBO and NBO are strongly coupled, originating from the same location\nin the inner accretion disk. The absence of HBO and NBO in the lower energy\nbands, an increase in the rms amplitude with energy and a smooth transition\namong them suggest that they are produced in the hot inner regions of the\naccretion disk.

Indirect detection\nmay provide a powerful test for some strongly motivated DM particle models.\nNevertheless, astrophysical backgrounds are usually expected with amplitudes\nand spectral features similar to the chased signals. On galactic scales, these\nbackgrounds arise from interactions of cosmic rays (CRs) with the interstellar\ngas, both being difficult to infer and model in detail from observations.\nMoreover, the associated predictions unavoidably come with theoretical errors,\nwhich are known to be significant.

We present MHD simulations of cold front formation in the core\nof a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameter\nspace of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines.\nIncluding conduction has a strong effect on the temperature of the core and the\ncold fronts. Though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the front\nsurfaces, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. The\nfield geometry is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can be\nconnected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directions\nperpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of the\nfront which are not perfectly draped. This results in the heating of this gas\nbelow the front on a timescale of a Gyr, but the sharpness of the density and\ntemperature jumps may still be preserved. By modifying the density distribution\nbelow the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. If conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we find\nthat the characteristic sharp jumps in X-ray emission seen in observations of\nclusters do not form. This suggests that the presence of sharp cold fronts in\nhot clusters could be used to place upper limits on conduction in the {\\it\nbulk} of the ICM.

Under the canonical assumption that\nthe spectrum of CRs is a power-law in momentum and that the spectrum of\nsecondaries is stationary, we find that the combination of the steep spectrum\nof CRs necessary to explain the spectrum of the halo and their very broad\nspatial distribution (and large energy density) result in a gamma-ray emission\nin excess of present limits, unless the cluster magnetic field is sufficiently\nlarge.

For high but\nsub-critical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted onto the black\nhole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical\n$t^{-5/3}$ mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit\nand its pericenter distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there\ncan be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic\nprecession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid\ncircularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disk. The\nresultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs\nstrongly from the canonical rate of $t^{-5/3}$. By contrast, there is little\ndissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent simulation with a\npurely Newtonian potential.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks.

As\nthis contribution will appear anisotropic in the sky, one can use the angular\npower spectrum of anisotropies in DGRB to constrain properties of dark matter\nparticles.

A stochastic\nbackground of GWs from the incoherent superposition of many inspiraling\nsupermassive black hole binaries at nHz frequencies is likely to be the\ndominant GW signal detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic\nbackground this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as\nthe Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of\nthe pulsars. If the background is anisotropic, the cross-correlation is\ndifferent, but predictable, and also depends on the absolute position of the\npulsars. By simulating datasets containing GWBs with various anisotropic\nconfigurations, we have explored the prospects for constraining anisotropy\nusing near future data. We find that at moderate to high signal to noise ratio\nthe assumption of isotropy is no longer an appropriate description of the\nsimulated background. Furthermore, we can recover the nature of the injected\nanisotropy in a Bayesian parameter-estimation search, and propose a prior on\nthe anisotropy search-space motivated by the physicality of the implied\ndistribution of sources. \n\n"}

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\\gamma}$ depend weakly on the\nassumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current\nexperimental bounds on these quantities. We apply this method and ALP\nparameters found from fitting 3C454.3 data to another flat-spectrum radio\nquasar PKS1222+216 (4C+21.35) data up to 400 GeV, as a consistency check, and\nfound good fit.

The source exhibits remarkable spectral\nvariability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability\nis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber\ntowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. The column density is generally\nCompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times\n10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate\nthe outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs\nusing two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an\ninstantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of\nthe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta\n\\propto \\dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd.

Our model is based on the stable clustering\nhypothesis in phase space, the spherical collapse model, and tidal disruption\nof substructures, which is calibrated against the Aquarius simulations. Using\nthis model, we can predict the behaviour of $P^2SAD$ in the numerically\nunresolved regime, down to the decoupling mass limit of generic WIMP models.\nThis prediction can be used to estimate signals sensitive to the small scale\nstructure of dark matter. For example, the dark matter annihilation rate can be\nestimated for arbitrary velocity-dependent cross sections in a convenient way\nusing a limit of $P^2SAD$ to zero separation in physical space.

Such\nrelation can be expressed in terms of a single key parameter, namely the halo\nconcentration.

We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to\nreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For\nthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its\nspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations\nfrom the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength\ndata in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far.

Using a long-simulation box we have followed the\nmagnetic-field amplification until it is fully developed and saturated. The\nturbulent velocity is sub-relativistic even for a strong shock. Magnetic-field\namplification is controled by the turbulent motion and saturation occurs when\nthe magnetic energy is comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy.\nMagnetic-field amplification and saturation depend on the initial strength and\ndirection of the magnetic field in the preshock medium, and on the shock\nstrength. If the initial magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock normal,\nthe magnetic field is first compressed at the shock and then can be amplified\nby turbulent motion in the postshock region. Saturation occurs when the\nmagnetic energy becomes comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy in the\npostshock region.

Most of the\nblack hole growth since z~1 is associated with star-forming hosts.\nNevertheless, ~15-20% of the X-ray luminosity density since z~1, is taking\nplace in the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram. For the z~0.40 subsample,\nthere is tentative evidence (2sigma significance), that AGN split by their UVJ\ncolours differ in Eddington ratio.

If a QSO\nhosts a sub-parsec BBH in its center, it is expected that the BBH is surrounded\nby a circum-binary disk, each component of the BBH is surrounded by a small\naccretion disk, and a gap is opened by the secondary component in between the\ncircum-binary disk and the two small disks. Assuming such a BBH structure, we\ngenerate mock microlensing light curves for some QSO systems that host BBHs\nwith typical physical parameters. We show that microlensing light curves of a\nBBH QSO system at the infrared-optical-UV bands can be significantly different\nfrom those of corresponding QSO system with a single massive black hole (MBH),\nmainly because of the existence of the gap and the rotation of the BBH (and its\nassociated small disks) around the center of mass.

The gamma-ray emissivity spectra confirm that\nthe GeV-TeV cosmic rays uniformly permeate all gas phases up to the CO cores.\nThe dust and cosmic rays reveal large amounts of DNM gas, with comparable\nspatial distributions and twice as much mass as in the CO-bright clouds. We\ngive constraints on the HI-DNM-CO transitions and CO-dark $H_2$ fractions for\nseparate clouds. The corrected extinction provides the best fit to the total\ngas traced by the gamma rays, but we find evidence for a rise in $A_{VQ}/N_H$\nand a steep rise in opacity, with increasing $N_H$ and $H_2$ fraction, and with\ndecreasing dust temperature. We observe less variations for the specific power\nof the grains, except for a decline by half in the CO cores. This combined\ninformation suggests grain evolution.

We report\non a survey for X-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2)\nclusters of galaxies selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the\nSouth Pole Telescope data. Based on Chandra X-ray images, we find a total of 6\nclusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistent\nwith the picture of radio jets inflating X-ray cavities in the intracluster\nmedium. The majority of these detections are of relatively low significance and\nrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. Further, due to the\nlimitations of Chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (<10 kpc),\nunresolved X-ray cavities at high (z>0.5) redshift. Despite these limitations,\nour results suggest that the power generated by AGN feedback in brightest\ncluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of the\nUniverse (>7 Gyrs at z=0.8). On average, the detected X-ray cavities have\npowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.\nIntegrating over 7 Gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in the\nbrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9M_sun of\nmaterial to power these outflows. This level of accretion indicates that\nsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,\nin the quasar era, but at late times as well. We also find that X-ray cavities\nat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 keV per particle into the\nhot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.\nThis value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, break\nself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres. \n\n"}

Assuming a fixed Doppler factor\n$\\delta=30$, two principal parameter regimes are identified, where the\nhigh-energy emission is due to: 1) proton-synchrotron radiation, with magnetic\nfields $B \\sim 1-100\\ \\textrm{G}$ and maximum proton energies $E_{p;max}\n\\lesssim 10^{19}$ eV; and 2) synchrotron emission from p-$\\gamma$-induced\ncascades as well as SSC emission from primary leptons, with $B \\sim 0.1-1\\\n\\textrm{G}$ and $E_{p;max} \\lesssim 10^{17}$ eV. This can be realized with\nplausible, sub-Eddington values for the total (kinetic plus magnetic) power of\nthe emitting plasma, in contrast to hadronic interpretations for other blazar\nclasses that often warrant highly super-Eddington values. \n\n"}

Red timing noise - the stochastic wandering of\npulse arrival times with a red spectrum - is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars\nand has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by\ncalculating minimum observation times, $T_{\\rm min}(f_c)$, over which the\ngravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau. We do\nthis in two ways: 1) in a model-independent manner, and 2) by using the\nsuperfluid turbulence model for timing noise as an example to illustrate how\nneutron star parameters can be constrained. We show that the superfluid\nturbulence model can reproduce the data qualitatively from a number of pulsars\nobserved as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array.

Indeed,\nthe activation energy for such a process can be very small (essentially zero\ncompared with the observed increase in the pulsar's rotational kinetic energy\nat the onset of a glitch).

This missing\ngalactic feedback problem is extremely prominent in early-type galaxy bulges\nwhere there is little cool gas to make the SNe ejecta radiate at lower\ntemperature beyond the X-ray domain. We herein present a deep Suzaku\nobservation of an S0 galaxy NGC5866, which is relatively rich in molecular gas\nas an S0 galaxy and shows significant evidence of cool-hot gas interaction. By\njointly analyzing the Suzaku and an archival Chandra data, we measure the Fe/O\nabundance ratio to be $7.63_{-5.52}^{+7.28}$ relative to solar values. This\nabundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among\nthe highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies. NGC5866 also simultaneously has\nthe highest Fe/O abundance ratio and molecular gas mass among a small sample of\ngas-poor early-type galaxies. An estimation of the Fe budget indicates that\nNGC5866 could preserve a larger than usual fraction, but far from the total\namount of Fe injected by Type Ia SNe. We also find that the hot gas temperature\nincreases from inner to outer halos, with the inner halo has a temperature of\n~0.25keV, clearly lower than that expected from Type Ia SNe heating. This low\ntemperature could be most naturally explained by additional cooling processes\nrelated to the cool-hot gas interaction as being indicated by the existence of\nmany extraplanar dusty filaments. Our results indicate that the large cool gas\ncontent and the presence of cool-hot gas interaction in the inner region of\nNGC5866 have significantly reduced the specific energy of the SN ejecta and so\nthe velocity of galactic outflow.

In this paper, we report an\nunambiguous empirical correlation between the properties of the plasma close to\nthe black hole and the particle acceleration properties within jets launched\nfrom the central regions of accreting stellar-mass and supermassive black\nholes. In these sources the emission of the plasma near the black hole is\ncharacterized by a power law at X-ray energies during times when the jets are\nproduced.

We use this as compelling evidence that additional sources of heating\nmust be present to power an LGRB-SN, which we argue must be radioactive\nheating. Our self-consistent modelling approach was able to successfully\ndescribe all phases of ULGRB 111209A / SN 2011kl, from the early afterglow to\nthe later SN, where we determined for the magnetar central engine a magnetic\nfield strength of $1.1-1.3\\times10^{15}$ G, an initial spin period of\n$11.5-13.0$ ms, a spin-down time of $4.8-6.5$ d, and an initial energy of\n$1.2-1.6\\times10^{50}$ erg. These values are entirely consistent with those\ndetermined by other authors. The luminosity of a magnetar-powered SN is\ndirectly related to how long the central engine is active, where central\nengines with longer durations give rise to brighter SNe. The spin-down\ntimescales of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are of order months to years,\nwhich provides a natural explanation as to why SN 2011kl was less luminous than\nSLSNe that are also powered by emission from magnetar central engines. \n\n"}

The applications of astrophysical interest considered here\ncorrespond essentially to the following geometries: the Schwarzschild spacetime\nand the spacetime around a rotating spherical mass in the weak field and slow\nrotation regime.

We assume that a large number of PeV CRs were injected by Sgr A* at\nthe outburst about 10^7 yr ago when the Fermi bubbles were created. We\nconstrain the diffusion coefficient for the CRs in the Galactic halo on the\ncondition that the CRs have arrived on the Earth by now, while a fairly large\nfraction of them have escaped from the halo.

The observed\nhigh-energy electromagnetic radiation (above 50 keV) originated from a weak\ntransient source and lasted for about 1 second. Its localization is consistent\nwith the direction to GW150914. We speculate about the possible scenario for\nthe formation of a gamma-ray burst accompanied by the gravitational-wave\nsignal. Our model invokes a tight binary system consisting of a massive star\nand a black hole which leads to the triggering of a collapse of the star's\nnucleus, the formation of a second black hole, and finally to the binary black\nhole merger. For the most-likely configuration of the binary spin vectors with\nrespect to the orbital angular momentum in the GW150914 event, the recoil speed\n(kick velocity) acquired by the final black hole through gravitational wave\nemission is of the order of a few hundred km/s and this might be sufficient to\nget it closer to the envelope of surrounding material and capture a small\nfraction of matter from the remnant of the host star. The gamma-ray burst is\nproduced by the accretion of this remnant matter onto the final black hole. The\nmoderate spin of the final black hole suggests that the gamma-ray burst jet is\npowered by weak neutrino emission rather than the Blandford-Znajek mechanism,\nand hence explains the low power available for the observed GRB signal. \n\n"}

We argue\nthat $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio can still be explained by the DSA if positrons are\naccelerated in a \\emph{subset} of SNR shocks which: (i) propagate in clumpy gas\nmedia, and (ii) are modified by accelerated CR \\emph{protons}. The protons\npenetrate into the dense gas clumps upstream to produce positrons and,\n\\emph{charge the clumps positively}. The induced electric field expels\npositrons into the upstream plasma where they are shock-accelerated. Since the\nshock is modified, these positrons develop a harder spectrum than that of the\nCR electrons accelerated in other SNRs. Mixing these populations explains the\nincrease in the $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio at $E>8$ GeV. It decreases at $E<8$ GeV\nbecause of a subshock weakening which also results from the shock modification.\nContrary to the expelled positrons, most of the antiprotons, electrons, and\nheavier nuclei, are left unaccelerated inside the clumps. Scenarios for the\n100-300 GeV AMS-02 fraction exceeding the model prediction, including, but not\nlimited to, possible dark matter contribution, are also discussed. \n\n"}

The amount of heavy r-process material is consistent with the\nmass ejection and rates of mergers, and abundances of relic radioactive\nmaterials suggest that heavy r-process material is produced in rare events.\nObservations of possible macronovae provide further support for this model.\nStill, some concerns remain. One is the observation of heavy r-process elements\nin Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The escape velocities from UFDs are so\nsmall that the natal kicks, taking place at neutron stars birth, might eject\nsuch binaries from UFDs. Furthermore the old stellar populations of UFDs\nrequires that r-process nucleosynthesis must have taken place very early on,\nwhile it may take several Gyr for compact binaries to merge. This last problem\narises also within the Milky Way where heavy r-process materials has been\nobserved in some low metallicity stars.

Adopting event rates from the literature, we aim\nto establish general trends in the redshift evolution of the TDE number counts\nand their observable signals. We pay particular attention to two types of TDEs\nwhich are expected to be observable out to high redshifts, namely (i) jetted\nTDEs whose luminosity is boosted by relativistic beaming, and (ii) TDEs around\nbinary black holes. We show that the brightest (jetted) TDEs are expected to be\nproduced by massive black hole binaries if the occupancy of intermediate mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) in low mass galaxies is high. The same binary population\nwill also provide gravitational wave sources for eLISA. In addition, we find\nthat the shape of the X-ray luminosity function of TDEs strongly depends on the\noccupancy of IMBHs and could be used to constrain scenarios of SMBH formation.\nFinally, we make predictions for the expected number of TDEs observed by future\nX-ray telescopes as a function of their sensitivity limits.

Since the rates\nof reabsorption processes decrease as the dark-photon energy increases, we\npoint out that dark photons with energies above the Wien peak can escape\nwithout scattering, contributing more to energy loss than is possible assuming\na blackbody spectrum.

Then, we investigate if these scalarization windows could\nbe closed and if pulsar-timing constraints could be improved by\nlaser-interferometer GW detectors, when spontaneous (or dynamical)\nscalarization sets in during the early (or late) stages of a binary NS (BNS)\nevolution.

In addition to providing collimating media for gamma-ray\nburst jets, unbound outflows from these disks are an important source of mass\nejection and rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis.

The energy of the gamma rays is sufficiently high to\npotentially invoke atmospheric photonuclear reactions 14N(gamma, n)13N, which\nwould produce neutrons and eventually positrons via beta-plus decay of\ngenerated unstable radioactive isotopes, especially 13N. However, no clear\nobservational evidence for the reaction has been reported to date. Here we\nreport the first detection of neutron and positron signals from lightning with\na ground observation. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a\nTGF-like intense flash (within 1 ms) was detected at our monitoring sites\n0.5-1.7 km away from the lightning. The subsequent initial burst quickly\nsubsided with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 ms, followed by a\nprolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolt (MeV), lasting for a\nminute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 MeV of the\ninitial emission are well explained with de-excitation gamma rays from the\nnuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line\nemission corresponds to the electron-positron annihilation, and hence is the\nconclusive indication of positrons produced after the lightning. Our detection\nof neutrons and positrons is unequivocal evidence that natural lightning\ntriggers photonuclear reactions. No other natural event on the Earth is known\nto trigger photonuclear reactions. This discovery places lightning as only the\nsecond known natural channel on the Earth after the atmospheric cosmic-ray\ninteraction, in which isotopes, such as 13C, 14C, and 15N, are produced. \n\n"}

Mass flow through the accretion\nstreams linking the circumbinary disk to the mini-disks is modulated\nquasi-periodically by the streams' interaction with a nonlinear $m=1$ density\nfeature, or \"lump\", at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk: the stream\nsupplying each mini-disk comes into phase with the lump at a frequency $0.74$\ntimes the binary orbital frequency. Because the binary is relativistic, the\ntidal truncation radii of the mini-disks are not much larger than their\ninnermost stable circular orbits; consequently, the mini-disks' inflow times\nare shorter than the conventional estimate and are comparable to the stream\nmodulation period.

The approaching stars from the star cluster to the\nblack hole can take three types of orbit: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic\norbits. Since the mass fallback rate shows a different variability depending on\nthese orbital types, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three\nmain categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs. Respective TDEs are\ncharacterized by two critical values of the orbital eccentricity: the lower\ncritical eccentricity is the one below which the stars on eccentric orbits\ncause the finite, intense accretion, and the higher critical eccentricity above\nwhich the stars on hyperbolic orbits cause no accretion. Moreover, we find that\nthe parabolic TDEs are divided into three subclasses: precisely parabolic,\nmarginally eccentric, and marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We analytically derive\nthat the mass fallback rate of the marginally eccentric TDEs can be flatter and\nslightly higher than the standard fallback rate proportional to $t^{-5/3}$,\nwhereas it can be flatter and lower for the marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We\nconfirm by N-body experiments that only few eccentric, precisely parabolic, and\nhyperbolic TDEs can occur in a spherical stellar system with a single\nintermediate-mass to supermassive black hole.

By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe\nfeedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the\nevolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback\nmodels are updated based on \\citet{Yuan2018}. The gas sources comes exclusively\nfrom the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find\nthat SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low\nmass elliptical galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass\ngalaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus\nregulate the star formation activities. Such a suppression of star formation is\nextremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. AGB heating cannot\naccount for this suppression for low and high mass galaxies. The X-ray\ntemperature $T_{\\rm X}$ and luminosity $L_{\\rm X}$ of hot plasma can be in\nagreement with the observed data with the inclusion of effective feedback\nprocesses.

The possibility of a significant inefficiency leaves open a\nconsiderable `hole' in the limits for mass in the $\\sim$ 0.2 -- 2 GeV range,\nwhich XQC and CRESST can potentially fill when the thermalization efficiency is\nmeasured. We call attention to the asymmetry between a conventional lower limit\ncross section and the `upper-reach cross section' imposed by attenuation in an\noverburden -- an upper boundary being extremely sharp but quite insensitive to\nthe statistics of the experiment. Considering the recent interest to use dark\nmatter-baryon interaction with velocity dependence $n=-4$ to explain the EDGES\n21 cm anomaly, we also derive the limits on milli-charged DM that scatters off\nprotons and electrons under a Coulomb-like interaction.

The system consists of fluid ions\nand electrons as well as arbitrary numbers of species whose dynamics is\ngoverned by the Vlasov equation. The proposed model is thus a generalized\nversion of the well-known standard hybrid plasma simulation model, in which the\nions are fully kinetic whereas the electrons are assumed to be a fluid. Since\nthe proposed model employs the exact form of the generalized Ohm's law, the\nmass and energy densities, as well as the charge-to-mass ratio of the kinetic\nspecies, are taken to be arbitrary. In the absence of the kinetic species, it\nreduces to the quasi-neutral two-fluid model (Amano, 2015, JCP). In the\nopposite situation where the mass and energy densities of the kinetic species\nare much larger than the fluid ions, it is nothing more than the standard\nhybrid model with finite electron inertia effect. If the kinetic species is an\nenergetic particle (EP) population having negligible mass density but\nsubstantial energy density and the scale size is much larger than the ion and\nelectron inertial lengths, it describes the self-consistent coupling between\nthe magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the EP dynamics. The\nenergetic-particle-magnetohydrodynamics (EP-MHD) hybrid model is thus a special\ncase of the more general model described in this paper. Advantages of this\napproach over the existing models are discussed. A three-dimensional simulation\ncode solving the proposed set of equations is described. The code combines the\nParticle-in-Cell scheme for solving the kinetic species and a\nRiemann-solver-based code for the two-fluid equations. Several benchmark\nsimulation results are shown to confirm that the code successfully captures the\ndynamics of the EP population interacting self-consistently with the MHD fluid. \n\n"}

Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries may be detectable by an upcoming suite of\ngravitational wave experiments. Their binary nature can also be revealed by\nradio jets via a short-period precession driven by the orbital motion as well\nas the geodetic precession at typically longer periods. We have investigated\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and MERLIN radio maps of powerful jet\nsources for morphological evidence of geodetic precession. For perhaps the best\nstudied source, Cygnus A, we find strong evidence for geodetic precession.\nProjection effects can enhance precession features, for which we find\nindications in strongly projected sources. For a complete sample of 33 3CR\nradio sources we find strong evidence for jet precession in 24 cases (73 per\ncent). The morphology of the radio maps suggests that the precession periods\nare of the order of 10^6 - 10^7 yr. We consider different explanations for the\nmorphological features and conclude that geodetic precession is the best\nexplanation. The frequently observed gradual jet angle changes in samples of\npowerful blazars can be explained by orbital motion. Both observations can be\nexplained simultaneously by postulating that a high fraction of powerful radio\nsources have sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries. We consider\ncomplementary evidence and discuss if any jetted supermassive black hole with\nsome indication of precession could be detected as individual gravitational\nwave source in the near future.

This is puzzling, because (i) no\nStandard Model (SM) particle is expected to survive passage through Earth at\nsuch energies and incident angles, and (ii) no such events were reported by\nIceCube. In this paper, we address both these issues by invoking a beyond SM\ninterpretation of the EeV events as due to the decay of a long-lived bino in\nthe R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry. In particular, a TeV-scale\nslepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV\nneutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,\nlong-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before\ndecaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air\nshowers in the atmosphere near ANITA. We find that the ANITA events can be\nexplained with a GeV-scale bino and ${\\cal O}(0.1)$ RPV couplings, which are\nconsistent with all existing high and low-energy constraints. We also find that\nan isotropic neutrino flux is inadequate for a beyond the SM explanation of\nthis kind, and an anisotropic flux must be invoked.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

During the low-flux state, Mrk 335 demonstrates a\nreflection-dominated spectrum that results from a compact corona around a Kerr\nblack hole. In addition to the rapid brightening, the flare is further\ndescribed by spectral softening and a falling reflection fraction that are\nconsistent with previous observations advocating at least part of the corona in\nMrk 335 could be the base of an aborted jet.

We derive expressions for\nthe relative flux from such events in simple halos with various density\nprofiles, and use these to calculate the relative flux produced within a large\nvolume as a function of redshift. This flux peaks when the first halos\ncollapse, but then declines as small halos merge into larger systems of lower\ndensity. Simulations show that halos contain a substantial amount of dense\nsubstructure, left over from the incomplete disruption of smaller halos as they\nmerge together. We calculate the contribution to the flux due to this\nsubstructure, and show that it can increase the annihilation signal\nsubstantially. Overall, the present-day flux from annihilation events may be an\norder of magnitude larger than predicted by previous calculations. We discuss\nthe implications of these results for current and future gamma-ray experiments. \n\n"}

High energy electrons lose energy\nvia synchrotron and inverse Compton processes during propagation in the Galaxy.\nDue to these radiative losses, TeV electrons liberated from SNRs at distances\nlarger than ~1 kpc, or times older than ~10^5 yr, cannot reach the solar\nsystem.

Our analysis confirms the proposal of Navarro, Frenk & White\n(NFW) that the shape of LambdaCDM halo mass profiles differs strongly from a\npower law and depends little on mass. The logarithmic slope of the\nspherically-averaged density profile, as measured by beta=-dln(rho)/dln(r),\ndecreases monotonically towards the center and becomes shallower than\nisothermal (beta<2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}. Although the\nfitting formula proposed by NFW provides a reasonably good approximation to the\ndensity and circular velocity profiles of individual halos, systematic\ndeviations from the best NFW fits are also noticeable. Inside r_{-2}, the\nprofile of simulated halos gets shallower with radius more gradually than\npredicted and, as a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the dark matter\ndensity in these regions. This discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating a\nsteeply divergent cusp, but our results suggest a different interpretation. We\nuse the density and enclosed mass at our innermost resolved radii to place\nstrong constraints on beta_{0}: density cusps as steep as r^{-1.5} are\ninconsistent with most of our simulations, although beta_{0}=1 is still\nconsistent with our data. Our density profiles show no sign of converging to a\nwell-defined asymptotic inner power law.

The logarithmic density\nslopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the LCDM halos are found to vary as\npower-laws in radius, reaching values of gamma ~ -1 at the innermost resolved\nradii (~0.01 r_virial). This behavior is significantly different from that of\nbroken power-law models like the NFW profile, but similar to that of models\nlike de Vaucouleurs'.
