The space-dependent inflaton potential generates a classical\ncurvature perturbation mode characterized by the wavenumber of the step\ninhomogeneity. For inhomogeneities small compared with the horizon at the step,\nspace-dependence has a small effect on the curvature perturbation. Therefore\nthe smoothly oscillating quantum power spectrum predicted by the homogeneous\nstep is robust with respect to sub-horizon space-dependence. For\ninhomogeneities equal to or greater than the horizon at the step, the\nspace-dependent classical mode can dominate, producing a curvature perturbation\nin which modes of wavenumber determined by the step inhomogeneity are\nsuperimposed on the oscillating power spectrum.

This leads to\norder one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan\nframe, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if\nthe scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld\nmodel, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level.

It was\nfirst observed in computer simulations of the causal dynamical triangulation\n(CDT) approach to quantum gravity and refers to the reduction of the spectral\ndimension from 4 at classical scales to 2 at short distances. Thereafter\nseveral authors confirmed a similar result from different approaches to quantum\ngravity. Despite the contribution from different approaches, no analytical\nmodel was proposed to explain the numerical results as the continuum limit of\nCDT. In this thesis we introduce graph ensembles as toy models of CDT and show\nthat both the continuum limit and a scale dependent spectral dimension can be\ndefined rigorously. First we focus on a simple graph ensemble, the random comb.\nIt does not have any dynamics from the gravity point of view, but serves as an\ninstructive toy model to introduce the characteristic scale of the graph, study\nthe continuum limit and define the scale dependent spectral dimension. Having\ndefined the continuum limit, we study the reduction of the spectral dimension\non more realistic toy models, the multigraph ensembles, which serve as a radial\napproximation of CDT.

To\ndate, the structure of dense hydrogen remains experimentally elusive. Recent\nstudies of the melting curve of hydrogen indicate that at high (but\nexperimentally accessible) pressures, compressed hydrogen will adopt a liquid\nstate, even at low temperatures. In reaching this phase, hydrogen is also\nprojected to pass through an insulator-to-metal transition.

(ii) One desires to test out\nalternatives to Einstein's gravitational theory, in particular those of a\ngauge-theoretical nature, like Einstein-Cartan theory or metric-affine gravity.\nA clean discussion requires a reflection on the foundations of electrodynamics.\nIf one bases electrodynamics on the conservation laws of electric charge and\nmagnetic flux, one finds Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of the\nexcitation H=(D,H) and the field strength F=(E,B) without any intervention of\nthe metric or the linear connection of spacetime.

The\nquestion of whether or not the resulting corrections to the Einstein equations\nare significant, is still a subject of debate, partly due to possible\nambiguities in the averaging schemes available. In particular, it has been\nargued in the literature that the effects of averaging could be gauge\nartifacts. We apply the formalism of Zalaletdinov's Macroscopic Gravity (MG)\nwhich is a fully covariant and nonperturbative averaging scheme, in an attempt\nto construct gauge independent corrections to the standard\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations.

The real part of the\nquasinormal frequencies of Kerr black hole used for this computation is of the\nform $m\\Omega$ where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the black hole\nhorizon.

In such a case, in the context of string\ntheory, the FI terms originate from the derivative of the Kaehler potential and\nthey are inevitably field-dependent.

For sub-critical tensions, the crossover scale, below which\ngravity may look 4D, and the effective 4D gravitational coupling are sensitive\nto vacuum energy. This shows how the vacuum energy problem manifests in brane\ninduced gravity: instead of tuning the 4D curvature, generically one must tune\nthe crossover scale.

We find that\nto describe the flow data of the FOPI Collaboration the strength of the vector\npotential has to be reduced at high relative momentum or at high density such\nthat the Schr\\\"odinger- equivalent potential at normal nuclear density\ndecreases above 1 GeV relative kinetic energy and approaches zero above 2 GeV. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0612032", "contents": "Title: A New Look at the Quantum Mechanics of the Harmonic Oscillator Abstract: Classically the Harmonic Oscillator (HO) is the generic example for the use\nof angle and action variables phi in R mod 2 pi and I > 0. But the symplectic\ntransformation (\\phi,I) to (q,p) is singular for (q,p) = (0,0). Globally\n{(q,p)} has the structure of the plane R^2, but {(phi,I)} that of the punctured\nplane R^2 -(0,0). This implies qualitative differences for the QM of the two\nphase spaces: The quantizing group for the plane R^2 consists of the (centrally\nextended) translations generated by {q,p,1}, but the corresponding group for\n{(phi,I)} is SO(1,2) = Sp(2,R)/Z_2, (Sp(2,R): symplectic group of the plane),\nwith Lie algebra basis {h_0 = I, h_1 = I cos phi, h_2 = - I sin phi}. In the QM\nfor the (phi,I)-model the three h_j correspond to self-adjoint generators K_j,\nj=0,1,2, of irreducible unitary representations (positive discrete series) for\nSO(1,2) or one of its infinitely many covering groups, the Bargmann index k > 0\nof which determines the ground state energy E (k, n=0) = hbar omega k of the\n(phi,I)-Hamiltonian H(K). For an m-fold covering the lowest possible value is\nk=1/m, which can be made arbitrarily small! The operators Q and P, now\nexpressed as functions of the K_j, keep their usual properties, but the richer\nstructure of the K_j quantum model of the HO is ``erased'' when passing to the\nsimpler Q,P model! The (phi,I)-variant of the HO implies many experimental\ntests: Mulliken-type experiments for isotopic diatomic molecules, experiments\nwith harmonic traps for atoms, ions and BE-condensates, with the (Landau)\nlevels of charged particles in magnetic fields, with the propagation of light\nin vacuum, passing through electric or magnetic fields. Finally it leads to a\nnew theoretical estimate for the quantum vacuum energy of fields and its\nrelation to the cosmological constant. \n\n"}
