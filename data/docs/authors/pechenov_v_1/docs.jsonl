It is unexpected in the sense that a\nnuclear modification slope is too large to be expected from its average nuclear\ndensity. We investigated whether it is explained by a nuclear clustering\nconfiguration in Be-9 with two \\alpha nuclei and surrounding neutron clouds.\nSuch clustering aspects are studied by using antisymmetrized molecular dynamics\n(AMD) and also by a simple shell model for comparison. We consider that nuclear\nstructure functions F_2^A consist of a mean conventional part and a remaining\none depending on the maximum local density. The first mean part does not show a\nsignificant cluster effect on F_2. However, we propose that the remaining one\ncould explain the anonymous JLab slope, and it is associated with high\ndensities created by the cluster formation in Be-9. The JLab measurement is\npossibly the first signature of clustering effects in high-energy nuclear\nreactions.

We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe. Its nature is unknown but the\nconfirmation of a scalar Higgs is giving a boost to scalar-field-theories. So\nfar gravity experiments and observations performed at different distances find\nno deviation from Newton's gravity law. Therefore dark energy must possess a\nscreening mechanism which suppresses the scalar-mediated fifth force. Our line\nof attack is a novel gravity experiment with neutrons based on a quantum\ninterference technique. The spectroscopic measurement of quantum states on\nresonances with an external coupling makes this a powerful search for dark\nmatter and dark energy contributions in the universe. Quantum states in the\ngravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons\nif they exist.

The ATLAS detector measures photons with its\nhermetic, longitudinally segmented calorimeter, which gives excellent spatial\nand energy resolutions, and detailed information about the shower shape of each\nmeasured photon.

For the analysis we employ three different transport models - the\nmicroscopic off-shell Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach, the\nIsospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) approach as well as the\nUltra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) approach. We confirm the\nexperimentally observed enhancement of the dilepton yield (normalized to the\nmultiplicity of neutral pions $N_{\\pi^0}$) in heavy-ion collisions with respect\nto that measured in $NN = (pp+pn)/2$ collisions. We identify two contributions\nto this enhancement: a) the $pN$ bremsstrahlung which scales with the number of\ncollisions and not with the number of participants, i.e. pions; b) the dilepton\nemission from intermediate $\\Delta$'s which are part of the reaction cycles\n$\\Delta \\to \\pi N ; \\pi N \\to \\Delta$ and $NN\\to N\\Delta; N\\Delta \\to NN$. With\nincreasing system size more generations of intermediate $\\Delta$'s are created.\nIf such $\\Delta$ decays into a pion, the pion can be reabsorbed, however, if it\ndecays into a dilepton, the dilepton escapes from the system. Thus,\nexperimentally one observes only one pion (from the last produced $\\Delta$)\nwhereas the dilepton yield accumulates the contributions from all $\\Delta$'s of\nthe cycle. We show as well that the Fermi motion enhances the production of\npions and dileptons in the same way.

General forms of TMD-factorization fail\nfor such processes because of a previously noted incompatibility between the\nrequirements for TMD-factorization and the Ward identities of non-Abelian gauge\ntheories.

Momentum degradation of the hard and semihard partons as they traverse\nthe inhomogeneous medium at various azimuthal angles results in a complicated\nconvolution of geometrical, nuclear and dynamical factors that cannot usually\nbe described in a transparent way. In this work a compact formula is found that\nrepresents the inclusive distributions of minijets of any parton type at the\nsurface of the medium for any collision centrality. They take into account the\ncontributions from all initiating partons created at any point in the medium.\nBy comparing with the case of no energy loss, a ratio has been determined that\nis analogous to the nuclear modification factor for minijets. Phenomenological\nreality of such distributions is examined by calculating the hadronization of\nthe minijets in the recombination model. Good fits of the data on pion, kaon\nand proton production throughout the intermediate \\ppt\\ region have been\nobtained by adjusting the parameters controlling the magnitude of the thermal\npartons and the degradation rates of the semihard partons. The result gives\nsupport to the minijet spectra at any centrality on the one hand, and the\nhadronization procedure used on the other. An important property made manifest\nin this study is that quarks and gluons must not lose energy in the same way\nbecause the partons form mesons and baryons differently by recombination and\nthe momenta of quarks and gluons must be degraded at different rates in order\nto reproduce the experimental pion and proton spectra. This is a feature that\nrenders invalid the notion of parton-hadron duality or other hadronization\nschemes based on similar ideas. \n\n"}

Indeed, nuclear matter\ntraditionally addressed by mean-field models is uniform while clusters are\nknown to exist in the dilute baryonic matter which constitutes the main\ncomponent of compact objects outer shells.

This paper explores the correlations among harmonic flow\ncoefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\\Phi_n$, and the rapidity fluctuation of\n$v_n$. The study is carried out usin Pb+Pb events generated by the AMPT model\nwith fixed impact parameter.

The responses of the $v_n$, the\nevent-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in\n$\\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are\nobserved among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with\n$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$\nand $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear\ncollective response.

In atomic\nnuclei the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi momentum ($k>k_F\n\\approx 250$ Mev/c) is also dominated by short rangecorrelated\ndifferent-fermion (neutron-proton) pairs.\n  Purpose: Compare high-momentum unlike-fermion momentum distributions in\natomic and nuclear systems.\n  Methods: We show that, for $k>k_F$ MeV/c, nuclear momentum distributions are\nproportional to that of the deuteron. We then examine the deuteron momentum\ndistributions derived from a wide variety of modern nucleon-nucleon potentials\nthat are consistent with $NN$-scattering data.\n  Results: The high momentum tail of the deuteron momentum distribution, and\nhence of the nuclear momentum distributions appears to decrease as $k^{-4}$.\nThis behavior is shown to arise from the effects of the tensor part of the\nnucleon-nucleon potential.

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the\nnon-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling\nbetween the collective states is found.\n  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found. DPPs\nhave forms depending on the specific excitations and cannot be represented by a\nuniform renormalization of the potential. The method is useful for study of the\ncontribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning\nwhich remarkably little is known in general. \n\n"}

The initial charm\nquarks are produced by the Pythia event generator tuned to fit the transverse\nmomentum spectrum and rapidity distribution of charm quarks from Fixed-Order\nNext-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculations. The produced charm quarks\nscatter in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) with the off-shell partons whose masses\nand widths are given by the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) which\nreproduces the lattice QCD equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. The\nrelevant cross section are calculated in a consistent way by employing the\neffective propagators and couplings from the DQPM. Close to the critical energy\ndensity of the phase transition, the charm quarks are hadronized into $D$\nmesons through coalescence and/or fragmentation depending on transverse\nmomentum. The hadronized $D$ mesons then interact with the various hadrons in\nthe hadronic phase with cross sections calculated in an effective lagrangian\napproach with heavy-quark spin symmetry.

Together with new shell-model calculations of the\nelectron-capture strength function of 56Sc, our results strongly reduce\nuncertainties in model calculations of the heating and cooling at the 56Ti\nelectron-capture layer in the outer crust of accreting neutron stars. We found\nthat, in contrast to previous studies, neither strong neutrino cooling nor\nstrong heating occurs in this layer. We conclude that Urca cooling in the outer\ncrusts of accreting neutron stars that exhibit superbursts or high temperature\nsteady-state burning, which are predicted to be rich in A=56 nuclei, is\nconsiderably weaker than predicted. Urca cooling must instead be dominated by\nelectron capture on the small amounts of adjacent odd-A nuclei contained in the\nsuperburst and high temperature steady-state burning ashes. This may explain\nthe absence of strong crust Urca cooling inferred from the observed cooling\nlight curve of the transiently accreting x-ray source MAXI J0556-332. \n\n"}

They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation.

However, the inevitable momentum spread of secondary ions\nlimits the precision of nuclear masses determined by using IMS.

{"id": "1608.00487", "contents": "Title: Analysis of Neutron Stars Observations Using a Correlated Fermi Gas\n  Model Abstract: Background: The nuclear symmetry energy is a fundamental ingredient in\ndetermining the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NS). Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

These processes hold a lot of potential for resolving the outstanding\nissues related to the dynamics of hadronization in QCD. Within the minimal Fock\ncomponent framework, valid at large Bjorken $x$, the main features of the\ntheoretical approach based on the virtual nucleon approximation are elaborated.\nIn this approach, the strong final-state interaction of the DIS products with\nthe nuclear fragments is described by an effective eikonal amplitude, whose\nparameters can be extracted from the analysis of semi-inclusive DIS off the\ndeuteron target. The extraction of the $Q^2$ and $W$ mass dependences of these\nparameters gives a new observable in studying the QCD structure of DIS final\nstates. Another important feature of tagged DIS off the lightest nuclei is the\npossibility of performing pole extrapolation with a high degree of accuracy.\nSuch extrapolation allows an extraction of the neutron structure function in a\nmodel independent way due to suppression of the final-state interaction in the\non-shell limit of the struck nucleon propagator. We review the first\napplication of the pole extrapolation to recent experimental data. Finally, we\noutline the extension of the framework to inclusive DIS, including a polarized\ndeuteron target as well as its application to the tagged DIS reactions for\nfuture experiments at fixed target and collider energies. \n\n"}

Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

The mass is the first problem: it is difficult to explain with any\ntheoretical tool that can validly be used to study quantum chromodynamics\n[QCD]. In the last decade, a new challenge has appeared, viz. precise\ninformation on the proton-to-Roper electroproduction transition form factors,\nreaching $Q^2\\approx 4.5\\,$GeV$^2$. This scale probes the domain within which\nhard valence-quark degrees-of-freedom could be expected to determine form\nfactor behavior. Hence, with this new data the Roper resonance becomes a\nproblem for strong-QCD [sQCD]. An explanation of how and where the Roper\nresonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a\ndescription of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed\nunderstanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the\ntransition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly\ncomplete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year\ninternational effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has\npresented a solution to the puzzle. Namely, the Roper is at heart the proton's\nfirst radial excitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a\nmeson cloud that reduces the core mass by approximately 20% and materially\nalters its electroproduction form factors on $Q^2<2m_N^2$, where $m_N$ is the\nproton's mass. We describe the experimental motivations and developments which\nenabled electroproduction data to be procured within a domain that is\nunambiguously the purview of sQCD, thereby providing a real challenge and\nopportunity for modern theory; and survey the developments in reaction models\nand QCD theory that have enabled this conclusion to be drawn about the nature\nof the Roper resonance. \n\n"}

Such analyses predict the\npresence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark)\ncorrelations within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar,\nisovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar, and vector diquarks can all\nplay a role. In the two lightest $(1/2,1/2^+)$ doublets, however, scalar and\npseudovector diquarks are overwhelmingly dominant. The associated rest-frame\nwave functions are largely $S$-wave in nature; and the first excited state in\nthis $1/2^+$ channel has the appearance of a radial excitation of the ground\nstate. The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different picture:\naccurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector\ndiquarks; in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark\ncores contain roughly equal fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the\nassociated wave functions are predominantly $P$-wave in nature, but possess\nmeasurable $S$-wave components.

However, uncertainties in transport models (or model\ndependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted. The incompressibility is deduced\nfrom the comparison of the UrQMD model simulations and the FOPI data for\nrapidity-dependent elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at beam energies\n0.4\\emph{A} - 1.0\\emph{A} GeV. The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of\nrapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +\nv_{22}\\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by\n$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$\nand the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy.

The\nresulting groomed jets can be used to study modifications to the parton shower\nevolution in the presence of the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion\ncollisions. Predictions of groomed jet properties from the PYTHIA and HERWIG++\nevent generators agree with the measurements in pp collisions. When comparing\nthe results from the most central PbPb collisions to pp data, a hint of an\nincrease of jets with large jet mass is observed, which could originate from\nadditional medium-induced radiation at a large angle from the jet axis.\nHowever, no modification of the groomed mass of the core of the jet is observed\nfor all PbPb centrality classes. The PbPb results are also compared to\npredictions from the JEWEL and Q-PYTHIA event generators, which predict a large\nmodification of the groomed mass not observed in the data. \n\n"}

For the latter, the determination of the\ncharge radius involves an extrapolation of the experimental form factor to zero\nmomentum transfer.\n  Purpose: To estimate the proton radius by introducing a novel non-parametric\napproach to model the electric form factor of the proton.\n  Methods: Within a Bayesian paradigm, we develop a model flexible enough to\nfit the data without any parametric assumptions on the form factor. The\nBayesian estimation is guided by imposing only two physical constraints on the\nform factor: (a) its value at zero momentum transfer (normalization) and (b)\nits overall shape, assumed to be a monotonically decreasing function of the\nmomentum transfer. Variants of these assumptions are explored to assess the\nimpact of these constraints.\n  Results: So far our results are inconclusive in regard to the proton puzzle,\nas they depend on both, the assumed constrains and the range of experimental\ndata used. For example, if only low momentum-transfer data is used, adopting\nonly the normalization constraint provides a value compatible with the smaller\nmuonic result, while imposing only the shape constraint favors the larger\nelectronic value.\n  Conclusions: We have presented a novel technique to estimate the proton\nradius from electron scattering data based on a non-parametric Gaussian\nprocess. We have shown the impact of the physical constraints imposed on the\nform factor and of the range of experimental data used. In this regard, we are\nhopeful that as this technique is refined and with the anticipated new results\nfrom the PRad experiment, we will get closer to resolve of the puzzle. \n\n"}

Purpose: The available\ndecay properties of proton drip-line nucleus $^{27}$S is insufficient to\nconstrain the properties of the key resonance in $^{26}$Si$(p,\\gamma)^{27}$P\nreaction rate and probe the possible isospin asymmetry. The decay scheme of\n$^{27}$S is complicated and far from being understood, which has motivated but\nalso presented challenges for our experiment. Method: The $^{27}$S ions were\nimplanted into a double-sided silicon strip detector array surrounded by the\nhigh-purity germanium detectors, where the $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\gamma$\nrays were measured simultaneously. Results: The improved spectroscopic\nproperties including the precise half-life of $^{27}$S, the excitation\nenergies, $\\beta$-decay branching ratios, log~$ft$ values, and $B$(GT) values\nfor the states of $^{27}$P populated in the $\\beta$ decay of $^{27}$S were\nmeasured and compared to the $^{27}$Mg mirror states and the shell-model\ncalculations. The present work has expanded greatly on the previously\nestablished decay scheme of $^{27}$S. Conclusions: The precise\nproton-separation energy of $^{27}$P, the energy and the ratio between $\\gamma$\nand proton partial widths of the $3/2^+$ resonance were obtained, thereby\ndetermining the $^{26}$Si$(p,\\gamma)^{27}$P reaction rate based mainly on\nexperimental constraints. The first evidence for the observation of a large\nisospin asymmetry for the mirror decays of $^{27}$S and $^{27}$Na is also\nprovided. The experimental spectroscopic information can be reproduced by the\nshell-model calculation taking the weakly bound effect of the proton $1s_{1/2}$\norbit into account. \n\n"}

Some examples\nare strongly interacting medium and heavy mass atomic nuclei and mesoscopic\ncondensed matter systems. In this approach, the linear Schrodinger equation for\nthe exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent\none-body potential problem. This approximation, not only provides\ncomputationally very simple solutions even for systems with many particles, but\ndue to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions that break\nessential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In\nthis way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system. However, the\nmean-field approach suffers from the drawback that the corresponding wave\nfunctions do not have sharp quantum numbers and, therefore, many results cannot\nbe compared directly with experimental data. In this article, we discuss\ngeneral group-theory techniques to restore the broken symmetries, and provide\ndetailed expressions on the restoration of translational, rotational, spin,\nisospin, parity and gauge symmetries, where the latter corresponds to the\nrestoration of the particle number.

Abstract: Several experiments have extracted proton electromagnetic form factors from\nelastic cross section measurements using the Rosenbluth technique.

This discrepancy indicates a fundamental problem in one of the\ntwo techniques, or a significant error in polarization transfer or cross\nsection measurements.

The reaction is characterized by a high\ndegree of transparency of the collisions partners leading to the formation of a\nbaryon-poor central region.

The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data.
