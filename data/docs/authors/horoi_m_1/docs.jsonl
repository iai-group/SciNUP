Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy.

We previously showed that our dynamical energy loss formalism can\naccurately explain suppression measurements at 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC\nand 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. With the upcoming LHC measurements at\nnotably higher collision energies, there is a question of what differences,\nwith respect to the current (2.76 TeV) measurements, can be expected. In this\npaper we concentrate on heavy flavor suppression at the upcoming 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb\ncollisions energy at the LHC. Naively, one would expect a notably ($\\sim 30\\%$)\nlarger suppression at 5.1 TeV collision energy, due to estimated (significant)\nenergy loss increase when transitioning from 2.76 to 5.1 TeV. Surprisingly,\nmore detailed calculations predict nearly the same suppression results at these\ntwo energies. We show that this unexpected result is due to an interplay of the\nfollowing two effects, which essentially cancel each other: i) flattening of\nthe initial distributions with increasing collision energies, and ii)\nsignificantly slower than naively expected increase in the energy loss.\nTherefore, the obtained nearly the same suppression provides a clear\n(qualitative and quantitative) test of our energy loss formalism. \n\n"}

Our study of\nphase resolved energy spectra of these oscillations in 4U 1636-53 shows that\nthe oscillations are not caused by variations in the blackbody temperature of\nthe neutron star, but reveals a correlation between the change of the count\nrate during the mHz QPO pulse and the spatial extend of a region emitting\nblackbody emission. The maximum size of the emission area\n$R^2_{\\mathrm{BB}}=216.7^{+93.2}_{-86.4}$km$^2$, provides the direct evidence\nthat the oscillations originate from a variable surface area constrained on the\nNS and are therefore not related to instabilities in the accretion disk.

In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted.

The late-time transition in the spectral energy\ndistribution to near-infrared wavelengths was interpreted as indicating the\nproduction of lanthanide nuclei, with atomic mass number A>140. However,\ncompelling evidence for the presence of heavier third-peak r-process elements\n(e.g., gold, platinum) or translead nuclei remains elusive. At early times\n(~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble\nof beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense,\ngenerating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single\npower-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input\ncan possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays, 223Ra\n(half-life t_{1/2}=11.43d), 225Ac (t_{1/2}=10.0d, following the beta-decay of\n225Ra with t_{1/2}=14.9d), and the fissioning isotope 254Cf (t_{1/2}=60.5d),\nwhich liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency\nthan beta-decay products.

Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively.

Here, we investigate the connection between the spectral properties of\nthe quantum-mechanical scattering matrix and its semiclassical equivalent based\non the semiclassical zeta-function of Gutzwiller and Voros. Our\nquantum-mechanical calculation is well-defined at every step, as the on-shell\nT-matrix and the multiscattering kernel M-1 are shown to be trace-class. The\nmultiscattering determinant can be organized in terms of the cumulant expansion\nwhich is the defining prescription for the determinant over an infinite, but\ntrace-class matrix. The quantum cumulants are then expanded by traces which, in\nturn, split into quantum itineraries or cycles. These can be organized by a\nsimple symbolic dynamics. The semiclassical reduction of the coherent\nmultiscattering part takes place on the level of the quantum cycles. We show\nthat the semiclassical analog of the m-th quantum cumulant is the m-th\ncurvature term of the semiclassical zeta function. In this way quantum\nmechanics naturally imposes the curvature regularization structured by the\ntopological (not the geometrical) length of the pertinent periodic orbits onto\nthe semiclassical zeta function.

The clue is to\nbase statistical probability on ensemble averaging and not on time averaging.\nIt is argued that due to the incomplete information obtained by macroscopic\nmeasurements thermodynamics handles ensembles or finite-sized sub-manifolds in\nphase space and not single time-dependent trajectories. Therefore, ensemble\naverages are the natural objects of statistical probabilities. This is the\nphysical origin of coarse-graining which is not anymore a mathematical ad hoc\nassumption.

The models taken into consideration have a U(2)_L x U(2)_R and\nan O(4) internal symmetry. The physical mesons of these models are sigma, pion,\neta and a_0 where the latter two are not present in the O(4) model. Including\ntwo-loop contributions through sunset graphs we calculate the temperature\nbehavior of the order parameter and the masses for explicit chiral symmetry\nbreaking and in the chiral limit. Decay threshold effects introduced by the\nsunset graphs alter the temperature dependence of the condensate and\nconsequently that of the masses as well. This correctly reproduces a\nsecond-order phase transition for the O(4) model and for the U(2)_L x U(2)_R\nmodel with an axial U(1) anomaly as expected from universality class arguments.\nChiral symmetry tends to be restored at higher temperatures in the two-loop\napproximation than in the Hartree-Fock approximation. To model a restoration of\nthe axial U(1) symmetry we imply a temperature-dependent anomaly parameter that\nsharply drops at about 175 MeV.

The reaction operator approach also\nleads to a simple algebraic proof of the ``color triviality'' of single\ninclusive distributions and to a solvable set of recursion relations. The\nanalytic solution generalizes previous continuum solutions (BDMPS) for\napplications to mesoscopic QCD plasmas. The solution is furthermore not\nrestricted to uncorrelated geometries and allows for evolving screening scales\nas well as the inclusion of finite kinematic constraints. The later is\nparticularly important because below LHC energies the kinematic constraints\nsignificantly decrease the non-abelian energy loss. Our solution for the\ninclusive distribution also generalizes the finite order exclusive (tagged)\ndistribution case studied previously (GLV1). The form of the analytic solution\nis well suited for numerical implementation in Monte Carlo event generators to\nenable more accurate calculations of jet quenching in ultra-relativistic\nnuclear collisions.

Emphasis is placed on the self-energy current which, being infinite,\nneeds to be renormalized. This is achieved starting in the Hartree-Fock\nframework and then expanding the Hartree-Fock current to first order in the\nsquare of the pion coupling constant to obtain a truly, gauge invariant,\none-pion-exchange current. The model is applied to the calculation of the\nparity-conserving (PC) and parity-violating (PV) inclusive responses of nuclei.\nInterestingly, in the pionic correlations terms exist which arise uniquely from\nrelativity, although their impact on the responses is found to be modest. \n\n"}

The results obtained in this way are\nequivalent to the usual loop calculations, provided no heavy-baryon expansion\nor any other manipulations which lead to a different analytic structure (e.g.,\ninfrared regularization) are made.

This argument concerns the structure of the strong\nisoscalar axial vector current. A vanishing eta-N coupling means a vanishing\ncontribution of the eta-pole term to the hypercharge nucleon axial vector\ncurrent. Therefore, no partial conservation of the latter can be achieved. This\nnew situation invalidates the octet Goldberger--Treiman relation for the eta-N\ncoupling constant that is indicative of the octet Goldstone boson nature of the\neta meson. In such a case there is no longer a compelling reason for the\nstandard belief that the eta meson should be coupled to the hadronic vacuum\nthrough the hypercharge axial vector current.

In the infinite cut-off limit power counting\nbreaks down: terms of different orders in the potential contribute to the\nscattering amplitude at the same order.

We\nfind that kinetic, thermal, and chemical equilibration of the expanding\nhadronic matter is nearly reached in central collisions at AGS energy for $t\n\\geq 10$ fm/$c$ in a central cell. At these times the equation of state may be\napproximated by a simple dependence $P \\cong (0.12-0.15) \\epsilon$. Increasing\ndeviations of the yields and the energy spectra of hadrons from statistical\nmodel values are observed for increasing bombarding energies. The origin of\nthese deviations is traced to the irreversible multiparticle decays of strings\nand many-body $(N \\geq 3)$ decays of resonances.

The simulations follow a lattice\nHamiltonian extended to relativistic transport. It is demonstrated that in the\nperipheral heavy-ion collisions the high-momentum elliptic flow is strongly\nsensitive to the momentum dependence of mean field at supranormal densities.\nThe high transverse-momentum particles are directly and exclusively emitted\nfrom the high-density zone in the collisions, while remaining particles\nprimarily continue along the beam axis. The elliptic flow was measured by the\nKaoS Collaboration as a function of the transverse momentum at a number of\nimpact parameters in Bi + Bi collisions at 400, 700, and 1000 MeV/nucleon. The\nobserved elliptic anisotropies in peripheral collisions, which quickly rise\nwith momentum, can only be explained in simulations when assuming a strong\nmomentum dependence of nucleonic mean field. This momentum dependence must\nstrengthen with the rise of density above normal. The mean-field\nparametrizations, which describe the data in simulations with various success,\nare confronted with mean fields from microscopic nuclear-matter calculations.\nTwo of the microscopic potentials in the comparisons have unacceptably weak\nmomentum-dependencies at supranormal densities. The optical potentials from the\nDirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations, on the other hand, together with the\nUV14 + TNI potential from variational calculations, agree rather well within\nthe region of sensitivity with the parametrized potentials that best describe\nthe data. \n\n"}
