In\nparticular, we consider different types of interactions including screened\nCoulomb interactions, much like those produced by a point charge placed either\nabove a single infinite conducting plate or exactly halfway between two\nparallel infinite conducting plates. Our considerations are motivated by the\nfact that, in some recent experiments on bilayer graphene there is a single\ngate while in others there are two gates, which can function as the conducting\nplanes and which, we argue, can lead to distinct broken symmetry phases. We map\nout the phases that the system enters as a function of the range of the\ninteraction. We discover that the system enters an antiferromagnetic phase for\nshort ranges of the interaction and a nematic phase at long ranges, in\nagreement with previous work. While the antiferromagnetic phase results in a\ngap in the spectrum, the nematic phase is gapless, splitting the quadratic\ndegeneracy points into two Dirac cones each. We also consider the effects of an\napplied magnetic field on the system in the antiferromagnetic phase via\nvariational mean field theory.

At low temperatures, an\nasymmetric conductance anomaly near zero bias is observed, which is interpreted\nas Fano resonance in the strong tunneling regime. In Ch5, the thermoelectric\npower (TEP) and longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) of MWNTs are measured. A\nmoderate positive TEP with metallic-like linear temperature dependence is\nfound, suggesting that the electron-hole symmetry in metallic MWNTs is broken.\nPeriodic oscillations in MR are observed at 20 mK when a longitudinal magnetic\nfield is applied.

Much of our focus\nis on the simple example of a free massive Dirac fermion, the so-called Chern\ninsulator, especially in 2+1 dimensions. In such cases, when parity and\ntime-reversal symmetry are broken, it is necessary to consider the\ngravitational sources to include a frame and an independent spin connection\nwith torsion. In 2+1 dimensions, the simplest parity-odd response is the Hall\nviscosity. We compute the Hall viscosity of the Chern insulator using a careful\nregularization scheme, and find that although the Hall viscosity is generally\ndivergent, the difference in Hall viscosities of distinct topological phases is\nwell-defined and determined by the mass gap. Furthermore, on a 1+1-dimensional\nedge between topological phases, the jump in the Hall viscosity across the\ninterface is encoded, through familiar anomaly inflow mechanisms, in the\nstructure of anomalies.

It has been\nproposed that even in the absence of a semiconducting bandgap, a relaxation\nbottleneck at the Dirac point may allow for population inversion and lasing at\narbitrarily long wavelengths. Furthermore, efficient carrier multiplication by\nimpact ionization has been discussed in the context of light harvesting\napplications. However, all these effects are difficult to test quantitatively\nby measuring the transient optical properties alone, as these only indirectly\nreflect the energy and momentum dependent carrier distributions. Here, we use\ntime- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with femtosecond extreme\nultra-violet (EUV) pulses at 31.5 eV photon energy to directly probe the\nnon-equilibrium response of Dirac electrons near the K-point of the Brillouin\nzone.

However, while numerous qubit array proposals exist to\nengineer the Hamiltonian for these systems, the question of how to stabilize\nthe many-body ground state of these photonic quantum simulators against photon\nlosses remains largely unanswered. We here propose a simple mechanism which\nachieves this goal for abelian and non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states\nof light. Our construction uses a uniform two-photon drive field to couple the\nqubits of the primary lattice with an auxiliary ``shadow\" lattice, composed of\nqubits with a much faster loss rate than the qubits of the primary quantum\nsimulator itself. This coupling causes hole states created by photon losses to\nbe rapidly refilled, and the system's many-body gap prevents further photons\nfrom being added once the strongly correlated ground state is reached. The\nfractional quantum Hall state (with a small, transient population of quasihole\nexcitations) is thus the most stable state of the system, and all other\nconfigurations will relax toward it over time.

However, the geometric topology of the studied samples is\nusually trivial, such as a ribbon or a cylinder. In this paper, we consider a\ngraphene M\\\"obius band irradiated with circularly polarised light.\nInterestingly, due to the non-orientability of the M\\\"obius band, a homogeneous\nquantum Hall effect cannot exist in this system, but the quantum spin Hall\neffect can.

But the significant controversy surrounding the nature of\nthe $\\nu = 5/2$ state has been hampered by the fact that the competition\nbetween these and other states is affected by small parameter changes. To study\nthe phase diagram of the $\\nu = 5/2$ state we numerically diagonalize a\ncomprehensive effective Hamiltonian describing the fractional quantum Hall\neffect of electrons under realistic conditions in GaAs semiconductors. The\neffective Hamiltonian takes Landau level mixing into account to lowest-order\nperturbatively in $\\kappa$, the ratio of the Coulomb energy scale to the\ncyclotron gap. We also incorporate non-zero width $w$ of the quantum well and\nsub-band mixing. We find the ground state in both the torus and spherical\ngeometries as a function of $\\kappa$ and $w$. To sort out the non-trivial\ncompetition between candidate ground states we analyze the following 4\ncriteria: its overlap with trial wave functions; the magnitude of energy gaps;\nthe sign of the expectation value of an order parameter for particle-hole\nsymmetry breaking; and the entanglement spectrum.

According to the tight-binding model, band\ngap opening (or closing) takes place for some type of jagged graphene\nnanoribbons in the external electric field that lays in the plane of the\nstructure and perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. Tunability of the band\ngap up to $0.6$ eV is attainable for narrow ribbons.

For jagged ribbons with zigzag and\narmchair edges regions of linear and quadratic dependence of the band gap on\nthe external electric field can be found that are useful in devices with\ncontrollable modulation of the band gap. \n\n"}

We derive the theory of the nematic state\nand of the phase transition.

Central to this phenomenon are Hamiltonians whose insulating gap is\ncontrolled by a multi-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) parameter space in\nwhich paths can be defined for adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian, i.e.,\nwithout closing the gap. Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band\ninsulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat the connectivity of this parameter space is crucial for defining quantum\npumps, demonstrating that, as opposed to the conventional two-dimensional case,\npumped quantities depend not only on the initial and final points of\nHamiltonian evolution but also on the class of the chosen path and preserved\nsymmetries. As such, we distinguish the scenarios of closed/open paths of\nHamiltonian evolution, finding that different closed cycles can lead to the\npumping of different quantum numbers, and that different open paths may point\nto distinct scenarios for surface physics. As explicit examples, we consider\nmodels similar to simple models used to describe topological insulators, but\nwith doubled degrees of freedom compared to a minimal topological insulator\nmodel.

This property is a consequence of the\nlong-range Coulomb interaction, which favors interband phase coherence that is\nweakly dependent on momentum and therefore frustrated by the single-particle\nHamiltonian at the band inversion point.

Here we\nstudy the excitations of lines of defects within a single-valley spherical band\napproximation, thus mapping the problem to a scaled hydrogen atom array. A\nseries of detailed full configuration-interaction and time-dependent hybrid\ndensity-functional theory calculations have been performed to understand linear\nclusters of up to 10 donors.

(The physical situation corresponds to $d_c=1$.) A particularly\nimportant application of our results is free-standing graphene. We find that at\nvery low stress, where the membrane exhibits a linear response, the PR\n$\\nu_L(0)$ decreases with increasing $L$ and saturates for $ L\\to \\infty$ at a\nvalue which depends on the boundary conditions and is essentially different\nfrom the value $\\nu=-1/3$ previously predicted by the membrane theory within a\nself-consisted scaling analysis. By increasing $\\sigma$, one drives a membrane\ninto a non-linear regime characterized by a universal value of PR that depends\nsolely on $d_c.$ This universal non-linear PR acquires its minimum value\n$\\nu_{\\rm min}=-1$ in the limit $d_c\\to \\infty.$ With the further increase of\n$\\sigma$, the PR changes sign and finally saturates at a positive non-universal\nvalue prescribed by the conventional elasticity theory. We also show that one\nshould distinguish between the absolute and differential PR ($\\nu$ and\n$\\nu^{\\rm diff}$, respectively). While coinciding in the limits of very low and\nvery high stresses, they differ in general, $\\nu \\neq \\nu^{\\rm diff}$.

In this\nregime, correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been\nexperimentally observed. A microscopic description of these phenomena requires\nan understanding of universal aspects of the band structure, which we discuss\nhere. First, we point out the importance of emergent symmetries, such as valley\nconservation, which are excellent symmetries in the limit of small twist angles\nand dictate qualitative features of the band structure. These have sometimes\nbeen overlooked when discussing commensurate approximants to the band\nstructure, which we also review here, and solidify their connection with the\ncontinuum theory which incorporates all emergent symmetries. Finally, we\ndiscuss obstructions to writing down tight-binding models of just the isolated\nbands, and in particular a new symmetry based diagnostic of these obstructions,\nas well as relations to band topology and strategies for resolving the\nobstruction. Especially, we construct a four-band model where the two lower\nisolated bands realize all identified Wannier obstructions of the single-valley\nnearly flat bands of twisted bilayer graphene. \n\n"}

We take into\naccount bosonic modes due to the electromagnetic environment which couple the\nMajorana manifold to above-gap continuum quasi-particles. This coupling causes\nthe degenerate ground state of the topological superconductor to be dressed in\na polaron-like manner by quasi-particle states and bosons, and the system to\nbecome gapless. Topological protection and hence full coherence is only\nmaintained if the qubit is operated and read out within the low-energy spectrum\nof the dressed states. We discuss reduction of fidelity and/or visibility if\nthis condition is violated by a quantum-dot readout that couples to the bare\n(undressed) Majorana modes. For a projective measurement of the bare Majorana\nbasis, we formulate a Bloch-Redfield approach that is valid for weak\nMajorana-environment coupling and takes into account constraints imposed by\nfermion-number-parity conservation. Within the Markovian approximation, our\nresults essentially confirm earlier theories of finite-temperature decoherence\nbased on Fermi's golden rule. However, the full non-Markovian dynamics reveals,\nin addition, the fidelity reduction by a projective measurement.

We discuss two competing transport channels for Cooper pairs\nto tunnel from the SC into the LL leads.

Current can flow only if two charge states of the grain have the same\nenergy; in this case the conductance has a peak. In a small grain with\nquantized electron states, referred to as a quantum dot, the magnitude of the\nconductance peak is directly related to the magnitude of the wavefunction near\nthe contacts to the dot. Since dots are generally irregular in shape, the\ndynamics of the electrons is chaotic, and the characteristics of Coulomb\nblockade peaks reflects those of wavefunctions in chaotic systems. Previously,\na statistical theory for the peaks was derived by assuming these wavefunctions\nto be completely random.
