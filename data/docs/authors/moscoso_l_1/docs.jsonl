Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

Its X-ray spectrum is thermal, and is reproduced remarkably well by a\nblack-body, but its interpretation has remained puzzling. One reason is that\nthe source did not exhibit pulsations, and hence a magnetic field\nstrength--vital input to atmosphere models--could not be estimated. Recently,\nhowever, very weak pulsations were discovered. Here, we analyze these in\ndetail, using all available data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray\nobservatories. From frequency measurements, we set a 2-sigma upper limit to the\nfrequency derivative of \\dot\\nu<1.3e-14 Hz/s. Trying possible phase-connected\ntiming solutions, we find that one solution is far more likely than the others,\nand we infer a most probable value of \\dot\\nu=(-5.98+/-0.14)e-16 Hz/s.

The gamma-ray flux is variable, with strong, distinct,\nsymmetrically-shaped flares for which the flux increases by a factor of several\non a time scale of about three days. This variability indicates a compact\nemission region, and the requirement that the source is optically thin to\npair-production implies relativistic beaming with Doppler factor delta > 8,\nconsistent with the values inferred from VLBI observations of superluminal\nexpansion (delta ~ 25).

Although these disks seem to be ejected from the\nstar and not accreted, there is substantial observational evidence to show that\nthe stars rotate more slowly than required for centrifugally driven mass loss.\nThis paper develops an idea (proposed originally by Hiroyasu Ando and\ncolleagues) that nonradial stellar pulsations inject enough angular momentum\ninto the upper atmosphere to spin up a Keplerian disk. The pulsations\nthemselves are evanescent in the stellar photosphere, but they may be unstable\nto the generation of resonant oscillations at the acoustic cutoff frequency. A\ndetailed theory of the conversion from pulsations to resonant waves does not\nyet exist for realistic hot-star atmospheres, so the current models depend on a\nparameterized approximation for the efficiency of wave excitation. Once\nresonant waves have been formed, however, they grow in amplitude with\nincreasing height, steepen into shocks, and exert radial and azimuthal Reynolds\nstresses on the mean fluid. Using reasonable assumptions for the stellar\nparameters, these processes were found to naturally create the inner boundary\nconditions required for dense Keplerian disks, even when the underlying B-star\nphotosphere is rotating as slowly as 60% of its critical rotation speed.\nBecause there is evidence for long-term changes in Be-star pulsational\nproperties, this model may also account for the long-term variability of Be\nstars, including transitions between normal, Be, and shell phases. \n\n"}

I study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions for\nthe high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the Sun. The\nself-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within the\nSun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the Sun. This\neffect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of\ntens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in\nextreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the\ndark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v <~\n10^-27 cm^3/s. This phenomenology is interesting. First, self-capture is\nnegligible for the Earth, so dark matter self-interactions break the\ncorrespondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. Likewise,\nthe correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scattering\ncross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction.

The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative\ndensity slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that\nis applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still\navoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each\nparticle decays to zero.

If the inner disc radius we measure (<=3.8\ngravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit of\nthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering RBS 1124 is\nrotating rapidly with spin a>= 0.6. The soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2\nkeV band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured Seyfert\n1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction we\nmeasure (R_disc ~0.4). The low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disc\ntruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we infer\nbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source\n(L_Bol / L_Edd ~1). A plausible explanation is that the X-ray corona is the\nbase of a failed jet (RBS 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing at\nmildly relativistic speeds. Aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,\nthus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferred\nsource intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived Eddington ratio from ~1to\n~0.5.

For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code\nInvestigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston\n(or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on\na modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale & Helou dust\nemission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on\nthe input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and compared\nto the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was\ntested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of\nthe different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting\nexpectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model\ngrid.

Abstract: In order to generate more than 60 e-folds of accelerated expansion in\noriginal hybrid inflation, 2-fields trajectories are usually required to be\ninitially fine-tuned in a very narrow band along the inflationary valley or in\nsome isolated points outside it. From a more precise investigation of the\ndynamics, these points which can cover a non-negligible proportion of the space\nof sub-planckian initial field values, depending on the potential parameters,\nare shown to be organised in connected domains with fractal boundaries. They\ncorrespond to trajectories first falling towards the bottom of the potential,\nthen climbing and slow-rolling back along the inflationary valley. The full\nparameter space, including initial velocities and all the potential parameters,\nis then explored by using Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chains (MCMC) methods.

Their nonlinear evolution drives\npressure anisotropies towards marginal stability, controlled by the plasma beta\n\\beta_i. Here this nonlinear evolution is worked out for the simplest\nanalytically tractable example - the parallel firehose instability. In the\nnonlinear regime, both analytical theory and the numerical solution predict\nsecular growth of magnetic fluctuations.

Abstract: When clusters of galaxies are viewed in projection, one cannot avoid picking\nup foreground/background interlopers (FBIs), that lie within the virial cone\n(VC), but outside the virial sphere. Structural & kinematic deprojection\nequations are not known for an expanding Universe, where the Hubble flow (HF)\nstretches the line-of-sight (LOS) distribution of velocities. We analyze 93\nmock relaxed clusters, built from a cosmological simulation. The stacked mock\ncluster is well fit by an m=5 Einasto DM density profile (but only out to 1.5\nvirial radii [r_v]), with velocity anisotropy (VA) close to the Mamon-Lokas\nmodel with VA radius equal to that of density slope -2. The surface density of\nFBIs is nearly flat out to r_v, while their LOS velocity distribution shows a\ndominant gaussian cluster-outskirts component and a flat field component. This\ndistribution of FBIs in projected phase space is nearly universal in mass. A\nlocal k=2.7 sigma velocity cut returns the LOS velocity dispersion profile\n(LOSVDP) expected from the NFW density and VA profiles measured in 3D. The HF\ncauses a shallower outer LOSVDP that cannot be well matched by the Einasto\nmodel for any k. After this velocity cut, FBIs still account for 23% of DM\nparticles within the VC (close to the observed fraction of cluster galaxies\nlying off the Red Sequence). The best-fit projected NFW/Einasto models\nunderestimate the 3D concentration by 6+/-6% (16+/-7%) after (before) the\nvelocity cut, unless a constant background is included in the fit. Assuming the\ncorrect mass profile, the VA profile is well recovered from the measured\nLOSVDP, with a slight bias towards more radial orbits in the outer regions.\nThese small biases are overshadowed by large cluster-cluster variations caused\nby cosmic variance.

The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility\nof significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.\nFive such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical\nafterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are\nsystematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst\ndensities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),\nor to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray\nfluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale\nenvironments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying\nhosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near\neach burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence\n(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10\",\nwhile somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with\nfaint galaxies at separations of ~2\". By measuring redshifts for the brighter\ngalaxies in three cases (z=0.111, 0.473, 0.403) we find physical offsets of\n~30-75 kpc, while for the faint hosts the assumption of z>1 leads to offsets of\n~15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be\nexplained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two\npossibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the\ncenters of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due\nto the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and\nhave fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts. \n\n"}

Quasi-Periodic Variability Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are uniquely\ndescribed by their masses and spins. An observational test of the no-hair\ntheorem can be performed by measuring at least three different multipole\nmoments of the spacetime of a black hole and verifying whether their values are\nconsistent with the unique combinations of the Kerr solution. In this paper, we\nstudy quasi-periodic variability observed in the emission from black holes\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum as a test of the no-hair theorem. We derive\nexpressions for the Keplerian and epicyclic frequencies in a quasi-Kerr\nspacetime, in which the quadrupole moment is a free parameter in addition to\nmass and spin. We show that, for moderate spins, the Keplerian frequency is\npractically independent of small deviations of the quadrupole moment from the\nKerr value, while the epicyclic frequencies exhibit significant variations. We\napply this framework to quasi-periodic oscillations in black-hole X-ray\nbinaries in two different scenarios. In the case that a pair of quasi-periodic\noscillations can be identified as the fundamental g- and c-modes in the\naccretion disk, we show that the no-hair theorem can be tested in conjunction\nwith an independent mass measurement. If, on the other hand, the pairs of\noscillations are identified with non-parametric resonance of dynamical\nfrequencies in the accretion disk, then testing the no-hair theorem also\nrequires an independent measurement of the black-hole spin. In addition, we\nargue that VLBI observations of Sgr A* may test the no-hair theorem through a\ncombination of imaging observations and the detection of quasi-periodic\nvariability. \n\n"}

Particularly, with numerical simulations, we compare\nthe Gaussian filter with the so called MRLens treatment based on the\nmodification of the Maximum Entropy Method. For a pure noise field without\nlensing signals, a Gaussian smoothing results a residual noise field that is\napproximately Gaussian in statistics if a large enough number of galaxies are\nincluded in the smoothing window. On the other hand, the noise field after the\nMRLens treatment is significantly non-Gaussian, resulting complications in\ncharacterizing the noise effects. Considering weak-lensing cluster detections,\nalthough the MRLens treatment effectively deletes false peaks arising from\nnoise, it removes the real peaks heavily due to its inability to distinguish\nreal signals with relatively low amplitudes from noise in its restoration\nprocess. The higher the noise level is, the larger the removal effects are for\nthe real peaks. For a survey with a source density n_g~30 arcmin^(2), the\nnumber of peaks found in an area of 3x3 sq.deg after MRLens filtering is only\n~50 for the detection threshold kappa=0.02, while the number of halos with\nM>5x10^{13} M_{\\odot} and with redshift z<=2 in the same area is expected to be\n~530. For the Gaussian smoothing treatment, the number of detections is ~260,\nmuch larger than that of the MRLens. The Gaussianity of the noise statistics in\nthe Gaussian smoothing case adds further advantages for this method to\ncircumvent the problem of the relatively low efficiency in weak-lensing cluster\ndetections. Therefore, in studies aiming to construct large cluster samples\nfrom weak-lensing surveys, the Gaussian smoothing method performs significantly\nbetter than the MRLens. \n\n"}

Assuming the jet efficiency depends on\nspin a, we can approximately reproduce the observed `radio loudness' of quasars\nand the local radio luminosity function. Using the X-ray luminosity function\nand the local mass function of supermassive black holes, SMBHs we can reproduce\nthe individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and\nlow-excitation narrow emission lines. The data favour spin distributions that\nare bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximal\nspin. In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar\namplitudes. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin\npeak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak. A bimodality\nshould be seen in the radio loudness of quasars. We predict that the\nlow-excitation galaxies are dominated by SMBHs with masses >~10^8 Msol, down to\nradio luminosity densities ~10^21 W Hz-1 sr-1 at 1.4~GHz. Our model is also\nable to predict the radio luminosity function at z=1, and predicts it to be\ndominated by high-excitation galaxies above luminosity densities >~10^26 W Hz-1\nsr-1, in full agreement with the observations.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars.

In order to do so we improve an analytic description of relativistic\nradiation mediated shocks and follow the system from the breakout itself,\nthrough the planar phase and into the spherical phase. We limit our calculation\nto cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planar\nphase. (i.e., the final gas Lorentz factor <~30). We find that spherical\nrelativistic breakouts produce a flash of gamma-rays with energy, temperature,\nand duration that always satisfy a specific relation between them as well as\nproviding the breakout radius and Lorentz factor. The breakout flare is\ntypically followed, on longer time scales, by X-rays that carry a comparable\nenergy.

This work investigates the origin of\nthe observed temperatures, by examining the relationship between them and the\ngalaxy structure, the gas heating due to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa's) and the\ngravitational potential, and the dynamical status of the gas flow. In galaxies\nwith sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for\nthe gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower\nthan this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow\nstatus; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for\ninfall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be\ndominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest\ngalaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower\nthan in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by\nSNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value\nat the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce\ntemperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The\nvalues of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is\nrelatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial\ntemperature.

The\nhydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,\nfocusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,\nusing the code \\textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a\nclumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual\nclumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter\ninto the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their\nsize divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump.

We conclude that moderate wind\nclumpiness makes already a strong difference with the homogeneous wind case,\nenhancing jet disruption, mass-loading, bending, and likely energy dissipation\nin the form of emission.

As such, it is becoming\nincreasingly important to rapidly identify bursts of interest as soon as\npossible after the event, before the afterglows fade beyond detectability.\nStudying the most distant (highest redshift) events, for instance, remains a\nprimary goal for many in the field. Here we present our Random forest Automated\nTriage Estimator for GRB redshifts (RATE GRB-z) for rapid identification of\nhigh-redshift candidates using early-time metrics from the three telescopes\nonboard Swift.

For a jet with an ultrarelativistic equation of state\nand external pressure that decreases as a power of spherical radius, p \\propto\nr^(-eta), the jet interior will lose causal contact when eta > 2. However, the\nouter layers of the jet gradually collimate toward the jet axis as long as eta\n< 4, leading to the formation of a shocked boundary layer. Assuming that\npressure-matching across the shock front determines the shape of the shock, we\nstudy the resulting structure of the jet in two ways: first by assuming that\nthe pressure remains constant across the shocked boundary layer and looking for\nsolutions to the shock jump equations, and then by constructing self-similar\nboundary-layer solutions that allow for a pressure gradient across the shocked\nlayer. We demonstrate that the constant-pressure solutions can be characterized\nby four initial parameters that determine the jet shape and whether the shock\ncloses to the axis. We show that self-similar solutions for the boundary layer\ncan be constructed that exhibit a monotonic decrease in pressure across the\nboundary layer from the contact discontinuity to the shock front, and that the\naddition of this pressure gradient in our initial model generally causes the\nshock front to move outwards, creating a thinner boundary layer and decreasing\nthe tendency of the shock to close.

I argue that gamma rays are the source of ionization in the deepest\nmolecular clouds of dense starbursts, creating Gamma-Ray Dominated Regions\n(GRDRs). Gamma rays are not deflected by magnetic fields, have a luminosity up\nto ~1/3 that of the injected cosmic rays, and can easily penetrate column\ndepths of ~100 g/cm^2 before being attenuated by gamma-Z pair production. The\nionization rates of GRDRs, <~10^-16 s^-1, are much smaller than in cosmic ray\ndominated regions, but in the most extreme starbursts, they may still reach\nvalues comparable to those in Milky Way molecular clouds.

The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2).

However, the median\nmetallicity of the 7 broad-lined SN Ic (SN Ic-BL) in our sample is\nsignificantly lower, log(O/H)+12 = 8.34.

Two models have been proposed to explain this\nresult. In the ADIOS model, the inward decrease of accretion rate is because of\nthe loss of gas in the outflow. In the CDAF model, the gas is assumed to be\nlocked in convective eddies, which results in the inward decrease of the\naccretion rate. We investigate the nature of inward decrease of accretion rate\nusing HD and MHD simulations. We calculate various properties of inflow and\noutflow, including the mass flux, radial and rotational velocities,\ntemperature, and the Bernoulli parameter ($Be$). Systematic and significant\ndifferences between inflow and outflow are found. These results suggest that\nthe inflow and outflow are not dominated by convective turbulence, but are\nsystematic inward and outward motion. We have also analyzed the convective\nstability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are convectively stable.\nThese results indicate that the ADIOS scenario is favored. The different\nproperties of inflow and outflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing\noutflow in HD and MHD flows are buoyancy and centrifugal force associated with\nthe magnetic field, respectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the\nBlandford & Payne mechanism. We also study the effect of initial conditions in\nthe simulations.

Of particular importance is the\nstellar mass density at early times which represents the integral of earlier\nstar formation. An important puzzle arising from the measurements so far\nreported is that the specific star formation rates (sSFR) evolve far less\nrapidly than expected in most theoretical models. Yet the observations\nunderpinning these results remain very uncertain, owing in part to the possible\ncontamination of rest-optical broadband light from strong nebular emission\nlines. To quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broad-band fluxes,\nwe investigate the SEDs of 92 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the\nredshift range 3.8<z<5.0 chosen because the H-alpha line lies within the\nSpitzer/IRAC 3.6 um filter. We demonstrate that the 3.6 um flux is\nsystematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum, which we\nderive by fitting the SED with population synthesis models. No such excess is\nseen in a control sample at 3.1<z<3.6 in which there is no nebular\ncontamination in the IRAC filters. From the distribution of our 3.6 um flux\nexcesses, we derive an H-alpha equivalent width (EW) distribution. The mean\nrest-frame H-alpha EW we infer at 3.8<z<5.0 (270 A) indicates that nebular\nemission contributes at least 30% of the 3.6 um flux.

The central\ntheme of the overview is to explore the implications of the recent discovery of\na Higgs like particle regarding the prospects for the discovery of\nsupersymmetry assuming that it is indeed the spin 0 CP even boson that enters\nin the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. The high mass of the\nHiggs like boson at $\\sim 125$ GeV points to the weak scale of supersymmetry\nthat enters in the loop correction to the Higgs boson mass, to be relatively\nhigh, i.e., in the TeV region. However, since more than one independent mass\nscales enter in softly broken supersymmetry, the allowed parameter space of\nsupersymmetric models can allow a small Higgs mixing parameter $\\mu$ and light\ngaugino masses consistent with a $\\sim 125$ GeV Higgs boson mass.

Another\npossibility is a stellar-mass black hole in a high-mass X-ray binary accreting\nat super-Eddington rates. In this paper we find a highly significant\nassociation between brightest X-ray sources in the Antennae galaxies and\nstellar clusters. On the other hand, we show that most of the X-ray sources are\nlocated outside of these clusters. We study clusters associated with the ULXs\nusing the ESO Very Large Telescope spectra and the Hubble Space Telescope data\ntogether with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and determine their ages to\nbe below 6 Myr.

If this\nscenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of\nstrong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,\nVirgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search.

In\nanticipation of a future balloon experiment, an accelerator test was conducted\nin 2004 and 2005 at KEK, Japan, in order to prove the concept and to precisely\nmeasure the X-ray yields of antiprotonic exotic atoms formed with different\ntarget materials [1]. The X-ray yields of the exotic atoms with Al and S\ntargets were obtained as ~ 75%, which are higher than were previously assumed\nin [2]. A simple, but comprehensive cascade model has been developed not only\nto evaluate the measurement results but also to predict the X-ray yields of the\nexotic atoms formed with any materials in the GAPS instrument.

It is argued that the recently\nobserved broadening of the radio spectra and/or light curves in some of the\ntype Ib/c supernovae is a direct indication of inhomogeneities. As compared to\na homogeneous source, this increases the deduced velocity of the forward shock\nand the observed correlation between total energy and shock velocity could in\npart be due to a varying covering factor.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that this classification has\nuncovered a new scaling law in the light curves of LGRBs II spanning 8 orders\nof magnitude from the prompt to late X-ray afterglow emission.

Collisions between these clumps reduce their angular\nmomentum, and as a result some of the clumps are set on a plunging trajectory.\nConstraints can be imposed on the nature of past accretion events based on the\ncurrently observed X-ray reflection from the molecular clouds. We discuss\naccretion of clouds in the context of enhanced activity of Sgr A* during the\npast few hundred years. We put forward a scenario according to which gas clouds\nbring material close to the horizon of the black hole on <~0.1 parsec scale. We\nhave modelled the source intrinsic luminosity assuming that multiple events\noccur at various moments in time. These events are characterized by the amount\nof accreted material and the distribution of angular momentum. We parameterized\nthe activity in the form of a sequence of discrete events, followed the viscous\nevolution, and calculated the luminosity of the system from the time-dependent\naccretion rate across the inner boundary. Accreting clumps settle near a\ncircularization radius, spread there during the viscous time, and subsequently\nfeed the black hole over a certain period. A significant enhancement (by factor\nof ten) of the luminosity is only expected if the viscous timescale of the\ninflow is very short. On the other hand, the increase in source activity is\nexpected to be much less prominent if the latter timescale is longer and a\nconsiderable fraction of the material does not reach the centre. A solution is\nobtained under two additional assumptions: (i) the radiative efficiency is a\ndecreasing function of the Eddington ratio; (ii) the viscous decay of the\nluminosity proceeds somewhat faster than the canonical L(t)~t^{-5/3} profile.\nWe applied our scheme to the case of G2 cloud in the Galactic centre to obtain\nconstraints on the core-less gaseous cloud model. \n\n"}

Such a remnant has been proposed as an\nexplanation for the late X-ray emission observed following some short duration\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as possible electromagnetic counterparts to the\ngravitational wave chirp. A stable NS merger remnant necessarily possesses a\nlarge rotational energy > 1e52 erg, the majority of which is ultimately\ndeposited into the surrounding circumburst medium (CBM) at mildly relativistic\nvelocities. We present Very Large Array radio observations of 7 short GRBs,\nsome of which possessed temporally extended X-ray emission, on timescales of\n~1-3 years following the initial burst. No radio sources were detected, with\ntypical upper limits ~0.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz.

High-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks is\nlimited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress\nthose speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction\nof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. This signal\nattenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk's\nsurface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physical\nprocesses responsible for the dust distribution. To compensate for this\nattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the\nself-subtraction function at each separation. As a proof of concept, we apply\nour method to 1.6 and 2.2 micron Keck AO NIRC2 scattered-light observations of\nthe HD 32297 debris disk reduced using a variant of the \"locally optimized\ncombination of images\" (LOCI) algorithm.

The source exhibits remarkable spectral\nvariability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability\nis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber\ntowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. The column density is generally\nCompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times\n10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.

We derive the CR acceleration efficiency in the SNR RCW 86 from the\nBalmer emission.

This pressure is essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy parameters $S_v$ and $L$, the first two coefficients of a Taylor\nexpansion of the symmetry energy around $n_s$.

Typically, in such situations, the scalar power spectrum\nexhibits a burst of features associated with modes that leave the Hubble radius\neither immediately before or during the epoch of fast roll. Moreover, one also\nfinds that the power spectrum turns scale invariant at smaller scales\ncorresponding to modes that leave the Hubble radius at later stages, when slow\nroll has been restored. In other words, the imprints of brief departures from\nslow roll, arising out of sharp shapes in the inflaton potential, are usually\nof a finite width in the scalar power spectrum. Intuitively, one may imagine\nthat the scalar bi-spectrum too may exhibit a similar behavior, i.e. a\nrestoration of scale invariance at small scales, when slow roll has been\nreestablished. However, in the case of the Starobinsky model (viz. the model\ndescribed by a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in its slope)\ninvolving the canonical scalar field, it has been found that, a rather sharp,\nthough short, departure from slow roll can leave a lasting and significant\nimprint on the bi-spectrum.

As a first improvement, we explore a gradient prescription\nthat requires the (analytical) inversion of a small matrix. For a regular\nparticle distribution this improves gradient accuracies by approximately ten\norders of magnitude and the SPH formulations with this gradient outperform the\nstandard approach in all benchmark tests. Second, we demonstrate that a simple\nchange of the kernel function can substantially increase the accuracy of an SPH\nscheme. While the \"standard\" cubic spline kernel generally performs poorly, the\nbest overall performance is found for a high-order Wendland kernel which allows\nfor only very little velocity noise and enforces a very regular particle\ndistribution, even in highly dynamical tests. Third, we explore new SPH volume\nelements that enhance the treatment of fluid instabilities and, last, but not\nleast, we design new dissipation triggers. They switch on near shocks and in\nregions where the flow --without dissipation-- starts to become noisy.

The most of radio-loud pulsars are detected by Fermi LAT\nby using the radio timing models, while the radio-quiet ones are discovered in\na blind search. The difference in the techniques introduces an observational\nselection bias and, consequently, the direct comparison of populations is\ncomplicated. In order to produce an unbiased sample, we perform a blind search\nof gamma-ray pulsations using Fermi-LAT data alone. No radio data or\nobservations at optical or X-ray frequencies are involved in the search\nprocess. We produce a gamma-ray selected catalog of 25 non-recycled gamma-ray\npulsars found in a blind search, including 16 radio-quiet and 9 radio-loud\npulsars. This results in the direct measurement of the fraction of radio-quiet\npulsars $\\varepsilon_{RQ} = 64\\pm 10\\%$, which is in agreement with the\nexisting estimates from the population modeling in the outer magnetosphere\nmodel.

Particularly, photons below the Lyman limit can escape the\nstar forming regions and produce a background ultraviolet (UV) flux which\nconsequently may influence the pristine halos far away from the radiation\nsources. These photons can quench the formation of molecular hydrogen by\nphoto-detachment of $\\rm H^{-}$. In this study, we explore the impact of such\nUV radiation on fragmentation in massive primordial halos of a few times $\\rm\n10^{7}$~M${_\\odot}$. To accomplish this goal, we perform high resolution\ncosmological simulations for two distinct halos and vary the strength of the\nimpinging background UV field in units of $\\rm J_{21}$. We further make use of\nsink particles to follow the evolution for 10,000 years after reaching the\nmaximum refinement level. No vigorous fragmentation is observed in UV\nilluminated halos while the accretion rate changes according to the thermal\nproperties.

The\nprobability of finding a high pairwise velocity pair among haloes with $M_{\\rm\nhalo}\\geq10^{14} M_{\\odot}$ is $4.6\\times 10^{-4}$ using ROCKSTAR, while it is\n$\\approx 34\\times$ lower using a friends-of-friends (FOF) based approach as in\nprevious studies.

As an initial example of such a study,\nthe recipe in (Green & Wald, 2012) for going between N-body results and a\nperturbed FLRW metric in the Newtonian gauge is used to study light propagation\nthrough quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The study is conducted by deriving a\nset of ODEs giving an expression for the angular diameter distance in the\nNewtonian gauge metric. The accuracy of the results obtained from the ODEs is\nestimated by using the ODEs to determine the distance-redshift relation in mock\nN-body data based on quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The results are then\ncompared to the exact relations. From this comparison it is seen that the\nobtained ODEs can accurately reproduce the distance-redshift relation along\nboth radial and non-radial geodesics in spherically symmetric models. The\nreproduction of geodesics in non-symmetric Szekeres models is slightly less\naccurate, but still good.

Recent 3D simulations suggest that\nturbulence might play a crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions,\nhowever the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these studies is\nunclear. Especially considering that the accuracy of ILES for the regime of\ninterest in CCSN, weakly compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been\nsystematically assessed before.

We report a detailed analysis of the way in which the\nturbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our results suggest that\nanisotropy and compressibility in CCSN turbulence have little effect on the\nturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ scaling is\nobtained in the inertial range.

The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations.

In this paper, we present a case study on the pulse profile\nvariability of PSR J1022+1001. We have detected approximately 14,000 sub-pulses\n(components of single pulses) in 35-hr long observations, mostly located at the\ntrailing component of the integrated profile. Their flux densities and\nfractional polarisation suggest that they represent the bright end of the\nenergy distribution in ordinary emission mode and are not giant pulses. The\noccurrence of sub-pulses from the leading and trailing components of the\nintegrated profile is shown to be correlated. For sub-pulses from the latter, a\npreferred pulse width of approximately 0.25 ms has been found. Using\nsimultaneous observations from the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, we have found that the integrated profile\nvaries on a timescale of a few tens of minutes. We show that improper\npolarisation calibration and diffractive scintillation cannot be the sole\nreason for the observed instability.

We study such alignment processes by explicitly taking into account the\nfinite sizes of accretion disks and the episodic lifetimes of AGNs that\ndelineate the duration of gas fueling onto accretion disks. We employ an\napproximate global model to simulate the evolution of accretion disks, allowing\nto determine the gravitomagnetic torque that drives the alignments in a quite\nsimple way. We then track down the evolutionary paths for mass and spin of\nblack holes both in a single activity episode and over a series of episodes.\nGiven with randomly and isotropically oriented gas fueling over episodes, we\ncalculate the spin evolution with different episodic lifetimes and find that it\nis quite sensitive to the lifetimes. We therefore propose that spin\ndistribution of SMBHs can place constraints on the episodic lifetimes of AGNs\nand vice versa. Applications of our results on the observed spin distributions\nof SMBHs and the observed episodic lifetimes of AGNs are discussed, although\nboth the measurements at present are yet ambiguous to draw a firm conclusion.\nOur prescription can be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models for black\nhole growth and spin evolution. \n\n"}

The galaxy inclination angle (i=63 degree) and the azimuthal angle (Phi=73\ndegree) imply that the QSO sightline is passing through the projected\nminor-axis of the galaxy. The absorption system shows a multiphase,\nmulticomponent structure with ultra-strong, wide velocity spread OVI (logN =\n15.16\\pm0.04, V_{90} = 419 km/s) and NV (logN = 14.69\\pm0.07, V_{90} = 285\nkm/s) lines that are extremely rare in the literature. The highly ionized\nabsorption components are well explained as arising in a low density (10^{-4.2}\ncm^{-3}), diffuse (10 kpc), cool (10^4 K) photoionized gas with a super-solar\nmetallicity ([X/H] > 0.3). From the observed narrowness of the Lyb profile, the\nnon-detection of SIV absorption, and the presence of strong CIV absorption we\nrule out equilibrium/non-equilibrium collisional ionization models. The\nlow-ionization photoionized gas with a density of 10^{-2.5} cm^{-3} and a\nmetallicity of [X/H] > -1.4 is possibly tracing recycled halo gas.

It has never been clear how they fit into the\ngeneral scheme of accreting compact objects. To address this problem, we\nstudied a sample of seven ULSs with extensive Chandra and XMM-Newton coverage.\nWe find an anticorrelation between fitted temperatures and radii of the thermal\nemitter, and no correlation between bolometric luminosity and radius or\ntemperature. We compare the physical parameters of ULSs with those of classical\nsupersoft sources, thought to be surface-nuclear-burning white dwarfs, and of\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), thought to be super-Eddington stellar-mass\nblack holes. We argue that ULSs are the sub-class of ULXs seen through the\ndensest wind, perhaps an extension of the soft-ultraluminous regime. We suggest\nthat in ULSs, the massive disk outflow becomes effectively optically thick and\nforms a large photosphere, shrouding the inner regions from our view. Our model\npredicts that when the photosphere expands to >10,000 km and the temperature\ndecreases below approximately 50 eV, ULSs become brighter in the far-UV but\nundetectable in X-rays. Conversely, we find that harder emission components\nbegin to appear in ULSs when the fitted size of the thermal emitter is smallest\n(interpreted as a shrinking of the photosphere). The observed short-term\nvariability and absorption edges are also consistent with clumpy outflows. We\nsuggest that the transition between ULXs (with a harder tail) and ULSs (with\nonly a soft thermal component) occurs at blackbody temperatures of\napproximately 150 eV. \n\n"}

It has also been proposed that the astrophysical\nneutrino signal comes from accelerators capable of producing cosmic rays of\nthese energies. Cosmic rays initiate cascades of secondary particles (air\nshowers) in the atmosphere and their masses are inferred from measurements of\nthe atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, or the composition of shower\nparticles reaching the ground.

Later works by other authors\nare also discussed, where similar diagrams were plotted using a larger\nobservational material.\n  Special attention is paid to the evolution of Shklovsky's views regarding the\npossible ways of gas getting into radio galaxies' central regions, followed by\nhigh-velocity ejections of magnetized plasmons from their nuclei. In his\nassumptions, Shklovsky was mainly based on the observational data for the\nproperties of the closest radio galaxy, NGC 4486 (Virgo A, M87), which he\nbelieved to be the same reference standard for extragalactic radio astronomy as\nthe Crab Nebula for galactic radio astronomy.\n  Shklovsky's approach to the recurrence of the activity phenomenon in galactic\nnuclei and the one-sided character of radio ejections from them is discussed.\n  Modern views on these issues are also briefly considered. \n\n"}

High-resolution simulations exhibit a tendency towards\nstatistical self-organization of MRI dynamo turbulence into large-scale cyclic\ndynamics. Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether\nthey can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in\nastrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The\ndiscovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven\nuseful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of\nturbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a\ncommon regime in accretion disks.

In particular, the LIGO detectors are most sensitive to\nsources above North America and the Indian Ocean and, as the Earth rotates, the\nsensitive regions are swept across the sky. However, because the detectors do\nnot acquire data uniformly over time, there is a net bias on detectable\nsources' right ascensions. Both LIGO detectors preferentially collect data\nduring their local night; it is more than twice as likely to be local midnight\nthan noon when both detectors are operating. We discuss these selection effects\nand how they impact LIGO's observations and electromagnetic follow-up. Beyond\ngalactic foregrounds associated with seasonal variations, we find that\nequatorial observatories can access over $80\\%$ of the localization\nprobability, while mid-latitudes will access closer to $70\\%$.

Between 2007 and 2015 it was the prime provider of\ncomplementary multi-frequency monitoring in the radio regime. We quantify the\nradio variability of gamma-ray blazars. We investigate its dependence on source\nclass and examine whether the radio variability is related to the gamma-ray\nloudness. Finally, we assess the validity of a putative correlation between the\ntwo bands. The F-GAMMA monitored monthly a sample of about 60 sources at up to\ntwelve radio frequencies between 2.64 and 228.39 GHz. We perform a time series\nanalysis on the first 2.5-year dataset to obtain variability parameters. A\nmaximum likelihood analysis is used to assess the significance of a correlation\nbetween radio and gamma-ray fluxes. We present light curves and spectra\n(coherent within ten days) obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m and IRAM 30-m\ntelescopes. All sources are variable across all frequency bands with amplitudes\nincreasing with frequency up to rest frame frequencies of around 60 - 80 GHz as\nexpected by shock-in-jet models. Compared to FSRQs, BL Lacs show systematically\nlower variability amplitudes, brightness temperatures and Doppler factors at\nlower frequencies, while the difference vanishes towards higher ones.

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We\ndemonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy\ndepositions during the cosmic \"dark ages\". Interestingly, structure formation\nconstraints force us to consider small mass splittings between the two dark\nmatter species.

To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the\nmajor axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,\nleading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal. In order to relate that\nto a halo ellipticity, we have to adopt a model density profile. We derive new\nexpressions for the quadrupole moments of the shear field given an elliptical\nmodel surface mass density profile. Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12.

The presence of\nthese bound states enhances the annihilation rate via resonances in the\nSommerfeld enhancement, but they can also be produced directly with the\nemission of a low-energy photon. In this work we compute the rate for SU(2)\ntriplet dark matter (the wino) to bind into WIMPonium -- which is possible via\nsingle-photon emission for wino masses above 5 TeV for relative velocity v <\nO(10^{-2}) -- and study the subsequent decays of these bound states. We present\nresults with applications beyond the wino case, e.g. for dark matter inhabiting\na nonabelian dark sector; these include analytic capture and transition rates\nfor general dark sectors in the limit of vanishing force carrier mass,\nefficient numerical routines for calculating positive and negative-energy\neigenstates of a Hamiltonian containing interactions with both massive and\nmassless force carriers, and a study of the scaling of bound state formation in\nthe short-range Hulthen potential.

The early high-energy\nsynchrotron afterglow flux depends strongly on Gamma_0. Upper limits on GeV\nemission therefore provide uppers limit on Gamma_0.

We then examine the\ncorrelations of the PAH properties (i.e., sizes and ionization fractions) with\nthe stellar properties (e.g., stellar effective temperature, luminosity, and\nmass). We find that the characteristic size of PAHs shows a tendency of\ncorrelating with the stellar effective temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$) and\ninterpret this as the preferential photodissociation of small PAHs in systems\nwith higher $T_{\\rm eff}$ of which the stellar photons are more energetic.

This is because the charging of PAHs\ndepends on not only the stellar properties (e.g., $T_{\\rm eff}$, luminosity)\nbut also the spatial distribution of PAHs in the disks. The mere negative\ncorrelation between the PAH size and the stellar age suggests that continuous\nreplenishment of PAHs via the outgassing of cometary bodies and/or the\ncollisional grinding of planetesimals and asteroids is required to maintain the\nabundance of small PAHs against complete destruction by photodissociation. \n\n"}

To answer this question, we run\nMonte-Carlo radiative transfer simulations to estimate the amount of X-ray flux\nreprocessed by HD189733b.

ESO 243-49 HLX-1, otherwise known as HLX-1, is an intermediate mass\nblack hole (IMBH) candidate located 8\" (3.7 Kpc) from the centre of the edge-on\nS0 galaxy ESO 243-49. How the black hole came to be associated with this\ngalaxy, and the nature of the environment in which it resides, are still\nunclear. Using multi-wavelength observations we investigate the nature of the\nmedium surrounding HLX-1, search for evidence of past mergers with ESO 243-49\nand constrain parameters of the galaxy. Methods. We reduce and analyse integral\nfield unit observations of ESO 243-49 that were taken with the MUSE instrument\non the VLT. Using complementary multi-wavelength data, including X-Shooter,\nHST, Swift, Chandra and ATCA data, we further examine the vicinity of HLX-1. We\nadditionally examine the nature of the host galaxy and estimate the mass of the\ncentral supermassive black hole (SMBH) in ESO 243-49. Results. No evidence for\na recent minor-merger that could result in the presence of the IMBH is\ndiscerned, but the data are compatible with a scenario in which minor mergers\nmay have occurred in the history of ESO 243-49. The MUSE data reveal a rapidly\nrotating disc in the centre of the galaxy, around the SMBH. The mass of the\nSMBH at the centre of ESO 243-49 is estimated to be 0.5-23 $\\times$ 10$^7$\nM$_\\odot$.

The light curve is unique in that it has a blue bump during\nthe first five days of observations in the U, B, and g bands, which is clearly\nresolved given our photometric cadence of 5.7 hr during that time span. We\nmodel the light curve as the combination of early shocking of the supernova\nejecta against a nondegenerate companion star plus a standard SN Ia component.\nOur best-fit model suggests the presence of a subgiant star 56 solar radii from\nthe exploding white dwarf, although this number is highly model-dependent.\nWhile this model matches the optical light curve well, it overpredicts the\nobserved flux in the ultraviolet bands. This may indicate that the shock is not\na blackbody, perhaps because of line blanketing in the UV. Alternatively, it\ncould point to another physical explanation for the optical blue bump, such as\ninteraction with circumstellar material or an unusual nickel distribution.\nEarly optical spectra of SN 2017cbv show strong carbon absorption up through\nday -13 with respect to maximum light, suggesting that the progenitor system\ncontains a significant amount of unburned material. These early results on SN\n2017cbv illustrate the power of early discovery and intense follow-up of nearby\nsupernovae to resolve standing questions about the progenitor systems and\nexplosion mechanisms of SNe Ia. \n\n"}

Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure. That polarization encodes information about the shape,\ncomposition, opacity, density, and ionisation state of the material within the\nstructure.

Discovered in the Reionization Lensing\nCluster Survey (RELICS) Hubble Treasury program and companion S-RELICS Spitzer\nprogram, this candidate has a lensed H-band magnitude of 25.7+/-0.1 AB mag.\nWith a magnification of \\mu~4-7 estimated from our lens models, the de-lensed\nintrinsic magnitude is 27.6+/-0.3 AB mag, and the half-light radius is r_e<0.8\nkpc, both consistent with other z>9 candidates. The inferred stellar mass (log\n[M* /M_Sun]=9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.5}) and star formation rate (\\log [SFR/M_Sun\nyr^{-1}]=1.3^{+0.2}_{-0.3}) indicate that this candidate is a typical\nstar-forming galaxy on the z>6 SFR-M* relation. We note that three independent\nlens models predict two counterimages, at least one of which should be of a\nsimilar magnitude to the arc, but these counterimages are not yet detected.\nCounterimages would not be expected if the arc were at lower redshift. However,\nthe only spectral energy distributions capable of fitting the Hubble and\nSpitzer photometry well at lower redshifts require unphysical combinations of\nz~2 galaxy properties. The unprecedented lensed size of this z~10 candidate\noffers the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope to study the geometric\nand kinematic properties of a galaxy observed 500 Myr after the Big Bang. \n\n"}

As the rate\nof astrophysical sources increases, the probability that a signal will occur at\nthe same time as a glitch also increases. This has occurred previously in the\ngravitational wave binary neutron star detection GW170817.

We propose\nthat the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by\nthe time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic\nfield lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may\nhave their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the\nmagneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized\nby an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it\nis a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form\nbetween the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers\nfurther jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of\nstripe widths $l>l_{\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\rm min}$. We find\nthat the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the\nstripes, is very gradual. The dissipation rate peaks at a distance $z_{\\rm\npeak}\\sim 10^6 R_g\\, (\\Gamma_\\infty/30)^2\\, (l_{\\rm min}/1000R_g)$, where\n$R_{g}$ is the black-hole's gravititional radius and $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ the\njet's asymptotic Lorentz factor, and exhibits a very broad plateau extending by\n$\\sim 4-5$ orders of magnitude in distance.

The\ndistribution of the radio signal on the ground contains information on crucial\ncosmic-ray properties, such as energy and mass.

The newly\nintroduced fields share an odd charge under a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry.\nThis model, commonly known as \"Scotogenic\", was designed to provide a mechanism\nfor active neutrino mass generation as well as a viable dark matter candidate.\nIn this paper we consider a scenario in which the dark matter particle is at\nthe keV-scale. Such particle is free from X-ray limits due to the unbroken\nparity symmetry that forbids the mixing between active and right-handed\nneutrinos. The active neutrino masses are radiatively generated from the new\nscalars and the two heavier right-handed states with $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(100)$\nGeV masses. These heavy fermions can produce the observed baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe through the combination of Akhmedov-Rubakov-Smirnov mechanism and\nrecently proposed scalar decays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time that these two mechanisms are shown to be successful in any\nradiative model. We identify the parameter space where the successful\nleptogenesis is compatible with the observed abundance of dark matter as well\nas the measurements from the neutrino oscillation experiments.

The key to numerically solving the GS equation is to enable\nmagnetic field lines smoothly cross the LS, and crossing a straight LS in flat\nspacetime has been a well-studied problem. But the numerical algorithm\nimplementation becomes complicate in the presence of a bent LS, e.g. in curved\nspacetime, since there is no suitable computation grid adapted to it.

In this paper, we calculate the latter in the inspiral of a\nnon-spinning compact binary system within Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory. From the\ntheory's gravitational wave stress energy tensor and a balance law, we compute\nthe angular momentum decay both as a function of the fields in the theory and\nas a function of the multipole moments of the binary.

In\nthe optical microvariability studies of the blazars S5 0716+714 and BL Lac, we\nobserved many interesting features such as rapid variability, large variability\namplitude, presence of characteristic timescales, bluer-when-brighter\nachromatic behavior, and single power-law power spectral density. In {\\it\nNuSTAR} observations of several blazars, using spectral and timing analysis, we\nfound similar features consistent with the optical studies. In addition, in BL\nLacs we estimated the Lorentz factor of the population of highest energy\nelectrons emitting synchrotron emission, and whereas in flat-spectrum radio\nquasars, using external Compton models, we estimated the energy of the lower\nend of the injected electrons to be a few tens of Lorentz factors. In addition,\nwe find that the low flux state exhibit more rapid variability in contrast to\nthe previously reported results showing high flux states displaying rapid\nvariability. In both the studies, the size of the emission regions estimated\nusing variability timescales turn out to be an order magnitude smaller than the\ngravitational radius of a typical black-hole masses between $\\sim 10^8-10^9$\nsolar masses, believed to be at the center of the radio-loud AGN.

Our approach follows the idea put forth by Pal (2012) to apply Green's\nTheorem on the limb darkening integral, thus transforming the two-dimensional\nflux integral over the visible disk into a one-dimensional integral over the\nvisible boundary. We implement this idea through an iterative process which\ncombines a fast method for describing the visible boundary of each body with a\nfast numerical integration scheme to compute the integrals.

An important side-effect of the particle\nvelocities is the severe decrease in the number of collapsed halos at high\nredshift. This is caused both by the loss of small-scale power, and by the\ndelay in the collapse of the smallest individual halos (with masses near the\neffective Jeans mass of the DM).

In this article, I review the cluster of independent\ntheoretical studies of this issue, as well as the current observational status.\nTheoretically, the calculation of intrinsic alignments is by no means\nstraightforward, but some consensus has emerged from the existing works,\ndespite each making very different assumptions. This consensus is that a)\nintrinsic alignments are a small but non-negligible (< 10%) contaminant of the\nlensing ellipticity correlation function, for samples with a median redshift z\n= 1; b) intrinsic alignments dominate the signal for low-redshift samples (z =\n0.1), as expected in the SuperCOSMOS lensing survey and the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey \n\n"}

The treatment is based on\na precedent Newtonian analytic energy variational method which we have extended\nto the Post-Newtonian case. This method, based upon Landau's theory of\nsecond-order phase transitions, provides the critical value of the ellipsoid\npolar eccentricity e at the onset of viscosity-driven instability and it is\nvalid for any equation of state. The extension of this method to Post-Newtonian\nfluid configurations has been accomplished by combining two earlier orthogonal\nworks, specialized respectively to slow rotating configurations but with\narbitrary density profile and to constant mass density but arbitrarily fast\nrotating ellipsoids. We also determine the explicit expressions for the density\nfunctionals which allow the generalization of the physical quantities involved\nin our treatment from the constant mass density to an arbitrary density profile\nform.

Comparing with the derived jet power, we\nfind that the accretion disks in most BL Lac objects should not be standard\naccretion disks. For a pure advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF), there is\nan upper limit on its optical continuum luminosity due to the existence of an\nupper limit $\\dot{m}_{\\rm crit}$ on the accretion rate. It is found that a pure\nADAF is too faint to produce the optical ionizing luminosity of BL Lac objects\nderived from their narrow-line luminosity. We propose that an ADAF is present\nin the inner region of the disk and it becomes a standard thin disk in the\nouter region in most BL Lac objects, i.e., ADAF+SD(standard disk) scenario.\nThis ADAF+SD scenario can explain both the jet power and optical ionizing\ncontinuum emission of these BL Lac objects. The inferred transition radii\nbetween the inner ADAF and outer SD are in the range of $40-150 GM_{bh}/c^2$,\nif the disks are accreting at the rate $\\dot{m}=0.01$. \n\n"}

Using a\nrigorous statistical method, we present the calculations reported by Burgay et\nal., which produce a in-spiral rate for Galactic double neutron star (DNS)\nsystems that is higher by a factor of 5-7 compared to estimates made prior to\nthe new discovery. Our method takes into account known pulsar-survey selection\neffects and biases due to small-number statistics. This rate increase has\ndramatic implications for gravitational wave detectors. For the initial Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, the most\nprobable detection rates for DNS in-spirals are one event per 10-630 yr; at 95%\nconfidence, we obtain rates up to one per 3 yr.

The pulse shape and pulsed\nfraction are apparently different at lower and higher energies of the observed\n0.2-10 keV energy range, which suggests that the radiation cannot be explained\nby a single emission mechanism. The X-ray spectrum of the pulsar can be fitted\nwith a power-law model with a photon index about 1.75 and an (isotropic)\nluminosity about 9.8e29 erg/s in the 0.2-10 keV. Better fits are obtained with\ntwo-component, power-law plus thermal, models with index of 1.30 and 9.7e29\nerg/s for the power-law component that presumably originates from the pulsar's\nmagnetosphere. The thermal component, dominating at E>0.7 keV, can be\ninterpreted as radiation from heated polar caps on the neutron star surface\ncovered with a hydrogen atmosphere. The inferred effective temperature, radius,\nand bolometric luminosity of the polar caps are about 1 MK, 250 m, and 3e29\nerg/s. Optical through X-ray nonthermal spectrum of the pulsar can be described\nas a single power-law with index 1.3-1.4 for the two-component X-ray fit.

Our automated source detection yielded 535 good X-ray\nsources; to date, we have studied 225 of them. In particular, we examined the\nPDS because low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) exhibit two distinctive types of\nPDS. At low accretion rates, the PDS is characterised by a broken power law,\nwith the spectral index changing from ~0 to ~1 at some frequency in the range\n\\~0.01--1 Hz; we refer to such PDS as Type A. At higher accretion rates, the\nPDS is described by a simple power law; we call these PDS Type B.

We find that AGNs form two distinct and\nwell separated sequences on the radio-loudness -- Eddington-ratio plane. The\n`upper' sequence is formed by radio selected AGNs, the `lower' sequence\ncontains mainly optically selected objects. Whereas an apparent `gap' between\nthe two sequences may be an artifact of selection effects, the sequences\nthemselves mark the real upper bounds of radio-loudness of two distinct\npopulations of AGNs: those hosted respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies.\nBoth sequences show the same dependence of the radio-loudness on the Eddington\nratio (an increase with decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests that the\nnormalization of this dependence is determined by the black hole spin. This\nimplies that central black holes in giant elliptical galaxies have (on average)\nmuch larger spins than black holes in spiral/disc galaxies.

With an (exact or effective)\nadditional contribution to the energy density scaling as 1/a^6, which dominates\nuntil just before nucleosynthesis, the observed baryon asymmetry may be\nproduced at the electroweak scale in simple extensions of the Minimal Standard\nModel, even in the case that the phase transition is not first order. We focus\nour attention on one such cosmology, in which the Universe goes through a\nperiod termed `kination' in which its energy is dominated by the kinetic energy\nof a scalar field. The required kinetic energy dominated modes can occur either\nas a field rolls down an exponential (or steeper) potential, or in the\noscillation of a field about the minimum of a steep power-law potential. We\nimplement in detail the former case with a single exponential field first\ndriving inflation, and then rolling into a kinetic energy dominated mode.\nReheating is achieved using an alternative to the usual mechanism due to\nSpokoiny, in which the Universe is `reheated' by particle creation in the\nexpanding background. Density perturbations of the magnitude required for\nstructure formation may also be generated. We show that the analogous model for\nthe power-law potential cannot be consistently implemented.

Abstract: It is intriguing to consider the possibility that the Big Bang of the\nstandard (3+1) dimensional cosmology originated from the collision of two\nbranes within a higher dimensional spacetime, leading to the production of a\nlarge amount of entropy. In this paper we study, subject to certain\nwell-defined assumptions, under what conditions such a collision leads to an\nexpanding universe. We assume the absence of novel physics, so that ordinary\n(4+1) -dimensional Einstein gravity remains a valid approximation. It is\nnecessary that the fifth dimension not become degenerate at the moment of\ncollision. First the case of a symmetric collision of infinitely thin branes\nhaving a hyperbolic or flat spatial geometry is considered. We find that a\nsymmetric collision results in a collapsing universe on the final brane unless\nthe pre-existing expansion rate in the bulk just prior to the collision is\nsufficiently large in comparison to the momentum transfer in the fifth\ndimension. Such prior expansion may either result from negative spatial\ncurvature or from a positive five-dimensional cosmological constant.
