The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors.

The measurement restricting the hadronic final state\nintroduces a new scale \\mu_B << Q and probes the proton prior to the hard\ncollision. This corresponds to evaluating the PDFs at the scale \\mu_B. After\nthe proton is probed, the incoming hard parton is contained in an initial-state\njet, and the hard collision occurs between partons inside these jets rather\nthan inside protons.

These data, together with previous\nmeasurements of the inclusive electron scattering off proton and deuteron,\nwhich cover a similar continuous two-dimensional region of Q2 and Bjorken\nvariable x, permit the study of nuclear modifications of the nucleon structure.\nBy using these, as well as other world data, we evaluated the F2 structure\nfunction and its moments. Using an OPE-based twist expansion, we studied the\nQ2-evolution of the moments, obtaining a separation of the leading-twist and\nthe total higher-twist terms. The carbon-to-deuteron ratio of the leading-twist\ncontributions to the F2 moments exhibits the well known EMC effect, compatible\nwith that discovered previously in x-space. The total higher-twist term in the\ncarbon nucleus appears, although with large systematic uncertainites, to be\nsmaller with respect to the deuteron case for n<7, suggesting partial parton\ndeconfinement in nuclear matter.

The dependences of the photon rates on the jet\nkinematic characteristics (momentum, mass, etc.) and on the jet charged,\nneutral and total hadron multiplicities are reported.

However, a molecular wave function must be essentially\nof a meson-meson type, viz. $D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ in this case, with no other\nsignificant components.

It is therefore of interest to see whether the precision can be\nimproved by means of additional theoretical information on the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor, which controls the leading order contribution.

While their chiral limit is\nwell understood, recent measurements of the gamma^* omega pi^0 and gamma^*\ngamma pi^0 form factors at high photon virtualities seem to depart from the\nsimplest scaling behavior suggested by QCD.

{"id": "1408.5536", "contents": "Title: Three-Dimensional Triplet Tracking for LHC and Future High Rate\n  Experiments Abstract: The hit combinatorial problem is a main challenge for track reconstruction\nand triggering at high rate experiments. At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points. With the advent of relatively cheap and\nindustrially available CMOS-sensors the construction of highly granular full\nscale pixel tracking detectors seems to be possible also for experiments at LHC\nor future high energy (hadron) colliders. In this paper tracking performance\nstudies for full-scale pixel detectors, including their optimisation for\n3D-triplet tracking, are presented.

The\npotential of reducing the number of tracking layers and -- along with that --\nthe material budget using this new tracking concept is discussed.

Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators.

This \"$Z^\\prime$-portal\nRHN DM\" scenario is controlled by only three free parameters: the U(1)$_X$\ngauge coupling ($\\alpha_X$), the $Z^\\prime$ boson mass ($m_{Z^\\prime}$), and\nthe U(1)$_X$ charge of the SM Higgs doublet ($x_H$). We consider various\nphenomenological constraints to identify a phenomenologically viable parameter\nspace. The most important constraints are the observed DM relic abundance and\nthe latest LHC Run-2 results on the search for a narrow resonance with the\ndi-lepton final state.

Several methods exist to\nremove this overlap, thus avoiding double counting and separating the two\nprocesses.

Abstract: This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the only supernova from which we\nhave detected neutrinos - SN 1987A. The twenty or so neutrinos that were\ndetected were mined to great depth in order to determine the events that\noccurred in the explosion and to place limits upon all manner of neutrino\nproperties. Since 1987 the scale and sensitivity of the detectors capable of\nidentifying neutrinos from a Galactic supernova have grown considerably so that\ncurrent generation detectors are capable of detecting of order ten thousand\nneutrinos for a supernova at the Galactic Center. Next generation detectors\nwill increase that yield by another order of magnitude. Simultaneous with the\ngrowth of neutrino detection capability, our understanding of how massive stars\nexplode and how the neutrino interacts with hot and dense matter has also\nincreased by a tremendous degree. The neutrino signal will contain much\ninformation on all manner of physics of interest to a wide community. In this\nreview we describe the expected features of the neutrino signal, the detectors\nwhich will detect it, and the signatures one might try to look for in order to\nget at these physics. \n\n"}

We discuss the impact of both the new force acting between the\nbinary partners as well as radiation of the force carrier. We identify numerous\nconstraints on any such scenario, ultimately concluding that observable effects\non the dynamics of binary inspirals due to such a force are not possible if the\ndark matter is accrued during ordinary stellar evolution. Constraints arise\nfrom the requirement that the astronomical body be able to collect and bind at\nsmall enough radius an adequate number of dark matter particles, from the\nrequirement that the particles thus collected remain bound to neutron stars in\nthe presence of another neutron star, and from the requirement that the theory\nallows old neutron stars to exist and retain their charge. Thus, we show that\nany deviation from the predictions of general relativity observed in binary\ninspirals must be due either to the material properties of the inspiraling\nobjects themselves, such as a tidal deformability, to a true fifth force\ncoupled to baryons, or to a non-standard production mechanism for the dark\nmatter cores of neutron stars. Viable scenarios of the latter type include\nproduction of dark matter in exotic neutron decays, or the formation of compact\ndark matter objects in the early Universe that later seed star formation or are\ncaptured by stars. \n\n"}

We calculate the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the overlap Dirac operator that preserves the exact chiral\nsymmetry in lattice gauge theory using these QCD vacua. We then investigate the\neffects of magnetic monopoles and instantons. First, we confirm the monopole\neffects as follows: (i) The monopole creation operator makes the monopoles and\nanti-monopoles in the QCD vacuum. (ii) A monopole and anti-monopole pair\ncreates an instanton or anti-instanton without changing the structure of the\nQCD vacuum. (iii) The monopole and anti-monopole pairs change only the scale of\nthe spectrum distribution without affecting the spectra of the Dirac operator\nby comparing the spectra with random matrix theory. Next, we find the instanton\neffects by increasing the number density of the instantons and anti-instantons\nas follows: (iv) The decay constants of the pseudoscalar increase. (v) The\nvalues of the chiral condensate, which are defined as negative numbers,\ndecrease. (vi) The light quarks and the pseudoscalar mesons become heavy. The\ncatalytic effect on the charged pion is estimated using the numerical results\nof the pion decay constant and the pion mass. (vii) The decay width of the\ncharged pion becomes wider than the experimental result, and the lifetime of\nthe charged pion becomes shorter than the experimental result.

This is a powerful constraint on CP-violating new physics:\neven new physics generating the EDM at two loops is constrained at the\nmulti-TeV scale. We interpret the bound in the context of different scenarios\nfor new physics: a general order-of-magnitude analysis for both the electron\nEDM and the CP-odd electron-nucleon coupling; 1-loop SUSY, probing sleptons\nabove 10 TeV; 2-loop SUSY, probing multi-TeV charginos or stops; and finally,\nnew physics that generates the EDM via the charm quark or top quark Yukawa\ncouplings. In the last scenario, new physics generates a \"QULE operator\" $(q_f\n\\bar{\\sigma}^{\\mu \\nu}{\\bar u}_f) \\cdot (\\ell {\\bar{\\sigma}}_{\\mu \\nu} {\\bar\ne})$, which in turn generates the EDM through RG evolution.

For the first time, we also classify scenarios in which the\nQULE operator is generated at one loop through a box diagram, which include\nSUSY and leptoquark models. The electron EDM bound is the leading constraint on\na wide variety of theories of CP-violating new physics interacting with the\nHiggs boson or the top quark.

We\ninvestigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its\nsubsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix.\nFurthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix\nis invertible.

We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the\nbehaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the\nnumber of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data\nvectors.

We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator\nof the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the\nnumber of bins (data vector variables), P, to the number of data sets, N. This\nbias inevitably leads to an -- in extreme cases catastrophic -- underestimation\nof the size of confidence regions.

Special attention is paid to the small\nentries which are usually not specified in discussions of the neutrino mass\nmatrix textures. We specifically discuss the stability of neutrino masses and\nlepton mixing angles with respect to the choice and variations of these small\nentries. \n\n"}

Hadron\nproduction at high transverse momentum (p_T) in central Au+Au collisions shows\nvery different properties (production yields, flavor composition, azimuthal\ncorrelations, ...) in comparison to p+p, d+Au, and peripheral Au+Au collisions,\nand this fact constitutes arguably the most interesting outcome of the\nexperimental program so far. Four main topics are covered in this report: (i)\nthe depletion of high p_T inclusive hadron spectra, (ii) the ``anomalous''\nbaryon-meson composition at intermediate p_T's, (iii) the disappearance of\naway-side azimuthal (jet) correlations, and (iv) the large value of collective\nazimuthal (elliptic flow) correlations.

The\naddition of salt enhanced the signal from neutron capture, as compared to the\npure D$_2$O detector. By making a statistical separation of charged-current\nevents from other types based on event-isotropy criteria, the effective\nelectron recoil energy spectrum has been extracted. In units of $ 10^6$\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, the total flux of active-flavor neutrinos from $^8$B decay\nin the Sun is found to be\n$4.94^{+0.21}_{-0.21}{(stat)}^{+0.38}_{-0.34}{(syst)}$ and the integral flux of\nelectron neutrinos for an undistorted $^8$B spectrum is\n$1.68^{+0.06}_{-0.06}{(stat)}^{+0.08}_{-0.09}{(syst)}$; the signal from\n($\\nu_x$,e) elastic scattering is equivalent to an electron-neutrino flux of\n$2.35^{+0.22}_{-0.22}{(stat)}^{+0.15}_{-0.15}{(syst)}$.

We provide a contemporary perspective,\ncouched primarily in terms of the Dyson-Schwinger equations but also making\ncomparisons with other approaches and models. Our discourse provides a\npractitioners' guide to features of the Dyson-Schwinger equations [such as\nconfinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking] and canvasses\nphenomenological applications to light meson and baryon properties in cold,\nsparse QCD. These provide the foundation for an extension to hot, dense QCD,\nwhich is probed via the introduction of the intensive thermodynamic variables:\nchemical potential and temperature. We describe order parameters whose\nevolution signals deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration, and chronicle\ntheir use in demarcating the quark gluon plasma phase boundary and\ncharacterising the plasma's properties. Hadron traits change in an equilibrated\nplasma. We exemplify this and discuss putative signals of the effects.
