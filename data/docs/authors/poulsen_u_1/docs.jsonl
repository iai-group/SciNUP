At the fundamental physical\nlevel, it is a network of two body interactions, each the input-output\ntransformation of a universal Boolean gate.

For channels of\nnonzero capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be\nefficient, auxiliary resources of the proper kind and amount are generally\nrequired. In the classical case, shared randomness between sender and receiver\nis a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source, but\nin the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation\ndepend on both the channel being simulated, and the source from which the\nchannel inputs are coming. For tensor power sources (the quantum generalization\nof classical IID sources), entanglement in the form of standard ebits\n(maximally entangled pairs of qubits) is sufficient, but for general sources,\nwhich may be arbitrarily correlated or entangled across channel inputs,\nadditional resources, such as entanglement-embezzling states or backward\ncommunication, are generally needed.

Using Euclidean gravity, Fursaev computed the\nentanglement Renyi entropies (EREs) of an arbitrary spatial region in an\narbitrary holographic field theory, and thereby derived the RT formula.

While initially a\ncuriosity, it was quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had\nmeasurable consequences, for instance producing the Lamb shift of atomic\nspectra and modifying the magnetic moment for the electron. This type of\nrenormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now central to our understanding\nof nature. However, these effects provide indirect evidence for the existence\nof vacuum fluctuations.

A three-dimensional gapped lattice spin model is found\nwhich demonstrates for the first time that a reliable quantum memory at finite\ntemperature is possible, at least to some extent. When quantum information is\nencoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to\nthermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without\nany active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors\nwell localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved\nfaithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the\ninverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological\nquantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales\nexponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square.\n  This spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order,\nin which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are\nimmobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the\nHamiltonian.

Experimental setups considered\nup to date address this threat in a conceptually straightforward way -- by\neliminating the environment, i.e. by isolating an object in a sufficiently high\nvacuum. We show that another option exists: decoherence is suppressed in the\npresence of a strongly interacting environment if this environment is\nsuperfluid. Indeed, as long as an object immersed in a pure superfluid at zero\ntemperature moves with a velocity below the critical one, it does not create,\nabsorb or scatter any excitations of the superfluid.

Our statistic, the onion\nspectrum, is based on the onion decomposition, which refines the k-core\ndecomposition, a standard network fingerprinting method. The onion spectrum is\nexactly as easy to compute as the k-cores: It is based on the stages at which\neach vertex gets removed from a graph in the standard algorithm for computing\nthe k-cores.

The key\nidea of ETS is the division of the spatial volume into a small region around\nthe nucleus and its outside; the radial coordinates are time scaled only in the\nouter region. The continuum components of photoelectron wave packets are\nprevented from reaching the edge of the spatial simulation volume, enabling the\nlong-time evolution of wave packets with a relatively small number of basis\nfunctions without concerns of electron reflections. On the other hand, the\nbound-state components are free from shrinking toward the origin because of\nnon-time scaling in the inner region. Hence, the equations of motion in ETS are\nless stiff than the ones in the original time-scaled coordinate approach in\nwhich the shrinking bound states make the equations of motion seriously stiff.\nFor numerical implementation of ETS, the working equations are derived in terms\nof finite-element discrete-variable-representation functions.

These foundations\nrest on the results of two decade studies on the axiomatic and\noperational-realistic approaches to the foundations of quantum physics. The\ndeep analogies between the foundations of physics and cognition lead us to\ninvestigate the validity of quantum theory as a general and unitary framework\nfor cognitive processes, and the empirical success of the Hilbert space models\nderived by such investigation provides a strong theoretical confirmation of\nthis validity.

In this article, we explore the\nholographic properties of networks of random tensors.

When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that\nthe entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey\nthe Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties\nof the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each\nboundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement\nwedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the\npartition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the\nminimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls.

Increasing the\nentanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface\ntopologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole.

Our purpose is to\nstudy the subsequent temporal generation of entanglement, quantified by\nconcurrence, when initially the qubits are in an unentangled state. In the\nequilibrium situation, we show that the concurrence survives for a larger value\nof $d$ when the environmental spin chain is critical. Importantly, a common\nfeature observed both in the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium situations\nwhile the latter is created by a sudden but global change of the environmental\ntransverse field, is that the two qubits become maximally entangled for the\ncritical quenching. Following a non-equilibrium evolution of the spin chain,\nour study for $d\\neq 0$, indicates that there exists a threshold time above\nwhich concurrence attains a finite value. Additionally, we show that the number\nof independent decohering channels (DCs) is determined by $d$ as well as the\nlocal difference of the transverse field of the two underlying Hamiltonians\ngoverning the time evolution. The qualitatively similar behavior displayed by\nthe concurrence for critical and off-critical quenches, as reported here, is\ncharacterized by analyzing the non-equilibrium evolution of these channels. The\nconcurrence is maximum when the decoherence factor or the echo associated with\nthe most rapidly DC decays to zero; on the contrary, the condition when the\nconcurrence vanishes is determined non-trivially by the associated decay of one\nof the intermediate DCs. Analyzing the reduced density of a single qubit, we\nalso explain the observation that the dephasing rate is always slower than the\nunentanglement rate. \n\n"}

We present three novel tomography algorithms that use projected\ngradient descent and compare their performance with state-of-the-art\nalternatives, i.e. the diluted iterative algorithm and convex programming. Our\nresults find in favour of the general class of projected gradient descent\nmethods due to their speed, applicability to large states, and the range of\nconditions in which they perform. \n\n"}

Our method is\nbased on spectroscopic interrogation of quantum defects in macroscopic\nsolid-state crystals . When a WIMP scatters in a crystal, the induced nuclear\nrecoil creates a tell-tale damage cluster, localized to within about 50 nm,\nwith an orientation to the damage trail that correlates well with the direction\nof the recoil and hence the incoming WIMP. This damage cluster induces strain\nin the crystal, shifting the energy levels of nearby quantum defects. These\nlevel shifts can be measured optically (or through paramagnetic resonance)\nmaking it possible to detect the strain environment around the defect in a\nsolid sample. As a specific example, we consider nitrogen vacancy centers in\ndiamond, for which high defect densities and nanoscale localization of\nindividual defects have been demonstrated. To localize the millimeter-scale\nregion of a nuclear recoil within the crystal due to a potential dark matter\nevent, we can use conventional WIMP detection techniques such as the collection\nof ionization/scintillation. Once an event is identified, the quantum defects\nin the vicinity of the event can be interrogated to map the strain environment,\nthus determining the direction of the recoil. In principle, this approach\nshould be able to identify the recoil direction with an efficiency greater than\n70% at a false positive rate less than 5% for 10 keV recoil energies. If\nsuccessful, this method would allow for directional detection of WIMP-induced\nnuclear recoils at solid state densities, enabling probes of WIMP parameter\nspace below the solar neutrino floor.

From this investigation we posit two logically and operationally\ndistinct statements of the equivalence principle for quantum systems: Version\nA: The probability distribution of position for a free-falling particle is the\nsame as the probability distribution of a free particle, modulo a\nmass-independent shift of its mean.

For the marginal case $c=1.5$ corresponding to\ntwo-dimensional wetting, both the width $\\Delta T_c(L)$ and the shift\n$[T_c(\\infty)-T_c^{av}(L)]$ decay as $L^{-1/2}$, so the exponent is unchanged\n($\\nu_{random}=2=\\nu_{pure}$) but disorder is relevant and leads to non\nself-averaging at criticality.

In the generic\ncase, the power of particle emission is found to be proportional to the inverse\nsquare of the remaining time to the Cauchy horizon (CH). The constant of\nproportion can be arbitrarily large in the limit to marginally naked\nsingularity. Therefore, the unbounded power is especially striking in the case\nthat an event horizon is very close to the CH because the emitted energy can be\narbitrarily large in spite of a cutoff expected from quantum gravity.

We analyse the case of soliton\ncreation induced by collisions of a few highly energetic particles. We present\nsemiclassical, but otherwise first principle, study of this process at all\nenergies of colliding particles. We find that direct tunneling to the final\nstate occurs at energies below the critical value E_c, which is slightly higher\nthan the barrier height. Tunneling probability grows with energy in this\nregime. Above the critical energy, the tunneling mechanism is different. The\ntransition proceeds through creation of a state close to the top of the\npotential barrier (sphaleron) and its subsequent decay. At certain limiting\nenergy E_l tunneling probability ceases to grow. At higher energies the\ndominant mechanism of transition becomes the release of energy excess E-E_l by\nthe emission of a few particles and then tunneling at effectively lower energy\nE=E_l via the limiting semiclassical configuration.

The results are as follows:(1) the\nnon-equilibrium correlation function $P(t)$, the dynamical susceptibility\n$\\chi''(\\omega)$ and the equilibrium correlation function $C(t)$ are\nanalytically obtained for $s\\leq 1$; (2) the phase diagram of thermodynamic\ntransition shows the delocalized-localized transition point $\\alpha_l$ which\nagrees with exact results and numerical data from the Numerical Renormalization\nGroup; (3) the dynamical transition point $\\alpha_c$ between coherent and\nincoherent phase is explicitly given for the first time. A crossover from the\ncoherent oscillation to incoherent relaxation appears with increasing coupling\n(for $\\alpha > \\alpha_c $, the coherent dynamics disappear); (4) the Shiba's\nrelation and sum rule are exactly satisfied when $\\alpha \\leq \\alpha_c $; (5)\nan underdamping-overdamping transition point $\\alpha_c^{*}$ exists in the\nfunction $S(\\omega)$. Consequently, the dynamical phase diagrams in both ohmic\nand sub-Ohmic case are mapped out. For $\\Delta \\ll \\omega_c$, the critical\ncouplings ($\\alpha_l, \\alpha_c$ and $\\alpha_c^{*}$) are proportional to\n$\\Delta^{1-s}$. \n\n"}
