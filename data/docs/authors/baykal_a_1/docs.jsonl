Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

The presence of D-particle\ndefects in the space-time, which can interact non trivially (via particle\ncapture) with flavoured particles in a flavour non-preserving way, generates\nmixing in the effective field theory of low-energy string excitations.\nMoreover, the recoil of the D-particle defect during the capture/scattering\nprocess implies Lorentz violation, which however may be averaged to zero in\nisotropic D-particle populations, but implies non-trivial effects in\ncorrelators.

In a few\nwell-studied cases, these ``short GRBs with extended emission'' show no\nevidence for a bright associated supernova (SN). We propose that these events\nare produced by the formation and early evolution of a highly magnetized,\nrapidly rotating neutron star (a ``proto-magnetar'') which is formed from the\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD), the merger and collapse\nof a WD-WD binary, or, perhaps, the merger of a double neutron star binary. The\ninitial emission spike is powered by accretion onto the proto-magnetar from a\nsmall disk that is formed during the AIC or merger event. The extended emission\nis produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of the\nproto-magnetar on a timescale ~10-100 s. The ~3-10 s delay between the prompt\nand extended emission is the time required for the newly-formed proto-magnetar\nto cool sufficiently that the neutrino-heated wind from its surface becomes\nultra-relativistic. Because a proto-magnetar ejects little or no Ni56 (< 1e-3\nM_sun), these events should not produce a bright SN-like transient. We model\nthe extended emission from GRB060614 using spin-down calculations of a cooling\nproto-magnetar, finding reasonable agreement with observations for a magnetar\nwith an initial rotation period of ~1 ms and a surface dipole field of ~3e15 G.\nIf GRBs are indeed produced by AIC or WD-WD mergers, they should occur within a\nmixture of both early and late-type galaxies and should not produce strong\ngravitational wave emission.

Our approach combines advantages of observational constraints in halo\noccupation models and hydrodynamic merger simulations. This allows us to\nseparate the relative roles of dissipation, dry mergers, formation time, and\nprogenitor evolution, and identify their effects on scalings at each redshift.\nDissipation is the most important factor determining spheroid sizes and\nfundamental plane (FP) scalings, and can account for the FP tilt and\ndifferences between disk and spheroid scalings. Because disks at high-z have\nhigher gas fractions, mergers are more gas-rich, yielding more compact\nspheroids.

We observe elements of\nthis phenomenon in a simple model with inflaton \\phi and iso-inflaton \\chi\nfields interacting during inflation via the coupling g^2 (\\phi-\\phi_0)^2\n\\chi^2. Iso-inflaton particles are created during inflation when they become\ninstantaneously massless at \\phi=\\phi_0, with occupation numbers not exceeding\nunity. We point out that very quickly the produced \\chi particles become heavy\nand their multiple re-scatterings off the homogeneous condensate \\phi(t)\ngenerates bremschtrahlung radiation of light inflaton IR fluctuations with high\noccupation numbers. The subsequent evolution of these IR fluctuations is\nqualitatively similar to that of the usual inflationary fluctuations, but their\ninitial amplitude is different. The IR cascading generates a bump-shaped\ncontribution to the cosmological curvature fluctuations, which can even\ndominate over the usual fluctuations for g^2>0.06.

The\ndetection of GeV photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.\n  The observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with the\nredshift suggests a lower limit for the Lorentz factor of the\nultra-relativistic ejecta of Gamma > 1090. This value rivals any previous\nmeasurements of Gamma in GRBs and strengthens the extreme nature of GRB\n080916C. \n\n"}

This radiation is a key ingredient to\nunderstand the origin of the high energy emission of blazars, from the X-ray to\nthe gamma-ray energy band. These external radiation fields control the amount\nof the inverse Compton radiation with respect to the synchrotron flux.\nTherefore the predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) will depend on where\nthe jet dissipates part of its energy to produce the observed radiation. We\ninvestigate in detail how the SED changes as a function of the location of the\njet dissipation region, by assuming rather \"standard\" (i.e. \"canonical\")\nprescriptions for the accretion disk and its X-ray corona, the profile of the\njet magnetic field and the external radiation. The magnetic energy density of a\n\"canonical\" jet almost never dominates the radiative cooling of the emitting\nelectrons, and consequently the inverse Compton flux almost always dominates\nthe bolometric output.

Massive stars in\nnewly formed or primordial globular clusters could have played an important\nrole during the epoch of cosmological reionisation (z>~6) as sources of\nenergetic, neutral hydrogen ionising UV photons. We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray\nbackground at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate\nthe total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast\nthis with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main\nsequence lives. For reasonable estimates, we find that the bolometric\nluminosity of the cluster peaks at ~10^42 erg/s during the first few million\nyears, but declines to ~10^41 erg/s after ~5 million years as the most massive\nstars evolve off the main sequence. From this time onwards, the total\nbolometric luminosity is dominated by HMXBs and falls gradually to ~10^40 erg/s\nafter ~50 million years. Assuming a power-law spectral energy distribution for\nthe HMXBs, we calculate the effective number of neutral hydrogen ionisations\nper HMXB and show that HMXBs can be as important as sources of ionising\nradiation as massive stars. Finally we discuss the implications of our results\nfor modelling galaxy formation at high redshift and the prospects of using\nglobular clusters as probes of reionisation. \n\n"}

The relativistic electrons producing this diffuse synchrotron\nemission should also produce inverse Compton emission that becomes competitive\nwith thermal emission from the ICM at hard X-ray energies. Thus far, claimed\ndetections of this emission in Coma are controversial (Fusco-Femiano et al.\n2004; Rossetti & Molendi 2004). We present a Suzaku HXD-PIN observation of the\nComa cluster in order to nail down its non-thermal hard X-ray content.

We fail to find statistically significant evidence for\nnon-thermal emission in the spectra, which are better described by only a\nsingle or multi-temperature model for the ICM. Including systematic\nuncertainties, we derive a 90% upper limit on the flux of non-thermal emission\nof 6.0x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 keV, for photon index of 2.0), which implies a\nlower limit on the cluster-averaged magnetic field of B>0.15 microG. Our flux\nupper limit is 2.5x lower than the detected non-thermal flux from RXTE\n(Rephaeli & Gruber 2002) and BeppoSAX (Fusco-Femiano et al. 2004). However, if\nthe non-thermal hard X-ray emission in Coma is more spatially extended than the\nobserved radio halo, the Suzaku HXD-PIN may miss some fraction of the emission.\nA detailed investigation indicates that ~50-67% of the emission might go\nundetected, which could make our limit consistent with these detections.

This\neffect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of\ntens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in\nextreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the\ndark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v <~\n10^-27 cm^3/s. This phenomenology is interesting.

The difficulties of these child\nuniverse solutions due to their generic singularity problems will be very\nlikely be cured by quantum effects, just like for example \"almost\" instanton\nsolutions are made relevant in gauge theories with breaking of conformal\ninvariance.

The morphology of the flare light curve is the same for\nboth early time and late time flares, while they differ energetically. The\nwidth of late time flares increases with time similarly to the early time\nflares.

We investigate the effects of gas drag on the\nimpact radii and the accretion rates of these particles. As simplifying\nassumptions we restrict our analysis to 2D settings, a gas drag law linear in\nvelocity, and a laminar disk characterized by a smooth (global) pressure\ngradient that causes particles to drift in radially.

Using the observed\nbroadband data, we study the origin of the high energy emission, and suggest\nthat the early-time GeV emission and the late-time radio, optical, and X-ray\nafterglows can be understood as being due to synchrotron emission from an\nexternal forward shock caused by structured ejecta propagating in a wind bubble\njumping to a homogeneous density medium.

We find that flare\ncandidates appear in different types of SGRB host galaxy environments and show\nno clear correlation with the X-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates are\ndetected both in SGRBs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-rays\nand in SGRBs which do not show such component.

In particular,the main parameter driving the\nduration evolution of X-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to be\nthe elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on the\ndifferent progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, prompt\nvariability time-scales and energy budgets. On the contrary, SGRB flare\ncandidates significantly differ from LGRB flares in terms of peak luminosity,\nisotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variability\nflux.

Gravitational-wave observations with a network of detectors will\npermit a direct, independent measurement of the distance to the source systems.\nIf the redshift of the source is known, these inspiraling double-neutron-star\nbinary systems can be used as standard sirens to extract cosmological\ninformation. Unfortunately, the redshift and the system chirp mass are\ndegenerate in GW observations. Thus, most previous work has assumed that the\nsource redshift is obtained from electromagnetic counterparts. In this paper,\nwe explore what we can learn about the background cosmology and the mass\ndistribution of neutron stars from the set of neutron-star (NS) mergers\ndetected by such a network. We use a Bayesian formalism to analyze catalogs of\nNS-NS inspiral detections.

We find that this matter\nentropy is not equal to (it is less than) Wald entropy, except in the case of\nEinstein theory, where they are equal. The matter entropy is proportional to\nthe Wald entropy if we consider a specific m-th order Lanczos-Lovelock model,\nwith the proportionality constant depending on the spacetime dimensions D and\nthe order m of the Lanczos-Lovelock theory as (D-2m)/(D-2).

From the cooling process we\nfound that a solid quark-cluster star, which has a stiffer equation of state\nthan that of conventional liquid quark star, has a heat capacity much smaller\nthan a neutron star. It can cool down quickly, which can naturally explain the\nnon-detection of a point source (neutron star or quark star) in X-ray band. On\nthe other hand, we consider the heating process from magnetospheric activity\nand possible accretion, and obtain some constraints to the parameters of a\npossible pulsar. We conclude that a solid quark-cluster star can be fine with\nthe observational limit in a large and acceptable parameter space. A pulsar\nwith a short period and a strong magnetic field (or with a long period and a\nweak field) would has luminosity higher than the luminosity limit if the\noptical depth is not large enough to hide the compact star. The constraints of\nthe pulsar parameters can be tested if the central compact object in 1987A is\ndiscovered by advanced facilities in the future. \n\n"}

The number of PBH's formed is therefore\nsensitive to small changes in the shape of the tail of the fluctuation\ndistribution, which itself depends on the amount of non-Gaussianity present. We\nstudy, for the first time, how quadratic and cubic local non-Gaussianity of\narbitrary size (parameterised by f_nl and g_nl respectively) affects the PBH\nabundance and the resulting constraints on the amplitude of the fluctuations on\nvery small scales.

The existence of two physically distinct quasar populations,\nthe radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, is controversial and over the last\ndecade a bimodal distribution of radio loudness of quasars has been both\naffirmed and disputed. We model the quasar radio luminosity distribution with\nsimple unimodal and bimodal distribution functions. The resulting simulated\nsamples are compared to a fiducial sample of 8,300 quasars drawn from the SDSS\nDR7 Quasar Catalog and combined with radio observations from the FIRST survey.\nOur results indicate that the SDSS-FIRST sample is best described by a radio\nloudness distribution which consists of two components, with 12+/-1 % of\nsources in the radio-loud component.

The\ninter-plasmoid reconnection layers are subject to strong synchrotron cooling,\nleading to significant plasma compression. Using the conditions of pressure\nbalance across these current layers, the balance between the heating by\nmagnetic energy dissipation and synchrotron cooling, and Ampere's law, we\nobtain simple estimates for key parameters of the layers --- temperature,\ndensity, and layer thickness.

At the lowest\nfrequencies available in the lightcurve (<1.5E-4 Hz), we find hard lags where\nthe power-law dominated hard band lags the soft band (where the reflection\nfraction is high). However, at higher frequencies in the range (2-3)E-4 Hz we\nfind a soft lag of -325 +/- 89 s. The general evolution from hard to soft lags\nas the frequency increases is similar to other AGN where soft lags have been\ndetected. We interpret this soft lag as due to reverberation from the accretion\ndisk, with the reflection component responding to variability from the X-ray\ncorona. For a black hole mass of 7E6 M(solar) this corresponds to a\nlight-crossing time of ~9 R_g/c, however, dilution effects mean that the\nintrinsic lag is likely longer than this. Based on recent black hole\nmass-scaling for lag properties, the lag amplitude and frequency are more\nconsistent with a black hole a few times more massive than the best estimates,\nthough flux-dependent effects could easily add scatter this large. \n\n"}

A supernova shock breakout\nand a jet from a newborn stellar mass compact object were put forward to\nexplain its multiwavelength signature. We propose that the source is naturally\nexplained by another channel, a tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The tidal disruption is accompanied by a\ntidal pinching, which leads to the ignition of a WD and a supernova. Some\ndebris falls back onto the IMBH, forms a disk, which quickly amplifies the\nmagnetic field, and launches a jet. We successfully fit soft X-ray spectrum\nwith the Comptonized blackbody emission from a jet photosphere. The optical/UV\nemission is consistent with self-absorbed synchrotron from the expanding jet\nfront. The accretion rate temporal dependence Mdot(t) in a tidal disruption\nprovides a good fit to soft X-ray lightcurve.

Despite of its main role in quantum information processing,\nkinematic non-locality is unable to induce any change in the probability\ndistributions, so that the \"action-at-a-distance\" cannot manifest[5,6].\nConversely, dynamical non-locality does create explicit changes in probability,\nthough in a \"causality-preserving\" manner[6,7].

These remarks are illustrated in terms of the current standard\nmodels of cosmology and particle physics, as well as their respective\nunderlying theories, viz. general relativity and quantum (field) theory.

In the absence of such a deformation, a class of solutions can be found\nin the literature [R. Goswami and P. S.

However, when the phase-space is deformed, as implemented herein\nthis paper, we find that the singularity may be either removed or instead,\nattained faster. More precisely, for negative values of the deformation\nparameter, we identify the emergence of a negative pressure term, which slows\ndown the collapse so that the singularity is replaced with a bounce. In this\nrespect, the formation of a dynamical horizon can be avoided depending on the\nsuitable choice of the boundary surface of the star.

Companion masses are found mostly in 0.1-1 Msun mass range with peak\nat 0.6 Msun. The formation of these systems is believed to involve a common\nenvelope phase, initiated by a BH progenitor, expected to be a massive star >20\nMsun. It was realized that it may be very problematic for a low-mass companion\nto eject a massive envelope of the black hole progenitor. It invoked\nsuggestions that an intermediate-mass companion ejects the envelope, and then\nis shredded by the Roche-lobe overflow to its current low-mass. But this\ncreates another issue; a temperature mismatch between hot models and the\nobserved cool low-mass donors. Finally, the main driver of Roche-lobe overflow\nthat is believed to be magnetic braking does not seem to follow any\ntheoretically calculated models.

The Population with Kinematically Offset Broad\n  Balmer Emission Lines Abstract: A small fraction of quasars have long been known to show bulk velocity\noffsets in the broad Balmer lines with respect to the systemic redshift of the\nhost galaxy. Models to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line region\ngas kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (BHs), orbital motion of\nmassive (~sub-pc) binary black holes (BBHs), or recoil BHs, but single-epoch\nspectra are unable to distinguish between these scenarios. The line-of-sight\n(LOS) radial velocity (RV) shifts from long-term spectroscopic monitoring can\nbe used to test the BBH hypothesis. We have selected a sample of 399 quasars\nwith offset broad H-beta lines from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog, and have\nconducted second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. Combined with the\nexisting SDSS spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the LOS RV\nshifts of broad H-beta lines with a rest-frame baseline of a few years to\nnearly a decade. Using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant (99%\nconfidence) radial accelerations in the broad H-beta lines in 24 of the 50\nobjects. We suggest that 9 of the 24 detections are sub-pc BBH candidates,\nwhich show consistent velocity shifts independently measured from a second\nbroad line (either H-alpha or Mg II) without significant changes in the\nbroad-line profiles. Combining the results on the general quasar population\nstudied in Paper I, we find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocity\noffset in the first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between two\nepochs, which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the time\nseparation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the orbital\nperiod of the motion causing the line displacement.

Cold accretion flows, which consist of cool optically thick gas, are found\nat relatively high mass accretion rates. Prominent examples are the standard\nthin disk, which occurs at a fraction of the Eddington mass accretion rate, and\nthe slim disk at super-Eddington rates. These accretion flows are responsible\nfor luminous systems such as active galactic nuclei radiating at or close to\nthe Eddington luminosity and black hole X-ray binaries in the soft state. Hot\naccretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin.\nThey occur at lower mass accretion rates, and are described by models such as\nthe advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because\nof energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general\nlower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency\ndecreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot\naccretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments\nsuggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are\nbelieved to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black\nhole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states.

Abstract: If the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way grew\nadiabatically from an initial seed embedded in an NFW dark matter (DM) halo,\nthen the DM profile near the hole has steepened into a spike. We calculate the\ndramatic enhancement to the gamma ray flux from the Galactic center (GC) from\nsuch a spike if the 1-3 GeV excess observed in Fermi data is due to DM\nannihilations. We find that for the parameter values favored in recent fits,\nthe point source-like flux from the spike is 35 times greater than the flux\nfrom the inner $1^\\circ$ of the halo, far exceeding all Fermi point source\ndetections near the GC.

Depending on the total initial mass of the system, and the NS\nequation of state (EOS), the post-merger phase can see a prompt collapse to a\nblack hole, or the formation of a supramassive NS, or even a stable NS. In the\ncase of post-merger NS (PMNS) formation, magnetic field amplification during\nthe merger will produce a magnetar with a large induced mass quadrupole moment,\nand millisecond spin. If the timescale for orthogonalization of the magnetic\nsymmetry axis with the spin axis is sufficiently short the NS will radiate its\nspin down energy primarily via GWs. Here we study this scenario for various\noutcomes of NS formation: we generalise the set of equilibrium states for a\ntwisted torus magnetic configuration to include solutions that, at a fixed\nexterior dipole field, carry a larger magnetic energy reservoir; we hence\ncompute their magnetic ellipticity and the strength of the expected GW signal\nas a function of the magnitude of the dipole and toroidal field. The relative\nnumber of GW detections from PMNSs and from binary NSs is a strong function of\nthe NS equation of state (EOS), being higher (~ 1%) for the stiffest EOSs and\nnegligibly small for the softest ones. For intermediate-stiffness EOSs, such as\nthe n=4/7 polytrope recently used by Giacomazzo \\& Perna or the GM1 used by\nLasky et al., the relative fraction is ~0.3%; correspondingly we estimate a GW\ndetection rate from stable PMNSs of ~ (0.1-1) yr$^{-1}$ with Advanced\ndetectors, and of ~ (100-1000) yr$^{-1}$ with third generation detectors such\nas the Einstein Telescope.

This system has been shown\ntransiting between a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) state and a rotation-powered\nMSP state. The NuSTAR observations were taken in both LMXB state and\nrotation-powered state. The source is clearly seen in both states up to ~79\nkeV. During the LMXB state, the 3-79 keV flux is about a factor of 10 higher\nthat in the rotation-powered state. The hard X-rays show clear orbital\nmodulation during the X-ray faint rotation-powered state but the X-ray orbital\nperiod is not detected in the X-ray bright LMXB state. In addition, the X-ray\nspectrum changes from a flat power-law spectrum during the rotation-powered\nstate to a steeper power-law spectrum in the LMXB state. We suggest that the\nhard X-rays are due to the intra-binary shock from the interaction between the\npulsar wind and the injected material from the low-mass companion star.

A resonant orbit is defined as a geodesic for which the longitudinal\nand radial orbital frequencies are commensurate. Our analysis is based on\nexpressing the resonance condition in its most symmetric form using Carlson's\nintegrals. We provide a number of concise formulae for the dependence of\nresonances on the system parameters. Resonant effects may be observable during\nthe in-spiral of a compact object into a super-massive black hole. When the\nslowly evolving orbital frequencies pass through a series of low-order\nresonances, rapid changes in the orbital parameters could produce measurable\nphase shifts in the emitted gravitational radiation (GW). Resonant orbits may\nalso capture dust leading to electromagnetic emission. The KAM theorem\nindicates that, low order resonant orbits demarcate the regions where the onset\nof chaos could occur around a perturbed black-hole. We find that the 1/2 and\n2/3 resonances occur at ~4 and 5.4 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) from the event\nhorizon. For compact object in-spirals around super-massive black holes, this\nregion lies within the sensitivity band of space-based GW detectors.

The reported dynamo\nsimulations extend into a \"buoyancy-dominated\" regime where the buoyancy\nforcing is dominant while the Coriolis force is no longer balanced by pressure\ngradients and strong anti-solar differential rotation develops as a result. We\nfind that the self-generated magnetic fields, despite being relatively weak,\nare able to reverse the direction of differential rotation from anti-solar to\nsolar-like.

Abstract: Using dark matter simulations we show how halo bias is determined by local\ndensity and not by halo mass. This is not totally surprising, as according to\nthe peak-background split model, local density is the property that constraints\nbias at large scales. Massive haloes have a high clustering because they reside\nin high density regions. Small haloes can be found in a wide range of\nenvironments which determine their clustering amplitudes differently. This\ncontradicts the assumption of standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)\nmodels that the bias and occupation of haloes is determined solely by their\nmass. We show that the bias of central galaxies from semi-analytic models of\ngalaxy formation as a function of luminosity and colour is not correctly\npredicted by the standard HOD model. Using local density instead of halo mass\nthe HOD model correctly predicts galaxy bias. These results indicate the need\nto include information about local density and not only mass in order to\ncorrectly apply HOD analysis in these galaxy samples.

For a constant-$w$ model, we have\n$w=-1.010\\pm0.030$ and $\\Omega_m=0.311\\pm0.014$, while for a time-evolving\nequation of state of dark energy $w(z)$ we have $\\Omega_m=0.308\\pm 0.017$,\n$w_0=-0.993\\pm0.046$ and $w_a=-0.123\\pm0.400$. Constraints on the cosmology are\nfurther improved by adding priors on the gas fraction evolution from\nhydrodynamic simulations. Current data favour the cosmological constant with\n$w\\equiv-1$, with no evidence for dynamic dark energy. We checked that our\nmethod is robust towards different sources of systematics, including background\nmodelling, outlier measurements, selection effects, inhomogeneities of the gas\ndistribution and cosmic filaments.

The parameter used in earlier versions of this model, referred to as\nthe reflection strength, is unsatisfactory, and it has been superseded by a\nparameter that provides insight into the accretion geometry, namely the\nreflection fraction. The reflection fraction is defined as the ratio of the\ncoronal intensity illuminating the disk to the coronal intensity that reaches\nthe observer. The relxill model combines a general relativistic ray-tracing\ncode and a photoionization code to compute the component of radiation reflected\nfrom an accretion that is illuminated by an internal source. The reflection\nfraction is a particularly important parameter for relativistic models with\nwell-defined geometry, such as the lamppost model, which is a focus of this\npaper. Relativistic spectra are compared for three inclinations and for four\nvalues of the key parameter of the lamppost model, namely the height above the\nblack hole of the illuminating, on-axis point source. In all cases, the\nstrongest reflection is produced for low source heights and high spin. A\nlow-spin black hole is shown to be incapable of producing enhanced relativistic\nreflection.

Abstract: Galactic cosmic rays (CR) are particles presumably accelerated in supernova\nremnant shocks that propagate in the interstellar medium up to the densest\nparts of molecular clouds, losing energy and their ionisation efficiency\nbecause of the presence of magnetic fields and collisions with molecular\nhydrogen. Recent observations hint at high levels of ionisation and at the\npresence of synchrotron emission in protostellar systems, which leads to an\napparent contradiction. We want to explain the origin of these CRs accelerated\nwithin young protostars as suggested by observations. Our modelling consists of\na set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to have an efficient CR\nacceleration through diffusive shock acceleration. We analyse three main\nacceleration sites, then we follow the propagation of these particles through\nthe protostellar system up to the hot spot region. We find that jet shocks can\nbe strong accelerators of CR protons, which can be boosted up to relativistic\nenergies. Other promising acceleration sites are protostellar surfaces, where\nshocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough\nto accelerate CR protons. In contrast, accretion flow shocks are too weak to\nefficiently accelerate CRs. Though CR electrons are weakly accelerated, they\ncan gain a strong boost to relativistic energies through re-acceleration in\nsuccessive shocks. We suggest a mechanism able to accelerate both CR protons\nand electrons through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism, which can be\nused to explain the high ionisation rate and the synchrotron emission observed\ntowards protostellar sources. The existence of an internal source of energetic\nparticles can have a strong and unforeseen impact on the ionisation of the\nprotostellar disc, on the star and planet formation processes, and on the\nformation of pre-biotic molecules. \n\n"}

The sign of $q$ changes from positive to negative during late time\nof evolution which explains the late time accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse.

The p/He decrease is often\ninterpreted in terms of particle-dependent acceleration, which is in contrast\nwith the universal nature of DSA mechanisms. A different explanation is that\nthe p-He anomaly reflects a flux transition between two components: a sub-TeV\nflux component (L) provided by hydrogen-rich supernova remnants with soft\nacceleration spectra, and a multi-TeV component (G) injected by younger sources\nwith amplified magnetic fields and hard spectra. In this scenario the\nuniversality of particle acceleration is not violated because both sources\nprovide composition-blind injection spectra. The present work is aimed at\ntesting this model using the low-energy CR flux which is expected to be\nL-dominated. However, at $E\\sim\\,$0.5-10 GeV, the fluxes are affected by energy\nlosses and solar modulation for which a proper modeling is required.

Some authors even\nclaim that a single source is responsible for the observed anomalies. But how\nprobable these explanations are? To answer that question, our current\ndescription of cosmic ray Galactic propagation needs to be replaced by the\nMyriad model. In the former approach, sources of protons and helium nuclei are\ntreated as a jelly continuously spread over space and time. A more accurate\ndescription is provided by the Myriad model where sources are considered as\npoint-like events.

X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars\nand stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star\nevolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged) \n\n"}

The use of\ntracers, namely massless particles that are advected with the flow, represents\na simple and effective way to solve this problem. Yet, the use of tracers in\nnumerical relativity is far from being settled and several issues, such as the\nimpact of different placements in time and space of the tracers, or the\nrelation between the placement and the description of the underlying fluid,\nhave not yet been addressed. In this paper we present the first detailed\ndiscussion of the use tracers in numerical-relativity simulations focussing on\nboth unbound material -- such as the one leading to r-process nucleosynthesis\nin binary mergers of neutron stars -- and on bound material -- such as the one\nin the core of the object produced from the merger of two neutron stars. In\nparticular, when interested in unbound matter, we have evaluated four different\nplacement schemes that could be used to initially distribute the tracers and\nhow well their predictions match those obtained when using information from the\nactual fluid flow. Countering our naive expectations, we found that the most\neffective method does not rely on the rest-mass density distribution nor on the\nfluid that is unbound, but simply distributes tracers uniformly in rest-mass\ndensity. This prescription leads to the closest matching with the information\nobtained from the hydrodynamical solution. When considering bound matter, we\ndemonstrate that tracers can provide insight into the fine details of the fluid\nmotion as they can be used to track the evolution of fluid elements or to\ncalculate the variation of quantities that are conserved along streamlines of\nadiabatic flows. \n\n"}

We furthermore undertake a photometric study of\nthe host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8\ndays after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this,\nthe light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9\ndays after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be\nexceptional.

When a search reports no detections,\nthe estimated sensitivity is then used to place upper limits on the coalescence\nrate of the target source. In order to obtain correct sensitivity and rate\nestimates, the injected waveforms must be faithful representations of the real\nsignals. Up to date, however, injected waveforms have neglected radiation modes\nof order higher than the quadrupole, potentially biasing sensitivity and\ncoalescence rate estimates. In particular, higher-order modes are known to have\na large impact in the gravitational waves emitted by intermediate mass black\nholes binaries. In this work we evaluate the impact of this approximation in\nthe context of two search algorithms run by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration\nin their search for intermediate mass black hole binaries in the O1 LIGO\nScience Run data: a matched-filter based pipeline and a coherent un-modeled\none.

MEMEcho analysis shows that\ndirect X-rays can be the driver of most of the variations in the UV/optical\nbands as long as the response functions for those bands all have long tails (up\nto 10d) in addition to a strong peak (from disc reprocessing) at short lag\n(<1d). We interpret the tails as due to reprocessing from the surrounding gas.\nComparison of X-ray to UVW2 and UVW2 to V-band lags for 4 AGN, including NGC\n4593, shows that all have UVW2 to V-band lags which exceed the expectations\nfrom disc resprocessing by factor < 2. However the X-ray to UVW2 lags are,\nmostly, in greater excess from the expectations from disc reprocessing and\ndiffer between AGN. The largest excess is in NGC 4151.

We develop an analytical prescription that models the\nsubhalo mass evolution and calibrate it to results of N-body numerical\nsimulations of various scales from very small (Earth size) to large (galaxies\nto clusters) halos. We then combine the results with halo accretion histories,\nand calculate the subhalo mass function that is physically motivated down to\nEarth-mass scales. Our results --- valid for arbitrary host masses and\nredshifts --- show reasonable agreement with those of numerical simulations at\nresolved scales. Our analytical model also enables self-consistent calculations\nof the boost factor of dark matter annhilation, which we find to increase from\ntens of percent at the smallest (Earth) and intermediate (dwarfs) masses to a\nfactor of several at galaxy size, and to become as large as a factor of\n$\\sim$10 for the largest halos (clusters) at small redshifts.

Motion of point charge with\nradiation reaction in flat spacetime is described by Lorenz-Dirac (LD)\nequation, while in curved spacetime -- by DeWitt-Brehme (DWB) equation\ncontaining the Ricci term and the tail term. We show that for the motion of\nelementary particles in vacuum metrics the DWB equation can be reduced to the\ncovariant form of the LD equation which we use here. Generically, the LD\nequation is plagued by runaway solutions, so we discuss computational ways to\navoid this problem in constructing numerical solutions.

The 1.3 mm continuum emission shows\nthat SMM4 is spatially resolved into two protostars embedded in the same core:\nSMM4A showing a high brightness temperature, 18 K, with little extended\nstructure and SMM4B showing a low brightness temperature, 2 K, with compact and\nextended structures. Their separation is ~2100 au. Analysis of the continuum\nvisibilities reveals a disk-like structure with a sharp edge at r~240 au in\nSMM4A, and a compact component with a radius of 56 au in SMM4B. The 12CO\nemission traces fan-shaped and collimated outflows associated with SMM4A and\nSMM4B, respectively. The blue and red lobes of the SMM4B outflow have different\nposition angles by ~30 deg. Their inclination and bending angles in the 3D\nspace are estimated at i_b~ 36 deg, i_r~70 deg, and alpha~40 deg, respectively.\nThe SO emission traces shocked regions, such as cavity walls of outflows and\nthe vicinity of SMM4B. The C18O emission mainly traces an infalling and\nrotating envelope around SMM4B. The C18O fractional abundance in SMM4B is ~50\ntimes smaller than that of the interstellar medium.

Third-generation Earth-based\ndetectors and the space-based interferometer LISA could measure multiple\nspectral lines from different multipolar components of the radiation, and\ntherefore provide qualitatively better tests of the Kerr hypothesis. In this\npaper we quantify the redshift out to which the various modes would be\ndetectable (or, conversely, the number of detectable modes at any given\nredshift) as a function of the intrinsic parameters of the merging binary. LISA\ncould detect so many modes that current numerical relativity simulations would\nnot be sufficient to extract all available science from the data. \n\n"}

Our modeling uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the\nSED, accounting for the limitations on the accretion rate at the outer radius\nof $10^3~r_g$ from the earlier works and the domination of the accretion flow\nwithin $30~r_g$ to the sub-mm bump.

Due to the low\ntemperatures in regions of star formation, these isotopologues are enhanced to\nsignificant levels, making detections of multiply-deuterated species possible.\nHowever, for complex organic species, only the multiply-deuterated variants of\nmethanol and methyl cyanide have been reported so far.

In this paper we use analytical and numerical calculations to explore\nthe effect of stellar rotation on the fallback rate of material. We find that\nslowly spinning stars ($\\Omega_* \\lesssim 0.01 \\Omega_{\\rm{breakup}}$) provide\nonly a small perturbation to fallback rates found in the non-spinning case.\nHowever when the star spins faster, there can be significant effects. If the\nstar is spinning retrograde with respect to its orbit the tidal force from the\nblack hole has to spin down the star first before disrupting it, causing\ndelayed and sometimes only partial disruption events. However, if the star is\nspinning prograde this works with the tidal force and the material falls back\nsooner and with a higher peak rate. We examine the power-law index of the\nfallback curves, finding that in all cases the fallback rate overshoots the\ncanonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate briefly after the peak, with the depth of the\novershoot dependent on the stellar spin.

As a\nresult, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(Zn, Co)/Fe], smaller\n[(Mn, Cr)/Fe], and larger [Fe/O], which could explain the trend observed in\nvery metal-poor stars. 2) Si-burning takes place in lower density regions, so\nthat the effects of $\\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced.

(2) How much do E/S0 galaxies contribute to the\ncounts in deep mid-infrared (MIR: 3 -- 20$\\mu m$) surveys?

The efficiency\nof type II SNe in injecting energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) and in\nre-heating a fraction of the original star-forming cloud is estimated with the\naid of a two-phase model for the ISM of the cloud. We argue that when SNe\nexplode the star-forming cloud has already been partially destroyed by ionizing\nlight and winds from massive stars. SN remnants (SNRs) will first cause the\ncollapse of most of the cloud gas into cold fragments, until the diffuse hot\nphase has a low enough density to make further radiative losses negligible.\nThis is completed in ~3 Myr, with a modest energy loss of ~5 per cent of the\ntotal budget.

Abstract: There is mounting evidence that long duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are\nproduced by ultra-relativistic jets of ordinary matter which are ejected in\ncore collapse supernova (SN) explosions. Such jets are extremely efficient\ncosmic ray (CR) accelerators which can accelerate the swept up ambient\nparticles on their way to the highest observed CR energies. The bulk of the jet\nkinetic energy is used to accelerate CRs while only a tiny fraction is used to\nproduce the GRB and its afterglow. Here we use the remarkably successful\ncannonball (CB) model of GRBs to show that the bipolar jets from SN explosions,\nwhich produce GRBs most of which are not beamed towards Earth, can be the main\norigin of cosmic rays at all energies. The model explains very simply the\nelemental composition of CRs and their observed spectra at all energies. In\nparticular it explains the origin of the CR knees and ankle. Above the CR\nankle, the Galactic magnetic fields can no longer delay the free escape of\nultra-high energies CRs (UHECR) from the Galaxy, and the CRs from the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), which were injected there by SN jets from all the\ngalaxies and isotropized there by the IGM magnetic fields, dominate the\nGalactic CR spectrum. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect due to the\ninteraction of UHECRs with the microwave background radiation is expected. The\nCR nuclei which diffuse out of galaxies, or are directly deposited in the IGM\nby the relativistic SN jets, may be the origin of the IGM magnetic fields.\nInverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR)\nby the CR electrons in the IGM produces the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground radiation (GBR). \n\n"}

We demonstrate that magnification perturbations are\ndominated by perturbers found within a tidal radius of an image, and that\nsizable magnification perturbations may arise from small, coherent\ncontributions from several substructures within the lens halo.

If\nthese clusters both harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; 10^{2-4}\nMsun) in their center, they can become a strong source of gravitational waves\nwhen the black holes merge with each other. In order to understand the\ndynamical processes that operate in such a scenario, one has to study the\nevolution of the merger of two such young massive star clusters, and more\nspecifically, their respective IMBHs. We employ the direct-summation Nbody4\nnumerical tool on special-purpose GRAPE6 hardware to simulate a merger of two\nstellar clusters each containing 63,000 particles and a central IMBH. This\nallows us to study accurately the orbital evolution of the colliding clusters\nand the embedded massive black holes. Within ~7 Myr the clusters have merged\nand the IMBHs constitute a hard binary. The final coalescence happens in ~10^8\nyrs.

The limit of the near-horizon\napproximation is considered. If the Killing horizon is bifurcate the conformal\nsymmetry is hidden, i.e. it does not arise from geometrical spacetime\nisometries, but the whole Hilbert space turns out to be an irreducible unitary\nrepresentation of SL(2,R) and the time evolution is embodied in the unitary\nrepresentation.

It is essential in order to construct Triad operators\nthat enter the Hamiltonian constraint and which become densely defined\noperators on the full Hilbert space even though in the classical theory the\ntriad becomes singular when classical GR breaks down. The expression for the\nvolume and triad operators derives from the quantisation of the fundamental\nelectric flux operator of LQG by a complicated regularisation procedure. In\nfact, there are two inequivalent volume operators available in the literature\nand, moreover, both operators are unique only up to a finite, multiplicative\nconstant which should be viewed as a regularisation ambiguity. Now on the one\nhand, classical volumes and triads can be expressed directly in terms of fluxes\nand this fact was used to construct the corresponding volume and triad\noperators. On the other hand, fluxes can be expressed in terms of triads and\ntherefore one can also view the volume operator as fundamental and consider the\nflux operator as a derived operator.

The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical\ntheory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of\nquantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We\napply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to\nquantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular\nregion of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is\na second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above\nthe first level physical compression for the component regions.

Decreasing the electron density by only a\nfactor of 4 is already sufficient to bring the energy dependence within the\nexperimental bounds.

In multi-field models\nwith strong preheating (q \\gg 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear,\nwith the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k \\to 0).\nThis amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the\ninflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy\nperturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein\nfield equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial\nconditions.

This might facilitate the quick\nrelaxation from a large effective cosmological constant down to the observed\nvalue. Here, we analyse this possibility in some detail. In four dimensions,\nand after the moduli are stabilized, branes interact via repulsive long range\nforces. Because of that, the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for coincident\nbrane nucleation may not exist, unless there is some short range interaction\nwhich keeps the branes together.

The\nall-plus amplitudes correspond to self-dual field configurations and vanish in\nsupersymmetric theories. We make use of the tree-level Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT)\nrelations between open and closed string theory amplitudes, which in the\nlow-energy limit imply relations between gravity and gauge theory tree\namplitudes. For n < 7, we determine the all-plus amplitudes explicitly from\ntheir unitarity cuts. The KLT relations, applied to the cuts, allow us to\nextend to gravity a previously found `dimension-shifting' relation between (the\ncuts of) the all-plus amplitudes in gauge theory and the maximally\nhelicity-violating amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. The gravitational\nversion of the relation lets us determine the n < 7 N=8 supergravity amplitudes\nfrom the all-plus gravity amplitudes.

We use this fact in this paper to derive in arbitrary\ndimension relations between the topology of the timelike boundary-at-infinity,\n$\\scri$, and that of the spacetime interior to this boundary. We prove as a\nsimple corollary of topological censorship that any asymptotically anti-de\nSitter spacetime with a disconnected boundary-at-infinity necessarily contains\nblack hole horizons which screen the boundary components from each other. This\ncorollary may be viewed as a Lorentzian analog of the Witten and Yau result\nhep-th/9910245, but is independent of the scalar curvature of $\\scri$.\nFurthermore, the topology of V', the Cauchy surface (as defined for\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with boundary-at-infinity) for regions\nexterior to event horizons, is constrained by that of $\\scri$.

However the\ntransmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in\nspacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,\nchannel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space\nand time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)\nthe basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a\nnotion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group\nlabeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin.

As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed\nwithout inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if\nthe distance between detectors is rather small.
