This offers a fascinating arena to\nstudy the physics of broken gauge symmetry. However, the important symmetries\nin superconductors are not only the gauge invariance. Especially, the symmetry\nproperties of the pairing, i.e., the parity and spin-singlet/spin-triplet,\ndetermine the physical properties of the superconducting state. Recently it has\nbeen recognized that there is the important third symmetry of the pair\namplitude, i.e., even or odd parity with respect to the frequency. The\nconventional uniform superconducting states correspond to the even-frequency\npairing, but the recent finding is that the odd-frequency pair amplitude arises\nin the spatially non-uniform situation quite ubiquitously. Especially, this is\nthe case in the Andreev bound state (ABS) appearing at the surface/interface of\nthe sample. The other important recent development is on the nontrivial\ntopological aspects of superconductors. As the band insulators are classified\nby topological indices into (i) conventional insulator, (ii) quantum Hall\ninsulator, and (iii) topological insulator, also are the gapped\nsuperconductors. The influence of the nontrivial topology of the bulk states\nappears as the edge or surface of the sample. In the superconductors, this\nleads to the formation of zero energy ABS (ZEABS). Therefore, the ABSs of the\nsuperconductors are the place where the symmetry and topology meet each other\nwhich offer the stage of rich physics. In this review, we discuss the physics\nof ABS from the viewpoint of the odd-frequency pairing, the topological\nbulk-edge correspondence, and the interplay of these two issues. It is\ndescribed how the symmetry of the pairing and topological indices determines\nthe absence/presence of the ZEABS, its energy dispersion, and properties as the\nMajorana fermions. \n\n"}

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N. In the light of the above observations, we are in a position to state that\nto this date no case has come to light indicative of the failure of the LT\nunder the conditions for which it has been deduced.

For weak impurity-boson coupling, the suppression of\nthe density of states near the Fermi energy leads to quantum phase transitions\nbetween strong-coupling (Kondo) and local-moment phases. For sufficiently\nstrong impurity-boson coupling, however, the bare repulsion between a pair of\nelectrons in the impurity level becomes an effective attraction, leading to\nquantum phase transitions between strong-coupling (charge-Kondo) and\nlocal-charge phases.

In particular, samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$) has drawn much\nattention as it might represent a new class of condensed matter called\ntopological Kondo insulator. Kondo insulators (KI) can have non-trivial Z$_2$\ntopology because the energy gap opens at the Fermi energy ($E_F$) by\nhybridization between an odd- parity renormalized $f$ band and an even- parity\nconduction $d$ band. However, the characteristics of SmB$_6$ deviate from the\nconventional KI because its gap is insensitive to doping and pressure. Thus, it\nis unclear what makes the gap of SmB$_6$ different from that of KI, and how the\nband inversion features occur. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the\nimportance of charge fluctuations in SmB$_6$. Our angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) results reveal that with decreasing temperature the bottom\nof the $d$-$f$ hybridized band at the $\\bar{\\text{X}}$ point gradually shifts\nfrom below to above $E_F$. This shift accompanies a redistribution of spectral\nweight from the upper to the lower quasiparticle band, and reflects the change\nin both carrier density and the number of localized $f$ electron.

This demonstrates that the charge fluctuations do not only drive the\ninsulating bulk phase but also the non-trivial topological phase. \n\n"}

Gauging, for\nexample, the charge conservation symmetry leads to electromagnetic gauge\nfields. It is an open question whether an analogous process is possible for\ntime reversal which is an anti-unitary symmetry.

This\nquestion is at the heart of solid state NMR. There, an initially local\npolarization spreads all over due to spin-spin interactions that conserve the\ntotal spin projection, leading to an equilibration of the polarization. In\nprinciple, this quantum dynamics can be reversed by changing the sign of the\nHamiltonian.

In the ground state of quantum\nmany-body systems, its scaling is typically linear in the boundary of the\nsubsystem (area law).

It was shown that the Dirac magnon\nHamiltonian preserves time-reversal symmetry defined with the sublattice pseudo\nspins and the Dirac points are robust against magnon-magnon interactions. The\nDirac points also occur at nonzero energy. In this paper, we propose a simple\nrealization of nontrivial topology (magnon edge states) in this system.

Thus, the system realizes magnon edge states similar to Haldane\nmodel for quantum anomalous Hall effect in electronic systems. However, in\ncontrast to electronic spin current where dissipation can be very large due to\nOhmic heating, noninteracting topological magnons can propagate for long time\nwithout dissipation as magnons are uncharged particles.

In this\nmethod, the electron operator is factorized into a fermioninc spinon describing\nthe physical spin and a slave-spin describing the charge fluctuations.\nFollowing the $U(1)$ formalism derived by Yu and Si [Phys. Rev. B 86, 085104\n(2012)], it is shown that the self-consistent equations to explore various\nsymmetry-broken density wave states can be constructed in general with a\ncluster of multiple slave-spin sites. We employ this method to study the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) state in the single band Hubbard model with the two and\nfour-site clusters of slave spins. While the Hubbard gap, the charge gap due to\nthe doubly-occupied states, scales with the Hubbard interaction $U$ as\nexpected, the AFM gap $\\Delta$, the gap in the spinon dispersion in the AFM\nstate, exhibits a crossover from the weak to strong-coupling behaviors as $U$\nincreases. Our cluster slave-spin method reproduces not only the traditional\nmean-field behavior of $\\Delta \\sim U$ in the weak-coupling limit, but also the\nbehavior of $\\Delta \\sim t^2/U$ predicted by the superexchange mechanism in the\nstrong coupling limit. In addition, the holon-doublon correlator as functions\nof $U$ and doping $x$ is also computed, which exhibits a strong tendency toward\nthe holon-doublon binding in the strong coupling regime.

We study a transition in a 3D classical loop\nmodel that is analogous to a deconfined 2+1D quantum phase transition in a\nmagnet with reduced lattice symmetry. The transition is between the N\\'eel\nphase and a twofold degenerate valence bond solid (lattice-symmetry-breaking)\nphase. The combined order parameter at the transition is effectively a\nfour-component superspin. It has been argued that in some weakly first order\n`pseudocritical' deconfined phase transitions, the renormalization group flow\ncan take the system very close to the ordered fixed point of the symmetric\n$O(N)$ sigma model, where $N$ is the total number of `soft' order parameter\ncomponents, despite the fact that $O(N)$ is not a microscopic symmetry.

In the case of a singular flat\nband, its Bloch wave function possesses immovable discontinuities generated by\nthe band-crossing with other bands, and thus the vector bundle associated with\nthe flat band cannot be defined. This singularity precludes the compact\nlocalized states from forming a complete set spanning the flat band. Once the\ndegeneracy at the band crossing point is lifted, the singular flat band becomes\ndispersive and can acquire a finite Chern number in general, suggesting a new\nroute for obtaining a nearly flat Chern band. On the other hand, the Bloch wave\nfunction of a nonsingular flat band has no singularity, and thus forms a vector\nbundle. A nonsingular flat band can be completely isolated from other bands\nwhile preserving the perfect flatness. All one-dimensional flat bands belong to\nthe nonsingular class. We show that a singular flat band displays a novel\nbulk-boundary correspondence such that the presence of the robust boundary mode\nis guaranteed by the singularity of the Bloch wave function. Moreover, we\ndevelop a general scheme to construct a flat band model Hamiltonian in which\none can freely design its singular or nonsingular nature.

In particular, we study models harboring fracton order, both type-I\nand type-II, and compare the resulting ES with that of both conventional\ntopological order and of (strong) subsystem symmetry protected topological\n(SSPT) states. We find that non-local surface stabilizers (NLSS), a set of\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian which form on the boundary of the entanglement\ncut, act as purveyors of universal non-local features appearing in the\nentanglement spectrum.

We argue that dissipation due to particle-hole\nexcitations close to the Fermi surface is a relevant perturbation at low\ntemperatures and we estimate the crossover temperature T^* above which power\nlaw behavior in specific heat and magnetic response occurs ($C_V/T \\sim \\chi(T)\n\\propto T^{-1+\\lambda}$ with $\\lambda<1$).

The resulting\nHiggs-mediated interaction of monopoles leads to the appearance of a certain\nupper bound for the parameter of the weak-coupling approximation. Namely, when\nthis bound is exceeded, the cumulant expansion used for the average over the\nHiggs field breaks down. The finite-temperature deconfining phase transition\nwith the account for the same Higgs-mediated interaction of monopoles is\nfurther analysed. It is demonstrated that in the general case, accounting for\nthis interaction leads to the existence of two distinct phase transitions\nseparated by the temperature region where W-bosons exist in both, molecular and\nplasma, phases. The dependence of possible ranges of the critical temperatures\ncorresponding to these phase transitions on the parameters of the\nGeorgi-Glashow model is discussed. The difference in the RG behaviour of the\nfugacity of W-bosons from the respective behaviour of this quantity in the\ncompact-QED limit of the model is finally pointed out. \n\n"}

They can be regarded as\nhigher-dimensional analogues of twist and winding-state operators in free 2d\nCFTs. We call them monopole operators for reasons explained in the text. The\nimportance of monopole operators is that in the Higgs phase, they create\nAbrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices. We study properties of these operators in\nthree-dimensional QED using large N_f expansion. In particular, we show that\nmonopole operators belong to representations of the conformal group whose\nprimaries have dimension of order N_f. We also show that monopole operators\ntransform non-trivially under the flavor symmetry group, with the precise\nrepresentation depending on the value of the Chern-Simons coupling. \n\n"}

A one-loop field theory computation, which involves\nsolving a Heisenberg chain by means of the Bethe ansatz agrees with the large\nangular momentum limit of a rotating string. We point out that the Heisenberg\nchain can be equally well solved by using a sigma model approach. Moreover we\nalso show that a certain limit, akin to the BMN limit, leads exactly to the\nsame sigma model for a string rotating with large angular momentum. The\nagreement is then at the level of the action. As an upshot we propose that the\nrotating string should be identified with a coherent, semi-classical state\nbuilt out of the eigenstates of the spin chain. The agreement is then complete.\nFor example we show that the mean value of the spin <S> gives, precisely, the\nposition of the string in the bulk. This suggests a more precise formulation of\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence in the large-N limit and also indicates a way to\nobtain string theory duals of other gauge theories. \n\n"}
