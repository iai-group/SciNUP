Remarkably, its numerical value mu_{0 D} = 140\nM_{sun}/pc^2 = (18.6 Mev)^3 is approximately the same (up to a factor of two)\nin all these systems. First, we present the physical consequences of the\nindependence of mu_{0 D} on r_0: the energy scales as the volume sim r_0^3\nwhile the mass and the entropy scale as the surface ~ r_0^2 and the surface\ntimes log r_0, respectively. Namely, the entropy scales similarly to the\nblack-hole entropy but with a much smaller coefficient. Second, we compute the\nsurface gravity and the density profile for small scales from first principles\nand the evolution of primordial density fluctuations since the end of inflation\ntill today using the linearized Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. The density profile\nrho_{lin}(r) obtained in this way decreases as r^{-1-n_s/2} for intermediate\nscales where n_s = 0.964 is the primordial spectral index. This scaling is in\nremarkable agreement with the empirical behaviour found observationally and in\nN-body simulations: r^{-1.6\\pm 0.4}.

For 45\ntransiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths\nforward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semi-major axes\nand eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the\nnumber of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many\nas 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to\nbe viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation.\nThis is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism\nto explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have\nto be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on\nthe eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario we match the\nextremely large radius of WASP-12b. (Abridged) \n\n"}

This review presents a\ntheoretical overview of the early evolution of star clusters and the consequent\nlong term survival chances. It is suggested that clusters forming with initial\ndensities of >10^4 Msun pc-3 survive the gas expulsion, or \"infant mortality\",\nphase. At ~10 Myr they are bound and have densities of 10^{3+/-1} Msun pc-3.\nAfter this time they are stable against expansion by stellar evolution,\nencounters with giant molecular clouds and will most likely survive for another\nHubble time if they are in a moderate tidal field. Clusters with lower initial\ndensities (<100 Msun pc-3) will disperse into the field within a few 10s of\nMyrs. Some discussion is provided on how extra galactic star cluster\npopulations and especially their age distributions can be used to gain insight\nin disruption. \n\n"}

In the 10 observed fields, 35 HII\nregions are identified, of which 20 are newly discovered. Many of the HII\nregions are multiply peaked indicating the presence of a cluster of massive\nstars.

We investigate the effects of temperature-dependent cooling\nfunctions on the disc's gravitational stability through controlled numerical\nexperiments using an SPH code. We find that such cooling functions raise the\nsusceptibility of discs to fragmentation through the influence of temperature\nperturbations - the average value of Omega*tcool has to increase to prevent\nlocal variability leading to collapse. We find the effects of temperature\ndependence to be most significant in the \"opacity gap\" associated with dust\nsublimation, where the average value of Omega*tcool at fragmentation is\nincreased by over an order of magnitude. We then use this result to predict\nwhere protoplanetary discs will fragment into bound objects, in terms of radius\nand accretion rate.

In particular, the power of\nthe quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low, and the\nquadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of\nthe Solar system. It has been suggested in the literature that microwave sky\npollution by an unidentified dust cloud in the vicinity of the Solar system may\nbe the cause for these anomalies. In this paper, we simulate the thermal\nemission by clouds of spherical homogeneous particles of several materials.\nSpectral constraints from the WMAP multi-wavelength data and earlier infrared\nobservations on the hypothetical dust cloud are used to determine the dust\ncloud's physical characteristics. In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a\nflat, CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14\nmm), and to be invisible in the infrared light, its particles must be\nmacroscopic.

Planet\nformation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal\nmechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model.

Using the Spitzer Space Telescope and its IRAC camera on the\npost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation of\nHD80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 January 2010. We complement this\nphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneously\nperformed with SOPHIE at Haute-Provence Observatory. This provides radial\nvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previously\nuncovered with spectroscopy. This new data set allows the parameters of this\nsingular planetary system to be significantly refined. We obtained a\nplanet-to-star radius ratio R_p/R_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lower\nthan the one measured from previous ground observations. We detected a feature\nin the Spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot.

The sky-projected angle between the\nspin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to\nbe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin\nanomaly.

Particularly, we include the effects of gravitational\ninstabilities (wakes) that importantly enhance the disk's viscosity. We show\nthat common estimates of the disk's spreading time-scales with constant\nviscosity significantly underestimate the rings' lifetime. With a realistic\nviscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary\nstages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with\nthe formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally\ngravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2\n(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the\nspreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become\nnot-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk\nbecomes completely not-self-gravitating. At this point its evolution\ndramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,\nwhich significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with\nconstant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with\nthe realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of\nconstant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our\nmodel.

Here we suggest a novel solution to the\nhomochirality problem based on a recently proposed thermodynamic dissipation\ntheory for the origin of life. Homochirality is suggested to have been\nincorporated gradually into the emerging life as a result of asymmetric right-\nover left-handed photon-induced denaturation of RNA/DNA occurring when Archean\nsea surface temperatures became close to the denaturing temperatures of\nRNA/DNA. This differential denaturing success would have been promoted by the\nsomewhat right-handed circularly polarized submarine light of the late\nafternoon when surface water temperatures are highest, and a negative circular\ndichroism band extending from 220 nm up to 260 nm for small segments of\nRNA/DNA.

While young low-mass stars show a wide range of rotation\nperiods, many CTTS are slow rotators, spinning at a small fraction of break-up,\nand their rotation period does not seem to shorten, despite the fact that they\nare actively accreting and contracting. Matt & Pudritz (2005) proposed that the\nspin-down torque of a stellar wind powered by a fraction of the accretion\nenergy would be strong enough to balance the spin-up torque due to accretion.\nSince this model establishes a direct relation between accretion and ejection,\nthe observable stellar parameters (mass, radius, rotation period, magnetic\nfield) and the accretion diagnostics (accretion shock luminosity), can be used\nto constraint the wind characteristics. In particular, since the accretion\nenergy powers both the stellar wind and the shock emission, we show in this\nletter how the accretion shock luminosity L_UV can provide upper limits to the\nspin-down efficiency of the stellar wind. It is found that luminous sources\nwith L_UV > 0.1 L_Sun and typical dipolar field components < 1 kG do not allow\nspin equilibrium solutions. Lower luminosity stars (L_UV < 0.1 L_Sun) are\ncompatible with a zero-torque condition, but the corresponding stellar winds\nare still very demanding in terms of mass and energy flux.

These three different populations correspond to evolved\nphases of Main Sequence (MS) OB stars. Axial rotation and mass loss have a\ngreat influence on massive star evolution in general and more specifically on\nthe durations of these different phases. Moderate rotation and mass loss,\nduring the MS phase, favor the evolution towards the RSG stage. Fast rotation\nand strong mass loss during the MS phase, in contrast, prevent the star from\nbecoming a RSG and allow the star to pass directly from the OB star phase into\nthe WR phase. Mass loss during the RSG stage may make the star evolve back in\nthe blue part of the HR diagram. We argue that such an evolution may be more\ncommon than presently accounted for in stellar models.

SEREN is designed in a flexible, modular style, thereby allowing a\nlarge number of options to be selected or disabled easily and without\ncompromising performance. SEREN uses the conservative `grad-h' formulation of\nSPH, but can easily be configured to use traditional SPH or Godunov SPH.\nThermal physics is treated either with a barotropic equation of state, or by\nsolving the energy equation and modelling the transport of cooling radiation. A\nBarnes-Hut tree is used to obtain neighbour lists and compute gravitational\naccelerations efficiently, and an hierarchical time-stepping scheme is used to\nreduce the number of computations per timestep. Dense gravitationally bound\nobjects are replaced by sink particles, to allow the simulation to be evolved\nlonger, and to facilitate the identification of protostars and the compilation\nof stellar and binary properties. At the termination of a hydrodynamical\nsimulation, SEREN has the option of switching to a pure N-body simulation,\nusing a 4th-order Hermite integrator, and following the ballistic evolution of\nthe sink particles (e.g. to determine the final binary statistics once a star\ncluster has relaxed).

The\nmotivation comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of $\\sim\n10^{15}$G, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after the\nmagnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong toroidal magnetic\nfields. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidal\nmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of\nrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and\nrigidly rotating models. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler\ninstabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. For both\nnon-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary\ninstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The\ninterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is\nthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in\nthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,\nunstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is\ndeveloped. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.\nContrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an\nequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence.

Seven of\nthe clusters feature main sequence turnoff (MSTO) regions that are wider than\ncan be accounted for by a simple stellar population, whereas their red giant\nbranches indicate a single value of [Fe/H]. The star clusters cover a range in\npresent-day mass from about 1E4 to 2E5 solar masses. We compare radial\ndistributions of stars in the upper and lower parts of the MSTO region, and\ncalculate cluster masses and escape velocities from the present time back to a\ncluster age of 10 Myr. Our main result is that for all clusters in our sample\nwith estimated escape velocities > 15 km/s at an age of 10 Myr, the stars in\nthe brightest half of the MSTO region are significantly more centrally\nconcentrated than the stars in the faintest half AND more massive red giant\nbranch and asymptotic giant branch stars.

For a qualitative\nestimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal\nphase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our\nmodel is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The\ndifference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low\nfrequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in\nlarger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and\nrheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the\nsame rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being\nnegligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the\nseismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)\nbecomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what\none might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate\ndeviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,\nand this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in\nmagnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the\nprimary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses\nthe synchronous orbit. We describe the mantle rheology with the Andrade model,\nallowing it to lean towards the Maxwell model at the lowest frequencies. To\nimplement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by\nendowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale\nto the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle. Some uncertainty in this\nparameter's frequency-dependence does not influence our principal conclusions. \n\n"}

{"id": "1106.4179", "contents": "Title: Formation of stars and planets: the role of magnetic fields Abstract: Star formation is thought to be triggered by gravitational collapse of the\ndense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc. Both processes are powered by the\naction of magnetic fields and are, in turn, likely to strongly affect the\nstructure, dynamics, evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their\nhost discs.

Since continuous tracking\nof global network state at all nodes is practically impossible, nodes can only\nacquire limited local views of the whole network to design their transmission\nstrategies. In this paper, we study multi-layer wireless networks and assume\nthat each node has only a limited knowledge, namely 1-local view, where each\nS-D pair has enough information to perform optimally when other pairs do not\ninterfere, along with connectivity information for rest of the network. We\ninvestigate the information-theoretic limits of communication with such limited\nknowledge at the nodes. We develop a novel transmission strategy, namely Coded\nLayer Scheduling, that solely relies on 1-local view at the nodes and\nincorporates three different techniques: (1) per layer interference avoidance,\n(2) repetition coding to allow overhearing of the interference, and (3) network\ncoding to allow interference neutralization.

A repulsion of the critical zeros of these L-functions\naway from the center of the critical strip was observed numerically by S. J.\nMiller in 2006; such behaviour deviates qualitatively from the conjectural\nlimiting distribution of the zeros (for large conductors this distribution is\nexpected to approach the one-level density of eigenvalues of orthogonal\nmatrices after appropriate rescaling).Our purpose here is to provide a random\nmatrix model for Miller's surprising discovery. We consider the family of even\nquadratic twists of a given elliptic curve. The main ingredient in our model is\na calculation of the eigenvalue distribution of random orthogonal matrices\nwhose characteristic polynomials are larger than some given value at the\nsymmetry point in the spectra. We call this sub-ensemble of SO(2N) the excised\northogonal ensemble. The sieving-off of matrices with small values of the\ncharacteristic polynomial is akin to the discretization of the central values\nof L-functions implied by the formula of Waldspurger and Kohnen-Zagier.The\ncut-off scale appropriate to modeling elliptic curve L-functions is\nexponentially small relative to the matrix size N. The one-level density of the\nexcised ensemble can be expressed in terms of that of the well-known Jacobi\nensemble, enabling the former to be explicitly calculated. It exhibits an\nexponentially small (on the scale of the mean spacing) hard gap determined by\nthe cut-off value, followed by soft repulsion on a much larger scale. Neither\nof these features is present in the one-level density of SO(2N). When N tends\nto infinity we recover the limiting orthogonal behaviour. Our results agree\nqualitatively with Miller's discrepancy. Choosing the cut-off appropriately\ngives a model in good quantitative agreement with the number-theoretical data. \n\n"}

In a previous work, we have\ndeveloped a family of subspace codes, based upon the Koetter-Kschichang\nconstruction, which are efficiently list decodable.

The\nresulting error correction radius can be expressed as follows: for any integer\n$s$, our list-decoder using $s+1$-interpolation polynomials guarantees\nsuccessful recovery of the message subspace provided the normalized dimension\nof errors is at most $s(1-sR)$. The same list-decoding algorithm can be used to\ncorrect erasures as well as errors.

We apply a\nporosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,\nwhich allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of\nimpact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and\ninstead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation\nhas been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of\na high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can\nevolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than\n0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show\nthat the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth.\nThis acceleration is a natural consequence of particles' aerodynamical property\nat low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path\nof the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates\nare found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10 AU\n(assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model).

In response, we propose a\nprobabilistic dynamic CS signal model that captures both amplitude and support\ncorrelation structure, and describe an approximate message passing algorithm\nthat performs soft signal estimation and support detection with a computational\ncomplexity that is linear in all problem dimensions. The algorithm, DCS-AMP,\ncan perform either causal filtering or non-causal smoothing, and is capable of\nlearning model parameters adaptively from the data through an\nexpectation-maximization learning procedure. We provide numerical evidence that\nDCS-AMP performs within 3 dB of oracle bounds on synthetic data under a variety\nof operating conditions. We further describe the result of applying DCS-AMP to\ntwo real dynamic CS datasets, as well as a frequency estimation task, to\nbolster our claim that DCS-AMP is capable of offering state-of-the-art\nperformance and speed on real-world high-dimensional problems. \n\n"}

Observed differences in\ntemperatures, outflow speeds, and velocity distribution anisotropies are useful\nconstraints on proposed explanations for how the plasma is heated and\naccelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of collisionless\nheating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come\nfrom magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical\ndescription of the radial evolution of Alfven, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD\nwaves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of\ndistance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next we\nsolved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady\nwavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling\nbetween the Alfven and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable\nchoices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the\nfast mode to the Alfven mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron\nresonance. This resonance is efficient at heating protons and other ions in the\ndirection perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and our model\npredicts heating rates for these species that agree well with both\nspectroscopic and in situ measurements. Nonetheless, the high-frequency waves\ncomprise only a small part of the total Alfvenic fluctuation spectrum, which\nremains highly two-dimensional as is observed in interplanetary space. \n\n"}

The total dust mass of the disk may be on the order of 1e-4\nM_sun, only weakly constrained due to the lack of long wavelength observations\nand the uncertainties in the dust model. The scale height of the\nsub-micron-sized dust is ~6 AU at the cavity edge, and the cavity wall is\noptically thick in the vertical direction at H-band. PDS 70 is not a member of\nthe class of (pre-)transitional disks identified by Dong et al.

The 2:1 resonance, which is near the\nouter edge of the main Kuiper Belt, has a large range of colors with similar\nnumbers of moderately red and ultra-red objects at all inclinations.

The proposed function provides an\nextraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with\nMach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. Compared to a\nlognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of\nmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This\nis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding\nmagnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T\nthat increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can\nbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)\nvelocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,\nand we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a\ncontinuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. It provides a new\nand unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not just\nvelocity) structure of turbulence. We show that this naturally explains some\napparent contradictory results in the literature based on use of different\nmoments of the density PDF, as well as differences based on whether\nvolume-weighted or mass-weighted quantities are measured. We show how these are\nfundamentally related to the fact that mass conservation requires violations of\nlog-normal statistics. \n\n"}

Further, considering\ndistributed relays employing a single antenna in the two-way interference\nchannel and the three-user fully-connected Y channel, achievable sum-DoF are\nalso derived in the two-way interference channel and the three-user\nfully-connected Y channel. A major implication of the derived DoF results is\nthat a relay with multiple antennas or multiple relays employing a single\nantenna increases the capacity scaling law of the multi-user interference\nnetwork when multiple directional information flows are considered, even if the\nnetworks are fully-connected and all nodes operate in half-duplex.

I:\n  Hydrodynamics Abstract: We use 3D hydrodynamical models to investigate the effects of massive star\nfeedback from winds and supernovae on inhomogeneous molecular material left\nover from the formation of a massive stellar cluster. We simulate the\ninteraction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with 3 O-stars into a\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 solar masses of molecular\nmaterial within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular\nclump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is\nentrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly\nresistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other\ndense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is\ngradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in\nexcess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per\ncent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the\ndifference being radiated. After 4.4 Myr, the massive stars in our simulation\nbegin to explode as supernovae. The highly structured environment into which\nthe SN energy is released allows even weaker coupling to the remaining dense\nmaterial and practically all of the SN energy reaches the wider environment.\nThe molecular material is almost completely dispersed and destroyed after 6\nMyr. The escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be about 50 per\ncent during the first 4 Myr of the cluster's life. A similar model with a\nlarger and more massive GMC clump reveals the same general picture, though more\ntime is needed for it to be destroyed. \n\n"}

Massive cores make hot planets Abstract: The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet\nformation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important\nphysical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and\neven more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or\ngravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the\npost-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core\naccretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct\nself-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets\nwith masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120\nEarth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant\nplanets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a\nfactor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian\nmass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well\ndefined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For\nmassive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core\naccretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start\nscenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the\nmechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or\nduring gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make\nno claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets.\nBut if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation\nmechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more\nluminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational\ninstability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity\ncould also be caused simply by a more massive core. \n\n"}

These descriptions are exploited at\nthe destination and the DF relays aim to decode the transmitted messages while\ncreating full cooperation among the nodes. Moreover, the destination and the DF\nrelays can independently select the set of descriptions to be decoded or\ntreated as interference.

It is known that the optimal exponential\nrate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood\nratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q.\n  We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in\nP and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on\nthe previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having\nobserved all the previous samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k\nin Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in\nthis case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple\nmaximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q.\n  We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis\ntesting for quantum states using restricted measurements.

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain\nexplicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and\ndelineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in\nsystems with massive (>10^{-2}M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is\nusually determined by the gravity of the eccentric disk alone, and is\ncomparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower\nlimit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.\nThis fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses\nor if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity. \n\n"}

An\napplication where realistic uncertainty assessments are especially important is\nthe intermediate neutron capture process or i process: a neutron capture regime\nwith neutron densities intermediate between the slow and rapid processes.\nAccordingly, the main network flux proceeds on the neutron-rich unstable\nisotopes up to 4-5 species off the valley of stability.

We study how large-scale poloidal fields evolve in accretion disks,\nwith the primary aim of quantifying the viability of magnetic accretion\nmechanisms in protoplanetary disks. We employ a kinematic mean-field model for\npoloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a\nfield balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit\non the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks.

The major bottleneck in such\ncomputations is the computation of lightcurves.

The CSI is estimated at the\nreceiver by training via a preamble, and fed back to the transmitter. The\nchannel estimate is more accurate when longer preamble is used, but less time\nis left for wireless power transfer before the channel changes. To maximize the\nharvested energy, in this paper, we address the key challenge of balancing the\ntime resource used for channel estimation and wireless power transfer (WPT),\nand also investigate the allocation of energy resource used for wireless power\ntransfer. First, we consider the general scenario where the preamble length is\nallowed to vary dynamically. Taking into account the effects of imperfect CSI,\nthe optimal preamble length is obtained online by solving a dynamic programming\n(DP) problem. The solution is shown to be a threshold-type policy that depends\nonly on the channel estimate power. Next, we consider the scenario in which the\npreamble length is fixed. The optimal preamble length is optimized offline.\nFurthermore, we derive the optimal power allocation schemes for both scenarios.\nFor the scenario of dynamic-length preamble, the power is allocated according\nto both the optimal preamble length and the channel estimate power; while for\nthe scenario of fixed-length preamble, the power is allocated according to only\nthe channel estimate power. The analysis results are validated by numerical\nsimulations. Encouragingly, with optimal power allocation, the harvested energy\nby using optimized fixed-length preamble is almost the same as the harvested\nenergy by employing dynamic-length preamble, hence allowing a low-complexity\nWPT system to be implemented in practice. \n\n"}

In the first transmission scheme, two\nantennas are used only at the relay, Adaptive Network Coding (ANC) is employed\nat the relay and the relay transmits a CIOD Space Time Block Code (STBC). This\ngives a better performance compared to an existing ANC scheme for two-way relay\nchannel which uses one antenna each at all the three nodes. It is shown that\nfor this scheme at high SNR the average end-to-end symbol error probability\n(SEP) is upper bounded by twice the SEP of a point-to-point fading channel. In\nthe second transmission scheme, two transmit antennas are used at all the three\nnodes, CIOD STBC's are transmitted in multiple access and broadcast phases.\nThis scheme provides a diversity order of two for the average end-to-end SEP\nwith an increased decoding complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(M^3)$ for an arbitrary\nsignal set and $\\mathcal{O}(M^2\\sqrt{M})$ for square QAM signal set. \n\n"}

This system\nconsists of two confirmed transiting planets, Kepler-51b ($P_{\\rm b} =\n45.2\\,\\mathrm{days}$) and Kepler-51c ($P_{\\rm c} = 85.3\\,\\mathrm{days}$), and\none transiting planet candidate KOI-620.02 ($P_{02} = 130.2\\,\\mathrm{days}$),\nwhich lie close to a $1:2:3$ resonance chain.

With the\ngoal of maximizing the secondary user (SU) throughput subject to constraints on\nthe primary user (PU) outage probability we formulate a joint problem of\nspectrum sensing and channel state estimation. The problem is cast into a\nsequential framework since sensing time minimization is crucial for throughput\nmaximization. In the optimum solution, the sensing decision rule is coupled\nwith the channel estimator, making the separate treatment of the sensing and\nchannel estimation strictly suboptimal. Using such a joint structure for\nspectrum sensing and channel estimation we propose a distributed (cooperative)\ndynamic spectrum access scheme under statistical channel state information\n(CSI).

This method is based upon\ntools from hypergraph theory. The deletion channel is represented by a\nhypergraph whose edges are the deletion balls (or spheres), so that a\ndeletion-correcting code becomes a matching in this hypergraph. Consequently, a\nbound on the size of such a code can be obtained from bounds on the matching\nnumber of a hypergraph. Classical results in hypergraph theory are then invoked\nto compute an upper bound on the matching number as a solution to a\nlinear-programming problem.\n  The method by Kulkarni and Kiyavash can be applied not only for the deletion\nchannel but also for other error channels. This paper studies this method in\nits most general setup. First, it is shown that if the error channel is regular\nand symmetric then this upper bound coincides with the sphere packing bound and\nthus is called the generalized sphere packing bound. Even though this bound is\nexplicitly given by a linear programming problem, finding its exact value may\nstill be a challenging task. In order to simplify the complexity of the\nproblem, we present a technique based upon graph automorphisms that in many\ncases reduces the number of variables and constraints in the problem.

To realize\nsufficient link margin, mmWave systems will employ directional beamforming with\nlarge antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver. Due to the high cost\nand power consumption of gigasample mixed-signal devices, mmWave precoding will\nlikely be divided among the analog and digital domains. The large number of\nantennas and the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of\nmmWave-specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. This paper\ndevelops an adaptive algorithm to estimate the mmWave channel parameters that\nexploits the poor scattering nature of the channel. To enable the efficient\noperation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical multi-resolution codebook is\ndesigned to construct training beamforming vectors with different beamwidths.\nFor single-path channels, an upper bound on the estimation error probability\nusing the proposed algorithm is derived, and some insights into the efficient\nallocation of the training power among the adaptive stages of the algorithm are\nobtained.

As these systems are expected to be\nCompton-thick, photons above 13.6 eV are largely absorbed and re-processed into\nlower energy bands. It follows that direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are\nvery bright in the LW/NIR bands, typically outshining small high-redshift\ngalaxies by more than 10 times. Once the first DCBHs form, they then trigger a\nrunaway process of further DCBH formation, producing a sudden rise in their\ncosmic mass density. The universe enters the \"DCBH era\" at $z \\approx 20$ when\na large fraction of atomic-cooling halos are experiencing DCBH formation. By\ncombining the clustering properties of the radiation sources with Monte Carlo\nsimulations we show that in this scenario the DCBH mass density rises from\n$\\sim 5$~$M_\\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z\\sim 30$ to the peak value $\\sim5\\times10^5\nM_\\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \\sim 14$ in our fiducial model.

At some point, this mode\nspontaneously and randomly changes to a strongly-coupled mode, the transition\noccurring with a mass-dependent lifetime that is of order 100 MYr.

Six\n  signals in the radial velocity data for GJ876 Abstract: The hunt for Earth analogue planets orbiting Sun-like stars has forced the\nintroduction of novel methods to detect signals at, or below, the level of the\nintrinsic noise of the observations. We present a new global periodogram method\nthat returns more information than the classic Lomb-Scargle periodogram method\nfor radial velocity signal detection. Our method uses the Minimum Mean Squared\nError as a framework to determine the optimal number of genuine signals present\nin a radial velocity timeseries using a global search algorithm, meaning we can\ndiscard noise spikes from the data before follow-up analysis.

{"id": "1404.6940", "contents": "Title: The compressional beta effect: a source of zonal winds in planets? Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak\nvertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a\nlarge number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than\npredicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context. \n\n"}

D2D enables efficient reuse\nof the licensed spectrum to support localized transmissions, while M2M\nconnections are often characterized by fixed and low transmission rates. D2D\nconnections can be instrumental in localized aggregation of uplink M2M traffic\nto a more capable cellular device, before being finally delivered to the Base\nStation (BS). In this paper we show that a fixed M2M rate is an enabler of\nefficient Machine-Type D2D underlay operation taking place simultaneously with\nanother \\emph{downlink} cellular transmission. In the considered scenario, a BS\n$B$ transmits to a user $U$, while there are $N_M$ Machine-Type Devices (MTDs)\nattached to $U$, all sending simultaneously to $U$ and each using the same rate\n$R_M$. While assuming that $B$ knows the channel $B-U$, but not the interfering\nchannels from the MTDs to $U$, we prove that there is a positive downlink rate\nthat can always be decoded by $U$, leading to zero-outage of the downlink\nsignal. This is a rather surprising consequence of the features of the multiple\naccess channel and the fixed rate $R_M$. We also consider the case of a\nsimpler, single-user decoder at $U$ with successive interference cancellation.\nHowever, with single-user decoder, a positive zero-outage rate exists only when\n$N_M=1$ and is zero when $N_M>1$.

The DoF outer bounds reveal a fundamental rank-matching phenomenon,\nreminiscent of impedance matching in circuit theory. It is well known that the\nmaximum power transfer in a circuit is achieved not for the maximum or minimum\nload impedance but for the load impedance that matches the source impedance.\nSimilarly, the maximum DoF in the rank- constrained 2 X 2 X 2 MIMO interference\nnetwork is achieved not for the maximum or minimum ranks of the destination\nhop, but when the ranks of the destination hop match the ranks of the source\nhop. In fact, for mismatched settings of interest, the outer bounds identify a\nDoF loss penalty that is precisely equal to the rank-mismatch between the two\nhops.

The orbital\ninclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace plane is ~8 deg, which is\nunexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from a\ncircumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process\nhas pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero\n(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to\n0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present\nvalue (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction\nfrom captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough).

Abstract: The formation of the present configuration of three hot super-Earths in the\nplanet system HD 40307 is a challenge to dynamical astronomers. With the two\nsuccessive period ratios both near and slightly larger than 2, the system may\nhave evolved from pairwise 2:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this paper, we\ninvestigate the evolutions of the period ratios of the three planets after the\nprimordial gas disk was depleted. Three routines are found to probably result\nin the current configuration under tidal dissipation with the center star, they\nare: (i) through apsidal alignment only; (ii) out of pairwise 2:1 MMRs, then\nthrough apsidal alignment; (iii) out of the 4:2:1 Laplace Resonance (LR) , then\nthrough apsidal alignment. All the three scenarios require the initial\neccentricities of planets $\\sim0.15$, which implies a planetary scattering\nhistory during and after the gas disk was depleted. All the three routines will\ngo through the apsidal alignment phase, and enter a state with near-zero\neccentricities finally. We also find some special characteristics for each\nroutine. If the system went through pairwise 2:1 MMRs at the beginning, the MMR\nof the outer two planets would be broken first to reach the current state. As\nfor routine (iii), the planets would be out of the Laplace Resonance at the\nplace where some high-order resonances are located.

Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the\nconfounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying\na multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an\nassumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends\nlinearly on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to\ndistinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the existence of\nan offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We perform this\nanalysis first for stars that present a clear lithium detection exclusively and\ninclude in a second analysis upper lithium measurements.\n  Results. Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of\nlinearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance\nbetween planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. We concluded that an inflation\non the lithium uncertainty estimations by a factor of larger than 5 is required\nto render the measured offset compatible with zero at less than 3-4 {\\sigma}\nand make it non-significant. We demonstrated that the offset as delivered by\nour method depends on the different nature of the stars in the two samples.

Moreover, the measured depletion is\nstill significant when one imposes different constraints on the dataset, such\nas a limit in planetary mass or constrain the host temperature to around solar\nvalue.

Unlike the\nnearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars contain radiative cores that\nspin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower than they\nwould in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the\nrole of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low\nmass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively\nexcited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential\nrotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into\nsub-giants, however, low frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and\ncannot propagate below the hydrogen burning shell, allowing the spin of the\ncore to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the\nbase of the sub-giant branch when stars have surface temperatures of roughly\n5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region,\nimplying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep\ncore near the hydrogen burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region\nmay also prevent the core from accreting high-angular momentum material and\nslow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant\nbranch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance\nshear within the radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of\nviscous/magnetic torques. \n\n"}

A possible channel for producing such\nmisaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's\norbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a\nrecent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot\nJupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often\nchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. Here we explore the\norigin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealized\nnon-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit are\nstrictly periodic. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set of\nsecular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of these\nresonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolution\nof stellar spin axis. The degree of chaos in the system depends on the\nadiabaticity parameter $\\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the Lidov-Kozai\nnodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends on\nthe planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate. For systems\nwith zero initial spin-orbit misalignment, our theory explains the occurrence\n(as a function of $\\epsilon$) of \"periodic islands\" in the middle of a \"chaotic\nocean\" of spin evolution, and the occurrence of restricted chaos in middle of\nregular/periodic spin evolution. Finally, we discuss a novel \"adiabatic\nresonance advection\" phenomenon, in which the spin-orbit misalignment, trapped\nin a resonance, gradually evolves as the adiabaticity parameter slowly changes.\nThis phenomenon can occur for certain parameter regimes when tidal decay of the\nplanetary orbit is included. \n\n"}

For\ninstance, stellar companions may have facilitated the inward migration of hot\nJupiters towards to their present day positions. Many observed short period gas\ngiant planets also have orbits that are misaligned with respect to their star's\nspin axis, which has also been attributed to the presence of a massive outer\ncompanion on a non-coplanar orbit.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that\nthe transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's\norbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing\nthe outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold\ntransiting planets. \n\n"}

We find\nthat even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets\nstill do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on\nwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so\nquickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the\ngap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the\nplanet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been\nbriefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of\nprotoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial\nit is for gap-opening.

Five new companions were revealed with our\nprogram. In total, we identify 188 (42%) binary or multiple star systems. The\nmultiplicity of the sample is examined with regards to the detection of\ncircumstellar disks for stars of spectral types AFGK.\n  In general, disks are less commonly detected around binaries than single\nstars, though the disk frequency is comparable among A stars regardless of\nmultiplicity.

Analytical perturbation theory predicts the\nexistence of nested circumbinary orbits that are generalizations of circular\npaths around a single star. These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star. Here,\nwe review the theory and confirm its predictions with a suite of representative\nsimulations. We then consider the circumbinary planets discovered with NASA's\nKepler satellite. These Neptune- and Jupiter-size planets, or their\nplanetesimal precursors, may have migrated inward to reach their observed\norbits, since their current positions are outside of unstable zones caused by\noverlapping resonances. In situ formation without migration seems less likely,\nonly because the surface density of the protoplanetary disks must be\nimplausibly high.

However, these methods are\nknown to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late\ntimes, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC\ncan indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are\nmade. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small. The second modification is the introduction\nof a particle remapping procedure that periodically re-expresses the dark\nmatter distribution function using a new set of particles. We describe a\nremapping algorithm that is third-order accurate and adaptive in phase space.\nThis procedure prevents the accumulation of numerical errors in integrating the\nparticle trajectories from growing large enough to significantly degrade the\nsolution. Once both of these changes are made, PIC converges at second order on\nthe Zel'dovich Pancake problem, even at late times, after many caustics have\nformed. Furthermore, the resulting scheme does not suffer from the unphysical,\nsmall-scale \"clumping\" phenomenon known to occur on the Pancake problem when\nthe perturbation wave vector is not aligned with one of the Cartesian\ncoordinate axes. \n\n"}

Thanks to this quantized mapping we are first\nable to show that, with high probability, an embedding of a bounded set\n$\\mathcal K \\subset \\mathbb R^N$ in $\\delta \\mathbb Z^M$ can be achieved when\ndistances in the quantized and in the original domains are measured with the\n$\\ell_1$- and $\\ell_2$-norm, respectively, and provided the number of quantized\nobservations $M$ is large before the square of the \"Gaussian mean width\" of\n$\\mathcal K$. In this case, we show that the embedding is actually\n\"quasi-isometric\" and only suffers of both multiplicative and additive\ndistortions whose magnitudes decrease as $M^{-1/5}$ for general sets, and as\n$M^{-1/2}$ for structured set, when $M$ increases. Second, when one is only\ninterested in characterizing the maximal distance separating two elements of\n$\\mathcal K$ mapped to the same quantized vector, i.e., the \"consistency width\"\nof the mapping, we show that for a similar number of measurements and with high\nprobability this width decays as $M^{-1/4}$ for general sets and as $1/M$ for\nstructured ones when $M$ increases. Finally, as an important aspect of our\nwork, we also establish how the non-Gaussianity of the mapping impacts the\nclass of vectors that can be embedded or whose consistency width provably\ndecays when $M$ increases. \n\n"}

Here, I present the main conclusions from a\ncomprehensive atmospheric retrieval survey of eight hot Jupiters with\ndetectable molecular absorption in their near-infrared transmission spectra. I\nanalyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed,\nself-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a\nthick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a\nsimilar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if\nstar spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be\nregarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary\natmospheres.

Abstract: While the authors of Batch Normalization (BN) identify and address an\nimportant problem involved in training deep networks-- \\textit{Internal\nCovariate Shift}-- the current solution has certain drawbacks. For instance, BN\ndepends on batch statistics for layerwise input normalization during training\nwhich makes the estimates of mean and standard deviation of input\n(distribution) to hidden layers inaccurate due to shifting parameter values\n(especially during initial training epochs). Another fundamental problem with\nBN is that it cannot be used with batch-size $ 1 $ during training. We address\nthese drawbacks of BN by proposing a non-adaptive normalization technique for\nremoving covariate shift, that we call \\textit{Normalization Propagation}. Our\napproach does not depend on batch statistics, but rather uses a\ndata-independent parametric estimate of mean and standard-deviation in every\nlayer thus being computationally faster compared with BN.

In this paper, we study the stability and delay\nanalysis for two cooperative relaying schemes; the sensing-based cooperative\n(SBC) scheme and the decision-based cooperative (DBC) scheme. In the SBC\nscheme, the relay senses the channel at the beginning of each time slot. In the\nidle time slots, the relay transmits the packet at the head of its queue, while\nin the busy one, the relay decides either to transmit simultaneously with the\nsource terminal or to listen to the source transmission. The SBC scheme is a\nnovel paradigm that utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than the other\ncooperative schemes because the relay not only exploits the idle time slots,\nbut also has the capability to mildly interfere with the source terminal.

Tidal dissipation in stellar\nconvective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of\nshort-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)\ndepends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified\ntwo-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal\ndissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the\nconversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium\nflow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent\nconvection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of\nthe dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence\nand on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$.

The first makes use of a dark energy barotropic\nfluid entering \\emph{by hand} the energy-momentum tensor of Einstein's theory.\nThe second lies on extending the Hilbert-Einstein action giving rise to the\nclass of extended theories of gravity. In this work, we propose a third\napproach, derived as an intrinsic geometrical effect of space-time, which\nprovides repulsive regions under certain circumstances. We demonstrate that the\neffects of repulsive gravity naturally emerge in the field of a homogeneous and\nisotropic universe. To this end, we use an invariant definition of repulsive\ngravity based upon the behavior of the curvature eigenvalues. Moreover, we show\nthat repulsive gravity counterbalances the standard gravitational attraction\ninfluencing both late and early times of the universe evolution. This\nphenomenon leads to the present speed up and to the fast expansion due to the\ninflationary epoch. In so doing, we are able to unify both dark energy and\ninflation in a single scheme, showing that the universe changes its dynamics\nwhen ${\\ddot H\\over H}=-2\\dot H$, at the repulsion onset time where this\ncondition is satisfied. Further, we argue that the spatial scalar curvature can\nbe taken as vanishing because it does not affect at all the emergence of\nrepulsive gravity.

In order\nto derive rigorous recovery results, the measurement map is usually modeled\nprobabilistically. We derive sufficient conditions on the minimal amount of\nmeasurements ensuring recovery via convex optimization. We establish our\nresults via certain properties of the null space of the measurement map. In the\nsetting where the measurements are realized as Frobenius inner products with\nindependent standard Gaussian random matrices we show that $10 r (n_1 + n_2)$\nmeasurements are enough to uniformly and stably recover an $n_1 \\times n_2$\nmatrix of rank at most $r$. We then significantly generalize this result by\nonly requiring independent mean-zero, variance one entries with four finite\nmoments at the cost of replacing $10$ by some universal constant. We also study\nthe case of recovering Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices from measurement matrices\nproportional to rank-one projectors. For $m \\geq C r n$ rank-one projective\nmeasurements onto independent standard Gaussian vectors, we show that nuclear\nnorm minimization uniformly and stably reconstructs Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices\nwith high probability. Next, we partially de-randomize this by establishing an\nanalogous statement for projectors onto independent elements of a complex\nprojective 4-designs at the cost of a slightly higher sampling rate $m \\geq C\nrn \\log n$. Moreover, if the Hermitian matrix to be recovered is known to be\npositive semidefinite, then we show that the nuclear norm minimization approach\nmay be replaced by minimizing the $\\ell_2$-norm of the residual subject to the\npositive semidefinite constraint. Then no estimate of the noise level is\nrequired a priori. We discuss applications in quantum physics and the phase\nretrieval problem. \n\n"}

The\nfeasibility of their dense deployments depends on the existence of a high\ndata-rate transport network that can provide high-data backhaul from an\naggregation node where data traffic originates and terminates, to every such\nsmall cell. Due to the limited range of radio signals in the high frequency\nbands, multihop wireless connection may need to be established between each\naccess node and an aggregation node. In this paper, we present a novel\ntransmission scheme for wireless multihop backhaul for 5G networks. The scheme\nconsists of 1) {\\em group successive relaying} that established a relay\nschedule to efficiently exploit half-duplex relays and 2) an optimized\nquantize-map-and-forward (QMF) coding scheme that improves the performance of\nQMF and reduces the decoding complexity and the delay.

We consider a scenario where sensors need to identify\nwhether a given event has occurred based on its periodic, noisy, observations\nof a given signal. Such information about the signal needs to be sent to a\nfusion center that decides about the actual state at that specific observation\ntime. The communication links -- single- or multi-hop -- are modeled as binary\nsymmetric channels, which may have different error probabilities. The decision\nat the fusion center is based on OR, AND, K-OUT-OF-N and MAJORITY Boolean\noperations on the received signals associated to individual sensor\nobservations. We derive closed-form equations for the average decision error\nprobability as a function of the system parameters (e.g. number of sensors and\nhops) and the input signal characterization.

A large, dedicated survey of metal-poor stars with the HARPS\nspectrograph has thus been carried out to search for Neptunes and super-Earths.\nAims. In this paper, we present the analysis of \\object{HD175607}, an old G6\nstar with metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.62. We gathered 119 radial velocity\nmeasurements in 110 nights over a time span of more than nine years. Methods.\nThe radial velocities were analysed using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, a genetic\nalgorithm, a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, and a Gaussian processes\nanalysis. The spectra were also used to derive stellar properties. Several\nactivity indicators were analysed to study the effect of stellar activity on\nthe radial velocities. Results. We find evidence for the presence of a small\nNeptune-mass planet (M$_{p}\\sin i = 8.98\\pm1.10$\\,M$_{\\oplus}$) orbiting this\nstar with an orbital period $P = 29.01\\pm0.02$\\, days in a slightly eccentric\norbit ($e=0.11\\pm0.08$). The period of this Neptune is close to the estimated\nrotational period of the star.

The considered SCN is\ncomposed of a mixture of small cells that are configured in either in-band or\nout-of-band backhaul modes with a certain probability. The performance of the\nuser in the considered hierarchical network is limited by several sources of\ninterference such as the backhaul interference, small cell base station\n(SBS)-to-SBS interference and the SI. Moreover, due to the channel hardening\neffect in massive MIMO, the backhaul links experience long term channel effects\nonly, whereas the access links experience both the long term and short term\nchannel effects. Consequently, the developed framework is flexible to\ncharacterize different sources of interference while capturing the\nheterogeneity of the access and backhaul channels.

The leading decay channels which determine dark radiation predictions\nare to hidden sector axions, visible sector Higgses and SUSY scalars depending\non their mass. We show that in most of the parameter space of split SUSY-like\nmodels squarks and sleptons are heavier than the lightest modulus. Hence dark\nradiation predictions previously obtained for MSSM-like cases hold more\ngenerally also for split SUSY-like cases since the decay channel to SUSY\nscalars is kinematically forbidden.

However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have\ndecreased below water condensation level well before the disk was\nphotoevaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is\npuzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be\ndirect condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the\nSun more slowly than the gas itself. The appearance of ice in a range of\nheliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial\ndrift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a sufficiently massive\nplanet is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because the\ndisk acquires a superKeplerian rotation just outside of the planetary orbit.\nFrom this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved about 20\nEarth masses when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively\nfossilized the snowline at that location. Although cooling, the disk inside of\nthe Jovian orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from\nthe outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that\nplanetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in\ntheir inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal disk at 0.7AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to\nexplain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its\norbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of\nthe phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds.

This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk.

We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside.

The pulsar is thought to switch between an \"off\" state in which no\nemission is detectable, a weak state and a strong state. We ran three\nindependent transient detection pipelines on two-minute snapshot images from a\n13 hour BETA observation in order to 1) study the emission from the pulsar, 2)\nsearch for other transient emission from elsewhere in the image and 3) to\ncompare the results from the different transient detection pipelines. The\npulsar was easily detected as a transient source and, over the course of the\nobservations, it switched into the strong state three times giving a typical\ntimescale between the strong emission states of 3.7 hours. After the first\nswitch it remained in the strong state for almost 40 minutes. The other strong\nstates lasted less than 4 minutes. The second state change was confirmed using\nobservations with the Parkes radio telescope. No other transient events were\nfound and we place constraints on the surface density of such events on these\ntimescales. The high sensitivity Parkes observations enabled us to detect\nindividual bright pulses during the weak state and to study the strong state\nover a wide observing band.

Given a query, an analyst formulates $k$ hypotheticals, each\nretaining some of the tuples of a database instance, possibly overlapping, and\nshe wishes to answer the query under scenarios, where a scenario is defined by\na subset of the hypotheticals that are \"turned on\". We say that a query admits\ncompact provisioning if given any database instance and any $k$ hypotheticals,\none can create a poly-size (in $k$) sketch that can then be used to answer the\nquery under any of the $2^{k}$ possible scenarios without accessing the\noriginal instance.\n  In this paper, we focus on provisioning complex queries that combine\nrelational algebra (the logical component), grouping, and statistics/analytics\n(the numerical component). We first show that queries that compute quantiles or\nlinear regression (as well as simpler queries that compute count and\nsum/average of positive values) can be compactly provisioned to provide\n(multiplicative) approximate answers to an arbitrary precision. In contrast,\nexact provisioning for each of these statistics requires the sketch size to be\nexponential in $k$. We then establish that for any complex query whose logical\ncomponent is a positive relational algebra query, as long as the numerical\ncomponent can be compactly provisioned, the complex query itself can be\ncompactly provisioned. On the other hand, introducing negation or recursion in\nthe logical component again requires the sketch size to be exponential in $k$.\nWhile our positive results use algorithms that do not access the original\ninstance after a scenario is known, we prove our lower bounds even for the case\nwhen, knowing the scenario, limited access to the instance is allowed. \n\n"}

Both classes were introduced---with Brownian-time-type\nkernel formulations---by Allouba in a series of articles starting in 2006,\nwhere he presented class (2) in its rigorous stochastic integral equations\nform.

An outer bound on the general nine-message network is\nobtained and then it is shown to be tight, establishing the DoF region for the\nmost general antenna setting wherein all four nodes have an arbitrary number of\nantennas each. The DoF-optimal scheme is applicable to the MIMO 2x2 network\nwith constant channel coefficients, and hence, a fortiori, to time/frequency\nvarying channel scenarios. In particular, a linear precoding scheme is proposed\nthat can achieve all the DoF tuples in the DoF region.

One of the most interesting\ncauses of TTVs is the gravitational interaction between planets. Here we\nconsider a case of two planets in a mean motion resonance (orbital periods in a\nratio of small integers). This case is important because the resonant\ninteraction can amplify the TTV effect and allow planets to be detected more\neasily. We develop an analytic model of the resonant dynamics valid for small\norbital eccentricities and use it to derive the principal TTV terms. We find\nthat a resonant system should show TTV terms with two basic periods (and their\nharmonics). The resonant TTV period is proportional (m/M_*)^(-2/3), where m and\nM_* are the planetary and stellar masses. For m=10^(-4) M_*, for example, the\nTTV period exceeds the orbital period by ~2 orders of magnitude. The amplitude\nof the resonant TTV terms scales linearly with the libration amplitude. The\nratio of the TTV amplitudes of two resonant planets is inversely proportional\nto the ratio of their masses.

We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star.

However, these claims have been\nbased on broadband photometry rather than the unambiguous identification of\nemission features with spectroscopy, and the chemical species that could cause\nthe thermal inversions by absorbing stellar irradiation at high altitudes have\nnot been identified despite extensive theoretical and observational effort.\nHere we present high precision HST WFC3 observations of the dayside emission\nspectrum of the hot Jupiter HD209458b; the first exoplanet suggested to have a\nthermal inversion. Our observations resolve a water band in absorption at 6.2\nsigma confidence. When combined with Spitzer photometry the data are indicative\nof a monotonically decreasing temperature with pressure over the range 1-0.001\nbar at 7.7 sigma confidence. We test the robustness of our results by exploring\na variety of model assumptions including the temperature profile\nparameterization, presence of a cloud, and choice of Spitzer data reduction.

This is possible by detecting the effects of the\ngravitational pull of the companion (ellipsoidal modulations) and in some\ncases, the photometric imprints of the Doppler effect when observing in a broad\nband (Doppler beaming). We aim to photometrically unveil the nature of some\ntransiting objects showing clear modulations in the phase-folded Kepler light\ncurve. We selected a subsample among the large crop of Kepler objects of\ninterest (KOIs) based on their chances to show detectable light curve\nmodulations, i.e., close ($a<12~R_{\\star}$) and large (in terms of radius)\ncandidates. We modeled their phase-folded light curves with consistent\nequations for the three effects, namely, reflection, ellipsoidal and beaming\n(known as REB modulations). We provide detailed general equations for the fit\nof the REB modulations for the case of eccentric orbits. These equations are\naccurate to the photometric precisions achievable by current and forthcoming\ninstruments and space missions.

On the other hand, the time-dependency\ndue to the motion of the third body (e.g. Moon and Sun) is almost always\nneglected. We propose several tools to overcome these limitations. Firstly, we\nhave expanded the third-body disturbing function into a finite polynomial using\nFourier series in multiple of the satellite's eccentric anomaly (instead of the\nmean anomaly) and involving Hansen-like coefficients. Next, by combining the\nclassical Brouwer-von Zeipel procedure and the time-dependent Lie-Deprit\ntransforms, we have performed a normalization of the expanded Hamiltonian in\norder to eliminate all the periodic terms. One of the benefits is that the\noriginal Brouwer solution for J2 is not modified.

{"id": "1609.04172", "contents": "Title: Gaia Data Release 1. Summary of the astrometric, photometric, and survey\n  properties Abstract: At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data\nrelease, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion\nsources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data. \n\n"}

These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the\ntransiting planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The\nmedian uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are ~8% and ~30%,\nrespectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses\nare ~9% and ~22%, respectively.

An early detailed analysis by Howell et al.

We detect the Doppler signal of Kepler-21b with a radial\nvelocity semi-amplitude K = 2.00 +/- 0.65 m/s, which corresponds to a planetary\nmass of 5.1 +/- 1.7 M_earth.

The straightforward answer to this problem is to\ncompare the query with all items in the dataset, but this is practical only for\nsmall datasets. One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve\nsublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the\ndataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the\nnearest neighbors. However, if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity\nrather than the Hamming distance, then the main issue is that the order of\nbuckets to probe is not evident.

We\ncarried out state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of the circumplanetary\ndisks for both formation scenarios, using as similar initial conditions as\npossible to unveil possible intrinsic differences in the circumplanetary disk\nmass and temperature between the two formation mechanisms. We found that the\ncircumplanetary disks mass linearly scales with the circumstellar disk mass.\nTherefore, in an equally massive protoplanetary disk, the circumplanetary disks\nformed in the disk instability model can be only a factor of eight more massive\nthan their core-accretion counterparts. On the other hand, the bulk\ncircumplanetary disk temperature differs by more than an order of magnitude\nbetween the two cases. The subdisks around planets formed by gravitational\ninstability have a characteristic temperature below 100 K, while the core\naccretion circumplanetary disks are hot, with temperatures even greater than\n1000 K when embedded in massive, optically thick protoplanetary disks.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries. \n\n"}

Our approach makes use of the approximate locations of\nmobile devices to provide good estimates of the channel statistics between the\nmobile devices and their corresponding base stations.

First, we characterize a\ndesired angular region of the target user at the serving base station based on\nthe number of base station antennas and the location of the target user, and\nmake the observation that in this region the interference is close to zero due\nto the spatial separability. Second, based on this observation, we propose\npilot coordination methods for multi-user multi-cell scenarios to avoid pilot\ncontamination.

The broad wavelength coverage and high sensitivity of its\ninstruments will allow us to extract far more information from exoplanet\nspectra than what has been possible with current observations. In this paper,\nwe investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era\nof JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission\nspectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to\nsimulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic\nobservations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these\nspectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one\nassuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parametrized temperature\nprofile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances. We found that\nthe isothermal approximation biases the retrieved parameters considerably,\noverestimating the abundances by about one order of magnitude. The retrieved\nabundances using the parametrized profile are usually within one sigma of the\ntrue state, and we found the retrieved uncertainties to be generally larger\ncompared to the isothermal approximation.

However, this raises several security concerns when the relays are\nuntrusted since they may have access to the relayed message. In this paper, we\nstudy the achievable secrecy diversity order of cooperative networks with\nuntrusted relays. In particular, we consider a network with an N-antenna\ntransmitter (Alice), K single-antenna relays, and a single-antenna destination\n(Bob). We consider the general scenario where there is no relation between N\nand K, and therefore K can be larger than N. Alice and Bob are assumed to be\nfar away from each other, and all communication is done through the relays,\ni.e., there is no direct link. Providing secure communication while enhancing\nthe diversity order has been shown to be very challenging. In fact, it has been\nshown in the literature that the maximum achievable secrecy diversity order for\nthe adopted system model is one (while using artificial noise jamming). In this\npaper, we adopt a nonlinear interference alignment scheme that we have proposed\nrecently to transmit the signals from Alice to Bob. We analyze the proposed\nscheme in terms of the achievable secrecy rate and secrecy diversity order.\nAssuming Gaussian inputs, we derive an explicit expression for the achievable\nsecrecy rate and show analytically that a secrecy diversity order of up to\nmin(N,K)-1 can be achieved using the proposed technique. We provide several\nnumerical examples to validate the obtained analytical results and demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed technique to its counterparts that exist in the\nliterature. \n\n"}

We adopt the concept of successive omniscience (SO),\ni.e., letting the local omniscience in some user subset be attained before the\nglobal omniscience in the entire system, and consider the problem of how to\nefficiently attain omniscience in a successive manner.

The\nwiretapper has perfect access to a fixed-length subset of the transmitted\ncodeword symbols of her choosing. Additionally, she observes the remainder of\nthe transmitted symbols through a discrete memoryless channel. This new model\nsubsumes the classical wiretap channel and wiretap channel II with noisy main\nchannel as its special cases. The strong secrecy capacity of the proposed\nchannel model is identified. Achievability is established by solving a dual\nsecret key agreement problem in the source model, and converting the solution\nto the original channel model using probability distribution approximation\narguments. In the dual problem, a source encoder and decoder, who observe\nrandom sequences independent and identically distributed according to the input\nand output distributions of the legitimate channel in the original problem,\ncommunicate a confidential key over a public error-free channel using a single\nforward transmission, in the presence of a compound wiretapping source who has\nperfect access to the public discussion.

Tethys\nitself contains <6% rock by mass, in contrast to its similar-mass outer\nneighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of a\nmassive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring\nmaterial spreads beyond the Roche limit.

We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites,\nincluding tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation\nfactor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moons\ninto mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends\noutward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively\nslow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis\ndistribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys.\nWe estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary\nimpactors during a late heavy bombardment.

The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If\nplanets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large\nmass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner\norbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper\nconsiders the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more\nplanets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually\ntransiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have\nperiastron $p>10$ AU. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18\nplanetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other\norbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion\nproperties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting\ndisk prior).

Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM.

Though BN accelerates the training in the\nbeginning, our experiments show that the use of BN can be unstable and\nnegatively impact the quality of the trained model. The evaluation of BN and\nnumerous other recent schemes for improving GAN training is hindered by the\nlack of an effective objective quality measure for GAN models. To address these\nissues, we first introduce a weight normalization (WN) approach for GAN\ntraining that significantly improves the stability, efficiency and the quality\nof the generated samples. To allow a methodical evaluation, we introduce\nsquared Euclidean reconstruction error on a test set as a new objective\nmeasure, to assess training performance in terms of speed, stability, and\nquality of generated samples.

We investigate the linear stability of KL modes for tilted\ninviscid discs under the approximations that the disc eccentricity is small and\nthe disc remains flat. By using 1D equations, we are able to probe regimes of\nlarge ratios of outer to inner disc edge radii that are realistic for binary\nsystems of hundreds of AU separations and are not easily probed by\nmulti-dimensional simulations. For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge. We\npresent a framework for understanding the zones of instability based on the\ndetermination of branches of marginally unstable modes. In general, multiple\ngrowing eccentric KL modes can be present in a disc. Coplanar apsidal-nodal\nprecession resonances delineate instability branches. We determine the range of\ntilt angles for unstable modes as a function of disc aspect ratio.

The secular\ndynamical evolution of these systems is generally complex, with secular chaotic\nmotion possible in certain parameter regimes. The latter can lead to extremely\nhigh eccentricities and, therefore, strong interactions such as efficient tidal\nevolution. These interactions are believed to play an important role in the\nformation of HJs through high-eccentricity migration. Nevertheless, a deeper\nunderstanding of the secular dynamics of these systems is still lacking. Here\nwe study in detail the secular dynamics of a special case of hierarchical\nquadruple systems in either the `2+2' or `3+1' configurations.

The nodes in the secondary network are assumed to be solely powered\nby ambient RF energy harvested from the transmissions of the primary network.\nWe assume that the secondary nodes can eavesdrop on the primary transmissions\ndue to which the primary network uses secrecy guard zones. The primary\ntransmitter goes silent if any secondary receiver is detected within its guard\nzone. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive the probability of\nsuccessful connection of the primary network as well as the probability of\nsecure communication. Two conditions must be jointly satisfied in order to\nensure successful connection: (i) the SINR at the primary receiver is above a\npredefined threshold, and (ii) the primary transmitter is not silent. In order\nto ensure secure communication, the SINR value at each of the secondary nodes\nshould be less than a predefined threshold. Clearly, when more secondary nodes\nare deployed, more primary transmitters will remain silent for a given guard\nzone radius, thus impacting the amount of energy harvested by the secondary\nnetwork. Our results concretely show the existence of an optimal deployment\ndensity for the secondary network that maximizes the density of nodes that are\nable to harvest sufficient amount of energy. Furthermore, we show the\ndependence of this optimal deployment density on the guard zone radius of the\nprimary network.

This interesting coupling between the two networks is\nstudied using tools from game theory.

In the in-situ formation scenario, the\neccentricities and inclinations of planets are determined by gravitational\nscattering and collisions between protoplanets on the giant impact stage.

The high-angular-resolution capability of the new-generation\nground-based adaptive-optics camera SPHERE at ESO VLT allows us to assess, for\nthe very first time, the cratering record of medium-sized (D~100-200 km)\nasteroids from the ground, opening the prospect of a new era of investigation\nof the asteroid belt's collisional history. Aims. We investigate here the\ncollisional history of asteroid (6) Hebe and challenge the idea that Hebe may\nbe the parent body of ordinary H chondrites, the most common type of meteorites\nfound on Earth (~34% of the falls). Methods. We observed Hebe with SPHERE as\npart of the science verification of the instrument. Combined with earlier\nadaptive-optics images and optical light curves, we model the spin and\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape of Hebe and check the consistency of the derived\nmodel against available stellar occultations and thermal measurements. Results.\nOur 3D shape model fits the images with sub-pixel residuals and the light\ncurves to 0.02 mag. The rotation period (7.274 47 h), spin (343 deg,+47 deg),\nand volume-equivalent diameter (193 +/- 6km) are consistent with previous\ndeterminations and thermophysical modeling. Hebe's inferred density is 3.48 +/-\n0.64 g.cm-3 , in agreement with an intact interior based on its H-chondrite\ncomposition. Using the 3D shape model to derive the volume of the largest\ndepression (likely impact crater), it appears that the latter is significantly\nsmaller than the total volume of close-by S-type H-chondrite-like asteroid\nfamilies. Conclusions. Our results imply that (6) Hebe is not the most likely\nsource of H chondrites.

When used for the purpose of statistical inference, logistic models\nproduce p-values for the regression coefficients by using an approximation to\nthe distribution of the likelihood-ratio test. Indeed, Wilks' theorem asserts\nthat whenever we have a fixed number $p$ of variables, twice the log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) $2\\Lambda$ is distributed as a $\\chi^2_k$ variable in the limit of\nlarge sample sizes $n$; here, $k$ is the number of variables being tested. In\nthis paper, we prove that when $p$ is not negligible compared to $n$, Wilks'\ntheorem does not hold and that the chi-square approximation is grossly\nincorrect; in fact, this approximation produces p-values that are far too small\n(under the null hypothesis). Assume that $n$ and $p$ grow large in such a way\nthat $p/n\\rightarrow\\kappa$ for some constant $\\kappa < 1/2$. We prove that for\na class of logistic models, the LLR converges to a rescaled chi-square, namely,\n$2\\Lambda~\\stackrel{\\mathrm{d}}{\\rightarrow}~\\alpha(\\kappa)\\chi_k^2$, where the\nscaling factor $\\alpha(\\kappa)$ is greater than one as soon as the\ndimensionality ratio $\\kappa$ is positive.

For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties.

For one\nthing, one-sided secrecy satisfies the secure demand of many practical\nscenarios. For another, the secrecy is measured over many blocks since the\ncorrelation between eavesdropper's observation and the confidential messages in\nsuccessive blocks, instead of secrecy measurement of one block in previous\nworks. Thus, firstly, an achievable secrecy rate region is derived for the\ngeneral two-way wiretap channel with feedback through multiple transmissions\nunder one-sided secrecy. Secondly, outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region\nare also obtained. The gap between inner and outer bounds on the secrecy\ncapacity region is explored via the binary input two-way wiretap channels. Most\nnotably, the secrecy capacity regions are established for the XOR channel.\nFurthermore, the result shows that the achievable rate region with feedback is\nlarger than that without feedback. Therefore, the benefit role of feedback is\nprecisely characterized for two-way wiretap channel with feedback under\none-sided secrecy. \n\n"}

The lobes\nexert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to\nthe one-sided Lindblad torque.

We\nfurther investigate this reported anti-correlation here using a dataset\ncomprising exoplanets discovered with both the RV and transit methods,\nsearching for hints of its causes by exploring the connection between the\nnumber of planets and the dynamical state of the exosystems. To examine the\ncorrelation between multiplicity and orbital eccentricity, for every\nmultiplicity case considered (1<M<7), we computed the weighted average\neccentricities instead of the median eccentricities used previously. The\naverage eccentricities were calculated using the inverse of the uncertainty on\nthe eccentricity values as weights. The analysis of the dynamic state of the\nexosystems was performed by computing their angular momentum deficit (AMD), a\ndiagnostic parameter used in the study of solar system and recently applied to\nexosystems. Our results confirm the reported multiplicity-eccentricity\nanti-correlation and show that the use of the uncertainties on the orbital\neccentricities in the analysis allows for a better agreement between data and\nfits. Our best fit reproduces well the behaviour of average eccentricities for\nall systems with M>1, including the additional cases of TRAPPIST-1 (M=7) and\nsolar system (M=8).

We then characterize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) distribution for an arbitrary network and derive its coverage\nprobability. To understand how varying the spatial correlation between\ndifferent networks affects coverage probability, we derive special results for\nthe two-operator scenario, where we construct the operators' individual\nnetworks from a single network via probabilistic coupling. For external\nvalidation, we devise a method to quantify and estimate spatial correlation\nfrom actual base-station deployments.

A relative distance comparison is a\nstatement of the form \"item A is closer to item B than to item C\". However,\nmany existing clustering algorithms that use relative distances are rather\ncomplex. They are often based on a two-step approach, where the relative\ndistances are first used to learn either a distance matrix, or an embedding of\nthe items, and then some standard clustering method is applied in a second\nstep. In this paper we argue that it should be possible to compute a clustering\ndirectly from relative distance comparisons.

Our model includes atmospheric\nphotochemistry, diffusion and escape, line-by-line climate calculations and\ninterior thermodynamics and chemistry.

Atmospheric Effects for an Unmagnetized Planet Abstract: Understanding the impact of active M-dwarf stars on the atmospheric\nequilibrium and surface conditions of a habitable zone Earth-like planet is key\nto assessing M dwarf planet habitability. Previous modeling of the impact of\nelectromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on an\nEarth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in\nozone were possible, but the atmosphere recovered. These stars more\nrealistically exhibit frequent flaring with a power-law distribution of\nenergies. Here we use a coupled 1D photochemical and radiative-convective model\nto investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and\nsurface UV of an Earth-like planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field.\nWe use time-resolved flare spectra obtained for the dM3 star AD Leo, combined\nwith flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically 10$^{30.5}$ to\n10$^{34}$ erg) from the 4-year Kepler light curve for the dM4 flare star\nGJ1243. Our model results show repeated EM-only flares have little effect on\nthe ozone column depth, but that multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the\nozone column. Combining the realistic flare and proton event frequencies with\nnominal CME & SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like planet\ncan be depleted by 94% in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery\nunlikely and suggests further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs O3\ndepletion allows a constant 0.1-1 W m$^{-2}$ of UV-C at the planet's surface,\nwhich is likely detrimental to organic complexity. Our results suggest that\nactive M dwarf hosts may comprehensively destroy ozone shields and subject the\nsurface of magnetically-unprotected Earth-like planets to long-term radiation\nthat can damage complex organic structures. However, this does not preclude\nhabitability, as a safe haven for life could still exist below an ocean\nsurface. \n\n"}

The offloading of computational tasks\nand collection of results rely on successful transmissions between vehicles and\ninfrastructures during encounters. In this paper, we investigate how to provide\ntimely computational services in VCC systems. In particular, we seek to\nminimize the deadline violation probability given a set of tasks to be executed\nin vehicular clouds. Due to the uncertainty of vehicle movements, the task\nreplication methodology is leveraged which allows one task to be executed by\nseveral vehicles, and thus trading computational resources for delay reduction.\nThe optimal task replication policy is of key interest. We first formulate the\nproblem as a finite-horizon sampled-time Markov decision problem and obtain the\noptimal policy by value iterations.

Moreover, a tight closed-form performance upper bound for the BETA\npolicy is derived, which indicates that the deadline violation probability\nfollows the Rayleigh distribution approximately. Applying the vehicle\nspeed-density relationship in the traffic flow theory, we find that vehicle\nmobility benefits VCC systems more compared with road traffic systems, by\nshowing that the optimum vehicle speed to minimize the deadline violation\nprobability is larger than the critical vehicle speed in traffic theory which\nmaximizes traffic flow efficiency. \n\n"}

The circulation of exoplanets with\n$P_{orb} \\leq $ 25~days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave\nin the troposphere and also in the stratosphere: It leads to a strong\nequatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that\nconfines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the\ndistribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited\nto an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with $P_{orb}>25$~days,\nlike GJ~667~C~f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the\nstratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses.\n  The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked\nExoEarths with $P_{orb} \\leq 25$~days can, however, be circumvented with deep\nstratospheric wind breaking alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like\non Earth.

{"id": "1801.02341", "contents": "Title: Pebble isolation mass --- scaling law and implications for the formation\n  of super-Earths and gas giants Abstract: The growth of a planetary core by pebble accretion stops at the so called\npebble isolation mass, when the core generates a pressure bump that traps\ndrifting pebbles outside its orbit. If the isolation mass is very small, then\ngas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a\nmainly solid composition. For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the\nplanet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into\na gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation\nmass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here we expand on previous\nmeasurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all\nrelevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling\nlaw that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$. We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas,\nwith Stokes number $\\tau_{\\rm f}<0.005$ can drift through the partial gap at\npebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must\nbe decreasingly smaller to penetrate through the pressure bump. Turbulent\ndiffusion of particles, however, can lead to an increase of the pebble\nisolation mass by a factor of two, depending on the strength of the background\nviscosity and on the pebble size. We finally explore the implications of the\nnew scaling law of the pebble isolation mass on the formation of planetary\nsystems by numerically integrating the growth and migration pathways of planets\nin evolving protoplanetary discs. Compared to models neglecting the dependence\nof the pebble isolation mass on the $\\alpha$-viscosity, our models including\nthis effect result in larger core masses for giant planets. These larger core\nmasses are more akin to the core masses of the giant planets in the Solar\nSystem. \n\n"}

This paper formulates a\nquadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation range and one-bit\nsymbol-level precoding design problem for minimizing the average symbol error\nrate (SER) in downlink massive MIMO transmission. A tight upper-bound for SER\nwith low-resolution DAC precoding is first derived.

Using the obtained SER expression, we propose a QAM\nconstellation range design for the single-user case.

In this work, we derive trends\nin $f_{\\rm sed}$ across a large range of eddy diffusivities ($K_{zz}$),\ngravities, material properties, and cloud formation pathways by fitting cloud\ndistributions calculated by a more detailed cloud microphysics model. We find\nthat $f_{\\rm sed}$ is dependent on $K_{zz}$, but not gravity, when $K_{zz}$ is\nheld constant. $f_{\\rm sed}$ is most sensitive to the nucleation rate of cloud\nparticles, as determined by material properties like surface energy and\nmolecular weight.

A recent approach for finding a common representation of\nthe two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015),\nwhich attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target\nfeature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial\ntraining faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function\nhas high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2)\nin non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform\nwell in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on\nthe source domain hurts performance on the target domain. In this paper, we\naddress these issues through the lens of the cluster assumption, i.e., decision\nboundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and\nrelated models: 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model,\nwhich combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes\nthe violation the cluster assumption; 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative\nRefinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T) model, which takes the VADA model\nas initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the\ncluster assumption violation.

Due to the large frequency\nseparation between Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL), in FDD systems channel\nreciprocity does not hold. Hence, in order to provide DL channel state\ninformation to the Base Station (BS), closed-loop DL channel probing and\nChannel State Information (CSI) feedback is needed. In massive MIMO this incurs\ntypically a large training overhead. For example, in a typical configuration\nwith M = 200 BS antennas and fading coherence block of T = 200 symbols, the\nresulting rate penalty factor due to the DL training overhead, given by max{0,\n1 - M/T}, is close to 0. To reduce this overhead, we build upon the well-known\nfact that the Angular Scattering Function (ASF) of the user channels is\ninvariant over frequency intervals whose size is small with respect to the\ncarrier frequency (as in current FDD cellular standards). This allows to\nestimate the users' DL channel covariance matrix from UL pilots without\nadditional overhead.

The Bayes clusterer is analogous\nto the Bayes classifier. Whereas determining a Bayes classifier requires full\nknowledge of the feature-label distribution, deriving a Bayes clusterer\nrequires full knowledge of the point process.

These\narguments do not work in the quantum setting. This bottleneck shows up in the\nfact that so-called simultaneous decoders, as opposed to successive\ncancellation decoders, are known for very few channels in quantum network\ninformation theory. Another manifestation of this bottleneck is the lack of\nso-called simultaneous smoothing theorems for quantum states.\n  In this paper, we overcome the bottleneck by proving for the first time a\none-shot quantum joint typicality lemma with robust union and intersection\nproperties. To do so, we develop two novel tools in quantum information theory\nwhich may be of independent interest. The first tool is a simple geometric idea\ncalled tilting, which increases the angles between a family of subspaces in\northogonal directions. The second tool, called smoothing and augmentation, is a\nway of perturbing a multipartite quantum state such that the partial trace over\nany subset of registers does not increase the operator norm by much.\n  Our joint typicality lemma allows us to construct simultaneous quantum\ndecoders for many multiterminal quantum channels.

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

This paper focuses on the mid-IR\nspectral region between 9.7 um to 40 um for T Tauri stars. The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be\noptically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult.\nWe find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc\nsurface is important for the line formation. We briefly discuss the effects of\nC/O ratio and choice of chemical rate network on these results. Our analysis\noffers new ways to infer the chemical and temperature structure of T Tauri\ndiscs from future JWST/MIRI observations, and to possibly detect secondary\nilluminated disc walls based on their specific mid-IR molecular signature. \n\n"}

Aiming to observationally identify\nthe polarization mechanisms, we present ALMA polarization observations of the\n0.87 mm dust continuum emission toward the circumstellar disk around HD 142527\nwith high spatial resolution. We confirm that the polarization vectors in the\nnorthern region are consistent with self-scattering. Furthermore, we show that\nthe polarization vectors in the southern region are consistent with grain\nalignment by magnetic fields, although self-scattering cannot be ruled out. To\nunderstand the differences between the polarization mechanisms, we propose a\nsimple grain size segregation model: small dust grains ($\\lesssim$ 100 microns)\nare dominant and aligned with magnetic fields in the southern region, and\nmiddle-sized ($\\sim100$ microns) grains in the upper layer emit self-scattered\npolarized emission in the northern region. The grain size near the middle plane\nin the northern region cannot be measured because the emission at 0.87 mm is\noptically thick.

This allows for a structured\ndescription of the universe of possible data structure designs that can be\nsynthesized as combinations of those primitives. The second innovation is\ncomputation of performance using learned cost models. These models are trained\non diverse hardware and data profiles and capture the cost properties of\nfundamental data access primitives (e.g., random access). With these models, we\nsynthesize the performance cost of complex operations on arbitrary data\nstructure designs without having to: 1) implement the data structure, 2) run\nthe workload, or even 3) access the target hardware.

Three epochs of high resolution imaging using adaptive\noptics (AO) at the Gemini-North and Keck II Telescopes demonstrate that HR\n7672B is a common proper motion companion, with a separation of 0.79\" (14 AU)\nand a 2.16 um flux ratio of 8.6 mags. Using follow-up K-band spectroscopy from\nKeck AO+NIRSPEC, we measure a spectral type of L4.5+/-1.5. This is the closest\nultracool companion around a main sequence star found to date by direct\nimaging. We estimate the primary has an age of 1-3 Gyr. Assuming coevality, the\ncompanion is most likely substellar, with a mass of 55-78 Mjup based on\ntheoretical models. The primary star shows a long-term radial velocity trend,\nand we combine the radial velocity data and AO imaging to set a firm\n(model-independent) lower limit of 48 Mjup. In contrast to the paucity of brown\ndwarf companions at <~4 AU around FGK dwarfs, HR 7672B implies that brown dwarf\ncompanions do exist at separations comparable to those of the giant planets in\nour own solar system. Its presence is at variance with scenarios where brown\ndwarfs form as ejected stellar embryos. Moreover, since HR 7672B is likely too\nmassive to have formed in a circumstellar disk as planets are believed to, its\ndiscovery suggests that a diversity of physical processes act to populate the\nouter regions of exoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

Thus, in systems with giant planets, the late stages of terrestrial\nplanet formation are strongly affected by the giant planets' dynamical\npresence. Observations of giant planet orbits may therefore constrain the\nsystems that can harbor potentially habitable, Earth-like planets. We present\nresults of 460 N-body simulations of terrestrial accretion from a disk of Moon-\nto Mars-sized planetary embryos. We systematically vary the orbital semimajor\naxis of a Jupiter-mass giant planet between 1.6 and 6 AU, and eccentricity\nbetween 0 and 0.4. We find that for Sun-like stars, giant planets inside\nroughly 2.5 AU inhibit the growth of 0.3 Earth-mass planets in the habitable\nzone. If planets accrete water from volatile-rich embryos past 2-2.5 AU, then\nwater-rich habitable planets can only form in systems with giant planets beyond\n3.5 AU. Giant planets with significant orbital eccentricities inhibit both\naccretion and water delivery. The majority of the current sample of extra-solar\ngiant planets appears unlikely to form habitable planets. \n\n"}

Our focus is the behavior of the so-called \"plug-in\" estimator, which is\nsimply the rate-distortion function of the empirical distribution of the\nobserved data. Sufficient conditions are given for its consistency, and\nexamples are provided to demonstrate that in certain cases it fails to converge\nto the true rate-distortion function. The analysis of its performance is\ncomplicated by the fact that the rate-distortion function is not continuous in\nthe source distribution; the underlying mathematical problem is closely related\nto the classical problem of establishing the consistency of maximum likelihood\nestimators. General consistency results are given for the plug-in estimator\napplied to a broad class of sources, including all stationary and ergodic ones.\nA more general class of estimation problems is also considered, arising in the\ncontext of lossy data compression when the allowed class of coding\ndistributions is restricted; analogous results are developed for the plug-in\nestimator in that case.

Confidential messages are transmitted to their respective receivers\nwith information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each receiver is kept in total\nignorance with respect to the message intended for the other receiver. The\nsecrecy level is measured by the equivocation rate at the eavesdropping\nreceiver. In this paper, we present inner and outer bounds on secrecy capacity\nregions for these two communication systems. The derived outer bounds have an\nidentical mutual information expression that applies to both channel models.\nThe difference is in the input distributions over which the expression is\noptimized. The inner bound rate regions are achieved by random binning\ntechniques. For the broadcast channel, a double-binning coding scheme allows\nfor both joint encoding and preserving of confidentiality. Furthermore, we show\nthat, for a special case of the interference channel, referred to as the switch\nchannel, the two bound bounds meet. Finally, we describe several transmission\nschemes for Gaussian interference channels and derive their achievable rate\nregions while ensuring mutual information-theoretic secrecy.
