Here we investigate, within one specific\nscenario, the fate of such a zero-temperature transition upon coupling of the\nelectronic to lattice degrees of freedom. We study a Kondo-Heisenberg model\nwith volume-dependent Kondo coupling -- this model displays both Kondo volume\ncollapse and Kondo-breakdown transitions, as well as Lifshitz transitions\nassociated with a change of the Fermi-surface topology. Within a large-N\ntreatment, we find that the Lifshitz transition tends to merge with the Kondo\nvolume collapse and hence becomes first order, whereas the Kondo breakdown\ntransition remains of second order except for very soft lattices. Interesting\nphysics emerges at the zero-temperature endpoint of the Kondo volume collapse:\nFor electrons in two space dimensions, this endpoint is located at the Lifshitz\nline for a large range of parameters, thus two continuous quantum phase\ntransitions coincide without fine tuning.

When the non\ninteracting Fermi surface is close to nesting, the Mott localization\ndisentangles from the onset of magnetism. First the paramagnetic heavy fermion\nmetal turns continuously into an itinerant magnet - the Fermi surface evolves\nsmoothly across the transition - and afterwards Mott localization intervenes\nwith a discontinuous rearrangement of the Fermi surface. We find that the\n$f$-electron localization remains even if magnetism is prevented, and is still\naccompanied by a sharp transfer of spectral weigth at the Fermi energy within\nthe Brillouin zone. We further show that the Mott localization can be also\ninduced by an external magnetic field, in which case it occurs concomitantly\nwith a metamagnetic transition. \n\n"}

High-sensitivity microwave surface\nimpedance measurements of the in-plane penetration depth in single crystals of\nelectron-doped PrFeAsO1-y (y~0.1) and hole-doped Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x~0.55) are\npresented. In clean crystals of Ba1-xKxFe2As2, as well as in PrFeAsO1-y\ncrystals, the penetration depth shows flat temperature dependence at low\ntemperatures, indicating that the superconducting gap opens all over the Fermi\nsurface. The temperature dependence of superfluid density in both systems is\nmost consistent with the existence of two different gaps. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, we\nfind that the superfluid density is sensitive to degrees of disorder inherent\nin the crystals, implying unconventional impurity effect. We also determine the\nlower critical field $H_{c1}$ in PrFeAsO1-y by using an array of micro-Hall\nprobes. The temperature dependence of $H_{c1}$ saturates at low temperatures,\nfully consistent with the superfluid density determined by microwave\nmeasurements. The anisotropy of $H_{c1}$ has a weak temperature dependence with\nsmaller values than the anisotropy of upper critical fields at low\ntemperatures, which further supports the multi-gap superconductivity in\nFe-arsenide systems.

To illuminate our analysis we show alternative\nrepresentations of the crystal structures in terms of orderly arrays of\nco-ordination defects and in terms of flourite-type modules. We found that in\nCe$_{7}$O$_{12}$, the excess charge resulting from removal of an oxygen atom\ndelocalizes among all three triclinic Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. In\nCe$_{11}$O$_{20}$, the charge localizes on the next nearest neighbour Ce atoms.\nOur main result is that the charge prefers to distribute itself so that it is\nfarthest away from the O vacancies.

By means of exact diagonalizations, the phase\ndiagram without vacancies is determined as a function of the magnetic field and\nthe ratio between Kitaev and Heisenberg interactions. We show that in the\n(antiferromagnetic) stripe ordered phase the static susceptibility and its\nanisotropy can be described by a spin canting mechanism. This accounts as well\nfor the transition to the polarized phase when including quantum fluctuations\nperturbatively. Effects of spin vacancies depend sensitively on the type of the\nground state. In the liquid phase, the magnetization pattern around a single\nvacancy in a small field is determined, and its spatial anisotropy is related\nto that of non-zero further neighbor correlations induced by the field and/or\nHeisenberg interactions. In the stripe phase, the joint effect of a vacancy and\na small field breaks the six-fold symmetry of the model and stabilizes a\nparticular stripe pattern.

In the\nCe-compounds, the N\\'{e}el temperature $T_\\textup{N}^\\textup{Ce}$ increases\nupon suppressing the SDW transition of Fe and then remains nearly unchanged\nwith further increasing Co concentration up to $x \\simeq 0.8$\n($T_\\textup{N}^\\textup{Ce}\\approx$ 4 K). Furthermore, evidence of Co-induced\npolarization on Ce-moments is observed on the Co-rich side. In the\nGd-compounds, the two magnetic species of Gd and Co are coupled\nantiferromagnetically to give rise to ferrimagnetic behavior in the magnetic\nsusceptibility on the Co-rich side.

A class of such\ndualities involves SL(N,R)\\times SL(N,R) Chern-Simons gauge theories in the\n(2+1)-dimensional bulk spacetime, and CFTs with W_N symmetry algebras on the\n(1+1)-dimensional boundary.

Motivated by\nthis challenge, in this note we present a proposal to compute entanglement\nentropy in the W_N CFTs via holographic methods.

We find that using an accurate model for the\npolarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct\nnumerical results. The interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon\nmodes, the gauge field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT\nlevel in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic\nphonons is interpreted as a strain pattern, allowing the calculation of the\nacoustic gauge field parameter in the GW approximation. The role of electronic\nscreening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is investigated. We then solve\nthe Boltzmann equation semi-analytically in graphene, including both acoustic\nand optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen and\nequipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the\nunscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation\npotential is negligible and strongly screened. By comparing with experimental\ndata, we show that the contribution of acoustic phonons to resistivity is\ndoping- and substrate-independent. The DFT+GW approach underestimates this\ncontribution to resistivity by about 30 %. Above 270K, the calculated\nresistivity underestimates the experimental one more severely, the\nunderestimation being larger at lower doping. We show that, beside remote\nphonon scattering, a possible explanation for this disagreement is the\nelectron-electron interaction that strongly renormalizes the coupling to\nintrinsic optical-phonon modes. Finally, after discussing the validity of the\nMatthiessen rule in graphene, we derive simplified analytical solutions of the\nBoltzmann equation to extract the coupling to acoustic phonons, related to the\nstrain-induced gauge field, directly from experimental data. \n\n"}

Shear banding is associated with strain\nlocalization, i.e. the deformation of the sheared glassy solid is localized in\nspace in form of band-like structures. These structures are often precursors to\ncatastrophic failure, implying that a proper understanding of the underlying\nmechanisms could lead to the design of smarter materials.

In a Landau Fermi\nLiquid, the single-impurity Kondo effect is the screening of an impurity spin\nat low temperature $T$. The two-impurity Kondo model then describes the\ncompetition between the Kondo interaction and the Heisenberg interaction\nbetween two impurity spins, also called the RKKY interaction. For spin-$1/2$\nimpurities, that competition leads to a quantum phase transition from a\nKondo-screened phase to a phase in which the two impurity spins screen one\nanother. Our holographic model is based on a $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT\ndescription of the two-impurity Kondo model, reliable for two impurities with\nnegligible separation in space. We consider only impurity spins in a totally\nanti-symmetric representation of an $SU(N)$ spin symmetry. We employ a\nlarge-$N$ limit, in which both Kondo and RKKY couplings are double-trace, and\nboth Kondo and inter-impurity screening appear as condensation of single-trace\noperators at the impurities' location. We perform the holographic\nrenormalization of our model, which allows us to identify the Kondo and RKKY\ncouplings as boundary conditions on fields in AdS.

Qualitatively different temperature-field\ndiagrams are obtained below 10 T for the field applied along $a$ or $b$ and\nalong $c$, respectively. In contrast, a nearly isotropic high-field phase\nemerges above 18 T and persists up to the saturation that occurs around 22.5 T.\nUpon cooling in low fields, the transitions at $T_{\\rm N1}$ and $T_{\\rm N2}$\ntoward the spin-density-wave and stripe phases are of the second order, whereas\nthe transition at $T_{\\rm N3}$ toward the helical state is of the first order\nand entails a lattice component. Our microscopic analysis identifies frustrated\n$J_1-J_2$ spin chains with a sizable antiferromagnetic interchain coupling in\nthe $bc$ plane and ferromagnetic couplings along the $a$ direction. The\ncompetition between these ferromagnetic interchain couplings and the helical\norder within the chain underlies the incommensurate order along the\n$a$-direction, as observed experimentally. Although a helical state is\ntriggered by the competition between $J_1$ and $J_2$ within the chain, the\nplane of the helix is not uniquely defined because of competing magnetic\nanisotropies.

ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5. However, the topological nature of ZrTe5 is under debate as some\nexperiments point to its being a three-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional\nDirac semimetal. Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5.

We study how Dirac cone\ntilting affects the low-energy properties by presenting a renormalization group\nanalysis of the Coulomb interaction and quenched disorder. Random scalar\npotential or random vector potential along the tilting direction cannot exist\non its own as it always dynamically generates a new type of disorder, which\ndominates at low energies and turns the system into a compressible diffusive\nmetal. Consequently, the fermions acquire a finite disorder scattering rate.\nMoreover, the isolated band-touching point is replaced by a bulk Fermi arc in\nthe Brillouin zone. These results are not qualitatively changed when the\nCoulomb interaction is incorporated. In comparison, random mass and random\nvector potential along the non-tilting direction can exist individually,\nwithout generating other types of disorder.

For a broad DW, the Peierls pinning is\nnegligibly small. However, the external spin-orbit field can induce a fast DW\npropagation, accompanied by a significant shrinking of its width down to atomic\nscales. Before stepping into the pinning region, noticeable spin waves are\nemitted at the tail of the DW.

As a\nresult of this interplay, the system undergoes a finite-temperature transition\nto the spin-dimer and orbital-ferro ordered phase concomitant with the\nJahn-Teller lattice distortion. The numerical results for the magnetic\nsusceptibility show a deviation from the Curie-Weiss behavior, and well\nreproduce the experimental data. The results reveal that the Jahn-Teller energy\nscale is considerably small and the orbital and spin exchange interactions play\na decisive role in the pyroxene titanium oxides. \n\n"}

As far as the structural\nproperties are concerned, the comparison between theory and experiments for\nLSMO strained on the most commonly used substrates, shows an overall good\nagreement: the slight overestimate (at most of 1-1.5 %) for the equilibrium\nout-of-plane lattice constants points to possible defects in real samples. The\ninclusion of a Hubbard-like contribution on the Mn d states, according to the\nso-called \"LSDA+U\" approach, is rather ineffective from the structural point of\nview, but much more important from the electronic and magnetic point of view.\nIn particular, full half-metallicity, which is missed within a bare\ndensity-functional approach, is recovered within LSDA+U, in agreement with\nexperiments.

The relative strength of the exchange and\nelectron-phonon interactions determines whether the transition is first or\nsecond order. A giant drop in the number of current carriers during the\ntransition, which is a consequence of local bound pair (bipolaron) formation in\nthe paramagnetic phase, is extremely sensitive to an external magnetic field.\nBelow the critical temperature of the transition, $T_c$, the binding of the\npolarons into immobile pairs competes with the ferromagnetic exchange between\npolarons and the localized spins on Mn ions, which tends to align the polaron\nmoments and, therefore, breaks up those pairs. The number of carriers abruptly\nincreases below $T_c$ leading to a sudden drop in resistivity. We show that the\ncarrier density collapse describes the colossal magnetoresistance of doped\nmanganites close to the transition.\n  Below $T_c$, transport occurs by polaronic tunneling, whereas at high\ntemperatures the transport is by hopping processes. The transition is\naccompanied by a spike in the specific heat, as experimentally observed. The\ngap feature in tunneling spectroscopy is related to the bipolaron binding\nenergy, which depends on the ion mass.
