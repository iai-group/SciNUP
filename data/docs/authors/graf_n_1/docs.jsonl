In scenarios with very shallow\nelectron density profiles, these transformations have been shown to couple with\nordinary matter effects, jointly producing spectral distortions both in normal\nand inverted hierarchy. In this work we consider a complementary scenario,\ncharacterized by higher electron density, as indicated by post-bounce\nshock-wave simulations. In this case, early collective flavor transitions are\ndecoupled from later, ordinary matter effects. Moreover, such transitions\nbecome more amenable to both numerical computations and analytical\ninterpretations in inverted hierarchy, while they basically vanish in normal\nhierarchy. We numerically evolve the neutrino density matrix in the region\nrelevant for self-interaction effects. In the approximation of averaged\nintersection angle between neutrino trajectories, our simulations neatly show\nthe collective phenomena of synchronization, bipolar oscillations, and spectral\nsplit, recently discussed in the literature. In the more realistic (but\ncomputationally demanding) case of non-averaged neutrino trajectories, our\nsimulations do not show new significant features, apart from the smearing of\n``fine structures'' such as bipolar nutations.

The neutrinos emitted from the remnant at the\ncenter, the protoneutron star (PNS), heat the material above the PNS surface.\nThis heat is partly converted into kinetic energy and the material accelerates\nto an outflow that is known as the neutrino driven wind.

However, the nature of the\nselection requirements of the trigger introduces a large bias in the observed\nproper decay time distribution.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

In\nthis paper we attempt to address both the sense and the sensitivity of such\nproposals. Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and\nunambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana\nneutrino mass, m_bb. In order to make sense of how the different experimental\napproaches compare, we apply this recipe to a selection of proposals, comparing\nthe resulting sensitivities. We also propose a \"physics-motivated range\" (PMR)\nof the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different\nnuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in\nterms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,\nisotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass. For each\nproposal, both a reference and an optimistic scenario for the experimental\nperformance are studied. In the reference scenario we find that all the\nproposals will be able to partially explore the degenerate spectrum, without\nfully covering it, although four of them (KamLAND-Zen, CUORE, NEXT and EXO)\nwill approach the 50 meV boundary. In the optimistic scenario, we find that\nCUORE and the xenon-based proposals (KamLAND-Zen, EXO and NEXT) will explore a\nsignificant fraction of the inverse hierarchy, with NEXT covering it almost\nfully. For the long term future, we argue that Xe-based experiments may provide\nthe best case for a 1-ton scale experiment, given the potentially very low\nbackgrounds achievable and the expected scalability to large isotope masses. \n\n"}

As a specific example, we consider a model with gauged B - L_e - 2\nL_tau number that contains an extremely light new vector boson m_Z' < 10^-18 eV\nand extraordinarily weak coupling alpha' < 10^-52. In that case, differences\nbetween nu_mu to nu_tau and anti-nu_mu to anti-nu_tau oscillations can result\nfrom a long-range potential due to neutrons in the Earth and the Sun that\ndistinguishes nu_mu and nu_tau on Earth, with a potential difference of ~\n6*10^-14 eV, and changes sign for anti-neutrinos.

Abstract: Following a simulation approach of recent publications we explore the\nviability of the neutrino-heating explosion mechanism in dependence on the\nspatial dimension. Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also\nobserve that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino\nluminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that\nexplosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that\nthe average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension\nand thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,\nmass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic\nenergy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.\nCoherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing\naccretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions\nbecause they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.\nWhile 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the\nopposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the\nturbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial\nscales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D\nis in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on\nsmaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more\nsimilar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be\ntightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including\nnonaxisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the new particle that has been observed at\n125 GeV is not the Standard Model (SM) Higgs, but instead the dilaton\nassociated with an approximate conformal symmetry that has been spontaneously\nbroken. We focus on dilatons that arise from theories of technicolor, or from\ntheories of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), that involve\nstrong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet. In the pNGB case, we are\nconsidering a framework where the Higgs particle is significantly heavier than\nthe dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed. In each of the technicolor\nand pNGB scenarios, we study both the case when the SM fermions and gauge\nbosons are elementary, and the case when they are composites of the strongly\ninteracting sector. Our analysis incorporates conformal symmetry violating\neffects, which are necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless, and\nis directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale\nand involve strong conformal dynamics. Since the AdS/CFT correspondence relates\nthe radion in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models to the dilaton, our results also\napply to RS models with the SM fields localized on the infrared brane, or in\nthe bulk. We identify the parameters that can be used to distinguish the\ndilatons associated with the several different classes of theories being\nconsidered from each other, and from the SM Higgs. We perform a fit to all the\navailable data from several experiments and highlight the key observations to\nextract these parameters. We find that at present, both the technicolor and\npNGB dilaton scenarios provide a good fit to the data, comparable to the SM\nHiggs. We indicate the future observations that will help to corroborate or\nfalsify each scenario. \n\n"}

The flavor content of the signal evolves\ndue to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a\nhighly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper\nwe investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different\nprogenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the\nMikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage\nthrough the star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium\nsupernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during\na window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral features of collective\nand shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost\nturbulence free making them the easiest to interpret.

In the SM, implied by\nthe hierarchical structure of the CKM matrix and the GIM mechanism, flavour\nchanging neutral current processes are most strongly suppressed in the kaon\nsector while the suppression is much less effective in the B meson systems.\nThus their theoretical cleanness makes rare K decays, in particular the K -> pi\nnu anti-nu system, extremely well suited to look for deviations from their tiny\nSM values. Despite the increasingly stringent constraints on new physics from\ndirect search experiments as well as indirect searches in B meson decays, large\nenhancements of both K^+ -> pi^+ nu anti-nu and K_L -> pi^0 nu anti-nu are\nstill possible, and deviations from the SM could be observed even for a\nmulti-TeV new physics scale.

Such non-standard particles require a mass of $\\sim 1$ eV/c$^2$, far\nabove the mass scale associated with active neutrinos, and were first invoked\nto explain the LSND $\\bar \\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\bar \\nu_e$ appearance signal.\nMore recently, the MiniBooNE experiment has reported a $2.8 \\sigma$ excess of\nevents in antineutrino mode consistent with neutrino oscillations and with the\nLSND antineutrino appearance signal. MiniBooNE also observed a $3.4 \\sigma$\nexcess of events in their neutrino mode data. Lower than expected\nneutrino-induced event rates using calibrated radioactive sources and nuclear\nreactors can also be explained by the existence of sterile neutrinos. Fits to\nthe world's neutrino and antineutrino data are consistent with sterile\nneutrinos at this $\\sim 1$ eV/c$^2$ mass scale, although there is some tension\nbetween measurements from disappearance and appearance experiments. In addition\nto resolving this potential major extension of the Standard Model, the\nexistence of sterile neutrinos will impact design and planning for all future\nneutrino experiments. It should be an extremely high priority to conclusively\nestablish if such unexpected light sterile neutrinos exist.

To date, LArTPC light collection systems\nhave employed tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) coatings on photomultiplier tubes\n(PMTs) or plates placed in front of the PMTs.

This is an\nimportant step in the development of meter-scale light guides for future\nLArTPCs. Improvements come from using a new acrylic-based coating,\ndiamond-polished cast UV transmitting acrylic bars, and a hand-dipping\ntechnique to coat the bars.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1. This result updates the \\lambda_pp\\mu\\\nvalue used in the above mentioned MuCap publication.\n  Conclusions: The 2.5x higher precision compared to earlier experiments and\nthe fact that the measurement was performed at nearly identical conditions to\nthe main data taking, reduces the uncertainty induced by \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ to a\nminor contribution to the overall uncertainty of \\Lambda_S and g_P, as\ndetermined in MuCap. Our final value for \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ shifts \\Lambda_S and\ng_P by less than one tenth of their respective uncertainties compared to our\nresults published earlier. \n\n"}

The space-time is five dimensional and the extra flat\nspatial dimension is compactified on the orbifold $S^1/(Z_2 \\times Z_2')$,\nleading to Pati-Salam gauge symmetry on the boundary where Yukawa interactions\nare localised. The gauge symmetry breaking is completed by means of a rather\neconomic scalar sector, avoiding the doublet-triplet splitting problem. The\nmatter fields live in the bulk and their massless modes get exponential\nprofiles, which naturally explain the mass hierarchy of the different fermion\ngenerations. Quarks and leptons properties are naturally reproduced by a\nmechanism, first proposed by Kitano and Li, that lifts the SO(10) degeneracy of\nbulk masses in terms of a single parameter.

The crab-waist scheme is implemented within\nthe local chromaticity correction system without additional sextupoles, by\nreducing the strength of one of the two sextupoles for vertical chromatic\ncorrection at each side of the IP. So-called \"tapering\" of the magnets is\napplied, which scales all fields of the magnets according to the local beam\nenergy to compensate for the effect of synchrotron radiation (SR) loss along\nthe ring. An asymmetric layout near the interaction region reduces the critical\nenergy of SR photons on the incoming side of the IP to values below 100 keV,\nwhile matching the geometry to the beam line of the FCC proton collider\n(FCC-hh) [2] as closely as possible. Sufficient transverse/longitudinal dynamic\naperture (DA) has been obtained, including major dynamical effects, to assure\nan adequate beam lifetime in the presence of beamstrahlung and top-up\ninjection.

This method does not require the full particle\nionization track to be contained inside of the detector volume as other track\nmomentum reconstruction methods do (range-based momentum reconstruction and\ncalorimetric momentum reconstruction). We motivate use of this technique,\ndescribe a tuning of the underlying phenomenological formula, quantify its\nperformance on fully contained beam-neutrino-induced muon tracks both in\nsimulation and in data, and quantify its performance on exiting muon tracks in\nsimulation. Using simulation, we have shown that the standard Highland formula\nshould be re-tuned specifically for scattering in liquid argon, which\nsignificantly improves the bias and resolution of the momentum measurement.\nWith the tuned formula, we find agreement between data and simulation for\ncontained tracks, with a small bias in the momentum reconstruction and with\nresolutions that vary as a function of track length, improving from about 10%\nfor the shortest (one meter long) tracks to 5% for longer (several meter)\ntracks.

Hadron colliders are likely to determine the pace of\nparticle-physics progress also during the next hundred years. Discoveries at\npast hadron colliders were essential for establishing the so-called Standard\nModel of particle physics. The world's present flagship collider, the LHC,\nincluding its high-luminosity upgrade HL-LHC, is set to operate through the\nsecond half of the 2030's. Further increases of the energy reach during the\n21st century require another, still more powerful hadron collider. Three\noptions for a next hadron collider are presently under investigation. The\nFuture Circular Collider (FCC) study, hosted by CERN, is designing a 100 TeV\ncollider, to be installed inside a new 100 km tunnel in the Lake Geneva basin.\nA similar 100 km collider, called SppC, is being pursued by CAS-IHEP in China.\nIn either machine, for the first time in hadron storage rings, synchrotron\nradiation damping will be significant. In parallel, the synchrotron-radiation\npower emitted inside the cold magnets becomes an important design constraint.\nOne important difference between FCC and SppC is the magnet technology. FCC\nuses 16 Tesla magnets based on Nb3Sn superconductor, while SppC magnets shall\nbe realized with cables made from iron-based high-temperature superconductor.\nInitially the SppC magnets are assumed to provide a more moderate dipole field\nof 12 T, but they can later be pushed to a final ultimate field of 24 T.

These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation. \n\n"}

We propagate the charm quarks and the D\nmesons following a previously applied Langevin dynamics. The evolution of the\nbackground medium is modeled in two different ways: (I) we use the UrQMD\nhydrodynamics + Boltzmann transport hybrid approach including a phase\ntransition to QGP and (II) with the coarse-graining approach employing also an\nequation of state with QGP. The latter approach has previously been used to\ndescribe di-lepton data at various energies very successfully. This comparison\nallows us to explore the effects of partial thermalization and viscous effects\non the charm propagation. We explore the centrality dependencies of the\ncollisions, the variation of the decoupling temperature and various\nhadronization parameters. We find that the initial partonic phase is\nresponsible for the creation of most of the D mesons elliptic flow and that the\nsubsequent hadronic interactions seem to play only a minor role. This indicates\nthat D mesons elliptic flow is a smoking gun for a partonic phase at FAIR\nenergies.

We consider\nthe possibility that black hole formation happens when the flux of neutrinos is\nstill measurably high. If this occurs, then the neutrino signal from the\nsupernova will be terminated abruptly (the transition takes $\\lesssim 0.5$ ms).\nThe properties and duration of the signal before the cutoff are important\nmeasures of both the physics and astrophysics of the cooling proto-neutron\nstar. For the event rates expected in present and proposed detectors, the\ncutoff will generally appear sharp, thus allowing model-independent\ntime-of-flight mass tests for the neutrinos after the cutoff. If black hole\nformation occurs relatively early, within a few ($\\sim 1$) seconds after core\ncollapse, then the expected luminosities are of order $L_{BH} = 10^{52}$ erg/s\nper flavor.

The least important processes are neutrino-neutrino scattering\nand e^+ e^- annihilation.

We studied the statistical analysis for the future detection of a\nnearby supernova by using a numerical supernova model and realistic Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of detection by the Super-Kamiokande detector. We mainly discuss\nthe detectability of the signatures of the delayed explosion mechanism in the\ntime evolution of the $\\anue$ luminosity and spectrum. For a supernova at 10\nkpc away from the Earth, we find that not only the signature is clearly\ndiscernible, but also the deviation of energy spectrum from the Fermi-Dirac\n(FD) distribution can be observed. The deviation from the FD distribution\nwould, if observed, provide a test for the standard picture of neutrino\nemission from collapse-driven supernovae. For the $D$ = 50 kpc case, the\nsignature of the delayed explosion is still observable, but statistical\nfluctuation is too large to detect the deviation from the FD distribution. We\nalso propose a method for statistical reconstruction of the time evolution of\n$\\anue$ luminosity and spectrum from data, by which we can get a smoother time\nevolution and smaller statistical errors than a simple, time-binning analysis.\nThis method is useful especially when the available number of events is\nrelatively small, e.g., a supernova in the LMC or SMC. Neutronization burst of\n$\\nu_e$'s produces about 5 scattering events when $D$ = 10 kpc and this signal\nis difficult to distinguish from $\\anue p$ events. \n\n"}

{"id": "astro-ph/9811350", "contents": "Title: Can a supernova be located by its neutrinos? Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

Still the flavor\ndependence of the nucleon's spin is a significant fundamental question that is\nnot understood. Experiments measuring the spin content of the nucleon have\nreported conflicting results on the amount of nucleon spin carried by strange\nquarks. Quasi-elastic neutrino scattering, observed using a novel detection\ntechnique, provides a theoretically clean measure of this quantity.\n  The optimum neutrino beam energy needed to measure the strange spin of the\nnucleon is 1 GeV. This is also an ideal energy to search for neutrino\noscillations at high $\\Delta m^2$ in an astrophysically interesting region.\nModels of the r-process in supernovae which include high-mass sterile neutrinos\nmay explain the abundance of neutron-rich heavy metals in the universe.

In\nlittle Higgs theories, the Higgs mass-squareds are protected to the one-loop\norder from the quadratic divergence.

For the elementary neutrino-nucleon interaction,\nwe take into account quasielastic scattering, Delta excitation and the\nexcitation of the resonances in the second resonance region. Our model for the\nneutrino-nucleus collisions includes in-medium effects such as Fermi motion,\nPauli blocking, nuclear binding, and final-state interactions. They are\nimplemented by means of the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU)\ncoupled-channel transport model. This allows us to study exclusive channels,\nnamely pion production and nucleon knockout. We find that final-state\ninteractions modify considerably the distributions through rescattering,\ncharge-exchange and absorption. Side-feeding induced by charge-exchange\nscattering is important in both cases. In the case of pions, there is a strong\nabsorption associated with the in-medium pionless decay modes of the Delta,\nwhile nucleon knockout exhibits a considerable enhancement of low energy\nnucleons due to rescattering. At neutrino energies above 1 GeV, we also obtain\nthat the contribution to nucleon knockout from Delta excitation is comparable\nto that from quasielastic scattering. \n\n"}

We argue that flow observables within systems with a non-negligible\nmean free path should acquire a \"dynamical\" fluctuation, due to the random\nnature of each collision between the system's degrees of freedom. Because of\nthis, $v_2$ fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the\nsystem produced at RHIC. To illustrate this quantitatively, we apply the UrQMD\nmodel, with scaled cross sections, to show that collisions at RHIC have a\nKnudsen number at least one order of magnitude above the expected value for an\ninteracting hadron gas. Furthermore, we argue that the Knudsen number is also\nbound from above by the $v_2$ fluctuation data, because too large a Knudsen\nnumber would break the observed scaling of $v_2$ fluctuations due to the onset\nof turbulent flow. We propose, therefore that $v_2$ fluctuation measurements,\ntogether with an understanding of the turbulent regime for relativistic\nhydrodynamics, will provide an upper as well as a lower limit for the Knudsen\nnumber. \n\n"}

FFAG magnets are naturally wide; low momentum muons move\nfrom the low field side of a gradient magnet to the high field side as they\ngain energy. This can be exploited to do double duty and allow a large beam\nadmittance without unduly increasing the magnetic field volume.

Ionization cooling is provided by high pressure hydrogen\ngas which removes both transverse and longitudinal momentum.

The longer path length in the hydrogen of\nhigher momentum muons decreases longitudinal emittance at the expense of\ntransverse emittance. Thus emittance exchange allows these rings to cool in all\nsix dimensions and not just transversely. Alternatively, if the RF is located\nafter the ring, it may be possible to cool the muons by stopping them as they\nspiral adiabatically into a central swarm.
