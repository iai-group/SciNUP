Strong\nBalmer absorption and high values of SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) both indicate\nmoderately active starbursts and support the picture that e(a) galaxies are the\nactive starbursts that feed the post-starburst population.

In common with some recent\nstudies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in major\nmergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift to\nz~1.2, with (1+z)^{1.6 \\pm 1.6}. Our key finding is that massive galaxies with\nM_* > 1E11 Msun are more likely to host merging companions than less massive\nsystems (M_* ~ 1E10 Msun). We find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red,\nspheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectations\nbased on clustering at small scales. So-called \"dry\" mergers between early-type\ngalaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with M_* > 3E10 Msun at z~0.5, but\nless than 30% at z~1. This result can be explained by the increasing abundance\nof red, early-type galaxies at these masses. We compare the volumetric merger\nrate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxy\nevolution, finding that major mergers cannot fully account for the formation of\nspheroidal galaxies since z~1. In terms of mass assembly, major mergers\ncontribute little to galaxy growth below M_* ~ 3E10 Msun but are more\nsignificant among galaxies with M_* > 1E11 Msun, 30% of which have undergone\nmostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range.

In this work we study this {\\it blurring} effect, and\nfind that it has a non-negligible impact on estimations of the kinetic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect: it induces a 10% correction in 20-40% of the\nclusters/groups, and a 100% correction in $\\sim 5$% of the clusters in an ideal\n(noiseless) experiment. We explore the possibility of using this blurring term\nto probe the CMB anisotropy field at different epochs in our Universe. In\nparticular, we study the required precision in the removal of the kSZ that\nenables detecting the blurring term $-\\tau_T \\delta T / T_0$ in galaxy cluster\npopulations placed at different redshift shells. By mapping this term in those\nshells, we would provide a tomographic probe for the growth of the Integrated\nSachs Wolfe effect (ISW) during the late evolutionary stages of the Universe.\nWe find that the required precision of the cluster peculiar velocity removal is\nof the order of 100 -- 200 km s$^{-1}$ in the redshift range 0.2 -- 0.8, after\nassuming that all clusters more massive than 10$^{14}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ are\nobservable. These errors are comparable to the total expected linear line of\nsight velocity dispersion for clusters in WMAPV cosmogony, and correspond to a\nresidual level of roughly 900 -- 1800 $\\tau_T \\mu$K per cluster, including all\ntypes of contaminants and systematics.

We confirm that this\nsimple method provides the same third- and fourth- order actions at leading\norder in slow-roll and in the small sound speed limit as those obtained by the\nusual ADM formalism. As an application, we compute the leading order connected\nfour-point function of the primordial curvature perturbation coming from the\nintrinsic fourth-order contact interaction in the multi-field DBI-inflation\nmodel. At the third order, the interaction Hamiltonian arises purely by the\nboost from the second-order action in the rest frame of the brane. The boost\nacts on the adiabatic and entropy modes in the same way thus there exists a\nsymmetry between the adiabatic and entropy modes. But at fourth order this\nsymmetry is broken due to the intrinsic fourth-order action in the rest frame\nand the difference between the Lagrangian and the interaction Hamiltonian.\nTherefore, contrary to the three-point function, the momentum dependence of the\npurely adiabatic component and the components including the entropic\ncontributions are different in the four-point function.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both\neffects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of\nthe star.

Using\none-zone models of cosmic ray (CR) injection, cooling, and escape in\nstar-forming galaxies, we attempt to reproduce the observed FIR-radio\ncorrelation over its entire span. We show that ~2% of the kinetic energy from\nsupernova explosions must go into primary CR electrons and that ~10 - 20% must\ngo into primary CR protons. Secondary electrons and positrons are likely\ncomparable to or dominate primary electrons in dense starburst galaxies. We\ndiscuss the implications of our models for the magnetic field strengths of\nstarbursts, the detectability of starbursts by Fermi, and cosmic ray feedback.\nOverall, our models indicate that both CR protons and electrons escape from low\nsurface density galaxies, but lose most of their energy before escaping dense\nstarbursts. The FIR-radio correlation is caused by a combination of the\nefficient cooling of CR electrons (calorimetry) in starbursts and a conspiracy\nof several factors. For lower surface density galaxies, the decreasing radio\nemission caused by CR escape is balanced by the decreasing FIR emission caused\nby the low effective UV dust opacity.

The data set\nconsists of 238 clusters drawn from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey with 0.1-2.4 keV\nluminosities >2.5e44 erg/second, and incorporates extensive follow-up\nobservations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

Here we describe the reduction of the follow-up X-ray\nobservations, present results on the cluster scaling relations, and discuss\ntheir implications. Our constraints on the luminosity-mass and temperature-mass\nrelations, measured within r_500, lead to three important results. First, the\ndata support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium has\naltered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally\ndominated system; however, this excess heating is primarily limited to the\ncentral regions of clusters (r<0.15r_500). Second, the intrinsic scatter in the\ncenter-excised luminosity-mass relation is remarkably small, being undetected\nat the <10% level in current data; for the hot, massive clusters under\ninvestigation, this scatter is smaller than in either the temperature-mass or\nY_X-mass relations (10-15%). Third, the evolution with redshift of the scaling\nrelations is consistent with the predictions of simple, self-similar models of\ngravitational collapse, indicating that the mechanism responsible for heating\nthe central regions of clusters was in operation before redshift 0.5 (the limit\nof our data) and that its effects on global cluster properties have not evolved\nstrongly since then. \n\n"}

We propose massive binaries as an alternative\nsource.\n  We compute the evolution of a 20 Msun star in a close binary and find that it\nsheds about 10 Msun. The ejecta are enriched in He, N, Na, and Al and depleted\nin C and O, similar to the abundance patterns observed in gobular cluster\nstars. In contrast to the fast, radiatively driven winds of massive stars, this\nmaterial is typically ejected with low velocity. We expect that it remains\ninside the potential well of a globular cluster and becomes available for the\nformation or pollution of a second generation of stars.\n  We estimate that the amount of processed low-velocity material ejected by\nmassive binaries is greater than the contribution of AGB stars and spin stars\ncombined, assuming that the majority of massive stars in a proto-globular\ncluster interact.

We develop first a\nmodel for pulse profile formation accounting for the screening of the antipodal\nemitting spot by the accretion disk. We demonstrate that the variations of the\nvisibility of the antipodal spot associated with the receding accretion disk\ncause a systematic shift in Fourier phases, observed together with the changes\nin the pulse form. We show that a strong secondary maximum can be observed only\nin a narrow intervals of inner disk radii, which explains the very short\nappearance of the double-peaked profiles in SAX J1808.4-3658.

We update\nour earlier fitting form for the mean merger rate per halo as a function of\nM_0, xi, and z. The overall behavior of this quantity is unchanged: the rate\nper unit redshift is nearly independent of z out to z~15; the dependence on\nhalo mass is weak (M0^0.13); and it is nearly a power law in the progenitor\nmass ratio (xi^-2).

Diversity of events at low and high\n  redshift Abstract: This paper investigates on the possible systematic difference of Supernovae\nIa (SN Ia) properties related to the age and masses of the progenitors that\ncould introduce a systematic bias between low and high redshift SN Ia's. The\nrelation between the main features of the distribution of the delay times (DTD)\nand the masses of the progenitors is illustrated for the single (SD) and double\ndegenerate (DD) models. Mixed models, which assume contributions from both the\nSD and DD channels, are also presented and tested versus the observed\ncorrelations between the SN Ia rates and the parent galaxy properties. It is\nshown that these correlations can be accounted for with both single channel and\nmixed models, and that the rate in S0 and E galaxies may effectively provide\nclues on the contribution of SD progenitors to late epoch explosions. A wide\nrange of masses for the CO WD at the start of accretion is expected in almost\nall galaxy types; only in galaxies of the earliest types the properties of the\nprogenitors are expected to be more uniform. For mixed models, late type\ngalaxies should host SD and DD explosions in comparable fractions, while in\nearly type galaxies DD explosions should largely prevail.

The problem of the existence of intermediate-mass black holes\n(IMBHs) at the centre of globular clusters is a hot and controversial topic in\ncurrent astrophysical research with important implications in stellar and\ngalaxy formation.\n  Aims. In this paper, we aim at giving further support to the presence of an\nIMBH in omega Centauri and at providing an independent estimate of its mass.\n  Methods. We employed a self-consistent spherical model with anisotropic\nvelocity distribution. It consists in a generalisation of the King model by\nincluding the Bahcall-Wolf distribution function in the IMBH vicinity.\n  Results. By the parametric fitting of the model to recent HST/ACS data for\nthe surface brightness profile, we found an IMBH to cluster total mass ratio of\nM_BH/M = 5.8(+0.9-1.2) x 10^(-3). It is also found that the model yields a fit\nof the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile that is better without mass\nsegregation than in the segregated case.

The best fit model to the\nkinematic data leads, moreover, to a cluster total mass estimate of M = (3.1\n+/- 0.3) x 10^6 Msol, thus giving an IMBH mass in the range 13,000 < M_BH <\n23,000 Msol (at 1-sigma confidence level).

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal.

Single-pointing spectra of the SiO J=2-1 and J=3-2 lines toward\nseveral regions in the filament, are also reported. The SiO images reveal that\nSiO is widespread along the IRDC (size >2 pc), showing two different\ncomponents: one bright and compact arising from three condensations (N, E and\nS), and the other weak and extended along the filament. While the first\ncomponent shows broad lines (linewidths of ~4-7 kms-1) in both SiO J=2-1 and\nSiO J=3-2, the second one is only detected in SiO J=2-1 and has narrow lines\n(~0.8 kms-1). The maps of CO and its isotopologues show that low-density\nfilaments are intersecting the IRDC and appear to merge toward the densest\nportion of the cloud.

We use an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model for the Galactic\nhalo to predict both the mean trend and scatter of C/O and N/O. In one set of\nmodels, we assume that massive stars enrich the interstellar medium during both\nthe stellar wind and supernovae phases. In the second set, we consider that in\nthe earliest phases (Z <10^-8), stars with masses above 40 Msun only enrich the\ninterstellar medium via stellar winds, collapsing directly into black holes. We\npredict a larger scatter in the C/O and N/O ratios at low metallicities when\nallowing the more massive fast-rotating stars to contribute to the chemical\nenrichment only via stellar winds. The latter assumption, combined with the\nstochasticity in the star formation process in the primordial Galactic halo can\nexplain the wide spread observed in the N/O and C/O ratios in normal\nvery-metal-poor stars.

The extra-terms in the gravitational field equations with\ngeometry-matter coupling modify the equations of motion of test particles, and\ninduce a supplementary gravitational interaction. Starting from the variational\nprinciple describing the particle motion in the presence of the non-minimal\ncoupling, the expression of the tangential velocity of a test particle, moving\nin the vacuum on a stable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric geometry,\nis derived.

Because it is more likely that the companion\nis a planetary-mass object in a moderate- to high-inclination orbit than a\nlow-mass stellar object in a nearly face-on orbit, the secondary bodies are\npresumed to be planets.

We expect to be able to detect and analyze\nmany cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very\nprecise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required. To\nbuild them we need to have a deep understanding of the gravitational\nbackreaction mechanism responsible for the inspiral. The self-force approach\ndescribes the inspiral as the action of a local force that can be obtained from\nthe regularization of the perturbations created by the stellar compact object\non the massive black hole geometry. In this paper we extend a new time-domain\ntechnique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the\ncase of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole. The main idea behind\nour scheme is to use a multidomain framework in which the small compact object,\ndescribed as a particle, is located at the interface between two subdomains.\nThen, the equations at each subdomain are homogeneous wave-type equations,\nwithout distributional sources.

During the subsequent evolution, the accretion disk, which\nis truncated at the tidal radius because of the tidal torque, also shrinks as\nthe orbital decay. Assuming that the disk mass changed by this process is all\naccreted, the disk becomes radiatively inefficient when the semi-major axis is\nseveral hundred Schwarzschild radii. The high-energy radiations, in spite of a\nlow bolometric luminosity, are emitted from an accretion disk around each black\nhole long before the black hole coalescence as well as the gravitational wave\nsignals.

The\nformer objects have substantially higher values of nu_M, implying that the\nsynchrotron emission comes from more compact regions; therefore, a substantial\nincrease of the BL Lac fraction at high radio frequencies and at bright flux\ndensities is predicted. Remarkably, our best model is able to give a very good\nfit to all the observed data on number counts and on distributions of spectral\nindices of extragalactic radio sources at frequencies above 5 and up to 220\nGHz. Predictions for the forthcoming sub-mm blazar counts from Planck, at the\nhighest HFI frequencies, and from Herschel surveys are also presented. \n\n"}

Newly available Spitzer data now offer the opportunity to carry out a\nsimilar analysis in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

Using a dust emission model, and testing our results with several\nradiation field spectra, we show that dust in the ionized gas is warmer than\ndust associated with other phases (atomic and molecular). We also find a\ndecrease of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) relative abundance with\nrespect to big grains (BGs), as well as an increase of the near infrared (NIR)\ncontinuum. These three results (e.g. warmer temperature, decrease of PAH\nabundance and increase of the NIR continuum) are found consistently for all\nregimes of the ionized gas. On the contrary, the molecular phase appears to\nprovide favorable conditions for the survival of PAHs. Furthermore, the very\nsmall grain (VSG) relative abundance tends to increase in the ionized phase,\nespecially in bright HII regions.

The survey,\ndescribed in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of\nconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of CDM. The\nCLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of\nspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized\nlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.\nSpecifically, twenty CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected.

Five additional clusters are included for their\nlensing strength (Einstein radii > 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to further\nquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution dark\nmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified\nhigh-redshift (z > 7) galaxies.

Here we focus on the secondary anisotropies resulting from\nthe thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect; the amplitude of which depends\ncritically on the average thermal pressure profile of galaxy groups and\nclusters. To this end, we use a suite of SPH simulations that include radiative\ncooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and energetic feedback from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). We examine in detail how the pressure profile depends on\ncluster radius, mass, and redshift and provide an empirical fitting function.\nWe employ three different approaches for calculating the tSZ power spectrum: an\nanalytical approach that uses our pressure profile fit, a semi-analytical\nmethod of pasting our pressure fit onto simulated clusters, and a direct\nnumerical integration of our simulated volumes. We demonstrate that the\ndetailed structure of the intracluster medium and cosmic web affect the tSZ\npower spectrum. In particular, the substructure and asphericity of clusters\nincrease the tSZ power spectrum by 10-20% at ell ~2000-8000, with most of the\nadditional power being contributed by substructures.

We\nuse dynamical arguments to derive an analytic formula that can be fitted to\nobserved velocity distributions, and validate it by fits to the velocities\nderived from a dynamically rigorous model, and to a sample of local stars with\naccurate space velocities. Our formula is much easier to use than a full\ndistribution function. It has fewer parameters than a multi-Gaussian fit, and\nthe best-fitting model parameters give insight into the underlying disc\ndynamics. In particular, once the azimuthal velocities of a sample have been\nsuccessfully fitted, the apparatus provides a prediction for the corresponding\ndistribution of radial velocities vR . An effective formula like ours is\ninvaluable when fitting to data for stars at some distance from the Sun because\nit enables one to make proper allowance for the errors in distance and proper\nmotion when determining the underlying disc kinematics. The derivation of our\nformula elucidates the way the horizontal and vertical motions are closely\nintertwined, and makes it evident that no stellar population can have a scale\nheight and vertical velocity dispersions that are simultaneously independent of\nradius.

Specifically, we investigate the possibility of the\nvery massive star (VMS) VFTS 682 being a runaway member of R136. Recent\nobservations of the above VMS, by virtue of its isolated location and its\nmoderate peculiar motion, have raised the fundamental question whether isolated\nmassive star formation is indeed possible. We perform the first realistic\nN-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which\nall the massive stars are in primordial binary systems. These calculations\nconfirm that the dynamical ejection of a VMS from a R136-like cluster, with\nkinematic properties similar to those of VFTS 682, is common. Hence the\nconjecture of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to account for\nthis VMS. Our results are also quite consistent with the ejection of 30 Dor\n016, another suspected runaway VMS from R136. We further note that during the\nclusters' evolution, mergers of massive binaries produce a few single stars per\ncluster with masses significantly exceeding the canonical upper-limit of 150\nsolar mass. The observations of such single super-canonical stars in R136,\ntherefore, do not imply an IMF with an upper limit greatly exceeding the\naccepted canonical 150 solar mass limit, as has been suggested recently, and\nthey are consistent with the canonical upper limit. \n\n"}

Our fiducial model, which includes\nradiative cooling by heavy elements and feedback by supernovae and active\ngalactic nuclei, predicts that by z = 0.25 nearly 60 per cent of the gas mass\nends up at densities and temperatures characteristic of the WHIM and we find\nthat half of this fraction is due to outflows. The standard HI observables\n(distribution of HI column densities N_HI, distribution of Doppler parameters\nb_HI, b_HI - N_HI correlation) and the BLA line number density predicted by our\nsimulations are in remarkably good agreement with observations.\n  BLAs arise in gas that is hotter, more highly ionised and more enriched than\nthe gas giving rise to typical Lyman-Alpha forest absorbers. The majority of\nthe BLAs arise in warm-hot (log (T/K) ~ 5) gas at low (log Delta < 1.5)\noverdensities. On average, thermal broadening accounts for at least 60 per cent\nof the BLA line width, which in turn can be used as a rough indicator of the\nthermal state of the gas. Detectable BLAs account for only a small fraction of\nthe true baryon content of the WHIM at low redshift. In order to detect the\nbulk of the mass in this gas phase, a sensitivity at least one order of\nmagnitude better than achieved by current ultraviolet spectrographs is\nrequired. We argue that BLAs mostly trace gas that has been shock-heated and\nenriched by outflows and that they therefore provide an important window on a\npoorly understood feedback process. \n\n"}

In this paper, we\nrevisit the issue by re-simulating a Milky Way class dark matter (DM) halo with\nunprecedented resolution. Our set of cosmological hydrodynamic Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement (AMR) simulations, called the Nut suite, allows us to investigate\nthe effect of supernova feedback and UV photoionisation at high redshift with\nsub-parsec resolution.

We apply this method to three isolated\nbarred Tree-SPH N-body galaxies with strong radial migration. Contrary to\nexpectations, we find that as stellar samples migrate, on the average, their\nvelocity dispersion change (by as much as 50%) in such a way as to\napproximately match the non-migrating population at the radius at which they\narrive.

These simple, model-independent strategies\nreduce the set of assumptions to near axisymmetry of the disc and are designed\nfor kinematically hot stars, which are less affected by spiral arms and other\neffects. The first two methods use the position-dependent rotational streaming\nin the heliocentric radial velocities U. The resulting rotation estimate\n{\\theta} from U velocities does not depend on Vg,\\odot. The first approach\ncompares this with rotation from the galactic azimuthal velocities to constrain\nVg,\\odot at an assumed R0. Both Vg,\\odot and R0 can be determined using the\nproper motion of Sgr A\\ast as a second constraint. The second strategy makes\nuse of {\\theta} being roughly proportional to R0. Therefore a wrong R0 can be\ndetected by an unphysical trend of Vg,\\odot with the intrinsic rotation of\ndifferent populations. From these two strategies I estimate R0 = (8.27 \\pm\n0.29) kpc and Vg,\\odot = (250 \\pm 9) kms-1 for a stellar sample from SEGUE, or\nrespectively Vc = (238 \\pm 9) kms-1.

In particular, we show that\nthe radial profiles of median gas properties are smooth and do not exhibit\nfluctuations at locations of massive clumps in contrast to mean and mode\nproperties. It is shown that distribution of gas properties in a given radial\nshell can be well described by a log-normal PDF and a tail. The former\ncorresponds to a nearly hydrostatic bulk component, accounting for ~99% of the\nvolume, while the tail corresponds to high density inhomogeneities. We show\nthat this results in a simple and robust separation of the diffuse and clumpy\ncomponents of the ICM. The FWHM of the density distribution grows with radius\nand varies from ~0.15 dex in cluster centre to ~0.5 dex at 2r_500 in relaxed\nclusters. The small scatter in the width between relaxed clusters suggests that\nthe degree of inhomogeneity is a robust characteristic of the ICM.

Therefore, X-ray observations yield a\npotentially biased estimate of the thermal gas pressure, P_X. At the same time\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations directly measure the integrated gas\npressure, P_SZ. If the X-ray pressure profiles are strongly biased with respect\nto the SZ, then one has the possibility to probe the gas inhomogeneities, even\nat scales unresolved by the current generation of telescopes. At the same time,\na weak bias has implications for the interchangeable use of mass proxies like\nY_SZ and Y_X as cosmological probes. In this paper we investigate the\ndependence of the bias, defined as b_P(r)=P_X(r)/P_SZ(r)-1, on the\ncharacteristics of fluctuations in the ICM taking into account the correlation\nbetween temperature and density fluctuations. We made a simple prediction of\nthe irreducible bias in idealised X-ray vs SZ observations using\nmulti-temperature plasma emission model. We also provide a simple fitting form\nto estimate the bias given the distribution of fluctuations. Analysing a sample\nof 16 clusters extracted from hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the\nmedian value of bias is within +/-3% within R_500, it decreases to -5% at\nR_500<r<1.5R_500 and then rises back to ~0% at r >~ 2R_500. The scatter of\nb_P(r) between individual relaxed clusters is small -- at the level of <0.03\nwithin R_500, but turns significantly larger (0.25) and highly skewed at r>~\n1.5R_500.

Only\nthree confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters\n(GCs) of any galaxy so far, of which one nova and two SSSs (including the nova)\nwere found in M 31 GCs. To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a\nhigh-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and\nChandra. We analysed X-ray and optical data of a new transient X-ray source in\nthe M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations. Our\noptical data set was based on regular M 31 monitoring programmes from five\ndifferent small telescopes. Additionally, we made use of Pan-STARRS 1 data\nobtained during the PAndromeda survey. Our observations reveal that the X-ray\nsource in Bol 126 is the third SSS in an M 31 GC and can be confirmed as the\nsecond CN in the M 31 GC system. This nova is named M31N 2010-10f. Its\nproperties in the X-ray and optical regimes agree with a massive white dwarf\n(M_WD >~ 1.3 M_sun) in the binary system. Incorporating the data on previously\nfound (suspected) novae in M 31 GCs we used our high-cadence X-ray monitoring\nobservations to estimate a tentative nova rate in the M 31 GC system of 0.05\n/yr/GC. An optical estimate, based on the recent 10.5-year WeCAPP survey, gives\na lower nova rate, which is compatible with the X-ray rate on the 95%\nconfidence level. There is growing evidence that the nova rate in GCs is higher\nthan expected from primordial binary formation and under conditions as in the\nfield. Dynamical binary formation and/or additional accretion from the\nintracluster medium are possible scenarios for an increased nova rate, but\nobservational confirmation for this enhancement has been absent, so far.\nRegular X-ray monitoring observations of M 31 provide a promising strategy to\nfind these novae. \n\n"}

We use\nthe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a\n(noisy) map of the CMB lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure\nof the mass distribution back to the CMB last-scattering surface. Our lensing\npotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact\nwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale\nstructure. We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding\ngenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting LCDM model for\nthe Planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100\ncorrectly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures\nwhich source the lensing potential. When combined with the temperature power\nspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter\nconstraints; it improves CMB-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of two\nand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordial\nperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing a\nmeasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of\nlarge-scale polarization data. Discarding scale information, our measurement\ncorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential power\nspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the RMS amplitude of matter fluctuations at\nz~2. \n\n"}

Gravitational lensing-infrared background\n  correlation Abstract: The multi-frequency capability of the Planck satellite provides information\nboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infrared\nbackground, or CIB) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensing\neffect on the cosmic microwave background, or CMB). The conjunction of these\ntwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark and\nluminous matter in the high redshift (1 < z <3) Universe. We use a three-point\nstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.\nFollowing a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite of\nconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 GHz and CIB\nmeasurements at 100-857 GHz, we report the first detection of the correlation\nbetween the CIB and CMB lensing. The well matched redshift distribution of\nthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\n\\sigma at 545 GHz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.\nOur full set of multi-frequency measurements (both CIB auto- and CIB-lensing\ncross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with a\ncharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting CIB sources of\nlog_{10}(M/M_sun) = 10.5 \\pm 0.6.

We measure directly the SFR density\nwith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,\nthus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at early\ntimes. \n\n"}

An empirical modeling approach (2-SFM) which\ndistinguishes between the main sequence and rarer starburst galaxies is capable\nof reproducing most statistical properties of infrared galaxies. In this paper,\nwe extend this approach by establishing a connection between stellar mass and\nhalo mass with the technique of abundance matching. Based on a few, simple\nassumptions and a physically motivated formalism, our model successfully\npredicts the (cross-)power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB), the\ncross-correlation between CIB and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing,\nand the correlation functions of bright, resolved infrared galaxies measured by\nHerschel, Planck, ACT and SPT. We use this model to infer the redshift\ndistribution these observables, as well as the level of correlation between\nCIB-anisotropies at different wavelengths. We also predict that more than 90%\nof cosmic star formation activity occurs in halos with masses between 10^11.5\nand 10^13.5 Msun. Taking into account subsequent mass growth of halos, this\nimplies that the majority of stars were initially (at z>3) formed in the\nprogenitors of clusters, then in groups at 0.5<z<3 and finally in\nMilky-Way-like halos at z<0.5. At all redshifts, the dominant contribution to\nthe star formation rate density stems from halos of mass ~10^12 Msun, in which\nthe instantaneous star formation efficiency is maximal (~70%). The strong\nredshift-evolution of SFR in the galaxies that dominate the CIB is thus\nplausibly driven by increased accretion from the cosmic web onto halos of this\ncharacteristic mass scale.

The correlation translates to the average\nextinction ratio A250um/AJ = 0.0014 +/- 0.0002, assuming a standard\nnear-infrared extinction law and a dust emissivity index beta=2. Using an\nempirical NH/AJ ratio we obtain an average absorption cross-section per H\nnucleus of sigmaH(250um) = (1.8 +/- 0.3) * 10^(-25) cm^2 / H-atom,\ncorresponding to a cross-section per unit mass of gas kappaG(250 um) = 0.08 +/-\n0.01 cm^2 / g. The cloud model however suggests that owing to the bias caused\nby temperature changes along the line-of-sight these values underestimate the\ntrue cross-sections by up to 40% near the centre of the core. Assuming that the\nmodel describes the effect of the temperature variation on tauFIR correctly, we\nfind that the relationship between H-Ks and tauFIR agrees with the recently\ndetermined relationship between sigmaH and NH in Orion A. The derived far-IR\ncross-section agrees with previous determinations in molecular clouds with\nmoderate column densities, and is not particularly large compared with some\nother cold cores. We suggest that this is connected to the core not beng very\ndense (the central density is likely to be ~10^5 cm^-3) and judging from\nprevious molecular line data, it appears to be at an early stage of chemical\nevolution. \n\n"}

Thus, the collapse\nsoon becomes nearly pressureless, proceeding along its shortest dimension\nfirst. This naturally produces filaments in the cloud, and clumps within the\nfilaments. The filaments are not in equilibrium at any time, but instead are\nlong-lived flow features, through which the gas flows from the cloud to the\nclumps. The filaments are long-lived because they accrete from their\nenvironment while simultaneously accreting onto the clumps within them; they\nare essentially the locus where the flow changes from accreting in two\ndimensions to accreting in one dimension. Moreover, the clumps also exhibit a\nhierarchical nature: the gas in a filament flows onto a main, central clump,\nbut other, smaller-scale clumps form along the infalling gas.

The long-term evolution of SF rates and H_alpha\nmorphologies corresponding to the distributions of star-forming regions are\nparticularly investigated for different model parameters. The principal results\nare as follows. Whether ram pressure can enhance or reduce SF depends on M_h of\ndisk galaxies and inclination angles of gas disks with respect to their orbital\ndirections for a given orbit and a given environment. For example, SF can be\nmoderately enhanced in disk galaxies with M_h=10^12 M_sun at the pericenter\npassages in a cluster with M_h=10^14 M_sun whereas it can be completely shut\ndown (`quenching') for low-mass disks with M_h=10^10 M_sun. Ram pressure can\nreduce the H_alpha-to-optical-disk-size ratios of disks and the revel of the\nreduction depends on M_h and orbits of disk galaxies for a given environment.\nDisk galaxies under strong ram pressure show characteristic H_alpha\nmorphologies such as ring-like, one-sided, and crescent-like distributions. \n\n"}

No clear evolution of Mdust is observed at fixed SFR and Mstar.\nWe find a tight correlation between SFR and Mdust, likely a consequence of the\nSchmidt-Kennicutt (S-K) law.

All galaxies\nin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same SFR-Mgas relation\n(integrated S-K law), which broadly agrees with CO-based results for the bulk\nof the population, despite the completely different approaches. The majority of\ngalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (SFE=SFR/Mgas) ~5 times higher\nthan at z~0.

Here we extend these results to different distances from the\nGalactic center, looking for variations of observables that can be related to\non-going and future spectroscopic surveys. By separating the effects of\nkinematic heating and radial migration, we show that migration is much more\nimportant, even for the oldest and hottest stellar population. The\ndistributions of stellar birth guiding radii and final guiding radii\n(signifying contamination from migration and heating, respectively) widen with\nincreasing distance from the Galactic center. As a result, the slope in the\nage-metallicity relation flattens significantly at Galactic radii larger than\nsolar. The radial metallicity and [Mg/Fe] gradients in our model show\nsignificant variations with height above the plane due to changes in the\nmixture of stellar ages. An inversion in the radial metallicity gradient is\nfound from negative to weakly positive (at r<10 kpc), and from positive to\nnegative for the [Mg/Fe] gradient, with increasing distance from the disk\nplane. We relate this to the combined effect of (i) the predominance of young\nstars close to the disk plane and old stars away from it, (ii) the more\nconcentrated older stellar component, and (iii) the flaring of mono-age disk\npopulations.

We use XMM-Newton and simultaneous Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer\nobservations of the LMXB 4U 1636-53 to test this hypothesis. We study the\nproperties of the Fe-K emission line as a function of the spectral state of the\nsource and the frequency of the kHz QPOs. We find that the inner radius of the\naccretion disc deduced from the frequency of the upper kHz QPO varies as a\nfunction of the position of the source in the colour-colour diagram, in\naccordance with previous work and with the standard scenario of accretion disc\ngeometry. On the contrary, the inner disc radius deduced from the profile of\nthe Fe line is not correlated with the spectral state of the source. The values\nof the inner radius inferred from kHz QPOs and Fe lines, in four observations,\ndo not lead to a consistent value of the neutron star mass, regardless of the\nmodel used to fit the Fe line. Our results suggest that either the kHz QPO or\nthe standard relativistic Fe line interpretation does not apply for this\nsystem.

Our analysis is based on samples from the MYStIX survey and a new\nestimator of pre-main sequence (PMS) stellar ages, AgeJX, derived from X-ray\nand near-infrared photometric data. To overcome the problem of uncertain\nindividual ages and large spreads of age distributions for entire clusters, we\ncompute median ages and their confidence intervals of stellar samples within\nannular subregions of the clusters. We find core-halo age gradients in both the\nNGC 2024 cluster and ONC: PMS stars in cluster cores appear younger and thus\nwere formed later than PMS stars in cluster peripheries. These findings are\nfurther supported by the spatial gradients in the disk fraction and K-band\nexcess frequency. Our age analysis is based on AgeJX estimates for PMS stars,\nand is independent of any consideration of OB stars. The result has important\nimplications for the formation of young stellar clusters. One basic implication\nis that clusters form slowly and the apparent age spreads in young stellar\nclusters, which are often controversial, are (at least in part) real. The\nresult further implies that simple models where clusters form inside-out are\nincorrect, and more complex models are needed. We provide several star\nformation scenarios that alone or in combination may lead to the observed\ncore-halo age gradients. \n\n"}

Unfortunately,\ncharacterising the velocity field in cosmological N-body simulations is\ninherently complicated by two facts: i) The velocity field becomes manifestly\nmulti-valued after shell-crossing and has discontinuities at caustics.

Here we review\nthe requirements on inflation models for these consistency conditions to be\nsatisfied.

In solid inflation the simplest consistency conditions are already\nviolated whilst in the non-attractor model we find that, contrary to the\nstandard scenario, the tensor-scalar-scalar correlator probes directly relevant\nmodel-dependent information.

Water is the ideal tracer of these effects\nbecause it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.\nMethod: We present \\textit{Herschel} HIFI spectra of multiple water-transitions\ntowards 29 nearby Class 0/I protostars as part of the WISH Survey. These are\ndecomposed into different Gaussian components, with each related to one of\nthree parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock and\nspot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. We then constrain the\nexcitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. Results:\nWater emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios that\ndo not vary with velocity, in contrast to CO. The physical conditions of the\ncavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock H$_{2}$ densities of order\n10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\\,cm$^{-3}$ and H$_{2}$O column densities of order\n10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. H$_{2}$O emission originates in compact\nemitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources with\nradii of order 10-200\\,AU, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thin\nlayer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\\,AU.\nConclusions: Water emission at the source position traces two distinct\nkinematic components in the outflow; J shocks at the base of the outflow or in\nthe jet, and C shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. Class I sources have\nsimilar excitation conditions to Class 0 sources, but generally smaller\nline-widths and emitting region sizes. We suggest that it is the velocity of\nthe wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density or\nmass, that is the cause of the decrease in H$_{2}$O intensity between Class 0\nand I. \n\n"}

The internal dispersion velocities of the\ngas in the haloes have converged for a box size of 30 comoving Mpc, but the\ncentre-of-mass peculiar velocities of the haloes have not up to a box size of\n60 comoving Mpc. The density and temperature of the gas within the\ninstantaneous turn-around radii of the haloes are adequately captured for box\nsizes 30 Mpc on a side, but the results are highly sensitive to the treatment\nof unresolved, rapidly cooling gas, with the gas mass fraction within the\nvirial radius severely depleted by star formation in the GADGET-3 simulations.\nConvergence of the gas peculiar velocity field on large scales requires a box\nsize of at least 60 Mpc.

The\ncompensating terms provide inertial forces depending on the total momentum P,\nintrinsic angular momentum J and intrinsic inertia tensor I. Therefore, the\nprivileged frames where Newton's equations are valid (Newtonian frames) are\ncompletely determined by the matter distribution of the universe\n(Machianization). At the Hamiltonian level, the gauge invariance leads to first\nclass constraints that remove those degrees of freedom that make no sense once\nthe absolute space has been eliminated. This reformulation of classical\nmechanics is entirely relational, since it is a dynamics for the distances\nbetween particles.

One hypothesis is that they grew\nfrom >10^5 M_sun black holes that formed in the `direct collapse' of massive\ngas clouds that have low concentrations of both metals and molecular hydrogen\n(H_2). Such clouds could form in the early (z>10) Universe if pre-galactic gas\nis irradiated by H_2-photodissociating, far-ultraviolet (FUV) light from a\nnearby star-forming galaxy. In this work, we re-examine the critical FUV flux\nJ_crit that is required to keep H_2 photodissociated and lead to direct\ncollapse. We submit that the same galaxies that putatively supply the\nextraordinary FUV fluxes required for direct collapse should also produce\ncopious amounts of soft X-rays, which work to offset H_2 photodissociation by\nincreasing the ionization fraction and promoting H_2 formation. Accounting for\nthis effect increases the value of J_crit by a factor of at least 3-10,\ndepending on the brightness temperature of FUV radiation. This enhancement of\nJ_crit suppresses the abundance of potential direct collapse sites at z>10 by\nseveral orders of magnitude. Recent studies---without accounting for the soft\nX-rays from the FUV source galaxies---had already arrived at large values of\nJ_crit that implied that direct collapse may occur too rarely to account for\nthe observed abundance of high-redshift quasars. Our results suggest that\nJ_crit should be even higher than previously estimated, and pose an additional\nchallenge for the direct collapse scenario via strong FUV radiation to explain\nthe high-redshift quasar population. \n\n"}

Previous\ninvestigations showed there is a discrepancy between interpretation of\ngamma-ray and ionization data if gamma-rays are generated by proton-proton\ncollisions. Here we provided analysis of processes of ionization and emission\nbasing on analytical and numerical calculations of kinetic equations which\ndescribe processes of particle propagation and their energy losses. The origin\nof gamma rays could be either due to collisions of relativistic protons with\nthe dense gas of the surrounding circumnuclear disk (CND) or bremsstrahlung and\ninverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. The hydrogen ionization\nin this case is produced by a low energy component of the CR spectrum. We found\nthat if ionization is produced by protons the expected ionization rate of\nhydrogen in the CND is of the same order as derived from IR observations. So we\ndo not see any discrepancy between the gamma-ray and ionization data for the\nhadronic model. In the case of ionization by electrons we obtained the\nionization rate one order of magnitude higher than follows from the IR data. In\nprinciple, a selection between the leptonic and hadronic interpretations can be\nperformed basing on measurements of radio and X-ray fluxes from this region\nbecause the leptonic and hadronic models give different values of the fluxes\nfrom there. We do not exclude that gamma-ray production and hydrogen ionization\nin the CND are due to a past activity of Sgr A* which occurred about 100 year\nago. Then we hypothesize that there may be connection between a past proton\neruption and a flux of hard X-rays emitted by Sgr A* hundred years ago as\nfollows from the observed time variability of the iron line seen in the\ndirection of GC molecular clouds. \n\n"}

The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present day stellar\nmasses near M*, at 5x10^10 Msol (MW-mass) and 10^11 Msol (M31-mass). We study\nthe typical progenitors of these galaxies using ZFOURGE, a deep medium-band\nnear-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies\nout to z~3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main\nprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in\nthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and\nstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR\nHST imaging from CANDELS, and far-IR imaging from GOODS-H and CANDELS-H. The\ntypical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution\nstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,\nto redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and to\nred, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the\nMW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower\nredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than the\nprogenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution,\nincluding the suppression of star-formation in present-day M* galaxies requires\nan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold\nfor quiescent galaxies. The effective size and star-formation rates imply that\nthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to\nz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the S\\'ersic index.\nTherefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M* galaxies corresponds to a rapid\ndecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formation\nefficiency. \n\n"}

In\nthis work, we investigate the effects of galaxy cluster mergers on the scaling\nrelation using the Omega500 high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulation. We show that the non-thermal pressure associated with\nmerger-induced gas motions contributes significantly to the bias, scatter, and\nevolution of the scaling relation. After the merger, the kinetic energy of\nmerging systems is slowly converted into thermal energy through dissipation of\nturbulent gas motions, which causes the thermal SZE signal to increase steadily\nwith time. This post-merger evolution is one of the primary source of bias and\nscatter in the Y-M relation.

Of the\nobserved high quality and extended rotation curves of these galaxies\ndecompositions have been made, for four different schemes, each with two free\nparameters.

For the alternative gravitational theory of MOND the rotation curves\ncan be explained if the fundamental parameter associated with MOND is allowed\nas a free parameter. Fixing that parameter leads to a disagreement between the\npredicted and observed rotation curves for a few galaxies.

This flare occurred in a massive,\nstar forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks to\nrepeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. By taking\ndifference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year SDSS Stripe-82\nlight-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum over\nthe course of the outburst. The tidal disruption event (TDE) interpretation is\nconsistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, which\ndisplays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (with\na clear superimposed re-brightening flare).

Due to the relative youth of this field, there is\nstill much to be done to understand intrinsic galaxy alignments and this review\nsummarises the current state of the field, providing a solid basis for future\nwork. \n\n"}

We argue that the ICM of the cooling\nflow galaxy group NGC 5813 is more likely to be heated by mixing of post-shock\njets' gas residing in hot bubbles with the ICM, than by shocks or\nturbulent-heating. Shocks thermalize only a small fraction of their energy in\nthe inner regions of the cooling flow; in order to adequately heat the inner\npart of the ICM, they would overheat the outer regions by a large factor,\nleading to its ejection from the group.

Here we report on VLT/GIRAFFE spectra of candidate\nmember stars in two recently discovered ultra-faint satellites Reticulum 2 and\nHorologium 1, obtained as part of the ongoing Gaia-ESO Survey. We identify 18\nmembers in Reticulum 2 and 5 in Horologium 1. We find Reticulum 2 to have a\nvelocity dispersion of ~3.22 km/s, implying a M/L ratio of ~ 500. We have\ninferred stellar parameters for all candidates and we find Reticulum 2 to have\na mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.46+/-0.1, with an intrinsic dispersion of ~\n0.29, and is alpha-enhanced to the level of [alpha/Fe]~0.4. We conclude that\nReticulum 2 is a dwarf galaxy.

Horologium 1 is slightly more metal-poor than Reticulum\n2 [Fe/H] = -2.76 +/- 0.1 and is similarly alpha-enhanced: [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.3.\nDespite a large error-bar, we also measure a significant spread of\nmetallicities of 0.17 dex which strengthen the evidence that Horologium 1 is\nindeed a dwarf galaxy. The line-of-sight velocity of Reticulum 2 is offset by\nsome 100 km/s from the prediction of the orbital velocity of the LMC, thus\nmaking its association with the Cloud uncertain. However, at the location of\nHorologium 1, both the backward integrated LMC's orbit and the LMC's halo are\npredicted to have radial velocities similar to that of the dwarf.

The\nmerger mechanism is revealed to be categorized into three types:\ngas-drag-driven merger (type A), interplay-driven merger (type B), and\nthree-body-driven merger (type C). We find the relation between the merger\nmechanism and the ratio of the gas mass within the initial BH orbit ($M_{gas}$)\nto the total BH mass (${\\Sigma}M_{BH}$).

We present the results of\na semi-analytical galaxy formation model that follows the evolution of dark\nmatter halos along merger trees, as well as that of the baryonic components.\nThis model allows us to study the evolution of NSCs in a cosmological context,\nby taking into account the growth of NSCs due to both dynamical friction-driven\nmigration of stellar clusters and star formation triggered by infalling gas,\nwhile also accounting for dynamical heating from (binary) MBHs.

A new Scenario for\n  Intermediate Mass Black Hole Formation in Globular Clusters Abstract: We discuss a new scenario for the formation of intermediate mass black holes\nin dense star clusters. In this scenario, intermediate mass black holes are\nformed as a result of dynamical interactions of hard binaries containing a\nstellar mass black hole, with other stars and binaries. We discuss the\nnecessary conditions to initiate the process of intermediate mass black hole\nformation and the influence of an intermediate mass black hole on the host\nglobal globular cluster properties. We discuss two scenarios for intermediate\nmass black hole formation. The SLOW and FAST scenarios. They occur later or\nearlier in the cluster evolution and require smaller or extremely large central\ndensities, respectively. In our simulations, the formation of intermediate mass\nblack holes is highly stochastic. In general, higher formation probabilities\nfollow from larger cluster concentrations (i.e. central densities). We further\ndiscuss possible observational signatures of the presence of intermediate mass\nblack holes in globular clusters that follow from our simulations.

One possible scenario is that SMGs have i) an\nextended gas component with a low dust temperature, and which can be traced by\nlow- to mid-$J$ CO line emission and radio continuum emission, and ii) a\nwarmer, compact starburst region giving rise to the high-$J$ line emission of\nCO, which could dominate the dust continuum size measurements. Because of the\nrapid cooling of CR electrons in dense starburst galaxies ($\\sim10^4-10^5$ yr),\nthe more extended synchrotron radio-emitting size being a result of CR\ndiffusion seems unlikely.

In this paper, we study a sample of giant transiting exoplanets\ndetected by the Kepler telescope with orbital periods up to 400 days.

This\nallow us to unveil the nature of these candidates and to measure a\nfalse-positive rate of 54.6 +/- 6.5 % for giant-planet candidates orbiting\nwithin 400 days of period. Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we\nthen derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges of\norbital periods. The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 days\nis 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets.

In\n2008 August, Fermi/LAT detected the blazar PKS 1502+106 showing a rapid and\nstrong gamma-ray outburst followed by high and variable flux over the next\nmonths. This activity at high energies triggered an intensive multi-wavelength\ncampaign covering also the radio, optical, UV, and X-ray bands indicating that\nthe flare was accompanied by a simultaneous outburst at optical/UV/X-rays and a\ndelayed outburst at radio bands.\n  Aims: In the current work we explore the phenomenology and physical\nconditions within the ultra-relativistic jet of the gamma-ray blazar PKS\n1502+106. Additionally, we address the question of the spatial localization of\nthe MeV/GeV-emitting region of the source.\n  Methods: We utilize ultra-high angular resolution mm-VLBI observations at 43\nand 86 GHz complemented by VLBI observations at 15 GHz. We also employ\nsingle-dish radio data from the F-GAMMA program at frequencies matching the\nVLBI monitoring.\n  Results: PKS 1502+106 shows a compact core-jet morphology and fast\nsuperluminal motion with apparent speeds in the range 5--22 c.

We study the physical and chemical properties of the jets and\nprotostellar sources in the NGC1333-IRAS4A proto-binary system using continuum\nemission and molecular tracers of shocked gas. We observed NGC1333-IRAS4A in\nthe SiO(6-5), SO(6_5-5_4), and CO(2-1) lines and the continuum emission at 1.3,\n1.4, and 3 mm using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer in the framework of\nthe CALYPSO large program. We clearly disentangle for the first time the\noutflow emission from the two sources A1 and A2. The two protostellar jets have\nvery different properties: the A1 jet is faster, has a short dynamical\ntimescale (<10^3 yr), and is associated with H2 shocked emission, whereas the\nA2 jet, which dominates the large-scale emission, is associated with diffuse\nemission, bends, and emits at slower velocities. The observed bending of the A2\njet is consistent with the change of propagation direction observed at large\nscale and suggests jet precession on very short timescales (~200-600 yr). In\naddition, a chemically rich spectrum with emission from several COMs (e.g.\nHCOOH, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3) is only detected towards A2. Finally, very\nhigh-velocity shocked emission (~50 km s^-1) is observed along the A1 jet. An\nLTE analysis shows that SiO, SO, and H2CO abundances in the gas phase are\nenhanced up to (3-4)x10^{-7}, (1.4-1.7)x10^{-6}, and (3-7.9)x10^{-7},\nrespectively. The intrinsic different properties of the jets and driving\nsources in NGC1333-IRAS4A suggest different evolutionary stages for the two\nprotostars, with A1 being younger than A2, in a very early stage of star\nformation previous to the hot-corino phase. \n\n"}

The cold front width varies from 4 kpc down to\nclose to the electron mean free path. Inside the front are multiple metallicity\nblobs on scales of 5-10 kpc, which could have been uplifted by AGN activity,\nalso explaining the central metallicity drop and flat inner metallicity\nprofile.

We show here the first evidence that the\nMilky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end\nof its thick disk formation $\\sim$9 Gyr ago. Elemental abundances of stars\nstudied as part of the APOGEE survey reveal indeed that in less than $\\sim$2\nGyr the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order-of-magnitude.\nBecause of the tight correlation between age and alpha abundance, this event\nreflects in the dearth of stars along the inner disk sequence in the\n[Fe/H]-[$\\alpha$/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the\nMilky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at\na much lower level to form the thin disk. These events are very well matched by\nthe latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late type\ngalaxies, quenching is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion\nof gas. In our Galaxy, it occurred on a much shorter time scale, while the\nchemical continuity before and after the quenching indicates that it was not\ndue to the exhaustion of the gas. While quenching is generally associated with\nspheroids, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way,\npossibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin\ndisks. Given the demographics of late type galaxies in the local universe, in\nwhich classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true\ngenerally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately $M^*$, where\nquenching could be directly a consequence of thick disk formation. We emphasize\nthat the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and\nrelated to, the formation of the bar.

Abstract: The gravitationally-lensed galaxy A1689-zD1 is one of the most distant\nspectroscopically confirmed sources ($z=7.5$). It is the earliest known galaxy\nwhere the interstellar medium (ISM) has been detected; dust emission was\ndetected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also\nunusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is\ntherefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical\ngalaxy at this redshift. We observed A1689-zD1 with ALMA in bands 6 and 7 and\nwith the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in band $Q$. To study the structure of\nA1689-zD1, we map the mm thermal dust emission and find two spatial components\nwith sizes about $0.4-1.7$\\,kpc (lensing-corrected). The rough spatial\nmorphology is similar to what is observed in the near-infrared with {\\it HST}\nand points to a perturbed dynamical state, perhaps indicative of a major merger\nor a disc in early formation. The ALMA photometry is used to constrain the\nfar-infrared spectral energy distribution, yielding a dust temperature ($T_{\\rm\ndust} \\sim 35$--$45$\\,K for $\\beta = 1.5-2$).

The ALMA images triggered numerous theoretical\nstudies based on disk-planet interactions, magnetically driven disk structures,\nand grain evolution.

The spectral energy distribution of\n  dust in clusters of galaxies Abstract: Although infrared (IR) overall dust emission from clusters of galaxies has\nbeen statistically detected using data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite\n(IRAS), it has not been possible to sample the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of this emission over its peak, and thus to break the degeneracy between\ndust temperature and mass. By complementing the IRAS spectral coverage with\nPlanck satellite data from 100 to 857 GHz, we provide new constraints on the IR\nspectrum of thermal dust emission in clusters of galaxies. We achieve this by\nusing a stacking approach for a sample of several hundred objects from the\nPlanck cluster sample; this procedure averages out fluctuations from the IR\nsky, allowing us to reach a significant detection of the faint cluster\ncontribution. We also use the large frequency range probed by Planck, together\nwith component-separation techniques, to remove the contamination from both\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect (tSZ) signal, which dominate below 353 GHz. By excluding dominant\nspurious signals or systematic effects, averaged detections are reported at\nfrequencies between 353 and 5000 GHz. We confirm the presence of dust in\nclusters of galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts, yielding an SED with a\nshape similar to that of the Milky Way. Planck's beam does not allow us to\ninvestigate the detailed spatial distribution of this emission (e.g., whether\nit comes from intergalactic dust or simply the dust content of the cluster\ngalaxies), but the radial distribution of the emission appears to follow that\nof the stacked SZ signal, and thus the extent of the clusters. The recovered\nSED allows us to constrain the dust mass responsible for the signal, as well as\nits temperature. We additionally explore the evolution of the IR emission as a\nfunction of cluster mass and redshift. \n\n"}

A path to\ndetermine macroscopic ICM properties opened up with the discovery of \"cold\nfronts\".

The high spatial resolution of the\nChandra X-ray Observatory revealed two puzzles about the cold fronts. First,\nthey should be subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites, yet in many cases they\nappear relatively smooth and undisturbed. Second, the width of the interface\nbetween the two gas phases is typically narrower than the mean free path of the\nparticles in the plasma, indicating negligible thermal conduction.

Further, the average LAE spatial\ndensity in the imaged field is twice that derived by other field LAE surveys.\nSpectroscopy with Keck/DEIMOS yielded redshifts for 164 galaxies (79 LAEs and\n85 LBGs); 65 lie at a redshift of 3.785+/-0.010. The velocity dispersion of\ngalaxies near the core is 350+/-40 km/s, a value robust to selection effects.\nThe overdensities are likely to collapse into systems with present-day masses\nof >10^{15} solar masses and >6x10^{14} solar masses.

The irradiation of the ice was\nmonitored by means of infrared spectroscopy and the molecules in the gas phase\nwere detected using quadrupole mass spectroscopy. Fully deuterated methanol was\nused for confirmation of the results. The photodesorption of methanol to the\ngas phase was not observed in the mass spectra at different irradiation\ntemperatures.

We study two systematic\nbiases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and\nsubtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a\nsuppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a\nsuppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond\nthe thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency\nscales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or\navoidance methods.

Galaxy clusters are continuously growing through the accretion of\nmatter in their outskirts. This process induces inhomogeneities in the gas\ndensity distribution (clumping) which need to be taken into account to recover\nthe physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at large radii. Aims.\nWe studied the thermodynamic properties in the outskirts (R > R500) of the\nmassive galaxy cluster Abell 2142 by combining the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect with the X-ray signal. Methods. We combined the SZ pressure profile\nmeasured by Planck with the XMM-Newton gas density profile to recover radial\nprofiles of temperature, entropy and hydrostatic mass out to 2R500. We used a\nmethod that is insensitive to clumping to recover the gas density, and we\ncompared the results with traditional X-ray measurement techniques. Results.\nWhen taking clumping into account, our joint SZ/X-ray entropy profile is\nconsistent with the predictions from pure gravitational collapse, whereas a\nsignificant entropy flattening is found when the effect of clumping is\nneglected. The hydrostatic mass profile recovered using joint X-ray/SZ data\nagrees with that obtained from spectroscopic X-ray measurements and with mass\nreconstructions obtained through weak lensing and galaxy kinematics.\nConclusions. We found that clumping can explain the entropy flattening observed\nby Suzaku in the outskirts of several clusters. When using a method insensitive\nto clumping for the reconstruction of the gas density, the thermodynamic\nproperties of Abell 2142 are compatible with the assumption that the thermal\ngas pressure sustains gravity and that the entropy is injected at accretion\nshocks, with no need to evoke more exotic physics.

Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be\nobtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is\nchallenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic\neffects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report\nresolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple\nmerger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at\nthe IRAM 30m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal\n(tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we\nextract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The\nkSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and +3.4\nsigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us\nand coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a\nmajor merging event.

The bubble formed by\nthe wind eventually breaks out of the disk, and most of the wind moves directly\nout of the galaxy and is definitively lost. The fraction of the wind moving\nnearly parallel to the galactic plane carves a hole in the disk which will\ncontract after the end of the SN activity.

To\nexplain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a\nsecond population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the\nlow-mass stars in the initial GC population. The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The\nlatter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface\ndensity profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first\nplace by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution\nis governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc. We\nconclude that the size and lifetime of the disc are probably not sufficient to\naccrete the amount of mass required in Bastian et al.'s scenario. \n\n"}

Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether\nthey can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in\nastrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The\ndiscovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven\nuseful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of\nturbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a\ncommon regime in accretion disks.

Our analysis relies on deep VLT/X-Shooter long-slit\nspectra, along with newly developed stellar population models, allowing for\n[Na/Fe] variations, up to 1.2dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity,\nand IMF slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent\nspectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the\nfirst time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of\nmassive early-type galaxies, finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe], in the range\n0.5-0.7dex, and a bottom-heavy IMF. Therefore, individual abundance variations\ncannot be fully responsible for the trends of gravity-sensitive indices,\nstrengthening the case towards a non-universal IMF.

In this paper, we assemble a\nfew data samples of local and distant star-forming galaxies to analyse various\ndust-related quantities in low and high redshift galaxies, to study how the\nrelations linking the dust mass to the stellar mass and star formation rate\nevolve with redshift. We interpret the available data by means of chemical\nevolution models for discs and proto-spheroid (PSPH) starburst galaxies. In\nparticular, we focus on the dust-to-stellar mass (DTS) ratio, as this quantity\nrepresents a true measure of how much dust per unit stellar mass survives the\nvarious destruction processes in galaxies and is observable. The theoretical\nmodels outline the strong dependence of this quantity on the underlying star\nformation history.

Conventional global 21-cm experiments rely on\nthe spectral smoothness of the foreground synchrotron emission to separate it\nfrom the unique 21-cm spectral structures in a single total-power spectrum.\nHowever, frequency-dependent instrumental and observational effects are known\nto corrupt such smoothness and complicates the foreground subtraction. We\nintroduce a polarimetric approach to measure the projection-induced\npolarization of the anisotropic foreground onto a stationary dual-polarized\nantenna. Due to Earth rotation, when pointing the antenna at a celestial pole,\nthe revolving foreground will modulate this polarization with a unique\nfrequency-dependent sinusoidal signature as a function of time. In our\nsimulations, by harmonic decomposing this dynamic polarization, our technique\nproduces two separate spectra in parallel from the same observation: (i) a\ntotal sky power consisting both the foreground and the 21-cm background, (ii) a\nmodel-independent measurement of the foreground spectrum at a harmonic\nconsistent to twice the sky rotation rate. In the absence of any instrumental\neffects, by scaling and subtracting the latter from the former, we recover the\ninjected global 21-cm model within assumed uncertainty. We further discuss\nseveral limiting factors and potential remedies for future implementation. \n\n"}

As a first\nstep towards a fully predictive theory, we investigate the effect of\nnon-radiative hydrodynamics on the structure of galaxy groups sized halos,\nwhich contribute the most to the weak lensing power spectrum. We perform high\nresolution (more than one million particles per halo and one kilo-parsec\nresolution) non-radiative hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of a sample of 16\nhalos, comparing the profiles to popular analytical models. We find that the\ntotal mass profile is well fitted by a Navarro, Frenk & White model, with\nparameters slightly modified from the dark matter only simulation. We also find\nthat the Komatsu & Seljak hydrostatic solution provides a good fit to the gas\nprofiles, with however significant deviations, arising from strong turbulent\nmixing in the core and from non-thermal, turbulent pressure support in the\noutskirts. The turbulent energy follows a shallow, rising linear profile with\nradius, and correlates with the halo formation time. Using only three main\nstructural halo parameters as variables (total mass, concentration parameter\nand central gas density), we can predict with an accuracy better than 20% the\nindividual gas density and temperature profiles.

Nine of these candidates lie nearby to near-infrared sources,\nboosting their reliability; in six cases the observed line frequency and\nstrength are consistent with expectations given the photometric redshift and\nproperties of the galaxy counterparts.

We use this observation to\nplace constraints on the density profile of dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the\nassumption that the galactic center excess is in fact a signal from\nannihilating dark matter. We place constraints on the generalized NFW parameter\n$\\gamma$ and the Einasto profile parameter $\\alpha$ which control the\nlogarithmic slope of the inner regions of the halo's density profile.

The spectra show multiple emission lines with variable\ninverse P-Cygni profiles and a highly variable blueshifted absorption below the\ncontinuum. Line ratios from metallic emission lines (Fe I/Fe II, Ti I/Ti II)\nsuggest temperatures of $\\sim$5800-6000 K in the accretion flow.\nPhotometrically and spectroscopically, the 2014-2017 event displays an\nintermediate behavior between EXors and FUors.

The PSF\nbiases the line shift of regions near the core as much as $\\sim 40-50$ km\ns$^{-1}$, so it is crucial to model this effect carefully. We also infer that\nif sloshing motions dominate the observed velocity gradient, Perseus must be\nobserved from a line of sight which is somewhat inclined from the plane of\nthese motions, but one that still allows the spiral pattern to be visible.\nFinally, we find that assuming isotropy of motions can underestimate the total\nvelocity and kinetic energy of the core in our simulation by as much as\n$\\sim$60%.

Classically, polarization\nis expected from non-spherical grains aligned with the magnetic field.\nRecently, two alternatives have been suggested. One polarization mechanism is\ncaused by self-scattering from dust grains of sizes comparable to the\nwavelength while the other mechanism is due to grains aligned with their short\naxes along the direction of radiation anisotropy. The latter has recently been\nshown as a likely mechanism for causing the dust polarization detected in HL\nTau at 3.1 mm. In this paper, we present ALMA polarization observations of HL\nTau for two more wavelengths: 870 $\\mu$m and 1.3 mm. The morphology at 870\n$\\mu$m matches the expectation for self-scattering, while that at 1.3 mm shows\na mix between self-scattering and grains aligned with the radiation anisotropy.\nThe observations cast doubt on the ability of (sub)millimeter continuum\npolarization to probe disk magnetic fields for at least HL Tau. By showing two\ndistinct polarization morphologies at 870 $\\mu$m and 3.1 mm and a transition\nbetween the two at 1.3 mm, this paper provides definitive evidence that the\ndominant (sub)millimeter polarization mechanism transitions with wavelength. In\naddition, if the polarization at 870 $\\mu$m is due to scattering, the lack of\npolarization asymmetry along the minor axis of the inclined disk implies that\nthe large grains responsible for the scattering have already settled into a\ngeometrically thin layer, and the presence of asymmetry along the major axis\nindicates that the HL Tau disk is not completely axisymmetric. \n\n"}

The purpose of this\nwork is to provide the first complete and robust photometric empirical\ncalibration of the Gaia Red Clump stars of the solar neighbourhood, through\ncolour-colour, effective temperature-colour and absolute magnitude-colour\nrelations, from the Gaia, Johnson, 2MASS, Hipparcos, Tycho-2, APASS-SLOAN and\nWISE photometric systems, and the APOGEE DR13 spectroscopic temperatures. We\nused a 3D extinction map to select low reddening red giants. To calibrate the\ncolour-colour and the effective temperature-colour relations, we developed a\nMCMC method which accounts for all variable uncertainties and selects the best\nmodel for each photometric relation. We estimate the Red Clump absolute\nmagnitude through the mode of a kernel-based distribution function. We provide\n20 colour vs G-Ks relations and the first Teff vs G-Ks calibration.

However, this\nmethod is limited by degeneracies between the density profile of dark matter\nand the stellar mass-to-light ratio. In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether $M_*/L$\ngradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF,\nor to gradients in the IMF itself. The inclusion of $M_*/L$ gradients decreases\ndramatically the inferred IMF normalisation, compared to previous lensing-based\nstudies, with the exact value depending on the assumed dark matter profile. The\nmain effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass\ndistribution towards the high mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF\ndistribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected. \n\n"}

In these simulations, filaments are not in a static equilibrium, but\nare long-lived flow structures that accrete gas from their environment and\ndirect it toward clumps embedded in the filament or at the nodes at the\nconjunction with other filaments. In this context, the magnetic field is\ndragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that\ngenerates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and\nthe magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas\ndensity increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to\nthe filament, and magnetic lines also tend to align with it. At the spine of\nthe filament, however, magnetic lines become perpendicular again since they\nmust connect to lines on the opposite side of the filament, resulting in\n\"U\"-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal\nflow along the filament. Magnetic diffusive processes, however, allow the gas\nto continue to flow. Assuming a stationary state in which the ram pressure of\nthe flow balances the magnetic tension, the curvature of the field lines is\ndetermined by the diffusion rate.

The first run was carried out under the ideal MHD approximation,\nwhile ambipolar and ohmic diffusion was incorporated in the second calculation.\nIn the ideal MHD simulation, the magnetic field dominates the energy budget\neverywhere inside and around the first core, fueling interchange instabilities\nand driving a low-velocity outflow. High magnetic braking removes essentially\nall angular momentum from the second core.

This result is consistent with the idea that the relative AGN\ncontribution in the optical emission becomes more significant at a later stage\nin the major merger scenario. We discovered eight IR-bright DOGs showing a\nsignificant blue excess in blue HSC bands (BluDOGs). This blue excess can be\ninterpreted as a leaked AGN emission that is either a directly leaking or a\nscattered AGN emission, as proposed for some blue-excess Hot DOGs in earlier\nstudies. \n\n"}

Efficient feature selection and interpretation\n  for photometric redshifts Abstract: The explosion of data in recent years has generated an increasing need for\nnew analysis techniques in order to extract knowledge from massive datasets.\nMachine learning has proved particularly useful to perform this task. Fully\nautomatized methods have recently gathered great popularity, even though those\nmethods often lack physical interpretability. In contrast, feature based\napproaches can provide both well-performing models and understandable\ncausalities with respect to the correlations found between features and\nphysical processes. Efficient feature selection is an essential tool to boost\nthe performance of machine learning models. In this work, we propose a forward\nselection method in order to compute, evaluate, and characterize better\nperforming features for regression and classification problems. Given the\nimportance of photometric redshift estimation, we adopt it as our case study.\nWe synthetically created 4,520 features by combining magnitudes, errors, radii,\nand ellipticities of quasars, taken from the SDSS. We apply a forward selection\nprocess, a recursive method in which a huge number of feature sets is tested\nthrough a kNN algorithm, leading to a tree of feature sets. The branches of the\ntree are then used to perform experiments with the random forest, in order to\nvalidate the best set with an alternative model. We demonstrate that the sets\nof features determined with our approach improve the performances of the\nregression models significantly when compared to the performance of the classic\nfeatures from the literature. The found features are unexpected and surprising,\nbeing very different from the classic features. Therefore, a method to\ninterpret some of the found features in a physical context is presented. The\nmethodology described here is very general and can be used to improve the\nperformance of machine learning models for any regression or classification\ntask. \n\n"}

The observation that the power of radio sources increases with\nredshift, whereas the cosmological assembly of mass proceeds vice versa means\nthat radio sources have their strongest impact in the early Universe.

Previous observations used to study these distributions\nhave been limited by two important observational factors: (1) sensitivity\nlimits that leave the lowest-mass sources undetected, or (2) resolution limits\nthat cannot distinguish binaries and/or cluster members in close proximity.\nMethods: Recent millimeter-wavelength interferometry observations can now\nuncover faint and/or compact sources in order to study a more complete\npopulation of protostars, especially in nearby ($D<500$ pc) clusters.

Here we employ a Cramer--Rao (CRLB)\nor Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in\neleven known streams (ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D,\nPS1E, Sangarius and Triangulum). This approach depends on a generative model,\nwhich we have developed previously, and which permits calculation of\nderivatives of predicted stream properties with respect to Galaxy and stream\nparameters. We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on\neccentric orbits contain the most information about the halo shape. For each\nstream, there are near-degeneracies between dark-matter-halo properties and\nparameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor, but simultaneous\nfitting of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level.\nAt this precision, simulated dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic\nparametrizations, so we add an expansion of basis functions to give the\ngravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information\nabout the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current\nposition of the stream. In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream\nappears to measure the local acceleration at its current position; this\nmotivates thinking about future non-parametric approaches. The CRLB formalism\nalso permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar\nvelocities, distances, and proper motions.

As a result, both Jovian and Neptunian Trojans share a common\norigin with the primordial disk population, whose other surviving members\nconstitute today's trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations.

In contrast, Jovian and\nNeptunian Trojans are observed to be blue. While the absence of ultra-red\nJovian Trojans can be readily explained by the sublimation of volatile material\nfrom their surfaces due to the high flux of solar radiation at 5AU, the lack of\nultra-red Neptunian Trojans presents both a puzzle and a challenge to formation\nmodels.

The\nstronger central tidal fields of cuspier halos minimize the cluster's ability\nto expand in response to mass loss due to stellar evolution during its early\nevolutionary stages and during its subsequent long-term evolution driven by\ntwo-body relaxation. Hence clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter halos are\ncharacterized by more compact sizes, higher velocity dispersions and remain\napproximately isotropic at all clustercentric distances. Conversely, clusters\nin cored halos can expand more and develop a velocity distribution profile that\nbecomes increasingly radially anisotropic at larger clustercentric distances.\nFinally, the larger velocity dispersion of clusters evolving in cuspier dark\nmatter profiles results in them having longer relaxation times. Hence clusters\nin cuspy galaxies relax at a slower rate and, consequently, they are both less\nmass segregated and farther from complete energy equipartition than cluster's\nin cored galaxies. Application of this work to observations allows for star\nclusters to be used as tools to measure the distribution of dark matter in\ndwarf galaxies and to distinguish isolated star clusters from ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

Most cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations focus\ntheir computational effort on the galaxies themselves and treat the CGM more\ncoarsely, which means small-scale structure cannot be resolved. We get around\nthis issue by running zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with\nstandard mass refinement and additional uniform spatial refinement within the\nvirial radius. This results in a detailed view of its gaseous halo at\nunprecedented (1 kpc) uniform resolution with only a moderate increase in\ncomputational time. The improved spatial resolution does not impact the central\ngalaxy or the average density of the CGM. However, it drastically changes the\nradial profile of the neutral hydrogen column density, which is enhanced at\ngalactocentric radii larger than 40 kpc. The covering fraction of Lyman-Limit\nSystems within 150 kpc is almost doubled.

Both types of\ngalaxies contain hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) which emit ionizing\nphotons. The difference must thus lie in the presence or absence of a reservoir\nof ionizable gas.

To avoid biases in the\ncomparison, we pair-match liny and lineless in stellar-mass, redshift and\nhalf-light Petrosian radius. We detect marginal differences in their optical\nstellar ages and NUV luminosities, indicating that liny RGs have an excess of\nintermediate-age (0.1--5 Gyr) stellar populations. Liny RGs show higher dust\nattenuation and $W3$ luminosities than their lineless counterparts.

This signature of low neutron-capture element abundances traces\nchemical enrichment in the least massive star-forming dark matter halos, and\nfurther shows that the dominant sources of neutron-capture elements in\nmetal-poor stars are rare. In contrast, all known globular clusters have\nsimilar ratios of neutron-capture elements to those of halo stars, suggesting\nthat globular clusters form as part of relatively massive galaxies rather than\nin their own dark matter halos. The low neutron-capture element abundances may\nbe the strongest evidence that Gru I and Tri II are (or once were) galaxies\nrather than globular clusters, and we expect future observations of these\nsystems to robustly find non-zero velocity dispersions or signs of tidal\ndisruption.

In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength.

The front is seen\nin the Chandra data as a sharp discontinuity in the gas density which\ndelineates a large body of dense cool gas moving with the near-sonic velocity\nthrough the less dense, hotter gas. Without a magnetic field, the front should\nbe quickly disturbed by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability arising from\ntangential motion of gas layers. However, Chandra image shows that the front is\nstable within a +-30deg sector in the direction of the cloud motion, beyond\nwhich it gradually disappears. We suggest that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nwithin the +-30deg sector is suppressed by surface tension of the magnetic\nfield whose field lines are parallel to the front. The required field strength\nis B ~ 10 muG. Magnetic field near the front is expected to be stronger and\nhave very different structure compared to the bulk of the intergalactic medium,\nbecause the field lines are stretched by the tangential gas motions. Such a\nmagnetic configuration, once formed, would effectively stop the plasma\ndiffusion and heat conduction across the front, and may inhibit gas mixing\nduring the subcluster merger.

The full\nlight curve consists of 26655 individual points obtained between 1901 and 2001.\nThe light curve and its periodicity were analysed with help of the O-C diagram,\nFourier analysis and time-frequency analysis. The results demonstrate the\nlimitations of these linear methods. The next step was to investigate the\npossible presence of low-dimensional chaos in the light curve. For this, a\nsmoothed and noise-filtered signal was created from the averaged data and with\nhelp of time delay embedding, we have tried to reconstruct the attractor of the\nsystem. The main result is that R Cygni shows such period-doubling events that\ncan be interpreted as caused by a repetitive bifurcation of the chaotic\nattractor between a period 2T orbit and chaos. The switch between these two\nstates occurs in a certain compact region of the phase space, where the light\ncurve is characterized by ~1500-days long transients.

The age-IMF\ndegeneracy of integrated spectra of stellar populations can be broken for the\nUniverse as a whole by using direct measurements of (relative) cosmic SFH from\nhigh-redshift observations.

This slope is in good agreement with\nthe Salpeter IMF slope (Gamma=1.35).

Although trivial in principle, these\ncomparisons are not always simple. We demonstrate that the projected\nspectroscopic temperature of thermally complex clusters obtained from X-ray\nobservations is always lower than the emission-weighed temperature, which is\nwidely used in the analysis of numerical simulations. We show that this\ntemperature bias is mainly related to the fact that the emission-weighted\ntemperature does not reflect the actual spectral properties of the observed\nsource. This has important implications for the study of thermal structures in\nclusters, especially when strong temperature gradients, like shock fronts, are\npresent.

The spinning fragment has a deformed shape and looks like an oblate\nellipsoid. Due to the virtual non-compressibility of nuclear matter, and the\npolarization of the spin in the plane transverse to the input momentum of the\nprojectile nucleus such an ellipsoid has a reduced mean interaction\ncross-section compared with a non-spinning fragment which has a spherical\nshape. Purely geometrical arguments dictate that such an ellipsoidal nucleus\nshould have additional fluctuations of cross-section even at a fixed impact\nparameter dependent on the orientation angle between the axis of the ellipsoid\nand the vector connecting the centers of projectile and target nucleus. The\nnumber of 'wounded nucleons' in the projectile nucleus participating in the\ninteraction correlates strongly with the interaction cross-section. All these\neffects lead to a non-exponential attenuation of fragments and increased\nprobability for a fragment to penetrate down to a larger depth in the absorber,\nthan normal.\n  If the sling effect appears in the interaction of a primary cosmic ray\nnucleus with nuclei in the atmosphere the induced atmospheric cascade will have\na slower attenuation, and thereby can help to reduce some important\ninconsistencies in the interpretation of the existing experimental data on\nextensive air showers, observed in the lower half of the atmosphere.

A gradual\nrelease of energy in the stellar magnetosphere is expected if it is twisted and\na strong electric current is induced on the closed field lines. We examine two\nmechanisms of gamma-ray emission associated with the gradual dissipation of\nthis current. (1) A thin surface layer of the star is heated by the downward\nbeam of current-carrying charges, which excite Langmuir turbulence in the\nlayer. As a result, it can reach a temperature kT ~ 100 keV and emit\nbremsstrahlung photons up to this characteristic energy. (2) The magnetosphere\nis also a source of soft gamma rays at a distance of ~100 km from the star,\nwhere the electron cyclotron energy is in the keV range.

The\ndistorted morphology of the two sub-clusters suggests that they are\ninteracting, while the velocity distribution of 104 confirmed cluster members\ndoes not reveal strong signatures of merging. By applying a two-body dynamical\nformalism to the two sub-clusters of A3921, and by comparing our optical\nresults to the X-ray analysis of A3921 based on XMM observations (Belsole et\nal. 2004), we conclude that A3921-B is probably tangentially traversing the\nmain cluster along a SW/NE direction.

We confirm that passive galaxies in the cluster increase in\nHdelta line strength as dHdelta / d r_p = 0.35 +/- 0.06. A variation of star\nformation rate, as measured by [OII], with increasing local density of the\nenvironment is discernible and is shown to be in broad agreement with previous\nstudies from 2dFGRS and SDSS. We find that clusters at z~0.1 are less active\nthan their higher redshift analogues. We also investigate unusual populations\nof blue and very red nonstarforming galaxies and we suggest that the former are\nlikely to be the progenitors of galaxies which will lie on the colour-magnitude\nrelation, while the colours of the latter possibly reflect dust reddening. The\ncluster galaxies at large radii consist of both backsplash ones and those that\nare infalling to the cluster for the first time. We make a comparison to the\nfield population at z~0.1 and examine broad differences between the two\npopulations.

III: SSC\n  emission in the TeV band from Mkn 501 Abstract: Curved broad-band spectral distributions of non-thermal sources like blazars\nare described well by a log-parabolic (LP) law where the second degree term\nmeasures the curvature. LP energy spectra can be obtained for relativistic\nelectrons by means of a statistical acceleration mechanism whose probability of\nacceleration depends on energy. In this paper we compute the spectra radiated\nby an electron population via synchrotron (S) and Synchro-Self Compton(SSC)\nprocesses to derive the relations between the LP parameters. These spectra were\nobtained by means of an accurate numerical code. We found that the ratio\nbetween the curvature parameters of the S spectrum to that of the electrons is\nequal to about 0.2 instead of 0.25, the value foreseen in the delta\napproximation. Inverse Compton spectra are also intrinsically curved and can be\napproximated by a log-parabola only in limited ranges. The curvature parameter,\nestimated around the SED peak, may vary from a lower value than that of the S\nspectrum up to that of emitting electrons depending on whether the scattering\nis in the Thomson or in the Klein-Nishina regime. We applied this analysis to\ncomputing the SSC emission from the BL Lac object Mkn 501 during the large\nflare of April 1997. We fit simultaneous BeppoSAX and CAT data and reproduced\nintensities and spectral curvatures of both components with good accuracy. The\nlarge curvature observed in the TeV range was found to be mainly intrinsic, and\ntherefore did not require a large pair production absorption against the\nextragalactic background. We regard this finding as an indication that the\nUniverse is more transparent at these energies than previously assumed by\nseveral models found in the literature. This conclusion is supported by recent\ndetection of two relatively high redshift blazars with H.E.S.S. \n\n"}

Are quasars located in environments similar to those\nof typical L* galaxies, and, if not, how do they differ? An answer to this\nquestion will help shed light on the triggering process of quasar activity. We\nuse the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the environment of quasars and\ncompare it directly with the environment of galaxies. We find that quasars (M_i\n< -22, z < 0.4) are located in higher local overdensity regions than are\ntypical L* galaxies. The enhanced environment around quasars is a local\nphenomenon; the overdensity relative to that around L* galaxies is strongest\nwithin 100 kpc of the quasars. In this region, the overdensity is a factor of\n1.4 larger than around L* galaxies. The overdensity declines monotonically with\nscale to nearly unity at ~1 Mpc, where quasars inhabit environments comparable\nto those of L* galaxies. The small-scale density enhancement depends on quasar\nluminosity, but only at the brightest end: the most luminous quasars reside in\nhigher local overdensity regions than do fainter quasars. The mean overdensity\naround the brightest quasars (M_i < -23.3) is nearly three times larger than\naround L* galaxies while the density around dimmer quasars (M_i = -22.0 to\n-23.3) is ~1.4 times that of L* galaxies.

The noncommutative scaling limit is explored to\ninvestigate a possible tunneling of an AdS vacuum in string theory to dS vacuum\nin its low energy gravity theory. The Hagedorn transition is invoked into its\nself-dual gauge theory to decouple the gauge nonlinearity from the dS geometry,\nwhich in turn is shown to describe a pure dS vacuum. \n\n"}

When the networks/webs of these walls contain loops, their size moduli\ngive localized massless modes. We construct Kahler potential of their effective\naction. In the large size limit Kahler metric is well approximated by kinetic\nenergy of walls and junctions, which is understood in terms of tropical\ngeometry. Kahler potential can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric\nfunctions which are useful to understand small size behavior. Even when the\nloop shrinks, the metric is regular with positive curvature.

En plus a l'aide d'une linearisation du\nflot on deduit que le mecanisme physique de la pulsation consiste en\nl'interaction entre deux modes vibratoires (vraisemblablement radiaux), l'un\nlineairement instable, de frequence f_0, et l'autre stable, mais de frequence\n\\~2f_0 (soit un scenario a la Shilnikoff generalise). \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0309095", "contents": "Title: Quantum force due to distinct boundary conditions Abstract: We calculate the quantum statistical force acting on a partition wall that\ndivides a one dimensional box into two halves. The two half boxes contain the\nsame (fixed) number of noninteracting bosons, are kept at the same temperature,\nand admit the same boundary conditions at the outer walls; the only difference\nis the distinct boundary conditions imposed at the two sides of the partition\nwall. The net force acting on the partition wall is nonzero at zero temperature\nand remains almost constant for low temperatures. As the temperature increases,\nthe force starts to decrease considerably, but after reaching a minimum it\nstarts to increase, and tends to infinity with a square-root-of-temperature\nasympotics. This example demonstrates clearly that distinct boundary conditions\ncause remarkable physical effects for quantum systems. \n\n"}

Since quantum superpositions are\nfragile, the major hurdle in building such a computer is overcoming noise.\n  Developed over the last couple of years, new schemes for achieving fault\ntolerance based on error detection, rather than error correction, appear to\ntolerate as much as 3-6% noise per gate -- an order of magnitude better than\nprevious procedures. But proof techniques could not show that these promising\nfault-tolerance schemes tolerated any noise at all.\n  With an analysis based on decomposing complicated probability distributions\ninto mixtures of simpler ones, we rigorously prove the existence of constant\ntolerable noise rates (\"noise thresholds\") for error-detection-based schemes.\nNumerical calculations indicate that the actual noise threshold this method\nyields is lower-bounded by 0.1% noise per gate. \n\n"}
