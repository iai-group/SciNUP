Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory.

In the model, two distinct accretion\nmodes depending on gravitational stability of the CND play a key role on\naccreting gas to a SMBH. (i) If the CMD is gravitationally unstable, energy\nfeedback from supernovae (SNe) supports a geometrically thick, turbulent gas\ndisk. The accretion in this mode is dominated by turbulent viscosity, and it is\nsignificantly larger than that in the mode (ii), i.e., the CMD is supported by\ngas pressure. Once the gas supply from the host is stopped, the high accretion\nphase ($\\sim 0.01- 0.1 M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$) changes to the low one (mode\n(ii), $\\sim 10^{-4} M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$), but there is a delay with $\\sim\n10^{8}$ yr.

The location of WOH G64 on the H-R diagram\nbased on the previously estimated luminosities is in serious disagreement with\nthe current stellar evolution theory. The dust envelope around WOH G64 has been\nspatially resolved with a baseline of ~60 m--the first MIDI observations to\nresolve an individual stellar source in an extragalactic system. The observed\nN-band visibilities show a slight decrease from 8 to 10 micron and a gradual\nincrease longward of 10 micron, reflecting the 10 micron silicate feature in\nself-absorption. The visibilities measured at four position angles differing by\n~60 degrees but at approximately the same baseline length (~60 m) do not show a\nnoticeable difference, suggesting that the object appears nearly\ncentrosymmetric. The observed N-band visibilities and spectral energy\ndistribution can be reproduced by an optically and geometrically thick silicate\ntorus model viewed close to pole-on. The luminosity of the central star is\nderived to be 2.8 x 10^5 Lsun, which is by a factor of 2 lower than the\nprevious estimates based on spherical models. The lower luminosity newly\nderived from our MIDI observations and two-dimensional modeling brings the\nlocation of WOH G64 on the H-R diagram in much better agreement with\ntheoretical evolutionary tracks for a 25 Msun star.

Its collision with the\npreviously formed spherical red supergiant wind shell forms a short-lived\nluminous nebula consisting of two polar caps and a central inner ring. With\ntime, the polar caps evolve into mid-latitude rings which gradually move toward\nthe equatorial plane while the central ring is fading. These structures are\nreminiscent to the observed nebulae around the blue supergiant Sher 25 and the\nprogenitor of SN 1987A. The simple model of an hour glass colliding with a\nspherical shell retrieves most of the intriguing nebula geometries discovered\naround blue supergiants, and suggests them to form an evolutionary sequence.\nOur results indicate that binarity is not required to obtain them. \n\n"}

X-ray AGN have a similar clustering amplitude\nas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantly\nmore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. The X-ray AGN clustering\nstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; AGN in red host\ngalaxies are significantly more clustered than AGN in blue host galaxies, with\na relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue DEEP2 galaxies. We\ndetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, X-ray luminosity, or\nhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. We find evidence for galaxies\nhosting X-ray AGN to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matching\njoint optical color and magnitude distributions. This implies that galaxies\nhosting X-ray AGN are more likely to reside in groups and more massive dark\nmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an X-ray\nAGN.

If\nincorporated again with some empirical density profile from simulations, our\ntheoretical predictions of the anisotropy parameter, and the radial\npseudo-phase-space density in the outer non-gravitationally degenerate region\nof the dark matter halo, agree rather well with the simulation data, and the\npredictions are also acceptable in the middle weak-degenerate region of the\ndark halo.

Each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a mass\nresolution ~ 10^3-4 M_sun/h) within its virial radius. Subhaloes with masses\nlarger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two\norders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. We incorporate a baryonic\ncomponent modelled as a Hernquist profile and account for the response of the\ndark matter via adiabatic contraction. We focus on the \"anomalous\" flux ratio\nproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to\nsubstructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux\nratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same\nhalo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is\ncomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is\nnot. The probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violations\nof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. We therefore conclude that the amount of\nsubstructure in the central regions of the Aquarius haloes is insufficient to\nexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.\nThese conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignore\nthe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability. \n\n"}

The NICMOS measurements reduce differential extinction in the host\ngalaxies by a factor of 5 over past optical data. Combined with an expanded of\n240 SNe Ia at z<0.1 which define their magnitude-redshift relation, we find\nH_0=74.2 +/-3.6, a 4.8% uncertainty including both statistical and systematic\nerrors.

The\ntime-dependent, \"plus\" and \"cross\" polarizations are expanded in Bessel\nfunctions, which are then self-consistently re-expanded in a power series about\nzero initial eccentricity to eighth order. The stationary phase approximation\nis then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the Fourier\ntransform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. We exemplify this\nframework by considering Newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in the\npost-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase and\namplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the Fourier domain\nwaveform. Such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiral\nmass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at the\ntime when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band.

The\nfractional expansion of the knots is constant, and this implies no significant\ndeceleration. Hence, the knots were ejected by an eruption close to the year\n1866. Knots have turned on after 1995, and this demonstrates that the knots are\npowered by shocks from the collision of the 1866 ejecta with fast ejecta from\nlater RN eruptions. The 1866 ejecta has a total mass of 10^-4.5 Msun, which\nwith the low ejection velocity shows that the 1866 event was an ordinary nova\neruption, not a RN eruption. The accretion rate before the ordinary nova event\nmust have been low (around the 4x10^-11 Msun/yr expected for gravitational\nradiation alone) and the matter accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf\nfor ~750,000 years. The current accretion rate (>10^-8 Msun/yr) is 1000X higher\nthan expected for a system below the period gap, with the plausible reason\nbeing that the 1866 event started a continuing supersoft source that drives the\naccretion. A key fact about T Pyx is that its accretion rate has been secularly\ndeclining since before the 1890 eruption, with the current rate being only 3%\nof its earlier rate. The decline in the observed accretion rate shows that the\nsupersoft source is not self-sustaining, and we calculate that the accretion in\nT Pyx will effectively stop in upcoming decades. With this, T Pyx will enter a\nstate of hibernation, lasting for an estimated 2,600,000 years, before\ngravitational radiation brings the system into contact again.

We estimate the unevolved sub-halo mass functions\n(USMFs), for which sub-halo masses are measured at the times of their\naccretion. For sub-halos that merge into the main branch of a present-day dark\nhalo, their USMF can be well described by a universal functional form, in\nexcellent agreement with previous results. The same conclusion can also be\nreached for the USMF of all progenitors that have merged to become sub-halos\nduring the entire halo merging history. In both cases, the USMFs are also\nindependent of the redshift of host halos. Due to tidal disruption, only a\nsmall fraction of the accreted halos survive as sub-halos identifiable in the\npresent-day dark halos. In cluster-sized halos, about 30% of the survived\nsub-halos are sub-subhalos, and this fraction decreases with decreasing halo\nmass.

A core of initial radius 1-1.5 pc\nevolves to a size of approximately 0.5 pc after 10 Gyr, roughly the size of the\nobserved core. The absence of a Bahcall-Wolf cusp is naturally explained in\nthese models, without the need for fine-tuning or implausible initial\nconditions. In the absence of a cusp, the time for a 10-solar-mass black hole\nto spiral in to the Galactic center from an initial distance of 5 pc can be\nmuch greater than 10 Gyr. Assuming that the stellar black holes had the same\nphase-space distribution initially as the stars, their density after 5-10 Gyr\nis predicted to rise very steeply going into the stellar core, but could remain\nsubstantially below the densities inferred from steady-state models that\ninclude a steep density cusp in the stars. Possible mechanisms for the creation\nof the parsec-scale initial core include destruction of stars on centrophilic\norbits in a pre-existing triaxial nucleus, inhibited star formation near the\nsupermassive black hole, or ejection of stars by a massive binary.

The internal extinction, derived from the TIR-to-FUV luminosity\nratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in Sb-Sbc galaxies. The TIR-to-FUV\nratio correlates with the UV spectral slope beta, following a sequence shifted\nto redder UV colors with respect to that of starbursts.

If the core of the cluster\nis resolved, the direct determination of the lensing curve and lensing system\nparameters are possible; if unresolved, the differential imaging technique can\nbe applied. We calculate the optical depth to central BH microlensing for a\nselected list of Galactic GCs and estimate the average time duration of the\nevents. We present the observational strategy and discuss the detectability of\nmicrolensing events using a 2-m class telescope. \n\n"}

Recent Spitzer\nobservations revealed an infrared (IR) shell containing a dozen point sources\narranged in a ring-like structure, previously proposed to be young stellar\nobjects. An extended knot of emission located in the NW part of the shell\nappears to be aligned with the pulsar's X-ray jet, suggesting a possible\ninteraction with the shell material. Surprisingly, the IRS spectrum of the knot\nresembles the spectrum of freshly formed dust in Cas A, and is dominated by an\nunidentified dust emission feature at 21 microns. The spectra of the shell also\ncontain various emission lines and show that some are significantly broadened,\nsuggesting that they originate in rapidly expanding supernova (SN) ejecta. We\npresent the first evidence that the PWN is driving shocks into expanding SN\nejecta and we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of the IR\nemission in which the shell is composed entirely of SN ejecta.

However, with\nthe addition of spectroscopic information it is possible to distinguish between\nblends and areas where the light is dominated by a single star using the widths\nof absorption features. We describe a procedure for identifying locations in\nkinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,\nand apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution covering\nthe 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of M32. Targets for\ndetailed investigation are selected as areas of localized brightness\nenhancement. Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from\na single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars\nwith very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving\nnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral\ntype. The lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper AGB\nwithin the central arcsec of M32 has a dispersion in J-K of only a few\nhundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii. One\nstar has weaker atomic absorption lines than the others, such that [M/H] is 0.2\ndex lower. Such a difference in metallicity is consistent with the metallicity\ndispersion inferred from the width of the AGB in M32. The use of line width to\ndistinguish between blends involving many relatively faint stars, none of which\ndominate the light output, and areas that are dominated by a single\nintrinsically bright star could be extended to crowded environments in other\nnearby galaxies. \n\n"}

Seemingly\nunrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk of\nunknown origin orbiting the BH in M31, and possibly many other systems. We show\nthat these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.\nMulti-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to BH scales show that when\nsufficient gas is driven towards a BH, gravitational instabilities form a\nlopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background. The stellar relic of this disk is long\nlived and retains the eccentric pattern. Simulations that yield quasar-level\naccretion rates produce relic stellar disks with kinematics, eccentric\npatterns, precession rates, and surface density profiles in reasonable\nagreement with observations of M31. The observed properties of nuclear stellar\ndisks can thus be used to constrain the formation history of super-massive BHs. \n\n"}

We discuss\nseveral aspects of the extended emission, including dust pillars that result\nwhen a clumpy molecular cloud is shredded by massive star feedback. There are\nfew \"extended green objects\" (EGOs) normally taken as signposts of outflow\nactivity, and none of the HH jets detected optically are seen as EGOs. A\npopulation of \"extended red objects\" tends to be found around OB stars, some\nwith clear bow-shocks. These are dusty shocks where stellar winds collide with\nflows off nearby clouds. Finally, the relative distributions of O stars and\nsubclusters of YSOs as compared to dust pillars shows that while some YSOs are\nlocated within pillars, many more stars and YSOs reside just outside pillar\nheads. We suggest that pillars are transient phenomena, part of a continuous\noutwardly propagating wave of star formation driven by massive star feedback.\nAs pillars are destroyed, they leave newly formed stars in their wake, which\nare then subsumed into the young OB association. Altogether, the current\ngeneration of YSOs shows no strong deviation from a normal IMF. The number of\nYSOs suggests a roughly constant star-formation rate over the past 3Myr,\nimplying that star formation in pillars constitutes an important mechanism to\nconstruct unbound OB associations.

Using the Submillimeter Array and the Spitzer Space\nTelescope, we present high angular resolution observations towards the embedded\ndense core IRS2E in L1448.

Consequently, this source\nhas an extremely low bolometric luminosity (< 0.1 L_sun).

Abstract: The decay of non-topological electroweak strings formed during the\nelectroweak phase transition in the early universe may leave an observable\nimprint in the universe today. Such strings can naturally seed primordial\nmagnetic fields. Protogalaxies then tend to form with their axis of rotation\nparallel to the external magnetic field, and moreover, the external magnetic\nfield produces torque which forces the galaxy axis to align with the magnetic\nfield, even if the two axis were not aligned initially. This can explain an\n(observed, but as of yet unexplained) alignment of the quasars' polarization\nvectors. We demonstrate that the shape of a magnetic field left over from two\nlooped electroweak strings can explain the non-trivial alignment of quasar\npolarization vectors and make predictions for future observations. \n\n"}

Previous work in the\nliterature on models with density void profiles and/or allowing for density\nprofile inversions is given full generalization, with some erroneous results\ncorrected. We prove rigorously that if an evolution without shell crossings is\nassumed, then only the 'clump to void' inversion can occur in density profiles,\nand only in hyperbolic models or regions with negative spatial curvature. The\nprofiles of spatial curvature follow similar patterns as those of the density,\nwith 'clump to void' inversions only possible for hyperbolic models or regions.\nHowever, profiles of the expansion scalar are less restrictive, with profile\ninversions necessarily taking place in elliptic models. We also examine radial\nprofiles in special LTB configurations: closed elliptic models, models with a\nsimultaneous big bang singularity, as well as a locally collapsing elliptic\nregion surrounded by an expanding hyperbolic background.

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc. At larger radii there is no statistically significant\nseparation between populations; the upper limit to the cumulative scoured mass\nat ~kpc is ~2-4 M_BH. This does not depend strongly on stellar mass. The\ndispersion in M(<R) appears larger in the core population, possibly reflecting\nthe fact that scouring increases the scatter in profile shapes.

We expect to be able to detect and analyze\nmany cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very\nprecise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required. To\nbuild them we need to have a deep understanding of the gravitational\nbackreaction mechanism responsible for the inspiral.

In this paper we extend a new time-domain\ntechnique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the\ncase of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole. The main idea behind\nour scheme is to use a multidomain framework in which the small compact object,\ndescribed as a particle, is located at the interface between two subdomains.\nThen, the equations at each subdomain are homogeneous wave-type equations,\nwithout distributional sources.

We explore three disk models around non-rotating black\nholes with disk-to-black hole mass ratios of 0.24, 0.17 and 0.11.

Instead, all of the models develop unstable\nnon-axisymmetric modes on a dynamical timescale. We observe two distinct types\nof instabilities: the Papaloizou-Pringle and the so-called intermediate type\ninstabilities.

For this purpose, we\nhave developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study\nthe formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and\nsedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K,\nFreytag et al. 2010). We discovered the formation of gravity waves as a driving\nmechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and derived a rule\nfor the velocity field versus atmospheric depth and Teff , which is relatively\ninsensitive to gravity. This rule has been used in the construction of the new\nmodel atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, the\ndiffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of\ndepth. This new model grid of atmospheres and synthetic spectra has\nbeencomputedfor100,000K>Teff >400K,5.5>logg>-0.5,and[M/H]=+0.5to -1.5, and the\nreference solar abundances of Asplund et al. (2009).

We show that\nin order to generate observably large non-Gaussianity during inflation, the\nsourcing of curvature modes by isocurvature modes must be extremely sensitive\nto the initial conditions, and that the amount of sourcing must be moderate in\norder to avoid excessive fine-tuning. Under some minimal assumptions, we argue\nthat the first condition is satisfied only when neighboring trajectories\nthrough the two-dimensional field space diverge during inflation.\nGeometrically, this means that the inflaton must roll along a ridge in the\npotential V for some time during inflation and that its trajectory must turn\nslightly (but not too sharply) in field space. Therefore, it follows that\ntwo-field scenarios with attractor solutions necessarily produce small\nnon-Gaussianity. This explains why it has been so difficult to achieve large\nnon-Gaussianity in two-field inflation, and why it has only been achieved in a\nnarrow class of models like hybrid inflation and certain product potentials\nwhere the potential and/or the initial conditions are fine-tuned.

The big\nadvantage of the SZ effect is its redshift independence, which is not the case\nfor visible and X-ray observations. It allows us to directly estimate the\ncluster's total mass from the integrated comptonization parameter Y, even for\ndistant clusters. However, not having a full knowing intra-cluster medium (ICM)\nphysics can affect the results. By taking self-similar temperature and density\nprofiles of the ICM into account, we studied how different ICM morphologies can\naffect the cluster total mass estimation. With the help of the high percentage\nof cool core (CC) clusters, as observed so far, the present analysis focuses on\nstudying this class of objects. A sample of eight nearby (0.1 < z < 0.5) and\nhigh-mass (M > 10^(14) M_sun) clusters observed by Chandra was considered.

We use the semiclassical theory of gravity with the\nexpectation value of the conformal field stress tensor as a source.

We next examine the modification of linearized\nplane gravity waves by the effects of the quantum stress tensor. We find a\ncorrection term which is of the same form as the original wave, but displaced\nin phase by -\\pi/2, and with an amplitude which depends upon the duration of\ninflation. The magnitude of this effect is proportional to the change in scale\nfactor during inflation.

The method needs a geometric model of the binary,\naccepts the light curve and the detected pulsation frequencies on input, and on\noutput yields estimates of the pulsation patterns, in form of images -- thus\nallowing a direct identification of the surface mode numbers$(\\ell,m)$.\n  Since it has minimal modelling requirements and can operate on photometric\nobservations in arbitrary wavelength bands, DEM is well suited to analyze the\nwide-band time series collected by space observatories.\n  The method was extensively tested on simulated data, in which almost all\nphotometrically detectable modes with a latitudinal complexity $\\ell-|m|\\le 4$\nwere properly restored. Multimode pulsations can be also reconstructed in a\nnatural manner, as well as pulsations on components with tilted rotation axis\nof known direction. It can also be used in principle to isolate the\ncontribution of hidden modes from the light curve.\n  Sensitivity tests show that moderate errors in the geometric parameters and\nthe assumed limb darkening can be partially tolerated by the inversion, in the\nsense that the lower degree modes are still recoverable. Tidally induced or\nmutually resonant pulsations, however, are an obstacle that neither the eclipse\nmapping, nor any other inversion technique can ever surpass.\n  We conclude that, with reasonable assumptions, Dynamic Eclipse Mapping could\nbe a powerful tool for mode identification, especially in moderately close\neclipsing binary systems, where the pulsating component is not seriously\naffected by tidal interactions so that the pulsations are intrinsic to them,\nand not a consequence of the binarity. \n\n"}

These three different populations correspond to evolved\nphases of Main Sequence (MS) OB stars. Axial rotation and mass loss have a\ngreat influence on massive star evolution in general and more specifically on\nthe durations of these different phases. Moderate rotation and mass loss,\nduring the MS phase, favor the evolution towards the RSG stage. Fast rotation\nand strong mass loss during the MS phase, in contrast, prevent the star from\nbecoming a RSG and allow the star to pass directly from the OB star phase into\nthe WR phase. Mass loss during the RSG stage may make the star evolve back in\nthe blue part of the HR diagram. We argue that such an evolution may be more\ncommon than presently accounted for in stellar models. This might be the reason\nfor the lack of type IIP SNe with RSG progenitors having initial masses between\n18 and 30 M$_\\odot$.

The\ndifferential rotation and meridional circulation are intimately linked, with a\ncommon origin in the turbulent stresses of the upper solar convection zone. The\nexistence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of\nangular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed. Rather, the\nturbulent angular momentum transport accounts for the poleward meridional flow\nwhile the often overlooked meridional force balance maintains the mid-latitude\nrotational shear. We suggest that the base of the NSSL is marked by a\ntransition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses in the meridional plane which\nsuppress Coriolis-induced circulations that would otherwise establish a\ncylindrical rotation profile. The turbulent angular momentum transport must be\nnon-diffusive and directed radially inward.

For the first time, we have discovered that during the 2008 outburst\nof SAX J1808.4-3658 a major pulse profile change was accompanied by a dramatic\nvariation of the disc luminosity at almost constant total luminosity.

Interpreting Li Abundances in RGB and\n  AGB Stars Abstract: We reanalyze the problem of Li abundances in red giants of nearly solar\nmetallicity. After an outline of the problems affecting our knowledge of the Li\ncontent in low-mass stars (M<3Mo), we discuss deep-mixing models for the RGB\nstages suitable to account for the observed trends and for the correlated\nvariations of the carbon isotope ratio; we find that Li destruction in these\nphases is limited to masses below about 2.3 Mo. Subsequently, we concentrate on\nthe final stages of evolution for both O-rich and C-rich AGB stars. Here, the\nconstraints on extra-mixing phenomena previously derived from heavier nuclei\n(from C to Al), coupled to recent updates in stellar structure models\n(including both the input physics and the set of reaction rates used), are\nsuitable to account for the observations of Li abundances below A(Li)= log\ne(Li) = 1.5 (and sometimes more). Also their relations with other\nnucleosynthesis signatures of AGB phases (like the abundance of F, the C/O and\n12C/13C ratios) can be explained. This requires generally moderate efficiencies\n(\\dot M <= 0.3 - 0.5 x 10^-6 Mo/yr) for non-convective mass transport. At such\nrates, slow extra-mixing does not modify remarkably Li abundances in early-AGB\nphases; on the other hand, faster mixing encounters a physical limit in\ndestroying Li, set by the mixing velocity. Beyond this limit, Li starts to be\nproduced; therefore its destruction on the AGB is modest. Li is then\nsignificantly produced by the third dredge up. We also show that effective\ncirculation episodes, while not destroying Li, would easily bring the 12C/13C\nratios to equilibrium, contrary to the evidence in most AGB stars, and would\nburn F beyond the limits shown by C(N) giants. Hence, we do not confirm the\ncommon idea that efficient extra-mixing drastically reduces the Li content of\nC-stars with respect to K-M giants. \n\n"}

The average RM and the RM\nstandard deviation are increased by the action of the jets. Energetics, RM\nstatistics and magnetic power spectral analysis consistently show that the\neffects also correlate with the jets' power, and that the lightest, fastest\njets produce the strongest changes in their environment.

We calculate the amplitude of the\ntidally excited gravity waves as a function of the tidal forcing frequency\n\\omega=2(\\Omega-\\Omega_s) (where \\Omega is the orbital frequency and \\Omega_s\nis the spin frequency) for several realistic carbon-oxygen WD models, assuming\nthat the waves are efficiently dissipated in the outer layer of the star by\nnonlinear effects or radiative damping. The mechanism of wave excitation in WDs\nis complex due to the sharp features associated with composition changes inside\nthe WD, and in our WD models gravity waves are launched just below the\nhelium-carbon boundary.

Abstract: It is well-established observationally that the characteristic angular\nmomentum axis on small scales around AGN, traced by radio jets and the putative\ntorus, is not well-correlated with the large-scale angular momentum axis of the\nhost galaxy. In this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally in\nhigh-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and\ninflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy\nmergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can\nsometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly\noff-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth\nand trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested,\nself-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in\nthe potential of the outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip\nor re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the\npresence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host\ngalaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment be\nan indicator of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this\nconclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments may mean\nthat even BHs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up to\nmaximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies and\ninefficient jet formation.

The 12.6-min\nperiodicity first appeared 7 months after the 2006 outburst and was the most\nprominent one during the following \\sim 900 days. It was identified as\nnon-radial pulsations of the white dwarf. The period of this pulsations varied\nwithin a range of 36 s, and amplitude changed from 0.013m to 0.03m.\nSimultaneously one could observe the 21.7-min and 14.3-min periodicities with a\nmuch lower significance level. During the minioutbursts the 21.7-min\nperiodicity became the most powerful, the 12.6-min periodicity was less\npowerful, and the 12.6-min periodicity had the lowest significance. After the\n2011 outburst the most prominent short-term periodicity appeared \\sim 7 months\nafter the outburst, but at 4.28 min. We identified that variability with\nperiods P2, P3 and P4 could be additional pulsation modes, however the relation\nof P4 to white dwarf pulsation also can't be excluded. \n\n"}

While a\nconstant interaction strength leads to less concentrated density profiles, a\nsteep growth in time of the coupling function has been shown to determine a\nlarge increase of halo concentrations over a wide range of masses, including\nthe typical halos hosting luminous spiral galaxies. This determines a\nsubstantial worsening of the \"cusp-core\" tension arising in the standard\n$\\Lambda $CDM model and provides a direct way to constrain the form of the Dark\nEnergy interaction. In the present paper we make use of the outcomes of some\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations of a specific class of interacting Dark\nEnergy models to compare the predicted rotation curves of luminous spiral\ngalaxies forming in these cosmologies against real observational data. Our\nresults show how some specific interacting Dark Energy scenarios featuring a\nsteep growth in time of the coupling function -- which are virtually\nindistinguishable from LCDM in the background -- cannot fit the observed\nrotation curves of luminous spiral galaxies and can therefore be ruled out only\non the basis of dynamical properties of small-scale structures.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a\nconstant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account\nfor the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,\nas they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma. Comparing our model to\nthe observed luminosity-temperature relation, we discriminate between different\nM-c_vir relations: a weak dependence of c_vir on M is currently preferred by\ndata. This simple theoretical model accounts for much of the complexity of\nrecent, improved X-ray scaling relations, provided that we allow for a mild\ndependence of Gamma on M or for T_xi consistent with intercluster values.\n[abridged] \n\n"}

Taking advantage of the fact\nthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce\ndiscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the\nFourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of\nsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark\nmatter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. In addition to strong mass loss and\nrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation\nthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first\npericenter passage.

The disk is proposed to\nhave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its\nenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal\ndebris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed\ncloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the\nexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters\nmay be as high as $\\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by\nthe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular\nmomentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation\nradius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may\nplace gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporation\nwind that forms the cloud at every orbit.

In this paper, we analytically\nstudy the effect of high magnetic field on relativistic cold electron, and\nhence its effect on the stability and the mass-radius relation of a magnetic\nwhite dwarf. In strong magnetic fields, the equation of state of the Fermi gas\nis modified and Landau quantization comes into play. For relatively very high\nmagnetic fields (with respect to the energy density of matter) the number of\nLandau levels is restricted to one or two. We analyse the equation of states\nfor magnetized electron degenerate gas analytically and attempt to understand\nthe conditions in which transitions from the zero-th Landau level to first\nLandau level occur. We also find the effect of the strong magnetic field on the\nstar collapsing to a white dwarf, and the mass-radius relation of the resulting\nstar.

The reason is that stellar winds have\nbeen found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical\nmass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss\nrates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to\nnon-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates\nare of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even\nfurther, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes\nnecessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans\nbetween O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model\nindependent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition\npoint in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far\nless model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is\nsubsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the\nOf/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two\nalternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided\nby current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the\n~50Msun mass range. Our results do not confirm the specific need for eruptive\nmass loss as Luminous Blue Variables, and current stellar evolution modelling\nfor Galactic massive stars seems sound. Mass loss through alternative\nmechanisms might still become necessary at lower masses, and/or metallicities,\nand the quantification of alternative mass loss is desirable. \n\n"}

If all of the magnetic flux of a typical core were to be dragged into\nthe central star, the stellar field strength would be orders of magnitude\nhigher than the observed values. This well-known \"magnetic flux problem\" can in\nprinciple be resolved through non-ideal MHD effects. Two dimensional\n(axisymmetric) calculations have shown that ambipolar diffusion, in particular,\ncan transport magnetic flux outward relative to matter, allowing material to\nenter the central object without dragging the field lines along. We show\nthrough simulations that such axisymmetric protostellar accretion flows are\nunstable in three dimensions to magnetic interchange instability in the\nazimuthal direction. The instability is driven by the magnetic flux\nredistributed from the matter that enters the central object. It typically\nstarts to develop during the transition from the prestellar phase of star\nformation to the protostellar mass accretion phase. In the latter phase, the\nmagnetic flux is transported outward mainly through advection, by strongly\nmagnetized low-density regions that expand against the collapsing inflow. The\ntussle between the gravity-driven infall and magnetically driven expansion\nleads to a filamentary inner accretion flow, more disordered than previously\npictured. The efficient outward transport of magnetic flux by advection lowers\nthe field strength at small radii, making the magnetic braking less efficient\nand the formation of rotationally supported disks easier in principle. However,\nwe find no evidence for such disks in any of our rotating collapse simulations.\nWe conclude that the inner protostellar accretion flow is shaped to a large\nextent by this magnetic interchange instability.

The compactness of AM CVn\norbits and their unusual chemical composition make these systems valuable\ntestbeds for outburst models. We aim for a better understanding of the role of\nhelium in the accretion disc instability mechanism, testing the model for dwarf\nnovae outbursts in the case of AM CVn stars, and aim to explain the outburst\nlight-curves of these ultra-compact binaries. We calculated the properties of\nthe hydrogen-free AM CVn stars using our previously developed numerical code\nadapted to the different chemical composition of these systems and supplemented\nwith formulae accounting for mass transfer rate variations, additional sources\nof the disc heating, and the primary's magnetic field.

In order to shed\nsome light on this problem, here we discuss a new determination of H_0 at\nintermediate redshifts (z ~ 1), using the following four cosmic probes: (i)\nmeasurements of the angular diameter distances (ADD) for galaxy clusters based\non the combination of Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray data (0.14 < z <\n0.89$), (ii) the inferred ages of old high redshift galaxies (OHRG) (0.62 < z <\n1.70), (iii) measurements of the Hubble parameter H(z) (0.1 < z < 1.8), and\n(iv) the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature (z=0.35).

Our previous observations using the VLTI and AMBER\nin the medium resolution K-band mode spatially resolved the environment of HD\n327083.

We have observed HD 327083 with high spectral\nresolution (25 & 6 km/s) using AMBER and CRIRES. The observations are compared\nto kinematical models to constrain the source of the emission. It is shown that\nthe CO bandhead emission can be reproduced using a model of a Keplerian disc\nwith an inclination and size consistent with our previous VLTI observations.\nThe model is compared to AMBER differential phase measurements, which have a\nprecision as high as 30-micro-arcseconds.

This method avoids known star formation and chemical enrichment\nproblems encountered in simulations. Here we focus on the Milky Way, by using a\ndetailed thin-disk chemical evolution model and a simulation in the\ncosmological context, with dynamical properties close to those of our Galaxy.\nWe show that, due to radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the\ncentral bar at later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor\nhigh-[alpha/Fe] stars reaches the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a\nnumber of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite\nthe fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant radial\nmixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is only weakly\naffected, with a scatter compatible with recent observational work. While we\nfind a smooth density distribution in the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, we can recover\nthe observed discontinuity by selecting particles according to kinematic\ncriteria used in high-resolution samples to define the thin and thick disks. We\noutline a new method for estimating the birth place of the Sun and predict that\nthe most likely radius lies in the range 4.4 < r < 7.7 kpc (for a location at r\n= 8 kpc). A new, unifying model for the Milky Way thick disk is offered, where\nboth mergers and radial migration play a role at different stages of the disk\nevolution. We show that in the absence of early-on massive mergers the vertical\nvelocity dispersion of the oldest stars is underestimated by a factor of ~2\ncompared with observations. We can, therefore, argue that the Milky Way thick\ndisk is unlikely to have been formed through a quiescent disk evolution. \n\n"}

This small-scale structure acted as an important sink during the\nepoch of reionization, impeding the progress of the ionization fronts that\nswept out from the first sources of ionizing radiation. Here we present results\nof high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations that resolve the\ncosmological Jeans mass of the neutral IGM in representative volumes several\nMpc across. The adiabatic hydrodynamics we follow are appropriate in an\nunheated IGM, before the gas has had a chance to respond to the photoionization\nheating. Our focus is determination of the resolution required in cosmological\nsimulations in order to sufficiently sample and resolve small-scale structure\nregulating the opacity of an unheated IGM.

Specifically, setting the column density\nthreshold near or above the peak of the column density probability distribution\nfunction Npdf ($N\\sim 10^{21}$ cm\\alamenos 2) produces the Larson scaling as\nlong as the Npdf decreases rapidly at higher column densities.

Abstract: Recent Herschel/SPIRE maps of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC,\nLMC) exhibit in each thousands of clouds. Observed at 250 microns, they must be\ncold, T ~ 15 K, hence the name \"Herschel cold clouds\" (HCCs). From the observed\nrotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nGalactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal\nsphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii. There are so many HCCs that they will make\nup all the missing Halo mass density if there is spherical symmetry and their\naverage mass is of order 15,000 Mo. This compares well with the Jeans mass of\ncirca 40,000 Mo and puts forward that the HCCs are in fact Jeans clusters,\nconstituting all the Galactic dark matter and much of its missing baryons, a\nconclusion deduced before from a different field of the sky (Nieuwenhuizen,\nSchild and Gibson 2011). A preliminary analysis of the intensities yields that\nthe Jeans clusters themselves may consist of some billion MACHOs of a few dozen\nEarth masses.

The difference in the half-light\nradius between metal-poor SCs and metal-rich SCs is (up to a factor of two)\nlarger than the difference in the half-mass radius. \n\n"}

We report on simultaneous observations and modeling of mid-infrared\n(MIR), near-infrared (NIR), and submillimeter (submm) emission of the source\nSgr A* associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy.\nOur goal was to monitor the activity of Sgr A* at different wavelengths in\norder to constrain the emitting processes and gain insight into the nature of\nthe close environment of Sgr A*. Methods. We used the MIR instrument VISIR in\nthe BURST imaging mode, the adaptive optics assisted NIR camera NACO, and the\nsub-mm antenna APEX to monitor Sgr A* over several nights in July 2007.\nResults. The observations reveal remarkable variability in the NIR and sub-mm\nduring the five nights of observation. No source was detected in the MIR, but\nwe derived the lowest upper limit for a flare at 8.59 microns (22.4 mJy with\nA_8.59mu = 1.6+/- 0.5).

The aim of this study is to provide observational constraints\non theoretical prediction that the winds of M-type AGB objects can be driven by\nphoton scattering on iron-free silicate grains located in the close environment\n(about 2 to 3 stellar radii) of the star. We interpreted\nspectro-interferometric data, first using wavelength-dependent geometric\nmodels. We then used a self-consistent dynamic model atmosphere containing a\ntime-dependent description of grain growth for pure forsterite dust particles\nto reproduce the photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurements\nof RT Vir. Since the hydrodynamic computation needs stellar parameters as\ninput, a considerable effort was first made to determine these parameters. MIDI\ndifferential phases reveal the presence of an asymmetry in the stellar\nvicinity. Results from the geometrical modeling give us clues to the presence\nof aluminum and silicate dust in the close circumstellar environment (< ~5\nstellar radii). Comparison between spectro-interferometric data and a\nself-consistent dust-driven wind model reveals that silicate dust has to be\npresent in the region between 2 to 3 stellar radii to reproduce the 59 and 63 m\nbaseline visibility measurements around 9.8 micron. This gives additional\nobservational evidence in favor of winds driven by photon scattering on\niron-free silicate grains located in the close vicinity of an M-type star.\nHowever, other sources of opacity are clearly missing to reproduce the 10-13\nmicron visibility measurements for all baselines. This study is a first attempt\nto understand the wind mechanism of M-type AGB stars by comparing photometric,\nspectrometric, and interferometric measurements with state-of-the-art,\nself-consistent dust-driven wind models. The agreement of the dynamic model\natmosphere with interferometric measurements in the 8-10 micron spectral region\ngives additional observational evidence that the winds of M-type stars can be\ndriven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains.

We propose that (1)\nthe nearly complete absence of unprocessed ices along the line-of-sight is due\nto the flattened envelope structure of HOPS-68, which lacks cold absorbing\nmaterial in its outer envelope, and possesses an extreme concentration of\nmaterial within its inner (10 AU) envelope region and (2) an energetic event\nled to the evaporation of inner envelope ices, followed by cooling and\nre-condensation, explaining the sequestration of spherical, CO2 ice mantles in\na hydrogen-poor mixture.

The present study aims at characterizing the\nvariation of the molecular outflow properties with time, and at studying the\nSiO excitation conditions in outflows associated with massive YSOs. We used the\nIRAM30m telescope to map 14 massive star-forming regions in the SiO(2-1),\nSiO(5-4) and HCO+(1-0) outflow lines, and in several dense gas and hot core\ntracers. Hi-GAL data was used to improve the spectral energy distributions and\nthe L/M ratio, which is believed to be a good indicator of the evolutionary\nstage of the YSO. We detect SiO and HCO+ outflow emission in all the sources,\nand bipolar structures in six of them. The outflow parameters are similar to\nthose found toward other massive YSOs. We find an increase of the HCO+ outflow\nenergetics as the object evolve, and a decrease of the SiO abundance with time,\nfrom 10^(-8) to 10^(-9). The SiO(5-4) to (2-1) line ratio is found to be low at\nthe ambient gas velocity, and increases as we move to high velocities,\nindicating that the excitation conditions of the SiO change with the velocity\nof the gas (with larger densities and/or temperatures for the high-velocity gas\ncomponent). The properties of the SiO and HCO+ outflow emission suggest a\nscenario in which SiO is largely enhanced in the first evolutionary stages,\nprobably due to strong shocks produced by the protostellar jet. As the object\nevolves, the power of the jet would decrease and so does the SiO abundance.\nDuring this process, however, the material surrounding the protostar would have\nbeen been swept up by the jet, and the outflow activity, traced by entrained\nmolecular material (HCO+), would increase with time. \n\n"}

However, we cannot exclude that\nlocal sources of CRs or X-ray photons nearby the cloud may provide much higher\nintensity of the line from there. Production of the line emission from\nmolecular clouds depends strongly on processes of CR penetration into them. We\nshow that turbulent motions of neutral gas may generate strong magnetic\nfluctuations in the clouds which prevent free penetration of CRs into the\nclouds from outside. We provide a special analysis of the line production by\nhigh energy electrons. We concluded that these electrons hardly provide the\ndiffuse 6.4 keV line emission from the GC because their density is depleted by\nionization losses.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate\nthe outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs\nusing two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an\ninstantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of\nthe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta\n\\propto \\dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd. We show that a population of black hole\nLMXBs at short orbital periods can only be hidden by a sharp drop in\nefficiency, either instantaneous or for n >= 3. This could be achieved by a\ngenuine drop in luminosity or through abrupt spectral changes that shift the\naccretion power out of a given X-ray band. \n\n"}

We use dynamical simulations to show how Vega's hot dust can be created by\nlong-range gravitational scattering of planetesimals from its cold outer\nregions. Planetesimals are scattered progressively inward by a system of 5-7\nplanets from 30-60 AU to very close-in. In successful simulations the outermost\nplanets are typically Neptune-mass.

Second, we used a Bayesian formalism (introduced by Treu et al.\n2012) that compares the z>7 galaxy spectra to models of the Lyman-alpha\nequivalent width (WLy{\\alpha}) distribution at z~6. We explored two simple\nevolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where Lyman-alpha is attenuated in all\ngalaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolution\nor a slowly increasing IGM opacity), and patchy evolution where Lyman-alpha is\nblocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the IGM being opaque along\nonly some fraction of sightlines).

The absolute proper motion of GRS 1915+105 is -3.19 +/- 0.03 mas/y and\n-6.24 +/- 0.05 mas/y toward the east and north, respectively, which corresponds\nto a modest peculiar speed of 22 +/-24 km/s at the parallax distance,\nsuggesting that the binary did not receive a large velocity kick when the black\nhole formed.

The rate at\nwhich MRI-driven turbulence transports angular momentum is related to both the\nstrength of the amplitudes of the fluctuations on various scales and the degree\nof anisotropy of the underlying turbulence. This has motivated several studies\nof the distribution of turbulent power in spectral space. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the anisotropic nature of MRI-driven turbulence using a\npseudo-spectral code and introduce novel ways to robustly characterize the\nunderlying turbulence. We show that the general flow properties vary in a\nquasi-periodic way on timescales comparable to 10 inverse angular frequencies\nmotivating the temporal analysis of its anisotropy. We introduce a 3D tensor\ninvariant analysis to quantify and classify the evolution of the anisotropic\nturbulent flow. This analysis shows a continuous high level of anisotropy, with\nbrief sporadic transitions towards two- and three-component isotropic turbulent\nflow. This temporal-dependent anisotropy renders standard shell-average,\nespecially when used simultaneously with long temporal averages, inadequate for\ncharacterizing MRI-driven turbulence.

It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates\nslower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores. We find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks\nbetween their gravitational-wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating\nindividual neutron stars, that exist for fixed total binary masses. These\nfindings are derived for equal-mass binaries without intrinsic neutron-star\nspin analyzing hydrodynamical simulations without magnetic field effects. Our\nclassification scheme may form the basis for the construction of detailed\ngravitational-wave templates of the post-merger phase.

We demonstrate here that for some\nrealistic progenitors enshrouded in optically thick winds, such as possibly SN\n2008D, a CS forms deep inside the wind, soon after the RDS leaves the core, and\ntherefore significantly before SB. The RDS does not survive the transition from\nthe core to the thick wind when the wind close to the core is not sufficiently\ndense to compensate for the $r^{-2}$ dilution of photons due to shock\ncurvature. This typically happens when the shock velocity is $\\lesssim 0.1 {\\rm\nc} \\, (\\frac{u_{\\rm w}}{10\\,{\\rm km/s}}) (\\frac{\\dot{M}}{5 \\cdot 10^{-4} \\,\n{\\rm M}_\\odot {\\rm /yr}})^{-1} (\\frac{r_\\ast}{10^{13}\\,{\\rm cm}})$, where\n$u_{\\rm w}$, $\\dot{M}$ and $r_\\ast$ are respectively the wind velocity,\nmass-loss rate and radius of the progenitor star.

Rapid radiative\ncooling reduces the effective buoyancy and allows the VSI to operate. We\nquantify the cooling timescale $t_c$ needed for efficient VSI growth, through a\nlinear analysis of the VSI with cooling in vertically global, radially local\ndisk models. We find the VSI is most vigorous for rapid cooling with\n$t_c<\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}^{-1}h|q|/(\\gamma -1)$ in terms of the Keplerian orbital\nfrequency, $\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}$; the disk's aspect-ratio, $h\\ll1$; the radial\npower-law temperature gradient, $q$; and the adiabatic index, $\\gamma$.

In this article, we construct quasi-equilibrium\nconfigurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,\nand equations of state.

After the failure of two reaction wheels, the Kepler satellite\nhas been repurposed as Kepler-2 (K2), observing fields close to the ecliptic\nplane. As these fields contain many more bright stars than the original Kepler\nfield, K2 provides an unprecedented opportunity to study nearby objects\namenable to detailed follow-up with ground-based instruments. Due to bandwidth\nconstraints, only a small fraction of pixels can be downloaded, with the result\nthat most bright stars which saturate the detector are not observed.

To study dust extinction curves intrinsic to the\nquasars, from the HAQ survey we selected 16 cases where the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC) law could not provide a good solution to the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs).

The derived\nextinction, $A_V$, ranges from 0.2-1.0 mag. All the individual extinction\ncurves of our quasars are steeper ($R_V=2.2$-2.7) than that of the SMC, with a\nweighted mean value of $R_V=2.4$. We derive an `average quasar extinction\ncurve' for our sample by fitting SEDs simultaneously by using the weighted mean\nvalues of the FM law parameters and a varying $R_V$. The entire sample is well\nfit with a single best-fit value of $R_V=2.2\\pm0.2$. The `average quasar\nextinction curve' deviates from the steepest Milky Way and SMC extinction\ncurves at a confidence level $\\gtrsim95\\%$.

These sources can provide definitive evidence for the existence of\nIMBHs, probe globular-cluster dynamics, and potentially serve as tests of\ngeneral relativity. We analyse the accuracy with which we can measure the\nmasses and spins of the IMBH and its companion in intermediate-mass ratio\ncoalescences. We find that we can identify an IMBH with a mass above $100 ~\nM_\\odot$ with $95\\%$ confidence provided the massive body exceeds $130 ~\nM_\\odot$. For source masses above $\\sim200 ~ M_\\odot$, the best measured\nparameter is the frequency of the quasi-normal ringdown.

Originally the luminosity was expected in high-energy X-rays\nor gamma-rays, however we conjecture that some of the battery power is emitted\nin the radio bandwidth. While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence\nrates are too low to make these a primary FRB source. Instead, we propose the\ntransients form a FRB sub-population, distinguishable by a double peak with a\nprecursor.

As a result the pressure not\nonly opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes\nmore pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the\nmass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is\ninevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually\ndifferent than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which\nis attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs\nthe general relativistic critical mass is very close to the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit.

The line lists contain transition frequencies with qualified\naccuracies, intensities, quantum numbers, as well as further auxilary\ninformation. They have been generated from critically evaluated experimental\nline lists, mostly from laboratory experiments, employing established\nHamiltonian models. Seperate entries exist for different isotopic species and\nusually also for different vibrational states. As of December 2015, the number\nof entries is 792. They are available online as ascii tables with additional\nfiles documenting information on the entries. The Virtual Atomic and Molecular\nData Centre was founded more than 5 years ago as a common platform for atomic\nand molecular data. This platform facilitates exchange not only between\nspectroscopic databases related to astrophysics or astrochemistry, but also\nwith collisional and kinetic databases. A dedicated infrastructure was\ndeveloped to provide a common data format in the various databases enabling\nqueries to a large variety of databases on atomic and molecular data at once.\nFor CDMS, the incorporation in VAMDC was combined with several modifications on\nthe generation of CDMS catalog entries. Here we introduce related changes to\nthe data structure and the data content in the CDMS. The new data scheme allows\nus to incorporate all previous data entries but in addition allows us also to\ninclude entries based on new theoretical descriptions. Moreover, the CDMS\nentries have been transferred into a mySQL database format. These developments\nwithin the VAMDC framework have been driven by the needs of the astronomical\ncommunity to be able to deal efficiently with large data sets obtained with the\nHerschel Space Telescope or, more recently, with the Atacama Large Millimeter\nArray. \n\n"}

While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated.

All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent\nobservational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely\nmeasured.

A third decoupled RH neutrino, $N_{\\rm DM}$ with mass\n$M_{\\rm DM}$, plays the role of cold dark matter (DM) and is produced by the\nmixing with a source RH neutrino, $N_{\\rm S}$ with mass $M_{\\rm S}$, induced by\nHiggs portal interactions. The same interactions are also responsible for\n$N_{\\rm DM}$ decays. We discuss in detail the constraints coming from DM\nabundance and stability conditions, showing that in the hierarchical case\n($M_{\\rm DM} \\gg M_{\\rm S}$) there is an allowed window on $M_{\\rm DM}$, which\nnecessarily implies a contribution from DM decays to the high-energy neutrino\nflux recently detected by IceCube.

Previous studies showed that only a certain\ncombination of the individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal\ndeformability) can be measured with second-generation gravitational wave\ninterferometers, such as Adv.

Nonetheless, some\nworks suggest that a parabolic geometry would be more appropriate to fit the\nhigh energy spectral energy distribution properties and it has been recently\nfound that, at least in some nearby radio-galaxies, the geometry of the\ninnermost regions of the jet is parabolic.

During its first science flight in 2009,\nthe balloon-borne observatory Sunrise captured images of the magnetic fields in\nthe quiet Sun at a high spatial resolution. Using these data we measure the\nrate at which the IN features bring magnetic flux to the solar surface. In a\nprevious paper it was found that the lowest magnetic flux in small-scale\nfeatures detected using the Sunrise observations is 9 x 10^14 Mx. This is\nnearly an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest fluxes of features\ndetected in observations from the Hinode satellite. In this paper, we compute\nthe flux emergence rate (FER) by accounting for such small fluxes, which was\nnot possible before Sunrise. By tracking the features with fluxes in the range\n10^15-10^18 Mx, we measure an FER of 1100 Mx cm^-2 day^-1. The smaller features\nwith fluxes less than or equal to 10^16 Mx are found to be the dominant\ncontributors to the solar magnetic flux. The FER found here is an order of\nmagnitude higher than the rate from Hinode, obtained with a similar feature\ntracking technique. A wider comparison with the literature shows, however, that\nthe exact technique of determining the rate of the appearance of new flux can\nlead to results that differ by up to two orders of magnitude, even when applied\nto similar data.

The\ncorrelation time of the random velocity is comparable to the eddy turnover\ntime, about $10^7 yr$, although it may be shorter in regions with higher star\nformation rate. The random magnetic field is anisotropic, with the standard\ndeviations of its components $b_x/b_y/b_z$ having approximate ratios\n$0.5/0.6/0.6$ in the midplane.

We find that frequent mergers in high-redshift\nproto-galaxies could provide a fertile environment to produce long-lasting\nbound star clusters.

Nine of these candidates lie nearby to near-infrared sources,\nboosting their reliability; in six cases the observed line frequency and\nstrength are consistent with expectations given the photometric redshift and\nproperties of the galaxy counterparts. We present redshift identifications,\nmagnifications and molecular gas estimates for the galaxies with identified\nlines. We show that two of these candidates likely originate from starburst\ngalaxies, one of which is a jellyfish galaxy, while another two are consistent\nwith being main sequence galaxies based in their depletion times.\n  This work highlights the degree to which serendipitous emission lines can be\ndiscovered in large mosaic continuum observations when deep ancillary data are\navailable. The low number of high-significance line detections, however,\nconfirms that such surveys are not as optimal as blind line scans. We stress\nthat Monte Carlo simulations should be used to assess the line detections\nsignificances, since using the negative noise suffers from stochasticity and\nincurs larger uncertainties. \n\n"}

We combine\nconstraints from X-ray and radio observations of M87 with a shock model to\nderive the properties of the outburst that created the 13 kpc shock. Principal\nconstraints for the model are 1) the measured Mach number ($M$$\\sim$1.2), 2)\nthe radius of the 13 kpc shock, and 3) the observed size of the central\ncavity/bubble (the radio-bright cocoon) that serves as the piston to drive the\nshock.

This process is thought to be responsible for\nregulating cooling losses, thus moderating the inflow of gas on to the central\ngalaxy, quenching further star formation and maintaining the galaxy in a red\nand dead state. In this paper, we implement a new jet feedback scheme into the\nmoving mesh-code arepo, contrast different jet injection techniques and\ndemonstrate the validity of our implementation by comparing against simple\nanalytical models.

Exoplanet atmosphere\nstudies require stellar background spectra to be known along the transit path\nwhile detection of Earth analogs require stellar microvariability to be\nunderstood. Hydrodynamic 3-D models can be computed for widely different stars\nbut have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface\nfeatures. Model predictions include spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and\nwavelength shifts, and their center-to-limb changes across stellar disks. AIMS:\nTo observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly\nresolved stellar surfaces, which are free from the effects of spatial smearing\nand rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to\nsynthetic profiles from 3-D models. METHODS: During exoplanet transits,\nsuccessive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy\nbetween various transit phases provides spectra of small surface segments\ntemporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1% of\nany main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very\nprecise observations. Realistically measurable quantities are identified\nthrough simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines. RESULTS: In normal\nstars, line profile ratios between various transit phases may vary by some\n0.5%, requiring S/N ratios of 5,000 or more for meaningful spectral\nreconstruction. While not yet realistic for individual spectral lines, this is\nachievable for cool stars by averaging over numerous lines with similar\nparameters.

We compare radial profiles of the mass fractions and the velocity\ndispersions of different sub-populations of stars according to their birth and\ncurrent locations. Results: Radial redistribution of stars is important in all\ngalaxies regardless of their light profiles. Type II breaks seem to be a\nconsequence of the combined effects of outward-moving and accreted stars. The\nformer produces shallower inner profiles (lack of stars in the inner disc) and\naccumulate material around the break radius and beyond, strengthening the\nbreak; the latter can weaken or even convert the break into a pure exponential.\nFurther accretion from satellites can concentrate material in the outermost\nparts, leading to type III breaks that can coexist with type II breaks, but\nsituated further out. Type III galaxies would be the result of an important\nradial redistribution of material throughout the entire disc, as well as a\nconcentration of accreted material in the outskirts.

Since observed\nsuper-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas\nefficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to\nbe rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we\npropose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat\ntransport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is\ninvestigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate\npseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the\nradiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling\nluminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for\nthe turbulent diffusivity, $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$.

We determine the distributions of initial\norbital parameters for a population of these gravitational-wave sources.

Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those\nlargely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to\nform habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system is\nsubjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth\ncluster. Various potential hazards remain after clusters disperse. For\ninstance, central galactic regions may present risks to habitability via nearby\nsupernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition,\nplanets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the\nGalaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the\nbinary's eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we\nreview the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary\nhabitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky\nplanets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars\nwith a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star\nclusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely\nlong-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs,\nand comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more\nlimited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance\nthe threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but\nthe probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability will always\nbe substantially below 100% for any environment.

The origin of this large scale strong magnetic field\nnear the event horizon is due to the advection of the magnetic flux by the\naccreting gas from the environment, say, the interstellar medium or a companion\nstar, because of flux freezing. In this simplest vertically averaged,\n1.5-dimensional disc model, we choose the maximum upper limit of the magnetic\nfield, which the disc around a black hole can sustain.

We found no such signals with\nnon-terrestrial origins and make estimates of the upper limits on Equivalent\nIsotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) for these three cases of approximately 7 kW,\n840 W, and 100 kW, respectively. These transmitter powers are well within the\ncapabilities of human technologies, and are therefore plausible for alien\ncivilizations. While the chances of positive detection in any given Search for\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) experiment are vanishingly small, the\ncharacteristics of new generation telescopes such as the MWA (and in the\nfuture, the Square Kilometre Array) make certain classes of SETI experiment\neasy, or even a trivial by-product of astrophysical observations. This means\nthat the future costs of SETI experiments are very low, allowing large target\nlists to partially balance the low probability of a positive detection. \n\n"}

While it has\nbeen demonstrated in numerical simulations that this chiral magnetically driven\nturbulence exists and strongly affects the dynamics of the magnetic field, the\ndetails of this process remain unclear. The goal of this paper is to analyse\nthe energetics of chiral magnetically driven turbulence and its effect on the\ngeneration and dynamics of the magnetic field using direct numerical\nsimulations. We study these effects for different initial conditions, including\na variation of the initial chiral chemical potential and the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber, Pm. In particular, we determine the ratio of kinetic to magnetic\nenergy, Upsilon, in chiral magnetically driven turbulence. Within the parameter\nspace explored in this study, Upsilon reaches a value of approximately\n0.064-0.074 -independently of the initial chiral asymmetry and for Pm=1.

We measured\nthe mass-loss rates for a unique population of massive post-main sequence stars\nat every stage of evolution, confirming a significant increase as stars\ntransition from OB supergiant to WR states.

High-contrast exoplanet imaging is a rapidly growing field as can be\nseen through the significant resources invested. In fact, the detection and\ncharacterization of exoplanets through direct imaging is featured at all major\nground-based observatories. Aims. We aim to improve the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) achievable for ground-based, adaptive-optics assisted exoplanet imaging\nby applying sophisticated post-processing algorithms. In particular, we\ninvestigate the benefits of including time domain information. Methods. We\nintroduce a new speckle-suppression technique in data post-processing based on\nwavelet transformation. This technique explicitly considers the time domain in\na given data set (specifically the frequencies of speckle variations and their\ntime dependence) and allows us to filter-out speckle noise. We combine our\nwavelet-based algorithm with state-of-the-art principal component analysis\n(PCA) based PSF subtraction routines and apply it to archival data sets of\nknown directly imaged exoplanets. The data sets were obtained in the L filter\nwhere the short integration times allow for a sufficiently high temporal\nsampling of the speckle variations. Results. We demonstrate that improvements\nin the peak SNR of up to forty to sixty percent can be achieved. We also show\nthat, when combined with wavelet-denoising, the PCA PSF model requires\nsystematically smaller numbers of components for the fit to achieve the highest\nSNR. The improvement potential is, however, data set dependent or, more\nspecifically, closely linked to the field rotation available in a given data\nset: larger amounts of rotation allow for a better suppression of the speckle\nnoise.

To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran.

The thesis study is\nexpected to reveal salient properties of matter dynamics in affine spacetime\nand may reveal an intimate connection between vacuum state and metrical\ngravity. An interesting application of the framework is the inflationary\nregime, where it is shown that affine gravity prefers only a unique metric\ntensor such that the transition from nonminimal to minimal coupling of the\ninflaton is performed only via redefinition of the latter. This allows us to\navoid the use of the so called conformal frames. In fact, unlike metric\ngravity, the metric tensor in affine gravity is generated and not postulated a\npriori, thus this tensor is absent in the actions and conformal transformation\ndoes not make sense. Last but not least, we try to show how metric gravity can\nbe induced through a simple structure that contains only affine connection and\nscalar fields. General relativity arises classically only at the vacuum, and\nthis view of gravity may be considered as a new way to inducing metric\nelasticity of space, not through quantum corrections as in standard induced\ngravity, but only classically.

On secular timescales this motion is dissipated by bulk and shear\nviscous processes in the stellar interior and magnetospheric braking in the\nexterior, changing the inclination angle between the rotation and magnetic\naxes. Using our recent solutions for the non-rigid precessional dynamics, and\nviscous dissipation integrals derived in this paper, we make the only\nself-consistent calculation to date of these dissipation rates.

Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system.

We also\nexplore the formation and dynamical impact of density cusps that arise in both\nsystems due to the presence of a massive, central black hole. The large N-body,\nself-gravitating systems we treat are \"weakly-collisional\": the mean free time\nbetween star or SIDM particle collisions is much longer than their\ncharacteristic crossing (dynamical) time scale, but shorter than the system\nlifetime. The fluid conduction model reliably tracks the \"gravothermal\ncatastrophe\" in star clusters and SIDM halos without black holes. For a star\ncluster with a massive, central black hole, this approximation reproduces the\nfamiliar Bahcall-Wolf quasistatic density cusp for the stars bound to the black\nhole and shows how the cusp halts the \"gravothermal catastrophe\" and causes the\ncluster to re-expand.

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent.

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

However, more and more observations on relativistic jets in\nradio galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and \"microquasars\" in the Galaxy have\nshown that many of these outflows are not conical, but cylindrical, i.e., they\nmaintain constant cross sections at large scales. Thus it is necessary to\ndiscuss the possibility that GRBs may be due to highly collimated cylindrical\njets, not conical ones. Here we study the dynamical evolution of cylindrical\njets and discuss their afterglows. Both analytical and numerical results are\npresented. It is shown that when the lateral expansion is not taken into\naccount, a cylindrical jet typically remains to be highly relativistic for \\sim\n10^8 - 10^9 s. During this relativistic phase, the optical afterglow decays as\n\\propto t^{-p/2} at first, where p is the index characterizing the power-law\nenergy distribution of electrons. Then the light curve steepens to be \\propto\nt^{-(p+1)/2} due to cooling of electrons. After entering the non-relativistic\nphase (i.e., t > 10^{11} s), the afterglow is \\propto t^{-(5p-4)/6}. But if the\ncylindrical jet expands laterally at co-moving sound speed, then the decay\nbecomes \\propto t^{-p} and \\propto t^{-(15p-21)/10} - t^{-(15p-20)/10} in the\nultra-relativistic and non-relativistic phase respectively. Note that in both\ncases, the light curve turns flatter after the relativistic-Newtonian\ntransition point, which differs markedly from the behaviour of a conical jet.\nIt is suggested that some GRBs with afterglows decaying as t^{-1.1} - t^{-1.3}\nmay be due to cylindrical jets, not necessarily isotropic fireballs. \n\n"}

The shift value strongly depends on the damping\nrate which is measured by the halfwidth of the QPO feature.

The coorbital torque is assumed to come from orbit crossing fluid\nelements which exchange angular momentum with the planet when they execute a\nU-turn at the end of horseshoe streamlines. When the planet migrates inward,\nthe fluid elements of the inner disk undergo one such exchange as they pass to\nthe outer disk. The angular momentum they gain is removed from the planet, and\nthis corresponds to a negative contribution to the corotation torque, which\nscales with the drift rate. In addition, the material trapped in the coorbital\nregion drifts radially with the planet giving a positive contribution to the\ncorotation torque, which also scales with the drift rate. These two\ncontributions do not cancel out if the coorbital region is depleted, in which\ncase there is a net corotation torque which scales with the drift rate and the\nmass deficit in the coorbital region, and which has same sign as the drift\nrate. This leads to a positive feedback on the migrating planet. In particular,\nif the coorbital mass deficit is larger than the planet mass, the migration\nrate undergoes a runaway which can vary the protoplanet semi-major axis by 50%\nover a few tens of orbits. This can happen only if the planet mass is\nsufficient to create a dip or gap in its surrounding region, and if the\nsurrounding disk mass is larger than the planet mass. This typically\ncorresponds to planet masses in the sub-Saturnian to Jovian mass range embedded\nin massive protoplanetary disks.

The accretion rate can then be related to characteristic densities and\ntemperatures that are set by the cooling properties of molecular hydrogen. We\nallow for rotation of the gas core, assuming angular momentum conservation\ninside the sonic point of the flow. In the typical case, most mass then reaches\nthe star via an accretion disk. The structure of the inner region of this disk\nis described with the standard theory of viscous disks, but with allowance for\nthe substantial energies absorbed in ionizing and dissociating the gas. The\nsize of the protostar and its luminosity depend upon the accretion rate, the\nenergetics of the accreting gas, and the ability of the radiation to escape\nfrom the stellar accretion shock. We combine these models for the infall rate,\ninner disk structure, and protostellar evolution to predict the radiation field\nthat is the basis for radiative feedback processes acting against infall (Paper\nII). For realistic initial angular momenta, the photosphere of the protostar is\nmuch smaller and hotter than in the spherical case, leading to stronger\nradiative feedback at earlier stages in the evolution.

Such color selection\nproduces samples that are sufficiently clean for statistical studies of the\nMilky Way's halo substructure, and we utilize it to select 3,643 candidate RR\nLyrae stars from SDSS Data Release 1. We demonstrate that this sample recovers\nknown clumps of RR Lyrae stars associated with the Sgr dwarf tidal tail, and\nPal 5 globular cluster, and use it to constrain the halo substructure away from\nthe Sgr dwarf tidal tail. These results suggest that it will be possible to\nstudy the halo substructure out to ~70 kpc from the Galactic Center in the\nentire area imaged by the SDSS, and not only in the multiply observed regions. \n\n"}

The observations\nreach a depth of K=21.5, corresponding to K*+3.5 mag. The evolution of the\ngalaxy properties are discussed in terms of their K band luminosity functions\nand the K band Hubble diagram of brightest cluster galaxies.\n  The bulk of the galaxy luminosities, as characterised by the parameter K*\nfrom the Schechter (1976) function, are found to be consistent with passive\nevolution with a redshift of formation of z_f~1.5-2. This is consistent with\nobservations of other high redshift clusters, but may be in disagreement with\ngalaxies in the field at similar redshifts. A good match to the shape of the\nComa cluster luminosity function is found by simply dimming the high redshift\nluminosity function by an amount consistent with passive evolution. The\nevolution of the cumulative fraction of K band light as a function of\nluminosity shows no evidence of merger activity in the brighter galaxies.\n  The evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) is tested by their K\nband Hubble diagram and by the fraction of K band cluster light in the BCGs.\nThe evolution observed is consistent with recent previous observations although\nthe scatter in the Hubble diagram allows for a range of evolutionary histories.\nThe fraction of cluster light contained in the BCGs is not smaller than that in\nComa, suggesting that they are already very massive with no need to hypothesise\nsignificant mergers in their futures. \n\n"}

The coincident\ntiming of two recent (< 4 Gyr) increases in the star formation rate and\nSMC/Milky Way(MW) pericenter passages suggests that global star formation in\nthe SMC is driven at least in part by tidal forces due to the MW. The Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) is the other potential driver of star formation, but is\nonly near the SMC during the most recent burst. The poorly constrained LMC-SMC\norbit is our principal uncertainty. To explore the correspondence between\nbursts and MW pericenter passages further, we model star formation in the SMC\nusing a combination of continuous and tidally-triggered star formation. The\nbehavior of the tidally-triggered mode is a strong inverse function of the\nSMC-MW separation (preferred behavior ~ r^-5, resulting in a factor of ~100\ndifference in the rate of tidally-triggered star formation at pericenter and\napocenter).

Using several existing models for the clumping of ionized gas,\nwe find that the expected free-free distortion to the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) blackbody spectrum is at a level detectable with upcoming\nexperiments such as the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and\nDiffuse Emission (ARCADE). However, the dominant contribution to the distortion\ncomes from clumpy gas at z < 3, and the integrated signal does not strongly\nconstrain the epoch of reionization. In addition to the mean emission, we\nconsider spatial fluctuations in the free-free background and the extent to\nwhich these anisotropies confuse the search for fluctuations in 21 cm line\nemission from neutral hydrogen during and prior to reionization. This\nbackground is smooth in frequency space and hence can be removed through\nfrequency differencing, but only so long as the 21 cm signal and the free-free\nemission are uncorrelated. We show that, because the free-free background is\ngenerated primarily at low redshifts, the cross-correlation between the two\nfields is smaller than a few percent. Thus, multifrequency cleaning should be\nan effective way to eliminate the free-free confusion. \n\n"}

As an application, we consider\npycnonuclear burning of matter accreted on a neutron star in a soft X-ray\ntransient (SXT, a compact binary containing a neutron star and a low-mass\ncompanion). The energy released in this burning, while the matter sinks into\nthe stellar crust under the weight of newly accreted material, is sufficient to\nwarm up the star and initiate neutrino emission in its core. The surface\nthermal radiation of the star in quiescent states becomes dependent of poorly\nknown equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear matter in the stellar core, which\ngives a method to explore this EOS. Four qualitatively different model EOSs are\ntested against observations of SXTs.

From the absolute magnitudes of the variables calculated from these\ndistances, we find that the LMC Cepheids define tight period-luminosity\nrelations in the V, I, W,\n  J and K bands which agree exceedingly well with the corresponding Galactic PL\nrelations derived from the same technique, and are significantly steeper than\nthe LMC PL relations in these bands observed by the OGLE-II Project in V, I and\nW, and by Persson et al. in J and K. We find that the tilt-corrected true\ndistance moduli of the LMC Cepheids show a significant dependence on period,\nwhich hints at a systematic error in the ISB technique related to the period of\nthe stars. We identify as the most likely culprit the p-factor which converts\nthe radial into pulsational velocities; our data imply a much steeper period\ndependence of the p-factor than previously thought, and we derive p=1.58\n(+/-0.02) -0.15 (+/-0.05) logP as the best fit from our data, with a zero point\ntied to the Milky Way open cluster Cepheids. Using this revised p-factor law,\nthe period dependence of the LMC Cepheid distance moduli disappears, and at the\nsame time the Milky Way and LMC PL relations agree among themselves, and with\nthe directly observed LMC PL relations, within the 1 sigma uncertainties. Our\nmain conclusion is that the previous, steeper Galactic PL relations were caused\nby an erroneous calibration of the p-factor law, and that there is now evidence\nthat the slope of the Cepheid PL relation is independent of metallicity up to\nsolar metallicity, in both optical, and near-infrared bands. \n\n"}

Special focus is placed on the differences of the two commonly\nused versions of the spin parameter, namely lambda=J*E^1/2/(G*M^5/2) (Peebles\n80) and lambda'=J/(sqrt(2)*M_vir*R_vir*V_vir) (Bullock et al. 01). Though the\ndistribution of the spin transfer rate defined as the ratio of the spin\nparameters after and prior to a merger is similar to a high degree for both,\nlambda and lambda', we find considerable differences in the time evolution:\nwhile lambda' is roughly independent of redshift, lambda turns out to increase\nsignificantly with decreasing redshift. This distinct behaviour arises from\nsmall differences in the spin transfer during accretion events. The evolution\nof the spin parameter is strongly coupled with the virial ratio\neta:=2*E_kin/|E_pot| of dark halos. Major mergers disturb halos and increase\nboth their virial ratio and spin parameter for 1-2 Gyrs.

For halos\nin clusters the concentration parameters decrease on average with mass with a\nslope of ~0.1; for halos in voids these concentrations do not change with mass.\nFor masses <5 10^11 M_sh^-1, halos in clusters are on average ~30-40% more\nconcentrated and have ~2 times higher central densities than halos in voids.\nWhen comparing only parent halos, the differences are less pronounced but they\nare still significant.

In the conventional\napproach, gravity breaks this symmetry and the gravitational field equations\nare not invariant under such a shift of the energy momentum tensor. I argue\nthat until this symmetry is restored, one cannot obtain a satisfactory solution\nto the cosmological constant problem. I describe an alternative perspective to\ngravity in which the gravitational field equations are [G_{ab} -\\kappa T_{ab}]\nn^an^b =0 for all null vectors n^a. This is obviously invariant under the\nchange T^a_b --> T^a_b +\\rho \\delta^a_b and restores the symmetry under\nshifting the matter lagrangian by a constant. These equations are equivalent to\nG_{ab} = \\kappa T_{ab} + Cg_{ab} where C is now an integration constant so that\nthe role of the cosmological constant is very different in this approach. The\ncosmological constant now arises as an integration constant, somewhat like the\nmass M in the Schwarzschild metric, the value of which can be chosen depending\non the physical context.

Subsequently, it\nhas been argued that the intergalactic plasma may interfere adversely with this\nmechanism by rendering the oscillations energy dependent. Here we show that\nthis energy dependence is extremely sensitive to the precise value of the free\nelectron density in the Universe. Decreasing the electron density by only a\nfactor of 4 is already sufficient to bring the energy dependence within the\nexperimental bounds. Models of the intergalactic medium show that for redshifts\nz<1 about 97% of the total volume of space is filled with regions of density\nsignificantly lower than the average density. From these models we estimate\nthat the average electron density in most of space is lower by at least a\nfactor of 15 compared to the estimate based on one half of all baryons being\nuniformly distributed and ionized. Therefore the energy dependence of the\nphoton-axion oscillations is consistent with experiment, and the oscillation\nmodel remains a viable alternative to the accelerating Universe for explaining\nthe supernova observations. Furthermore, the electron density does give rise to\na sufficiently large plasma frequency which cuts off the photon-axion mixing\nabove microwave frequencies, shielding the cosmic microwave photons from axion\nconversions and significantly relaxing the lower bounds on the axion mass\nimplied by the oscillation model. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/9709381", "contents": "Title: Comprehensive Study of the Possibility of Day - Night Effect Enhancement Abstract: A set of quantitative predictions for the day-night asymmetry in the Super -\nKamiokande detector is presented. For these predictions, neutrino events are\ncollected in ``samples'' defined by the trajectories in the Earth of the\ncorresponding solar neutrinos. The more important samples considered here are:\nthe full sample of neutrinos detected at night, the sample of night neutrinos\nwhich cross the Earth core and the sample of night neutrinos which does not\ncross the Earth core. For energy integrated event rates, the day-night\nasymmetry for core crossing neutrinos is up to six times bigger than the\nday-night asymmetry for the full sample of night neutrinos. When the reduction\nin statistics is considered, an effective enhancement up to a factor $\\approx\n2.3$ is obtained.

Therefore the D-term inflation model in supergravity with\nconstant FI terms has to be revisited.\n  We also investigate the case of the so-called anomalous U(1) when a chiral\nsuperfield is shifted under U(1). In such a case, in the context of string\ntheory, the FI terms originate from the derivative of the Kaehler potential and\nthey are inevitably field-dependent. This raises an issue of stabilization of\nthe relevant field in applications to cosmology.\n  The recently suggested equivalence between the D-term strings and D-branes of\ntype II theory shows that brane-anti-brane systems produce FI terms in the\neffective 4d theory, with the Ramond-Ramond axion shifting under the U(1)\nsymmetry. This connection gives the possibility to interpret many unknown\nproperties of D-\\bar{D} systems in the more familiar language of 4d\nsupergravity D-terms, and vice versa.
