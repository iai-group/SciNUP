Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

In such a picture, quasars are expected to\nbe located in regions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where\nmergers are more likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity\nobserved in low-luminosity AGN is due to secular processes that are less\ndependent on the local galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the\nlocal photometric galaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic Type\nI and Type II quasars to the local density around lower luminosity\nspectroscopic Type I and Type II AGN. To minimize projection effects and\nevolution in the photometric galaxy sample we use to characterize AGN\nenvironments, we place our random control sample at the same redshift as our\nAGN and impose a narrow redshift window around both the AGN and control\ntargets.

The afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with R_V=4 and\nA_V=3.2 mag and requires the presence of a modest 2175A bump.

Importantly, an earlier episode of tidal heating can result\nin a planet with an inflated radius, even though its orbit has nearly\ncircularized. Moreover, we confirm that at late times, and under some\ncircumstances, by raising tides on the star itself a planet can spiral into its\nhost.

For photon\nfrequencies much larger than the typical radio frequency, vacuum birefringence\ndue to strong-field quantum electrodynamics dominates over the plasma effect.\nWe study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized QED vacuum of a\nneutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagation\neffect across the quasi-tangential (QT) point, where the photon momentum is\nnearly aligned with the magnetic field. In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon polarization modes\nare decoupled due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linear\npolarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.\nHowever, we show that X-ray polarization may change significantly when the\nphoton passes through the QT region. When averaging over a finite emission\narea, the net effect of QT propagation is to reduce the degree of linear\npolarization; the reduction factor depends on the photon energy, magnetic field\nstrength, geometry, rotation phase and the emission area, and can be more than\na factor of two.

This conclusion remains robust\nwith respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does not\ndepend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. As a concrete\nexample, we apply this test to the most recent data of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. Assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55EeV is not a\nstatistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed at\nenergies <10EeV, we show that the apparent clustering toward Cen A cannot be\nattributed to heavy nuclei. Similar conclusions are drawn regarding the\napparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei. We then discuss\na robust lower bound to the magnetic luminosity that a source must possess in\norder to be able to accelerate particles of charge Z up to 100EeV,\nL_B>10^{45}Z^{-2}erg/s. Using this bound in conjunction with the above\nconclusions, we argue that the current PAO data does not support the model of\ncosmic ray origin in active radio-quiet or even radio-loud galaxies. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that the apparent clustering in the direction of Cen A can be\nexplained by the contribution of the last few gamma-ray bursts or magnetars in\nthe host galaxy thanks to the scattering of the cosmic rays on the magnetized\nlobes. \n\n"}

The inconsistency indicates that there is a serious problem in\nthe map making routine of the WMAP team, and it is necessary to reprocess the\nWMAP data.

In the new maps, the inconsistency\ndisappeared, along with the hitherto unexplained high level alignment between\nthe CMB quadrupole and octopole components detected in released WMAP maps. An\nimproved CMB cross-power spectrum is then derived from the new maps which\nbetter agrees with that of BOOMRANG.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303.

We then arranged a set of reference objects mimicking\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe, with which correlations of\nsimulated UHECR events are analyzed. With our model IGMF, the deflection angle\nbetween the arrival direction of super-GZK protons and the sky position of\ntheir actual sources is quite large with the mean value of $<\\theta > \\sim\n15^{\\circ}$ and the median value of $\\tilde \\theta \\sim 7 - 10^{\\circ}$. On the\nother hand, the separation angle between the arrival direction and the sky\nposition of nearest reference objects is substantially smaller with $<S > \\sim\n3.5 - 4^{\\circ}$, which is similar to the mean angular distance in the sky to\nnearest neighbors among the reference objects. This is a direct consequence of\nour model that the sources, observers, reference objects, and the IGMF all\ntrace the matter distribution of the universe. The result implies that\nextragalactic objects lying closest to the arrival direction of UHECRs are not\nnecessary their actual sources. With our model for the distribution of\nreference objects, the fraction of super-GZK proton events, whose closest AGNs\nare true sources, is less than 1/3.

Following\nthe detections of Cen A and Per A, this makes M87 the third radio galaxy seen\nwith the LAT. The faint point-like gamma-ray source has a >100 MeV flux of 2.45\n(+/- 0.63) x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (photon index = 2.26 +/- 0.13) with no\nsignificant variability detected within the LAT observation. This flux is\ncomparable with the previous EGRET upper limit (< 2.18 x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1, 2\nsigma), thus there is no evidence for a significant MeV/GeV flare on decade\ntimescales.

A\nstandard model of the synchrotron self-Compton emission of a compact source\ninside a jet is not able to explain such a correlation. Therefore, we propose\nan alternative scenario where the emission of at least two independent compact\ncomponents is observed at the same time.\n  We compare two different models. The first model assumes the injection of\nrelativistic particles into a downstream region of a shock wave inside a jet\nthat creates the emitting source. The model precisely describes the evolution\nof the particle energy spectrum inside the source and takes into account a\nlight-crossing time effect for the produced radiation. The second model assumes\nan intrinsically constant emission of a homogeneous source that travels inside\nthe jet along a curved trajectory, where the activity is produced simply by\ndifferent values of the source's Doppler factor.

These systems have luminosities and stellar velocity\ndispersions that are similar to those of known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but\nthey have more extended stellar distributions (half light radii greater than\nabout 100 pc) because they inhabit dark subhalos that are slightly less massive\nthan their higher surface brightness counterparts. As a result, the typical\npeak surface brightness is fainter than 30 mag per square arcsec. One\nimplication is that the inferred common mass scale for Milky Way dwarfs may be\nan artifact of selection bias. If there is no sharp threshold in galaxy\nformation at low halo mass, then ultrafaint galaxies like Segue 1 represent the\nhigh-mass, early forming tail of a much larger population of objects that could\nnumber in the hundreds and have typical peak circular velocities of about 8\nkm/s and masses within 300 pc of about 5 million solar masses.

We use a\nmerger-tree approach to estimate the rate at which QSs might form as a function\nof redshift, and the statistical properties of the resulting QS and seed black\nhole populations. We relate the triggering of runaway infall to major mergers\nof gas-rich galaxies, and to a threshold for global gravitational instability,\nwhich we link to the angular momentum of the host. This is the main parameter\nof our models. Once infall is triggered, its rate is determined by the halo\npotential; the properties of the resulting QS and seed black hole depend on\nthis rate. After the epoch of QSs, we model the growth of MBHs within their\nhosts in a merger-driven accretion scenario. We compare MBH seeds grown inside\nquasistars to a seed model that derives from the remnants of the first\nmetal-free stars, and also study the case in which both channels of MBH\nformation operate simultaneously. We find that a limited range of QS/MBH\nformation efficiencies exists that allows one to reproduce observational\nconstraints.

The Symbiotic Channel Abstract: In order for a white dwarf (WD) to achieve the Chandrasekhar mass, M_C, and\nexplode as a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), it must interact with another star,\neither accreting matter from or merging with it. The failure to identify the\ntypes of binaries which produce SNeIa is the \"progenitor problem\". Its solution\nis required if we are to utilize the full potential of SNeIa to elucidate basic\ncosmological and physical principles. In single-degenerate models, a WD\naccretes and burns matter at high rates. Nuclear-burning WDs (NBWDs) with mass\nclose to M_C are hot and luminous, potentially detectable as supersoft x-ray\nsources (SSSs). In previous work we showed that > 90-99% of the required number\nof progenitors do not appear as SSSs during most of the crucial phase of mass\nincrease. The obvious implication is that double-degenerate (DD) binaries form\nthe main class of progenitors. We show in this paper, however, that many\nbinaries that later become DDs must pass through a long-lived NBWD phase during\nwhich they are potentially detectable as SSSs. The paucity of SSSs is therefore\nnot a strong argument in favor of DD models. Those NBWDs that are the\nprogenitors of DD binaries are likely to appear as symbiotic binaries for\nintervals > 10^6 years. In fact, symbiotic pre-DDs should be common, whether or\nnot the WDs eventually produce SNeIa. The key to solving the progenitor problem\nlies in understanding the appearance of NBWDs. Most do not appear as SSSs most\nof the time. We therefore consider the evolution of NBWDs to address the\nquestion of what their appearance may be and how we can hope to detect them. \n\n"}

The dust surface density is spatially correlated with the\natomic and molecular gas phases. The dust temperature is consistently lower in\nthe dense phase of the ISM than in the diffuse phase.

To this\nend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to the\nstudy of the high-z GRB 090205.

Our observational campaign led to the detection of the\noptical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 090205 and to the first measure of its\nredshift, z=4.65. Similar to other, recent high-z GRBs, GRB 090205 has a short\nduration in the rest-frame with T_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibility\nthat it might belong to the short GRBs class. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 090205\nshows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at\n500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. Photometric\nobservations of the GRB 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxy\nwith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 Myr. Moreover, the metallicity of\nZ > 0.27 Z_Sun derived from the GRB afterglow spectrum is among the highest\nderived from GRB afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burst\noccurred in a rather enriched envirorment.

The reason is that L/M rather than L is the main parameter\naffecting the planar cloud motion. b.

During this 11 months period, the source was\ncharacterized by a complex variability at optical, UV and gamma-ray bands, on\ntime scales down to 6-12 hours. The brightest gamma-ray isotropic luminosity,\nrecorded on 2009 March 26, was ~ 2x10^48erg s^-1. The spectrum in the Fermi-LAT\nenergy range shows a mild curvature well described by a log-parabolic law, and\ncan be understood as due to the Klein-Nishina effect. The gamma-ray flux has a\ncomplex correlation with the other wavelengths. There is no correlation at all\nwith the X-ray band, a weak correlation with the UV, and a significant\ncorrelation with the optical flux. The gamma-ray flux seems to lead the optical\none by about 13 days. From the UV photometry we estimated a black hole mass of\n~ 5.4x10^8 solar masses, and an accretion rate of ~ 0.5 solar masses/year.\nAlthough the power in the thermal and non-thermal outputs is smaller compared\nto the very luminous and distant flat spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089\nexhibits a quite large Compton dominance and a prominent big blue bump (BBB) as\nobserved in the most powerful gamma-ray quasars.

Cavities apparently evolve from the interaction of AGN jets\nwith the intracluster medium (ICM). However, in numerical simulations it has\nbeen difficult to create such fat cavities from narrow jets. Ultra-hot thermal\njets dominated by kinetic energy typically penetrate deep into the ICM, forming\nradially elongated cavities at large radii unlike those observed. Here, we\nstudy very light jets dominated energetically by relativistic cosmic rays (CRs)\nwith axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations, investigating the jet evolution\nboth when they are active and when they are later turned off. We find that,\nwhen the thermal gas density in a CR-dominated jet is sufficiently low, the jet\nhas a correspondingly low inertia, and thus decelerates quickly in the ICM.\nFurthermore, CR pressure causes the jet to expand laterally, encounter and\ndisplace more decelerating ICM gas, naturally producing fat cavities near\ncluster centers similar to those observed.

If any of them\nare non-zero, generated \\zeta is statistically anisotropic. Then the power\nspectrum of \\zeta and the non-linearity parameter fNL have an angular\nmodulation. This formalism is applied for two vector curvaton models and the\nend-of-inflation scenario. It is found that for p \\ne 0, the magnitude of fNL\nand the direction of its angular modulation is correlated with the anisotropy\nin the spectrum.

Unlike to usual experiments in particle\nphysics, where noise always adds to the signal, radio noise can in principle\ndecrease or increase the signal if it interferes by chance destructively or\nconstructively. Consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from the\nsignal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulses\nmust be studied with care. First, noise has to be determined consistently with\nthe definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum field\nstrength of the radio pulse. Second, the average impact of noise on radio pulse\nmeasurements at individual antennas is studied for LOPES. It is shown that a\ncorrect treatment of noise is especially important at low signal-to-noise\nratios: noise can be the dominant source of uncertainty for pulse height and\ntime measurements, and it can systematically flatten the slope of lateral\ndistributions. The presented method can also be transfered to other experiments\nin radio and acoustic detection of cosmic rays and neutrinos. \n\n"}

The standard interpretation of ULXs with a\ncurved spectrum, or a moderately steep power-law with soft excess and\nhigh-energy downturn, is that they are an extension of the very high state, up\nto luminosities ~ 1 to 3 L_{Edd}. Two competing models are Comptonization in a\nwarm corona, and slim disk; I suggest bulk motion Comptonization in the\nradiatively-driven outflow as another possibility. The interpretation of ULXs\nwith a hard power-law spectrum is more problematic.

Furthermore, X-ray\npolarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the\nmisalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus. To model\nthe expected polarisation percentage and position angle, we apply the radiative\ntransfer code STOKES.

Particles begin the acceleration by the ExB\ndrift with the accretion flow. The energy gain in the drift regime is limited\nby the conservation of the adiabatic invariant p_perp^2/B. Upon approaching the\nfilament, the drift turns into the gyro-motion around the filament so that the\nparticle moves parallel to the azimuthal electric field. In this 'betatron'\nregime the acceleration speeds up to rapidly reach the electrodynamic limit\n$cp_{max}=eBR$ for an accelerator with magnetic field $B$ and the orbit radius\n$R$ (Larmor radius).

Long and Short burst pulses exhibit these behaviors, suggesting\nthat a similar process is responsible for producing all GRB pulses. That these\nproperties correlate in the observer's frame indicates that intrinsic\ncorrelations are strong enough to not be diluted into insignificance by the\ndispersion in distances and redshift.

Simultaneously, the asymmetry of a\ngalaxy's stellar disk, in combination with other morphological parameters, has\nseen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxy\nsamples. Quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue to\ndetermine the merger rate over much of the age of the Universe. In this paper,\nwe measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the HI column density\nmaps from the Westerbork observations of neutral Hydrogen in Irregular and\nSPiral galaxies (WHISP). These are Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini,\nM20, and one addition of our own, the Gini parameter of the second order moment\n(GM). Our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can be\nidentified with these parameters. Our sample of 141 HI maps have all previous\nclassifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. We find that the\nAsymmetry, M20, and our new GM parameter correlate only weakly with the\nprevious morphological lopsidedness quantification. These three parameters may\nbe used to compute a probability that an HI disk is morphologically lopsided\nbut not unequivocally to determine it.

Our final sample consists of 44 Seyfert\n1's, 29 Seyfert 1.5's, 78 Seyfert 2's, and 14 Narrow Line Seyfert 1's.

Compton-thin Seyfert 2's show a\nreflection component stronger than Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 1.5's.

This cannot be\nexplained easily by the unified model. The absorber/reflector in mildly\nobscured Seyfert 2's might cover a large fraction of the X-ray source, and have\nclumps of Compton-thick material.

Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young\nstars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of\ndisc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference\nbetween the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest\nneighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older\npopulation should appear more spread out.\n  To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low\nmass star forming regions.

After a contraction timescale which is\nequal to a few times their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and\npopulate the IMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account\nin the form of stellar winds.

The power of\nthe radiation driven winds has a strong dependence on metallicity and increases\nwith increasing metallicity.

In fact, baryon-density perturbations of fairly large amplitude\nmay exist if they are compensated by dark-matter perturbations, so that the\ntotal density remains unchanged. These compensated isocurvature perturbations\n(CIPs) leave no imprint on the CMB at observable scales, at linear order in\ntheir amplitude. B modes in the CMB polarization are generated at reionization\nthrough the modulation of the optical depth by CIPs, but this induced\npolarization is small. The strongest known constraint $\\lesssim 10%$ to the CIP\namplitude comes from galaxy cluster baryon fractions.

However, baryonic physics\nmay affect the dark matter density profile. For example, it was suggested that\nadiabatic contraction of baryonic gas makes the dark matter cusp steeper.\nHowever, it is still an open question if the gas falls into the galactic centre\nin smooth adiabatic manner. Recent numerical studies suggested that disc\ngalaxies might experience clumpy phase in their early stage of the disc\nformation, which could also explain clump clusters and chain galaxies observed\nin high redshift Universe. In this letter, using numerical simulations with an\nisolated model, we study how the dark matter halo responds to these clumpy\nnature of baryon component in disc galaxy formation through the clump cluster\nphase. Our simulation demonstrates that such clumpy phase leads to a shallower\ndensity profile of the dark matter halo in the central region while clumps fall\ninto the centre due to dynamical friction.

Hence,\nclusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as\nenergy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and\nsupernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR\ninteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date\nobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy\ngamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes\nfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in\nthe detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E > 100 GeV with\na very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E >\n630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess.

These phenomena bring the star to\nevolve in the quite different (opposite) ways and should be taken into account\nat once, as the gravitational compression is considered. Under the above\ntransition, which is expected to occur within any supermassive neutron star\n(NS), the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum - a coherent state of gluon- and chiral\n$q\\bar q$-condensates - turns, first near the star center, into the \"empty\"\n(perturbation) subhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, pre-existing (very high)\nvacuum pressure falls there down rather abruptly; as a result, the \"cold\" star\nstarts collapsing almost freely into the new vacuum. If the stellar mass is\nsufficiently large, then this implosion is shown to result in an enormous\nheating within the star central domain (up to a temperature about 100-200 MeV\nor, maybe, even higher), what makes the pressure from within to grow up,\npredominantly due to degeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair\nproduction. Thus, a \"flaming wall\" could arise, which withstands the further\ncollapsing and brings the star off the irrevocable shutting into BH.

II.\n  Episodic formation of broad line regions Abstract: (abridged) We study the consequence of star formation (SF) in an self-gravity\ndominated accretion disk in quasars. The warm skins of the SF disk are governed\nby the radiation from the inner part of the accretion disk to form Compton\natmosphere (CAS). The CAS are undergoing four phases to form broad line\nregions. Phase I is the duration of pure accumulation supplied by the SF disk.\nDuring phase II clouds begin to form due to line cooling and sink to the SF\ndisk. Phase III is a period of preventing clouds from sinking to the SF disk\nthrough dynamic interaction between clouds and the CAS. Finally, phase IV is an\ninevitable collapse of the entire CAS through line cooling. This CAS evolution\ndrives the episodic appearance of BLRs. Geometry and dynamics of BLRs can be\nself-consistently derived from the thermal instability of the CAS during phases\nII and III by linear analysis. The metallicity gradient of SF disk gives rise\nto different properties of clouds from outer to inner part of BLRs. We find\nthat clouds have column density N_H < 10^22cm^{-2} in the metal-rich regions\nwhereas they have N_H > 10^22 cm^{-2} in the metal-poor regions. The metal-rich\nclouds compose the high ionization line (HIL) regions whereas the metal-poor\nclouds are in low ionization line (LIL) regions. Metal-rich clouds in HIL\nregions will be blown away by radiation pressure, forming the observed\noutflows. The LIL regions are episodic due to the mass cycle of clouds with the\nCAS in response to continuous injection by the SF disk, giving rise to\ndifferent types of AGNs.

A key\nphase in the episodic appearance of the BLRs is bright type II AGNs with no or\nonly weak BLRs.

For the cascade emission, we consider two possible\ncontributions: one is due to that the flux of the cascade emission is lower\nthan the Fermi LAT sensitivity (case I), which is independent on the\nextragalactic magnetic field (EGMF), another is due to the fact that the flux\nof the cascade emission is larger than the Fermi LAT sensitivity but the\nemission angle is larger than LAT point-spread-function (PSF) angle (case II),\nwhich depends on the EGMF.

The gain in lensing cross section increases as the mass is split into\nmore halos, provided that the lens potentials are projected close enough to\ninteract with each other. A nonzero projected halo angular separation, equal\nhalo mass ratio, and high projected halo concentration are the best mass\nconfigurations, whereas projected halo ellipticity, halo triaxiality, and the\nrelative orientations of the halos are less important.

In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is\nimportant since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies\na very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated\nnon-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by\nthe correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Fermi energy of the system.

In such cases, energy and then entropy produces via\nOhmic dissipation. In addition, certain optically thin, hot, accretion flows,\nof temperature >~ 10^9K, may be favourable for nuclear burning which could\ngenerate/absorb huge energy, much higher than that in a star.

One proposed signature of oceans is\nspecular reflection (\"glint\"), which increases the apparent albedo of a planet\nat crescent phases. We post-process a global climate model of an Earth-like\nplanet to simulate reflected lightcurves. Significantly, we obtain glint-like\nphase variations even though we do not include specular reflection in our\nmodel. This false positive is the product of two generic properties: 1) for\nmodest obliquities, a planet's poles receive less orbit-averaged stellar flux\nthan its equator, so the poles are more likely to be covered in highly\nreflective snow and ice, and 2) we show that reflected light from a\nmodest-obliquity planet at crescent phases probes higher latitudes than at\ngibbous phases, therefore a planet's apparent albedo will naturally increase at\ncrescent phase. We suggest that this \"latitude-albedo effect\" will operate even\nfor large obliquities: in that case the equator receives less orbit-averaged\nflux than the poles, and the equator is preferentially sampled at crescent\nphase. Using rotational and orbital color variations to map the surfaces of\ndirectly imaged planets and estimate their obliquity will therefore be a\nnecessary pre-condition for properly interpreting their reflected phase\nvariations. The latitude-albedo effect is a particularly convincing glint false\npositive for zero-obliquity planets, and such worlds are not amenable to\nlatitudinal mapping. This effect severely limits the utility of specular\nreflection for detecting oceans on exoplanets. \n\n"}

For 3 of the 7 stars, we have\nobtained dense phase coverage sampling the entire rotational cycle. These\ndatasets are suitable for immediate magnetic and chemical abundance surface\nmapping using Magnetic Doppler Imaging (MDI). For the 4 remaining stars,\npartial phase coverage has been obtained, and additional observations will be\nrequired in order to map the surfaces of these stars. The median\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the reduced observations is over 700 per 1.8 km\\s\npixel. Spectra of all stars show Stokes V Zeeman signatures in essentially all\nindividual lines, and most stars show clear Stokes QU signatures in many\nindividual spectral lines. The observations provide a vastly improved data set\ncompared to previous generations of observations in terms of signal-to-noise\nratio, resolving power and measurement uncertainties. Measurement of the\nlongitudinal magnetic field demonstrates that the data are internally\nconsistent within computed uncertainties typically at the 50 to 100 sigma\nlevel.

Our results suggest that the\nvariability of the non-thermal jet emission in blazars is stochastic in nature,\nwith unique variability properties due to the effects of relativistic beaming.\nAfter correcting for beaming, we estimate that the characteristic timescale of\nblazar variability is ~3 years in the rest-frame of the jet, in contrast with\nthe ~320 day disk flux timescale observed in quasars. The variability-based\nselection method presented will be useful for blazar identification in\ntime-domain optical surveys, and is also a probe of jet physics. \n\n"}

We argue that due to existent\nconditions in cluster cores, the SMBHs will, in addition to accreting gas via\nradiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes of enhanced\naccretion via thin discs. In general, the orientation of these accretion discs\nwill be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes and the ensuing\ntorques will cause the black hole's spin axis (and therefore, the jet axis) to\nslew and rapidly change direction. This model not only explains recent\nobservations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individual\ncool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular direction\nwith respect to the cluster center, but also shows that AGN jets {\\it can} heat\nthe cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas cooling timescale.

In particular, we show that\nthe radial profiles of median gas properties are smooth and do not exhibit\nfluctuations at locations of massive clumps in contrast to mean and mode\nproperties. It is shown that distribution of gas properties in a given radial\nshell can be well described by a log-normal PDF and a tail. The former\ncorresponds to a nearly hydrostatic bulk component, accounting for ~99% of the\nvolume, while the tail corresponds to high density inhomogeneities. We show\nthat this results in a simple and robust separation of the diffuse and clumpy\ncomponents of the ICM. The FWHM of the density distribution grows with radius\nand varies from ~0.15 dex in cluster centre to ~0.5 dex at 2r_500 in relaxed\nclusters.

In this paper we argue that, during inflation, the\nelectroweak vacuum can actually be very short-lived, contrary to the conclusion\nthat follows from the flat spacetime analysis. Namely, in the case of a pure\nHiggs potential the electroweak vacuum decays via the Hawking-Moss transition,\nwhich has no flat spacetime analogue. As a result, the Higgs vacuum is\nunstable, unless the rate of inflation is low enough: $H_{\\rm inf}\\lesssim\n10^9-10^{12}$ GeV. Models of inflation with such a low rate typically predict\nnegligible tensor perturbations in the cosmic microwave background radiation\n(CMBR).

We provide theoretical\ncorrections for the net velocity shifts due to convection expected for the\nmeasurements from the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). We used a set of\nthree-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface convection\ncomputed with CO5BOLD to calculate spectra of late-type stars in the Gaia RVS\nrange and to infer the net velocity offset that convective motions will induce\nin radial velocities derived by cross-correlation. The net velocity shifts\nderived by cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectral\nresolution of the observations. Convective shifts for Gaia RVS observations are\nless than 0.1 km/s for late-K-type stars, and they increase with stellar mass,\nreaching about 0.3 km/s or more for early F-type dwarfs.

Methods:\nWe perform a time-resolved spectral analysis of Ep. 1 with a blackbody (BB)\nplus a power-law (PL) spectral model. We analyze Ep. 2 within the Fireshell\nmodel, identifying the Proper-GRB (P-GRB) and simulating the light curve and\nspectrum. We establish the redshift to be z=0.75 [...].

The total energy of Ep. 1 and 2 are E_{iso}^1=1.42x10^{53}erg and\nE_{iso}^2=2.43x10^{52}erg, respectively.

Compared to previous work, we improve the\ncalculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition\nto radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central\nAGN, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scattered\nand reprocessed photons. We find that the accretion flow properties change\nsignificantly due to this \"re-radiation\" effect. The inflow rate at the inner\nboundary is reduced, while the outflow rate at the outer boundary is enhanced\nby about one order of magnitude. This effect is more significant when the\ndensity at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as\nvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the\naccretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the\nradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far\nbelow the value of $\\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological\nsimulations. The effect of the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary\n($T_0$) is investigated. When $T_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity of the\naccretion flow oscillates. This is because in this case the gas around the\nBondi radius can be more easily heated to be above the virial temperature due\nto its high internal energy.

This is largely related to\ntwo phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely\nhigh-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of\nefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including\nmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.\nThe subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we\nmeasure a redshift of z=0.984. GRB 110918A gave rise to a luminous afterglow\nwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line with\nlittle extinction (A_V=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions of\nafterglow properties.

It\nhas a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of ~10 kpc, the highest\nstellar mass for z<1.9 (log(M_*/M_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an Halpha-based star\nformation rate of 41 M_sol/yr.

In\nthe context of the former, we confirm that the latest Swift sample of GRBs\nreveals an increasing evolution in the GRB rate relative to the star formation\nrate (SFR) at high redshifts. The observed discrepancy between the GRB rate and\nthe SFR may be eliminated by assuming a modest evolution parameterized as\n$(1+z)^{0.8}$---perhaps indicating a cosmic evolution in metallicity.

I discuss my new research exploring\nhow CRs interact with the ISM in starbursts. Molecular clouds provide targets\nfor CR protons to produce pionic gamma rays and ionization, but those same\nlosses may shield the cloud interiors. In the densest molecular clouds, gamma\nrays and Al-26 decay can provide ionization, at rates up to those in Milky Way\nmolecular clouds. I then consider the free-free absorption of low frequency\nradio emission from starbursts, which I argue arises from many small, discrete\nH II regions rather than from a \"uniform slab\" of ionized gas, whereas\nsynchrotron emission arises outside them. Finally, noting that the hot\nsuperwind gas phase fills most of the volume of starbursts, I suggest that it\nhas turbulent-driven magnetic fields powered by supernovae, and that this phase\nis where most synchrotron emission arises. I show how such a scenario could\nexplain the far-infrared radio correlation, in context of my previous work. A\nbig issue is that radio and gamma-ray observations imply CRs also must interact\nwith dense gas.

Before using them as efficient tools in the early Universe,\nhowever, the environmental factors that govern the formation of GRBs need to be\nunderstood. Metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in\nGRB explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a decade of\nextensive studies, not fully understood. This is largely related to two\nphenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely\nhigh-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of\nefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including\nmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.\nThe subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we\nmeasure one of the largest host-integrated metallicities, ever, and the highest\nstellar mass for z<1.9. This presents one of the very few robust metallicity\nmeasurements of GRB hosts at z~1, and establishes that GRB hosts at z~1 can\nalso be very metal rich. It conclusively rules out a metallicity cut-off in GRB\nhost galaxies and argues against an anti-correlation between metallicity and\nenergy release in GRBs. \n\n"}

The study of BL Lac objects (BLL) detected in gamma-rays gives\ninsights on the acceleration mechanisms in play in such systems and is also a\nvaluable tool to constrain the density of the extragalactic background light.\nAs their spectra are dominated by the non-thermal emission of the jet and the\nspectral features are weak and narrow in the optical domain, measuring their\nredshift is challenging. However such a measure is fundamental as it allows a\nfirm determination of the distance and luminosity of the source, and therefore\na consistent model of its emission. Aims. Measurement of the redshift of BLL\ndetected in gamma-rays and determination of global properties of their host\ngalaxies. Methods.

We\nargue that for a range of CSM masses and their radii, a collisionless shock can\nform, allowing for efficient cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration. We show that pp\ncollisions between these newly accelerated CRs and the CSM leads to not only\ngamma rays but also secondary electrons and positrons that radiate synchrotron\nphotons in the high-frequency radio bands. Our estimates imply that various\nfacilities including the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) may observe such SNe at Gpc distances by\nfollowup observations in months-to-years, although the detectability strongly\ndepends on the CSM density as well as observed frequency.

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise. It has been\nproposed, however, that secondary positrons could be produced and then\naccelerated in nearby supernova remnants, potentially explaining the observed\nrise, without the need of primary positron sources. Yet, if secondary positrons\nare accelerated in such shocks, other secondary cosmic ray species (such as\nboron nuclei, and antiprotons) will also be accelerated, leading to rises in\nthe boron-to-carbon and antiproton-to-proton ratios.

As has been\nnoted previously, an incorrect assumption about the helium abundance will lead\nto an error in the iron abundance determined from X-ray spectroscopy.

An\nincorrectly assumed helium abundance will also lead to a systematic error in\nangular distance measurements based on X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)\nobservations of clusters of galaxies. Its magnitude is further amplified by the\nassociated error in the metal abundance determination, the impact being larger\nat lower ICM temperatures. Overall, a factor of 2-5 error in the helium\nabundance will lead to an ~ 10-25 % error in the angular distance.\n  We solve the full set of Burgers equations for a multi-component intracluster\nplasma to determine the maximal effect of diffusion on the interpretation of\nX-ray and microwave observations of clusters of galaxies. For an isothermal\ncluster, gravitational sedimentation can lead to up to a factor of ~ 5-10\nenhancements of helium and metal abundances in the cluster center on a ~ 3-7\nGyr timescale. In cool-core clusters on the contrary, thermal diffusion can\ncounteract gravitational sedimentation and effectively remove helium and metals\nfrom the cluster inner core.

The HAWC observatory will be\nsensitive to diverse searches for dark matter annihilation, including\nannihilation from extended dark matter sources, the diffuse gamma-ray emission\nfrom dark matter annihilation, and gamma-ray emission from non-luminous dark\nmatter subhalos. Here we consider the HAWC sensitivity to a subset of these\nsources, including dwarf galaxies, the M31 galaxy, the Virgo cluster, and the\nGalactic center. We simulate the HAWC response to gamma rays from these sources\nin several well-motivated dark matter annihilation channels. If no gamma-ray\nexcess is observed, we show the limits HAWC can place on the dark matter\ncross-section from these sources. In particular, in the case of dark matter\nannihilation into gauge bosons, HAWC will be able to detect a narrow range of\ndark matter masses to cross-sections below thermal. HAWC should also be\nsensitive to non-thermal cross-sections for masses up to nearly 1000 TeV.

On time scales from days to\nyears, substantial changes occur in emission line profiles and line strengths.\nOur extensive time-domain spectroscopy suggests that the broad near-IR,\noptical, and far-uv emission lines, centered on the star, originate in a\nturbulent post-shock region and can undergo scattering by the overlying stellar\nwind as well as some absorption from infalling material. Stable absorption\nfeatures appear in H-alpha, apparently caused by an accreting column\nsilhouetted in the stellar wind. Inflow of material onto the star is revealed\nby the near-IR He I 10830A line, and its free-fall velocity correlates\ninversely with the strength of the post-shock emission, consistent with a\ndipole accretion model. However, the predictions of hydrogen line profiles\nbased on accretion stream models are not well-matched by these observations.\nEvidence of an accelerating warm to hot stellar wind is shown by the near-IR He\nI line, and emission profiles of C II, C III, C IV, N V, and O VI.

Abstract: The success of precision cosmology depends not only on accurate observations,\nbut also on the theoretical model - which must be understood to at least the\nsame level of precision. Subtle relativistic effects can lead to biased\nmeasurements if they are neglected. One such effect gives a systematic shift in\nthe distance-redshift relation away from its background value, due to the non-\nlinear relativistic conservation of total photon flux. We also show directly\nhow this shift follows from a fully relativistic analysis of the geodesic\ndeviation equation. We derive the expectation value of the shift using\nsecond-order perturbations about a concordance background, and show that the\ndistance to last scattering is increased by 1%. We argue that neglecting this\nshift could lead to a significant bias in the background cosmological\nparameters, because it alters the meaning of the background model. A naive\nadjustment of CMB parameter estimation if this shift is really a correction to\nthe background would raise the H0 value inferred from the CMB by 5%,\npotentially removing the tension with local measurements of H0. Other CMB\nparameters which depend on the distance would also be shifted by ~1sigma when\ncombined with local H0 data.

The variability may arise from different\ncomponents of the quasar or may even originate from a jet.

Using recent determinations of the rate of GRBs, their\nluminosity function and properties of their host galaxies, we estimate the\nprobability that a life-threatening (lethal) GRB would take place. Amongst the\ndifferent kinds of GRBs, long ones are most dangerous. There is a very good\nchance (but no certainty) that at least one lethal GRB took place during the\npast 5 Gyr close enough to Earth as to significantly damage life. There is a\n50% chance that such a lethal GRB took place during the last 500 Myr causing\none of the major mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of\nradiation would be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore\nthe potential effects of GRBs to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the Universe.\nWe find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much larger in the inner Milky\nWay (95% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic center), making it\ninhospitable to life. Only at the outskirts of the Milky Way, at more than 10\nkpc from the galactic center, this probability drops below 50%.

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

Recently published shearing box simulations\nindicate that Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect all\nplay important roles in disk evolution. In the presence of a vertical magnetic\nfield, the disk remains laminar between 1-5au, and a magnetocentrifugal disk\nwind forms that provides an important mechanism for removing angular momentum.\nQuestions remain, however, about the establishment of a true physical wind\nsolution in the shearing box simulations because of the symmetries inherent in\nthe local approximation. We present global MHD simulations of protoplanetary\ndisks that include Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, where the\ntime-dependent gas-phase electron and ion fractions are computed under FUV and\nX-ray ionization with a simplified recombination chemistry. Our results show\nthat the disk remains laminar, and that a physical wind solution arises\nnaturally in global disk models. The wind is sufficiently efficient to explain\nthe observed accretion rates. Furthermore, the ionization fraction at\nintermediate disk heights is large enough for magneto-rotational channel modes\nto grow and subsequently develop into belts of horizontal field. Depending on\nthe ionization fraction, these can remain quasi-global, or break-up into\ndiscrete islands of coherent field polarity. The disk models we present here\nshow a dramatic departure from our earlier models including Ohmic resistivity\nonly. It will be important to examine how the Hall effect modifies the\nevolution, and to explore the influence this has on the observational\nappearance of such systems, and on planet formation and migration. \n\n"}

In this work, we use 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the\nonset of condensation in idealized galaxy-cluster cores. In particular, we look\nat how the condensation process depends on the ratio of cooling time to\nfreefall time and on the geometry of the gravitational potential. We conclude\nthat the ICM can always evolve to a state in which condensation occurs if given\nenough time, but that an initial timescale ratio tcool /tff < 10 is needed for\nthermal instability to grow quickly enough to affect realistic cluster cores\nwithin a timescale that is relevant for cosmological structure formation.

The situation becomes\ndifferent for a>0.9, in which case the resonant eigenfrequencies rapidly\ndecrease as the torus thickness increases. We conclude that the assumed\nnon-geodesic effects shift the lower limit of the spin, implied for the three\nmicroquasars by the epicyclic model and independently measured masses, from\na~0.7 to a~0.6. Their consideration furthermore confirms compatibility of the\nmodel with the rapid spin of GRS 1915+105 and provides highly testable\npredictions of the QPO frequencies. Individual sources with a moderate spin\n(a<0.9) should exhibit a smaller spread of the measured 3:2 QPO frequencies\nthan sources with a near-extreme spin (a~1).

When expanded up\nto a given order, this transformation reproduces the standard Eulerian\nPerturbation Theory (SPT) at the same order.

These terms\nexplicitly resum long wavelength motions, thus making the resulting density\nfield better correlated with the true non-linear density field. As a result,\nthe regime of validity of this approach is expected to extend that of the\nEulerian EFT, and match that of the IR-resummed Eulerian EFT.

Abstract: Collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) have recently been invoked as a possible\nmechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which\nis largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in\nany observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun\nBHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates.

If the energy scale of inflation is as high as the GUT scale,\ninflationary quantum fluctuations of the Higgs field can easily destabilize the\nstandard electroweak vacuum and produce a lot of AdS domains. This\ndestabilization during inflation can be avoided if a relatively large\nnonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling is introduced. Such\ncouplings generate a large effective mass term for the Higgs, which can raise\nthe effective Higgs potential and suppress the vacuum fluctuation of the Higgs\nfield. After primordial inflation, however, such effective masses drops rapidly\nand the nonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling can cause large\nfluctuations of the Higgs field to be generated via parametric resonance, thus\nproducing AdS domains in the preheating stage. Furthermore, thermal\nfluctuations of the Higgs field cannot be neglected in the proceeding reheating\nepoch.

The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes. \n\n"}

Between 2007 and 2015 it was the prime provider of\ncomplementary multi-frequency monitoring in the radio regime. We quantify the\nradio variability of gamma-ray blazars. We investigate its dependence on source\nclass and examine whether the radio variability is related to the gamma-ray\nloudness. Finally, we assess the validity of a putative correlation between the\ntwo bands. The F-GAMMA monitored monthly a sample of about 60 sources at up to\ntwelve radio frequencies between 2.64 and 228.39 GHz. We perform a time series\nanalysis on the first 2.5-year dataset to obtain variability parameters. A\nmaximum likelihood analysis is used to assess the significance of a correlation\nbetween radio and gamma-ray fluxes. We present light curves and spectra\n(coherent within ten days) obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m and IRAM 30-m\ntelescopes. All sources are variable across all frequency bands with amplitudes\nincreasing with frequency up to rest frame frequencies of around 60 - 80 GHz as\nexpected by shock-in-jet models. Compared to FSRQs, BL Lacs show systematically\nlower variability amplitudes, brightness temperatures and Doppler factors at\nlower frequencies, while the difference vanishes towards higher ones. The time\nscales appear similar for the two classes. The distribution of spectral indices\nappears flatter or more inverted at higher frequencies for BL Lacs.

To account for the observed millisecond pulses caused by scatter\nbroadening, we examine a variety of possible models of electron density\nfluctuations in both the IGM and the host galaxy medium. We find that a\nshort-wave-dominated power-law spectrum of density, which may arise in highly\nsupersonic turbulence with pronounced local dense structures of\nshock-compressed gas in the host interstellar medium (ISM), can produce the\nrequired density enhancements at sufficiently small scales to interpret the\nscattering timescale of FRBs. It implies that an FRB residing in a galaxy with\nefficient star formation in action tends to have a broadened pulse. The scaling\nof the scattering time with dispersion measure (DM) in the host galaxy varies\nin different turbulence and scattering regimes. The host galaxy can be the\nmajor origin of scatter broadening, but contribute to a small fraction of the\ntotal DM.

Adopting event rates from the literature, we aim\nto establish general trends in the redshift evolution of the TDE number counts\nand their observable signals.

The same binary population\nwill also provide gravitational wave sources for eLISA. In addition, we find\nthat the shape of the X-ray luminosity function of TDEs strongly depends on the\noccupancy of IMBHs and could be used to constrain scenarios of SMBH formation.\nFinally, we make predictions for the expected number of TDEs observed by future\nX-ray telescopes as a function of their sensitivity limits.

Dissipative\neffects such as heat conduction and viscosity can be important in a\ncollisionless plasma and will potentially alter the dynamics and radiative\nproperties of the flow from that in ideal fluid models; we refer to models that\ninclude these processes as Extended GRMHD.

Once accelerated by a jet,\nlow-energy cosmic rays confined in the radio lobe are adiabatically cooled;\nhigher-energy cosmic rays leaving the source interact with the magnetized\ncluster environment and produce neutrinos and gamma rays; the highest-energy\nparticles escape from the host cluster and contribute to the observed cosmic\nrays above 100 PeV.

We want to quantitatively establish that the 60Fe\nenhancement is the result of several supernovae which are also responsible for\nthe formation of the Local Bubble, our Galactic habitat. We performed\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations (with\nresolutions down to subparsec scale) of the Local Bubble and the neighbouring\nLoop I superbubble in different homogeneous, self-gravitating environments. For\nsetting up the Local and Loop I superbubble, we took into account the time\nsequence and locations of the generating core-collapse supernova explosions,\nwhich were derived from the mass spectrum of the perished members of certain\nstellar moving groups. The release of 60Fe and its subsequent turbulent mixing\nprocess inside the superbubble cavities was followed via passive scalars, where\nthe yields of the decaying radioisotope were adjusted according to recent\nstellar evolution calculations. The models are able to reproduce both the\ntiming and the intensity of the 60Fe excess observed with rather high\nprecision, provided that the external density does not exceed 0.3 cm-3 on\naverage.

The competitive\naccretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars\nshould sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars. \n\n"}

As the inner disc precesses, the misalignment angle\nbetween the inner and outer discs varies by more than $100^\\circ$. Different\nsnapshots of the evolution are post-processed with a radiative transfer code,\nin order to produce observational diagnostics of the process. Even though the\nsimulation was produced for the specific case of a circumbinary disc, most of\nthe observational predictions hold for any disc hosting a precessing inner rim.\nSynthetic scattered light observations show strong azimuthal asymmetries, where\nthe pattern depends strongly on the misalignment angle between inner and outer\ndisc.

Such a MAD state is unstable to\nthe magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, which itself leads to vigorous\nturbulence and the emergence of low-density highly-magnetized bubbles. This\ninstability was studied in a thin (ratio of half-height H to radius R, $H/R\n\\approx 0.1$) MAD simulation, where it has a more dramatic effect on the\ndynamics of the disk than for thicker disks.

However, the merger environment is polluted by\ndynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine\nthis by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that\nthe ejecta appears about 1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star\nbecomes the maximum. Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal\ncan reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be\nexplained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may\nleave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the\norigin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102.

The shock wave is expected to possess enough strength to ignite\nthe nuclear matter thereby converting it to quark matter. The conversion of\nnuclear to quark matter is assumed to take place at the shock discontinuity.\nThe density and pressure discontinuity is studied both spatially and temporally\nas it starts near the center of the star and moves towards the surface.\nPolytropic equations of state which mimics real original nuclear matter and\nquark matter equations of state are used to study such dynamical phase\ntransition. Solving relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a spherically\nsymmetric star we have studied the phase transition assuming a considerable\ndensity discontinuity near the center. We find that as the shock wave\npropagates outwards, its intensity decreases with time, however the shock\nvelocity peaks up and reaches a value close to that of light. Such fast shock\nvelocity indicates rapid phase transition in neutron star taking place on a\ntimescale of some tens of microseconds. Such a result is quite an interesting\none, and it differs from previous calculations that the phase transition in\nneutron stars takes at least some tens of milliseconds. Rapid phase transition\ncan have significant observational significance because such fast phase\ntransition would imply quite strong gravitational wave signals but very short\nlived. Such short-lived gravitational wave signals would be accompanied with\nshort-lived gamma-ray bursts and neutrino signals originating from the neutrino\nand gamma-ray generation from the phase transition of nuclear matter to quark\nmatter. \n\n"}

Here, we\nanalyze DQ Tau's light curves obtained by Kepler K2, the Spitzer Space\nTelescope, and ground-based facilities. We observed variability phenomena,\nincluding rotational modulation by stellar spots, brief brightening events due\nto stellar flares, long brightening events around periastron due to increased\naccretion, and short dips due to brief circumstellar obscuration. The\nrotational modulation appears as sinusoidal variation with a period of 3.017 d.\nIn our model this is caused by extended stellar spots 400 K colder than the\nstellar effective temperature. During our 80-day-long monitoring we detected 40\nstellar flares with energies up to 1.2$\\times$10$^{35}$ erg and duration of a\nfew hours. The flare profiles closely resemble those in older late-type stars,\nand their occurrence does not correlate with either the rotational or the\norbital period.

We present an improved postprocessing framework to estimate the\nabundance of atomic and molecular hydrogen and apply it to the IllustrisTNG\nsimulations. We compare five different models for the atomic-to-molecular\ntransition, including empirical, simulation-based, and theoretical\nprescriptions. Most of these models rely on the surface density of neutral\nhydrogen and the ultraviolet (UV) flux in the Lyman-Werner band as input\nparameters. Computing these quantities on the kiloparsec scales resolved by the\nsimulations emerges as the main challenge. We show that the commonly used Jeans\nlength approximation to the column density of a system can be biased and\nexhibits large cell-to-cell scatter. Instead, we propose to compute all surface\nquantities in face-on projections and perform the modeling in two dimensions.\nIn general, the two methods agree on average, but their predictions diverge for\nindividual galaxies and for models based on the observed midplane pressure of\ngalaxies. We model the UV radiation from young stars by assuming a constant\nescape fraction and optically thin propagation throughout the galaxy.

Therefore studies with simulated galaxy clusters have flourished.\nHowever detailed comparisons between simulated and observed clusters and their\npopulation - the galaxies - are complicated by the diversity of clusters and\ntheir surrounding environment. An original way initiated by Bertschinger as\nearly as 1987, to legitimize the one-to-one comparison exercise down to the\ndetails, is to produce simulations constrained to resemble the cluster under\nstudy within its large scale environment. Subsequently several methods have\nemerged to produce simulations that look like the local Universe. This paper\nhighlights one of these methods and its essential steps to get simulations that\nnot only resemble the local Large Scale Structure but also that host the local\nclusters. It includes a new modeling of the radial peculiar velocity\nuncertainties to remove the observed correlation between the decreases of the\nsimulated cluster masses and of the amount of data used as constraints with the\ndistance from us. This method has the particularity to use solely radial\npeculiar velocities as constraints: no additional density constraints are\nrequired to get local cluster simulacra. The new resulting simulations host\ndark matter halos that match the most prominent local clusters such as Coma.\nZoom-in simulations of the latter and of a volume larger than the 30 Mpc/h\nradius inner sphere become now possible to study local clusters and their\neffects.

The radio and X-ray afterglows of GW170817 exhibited delayed\nonset, a gradual rise in the emission with time as t^0.8, a peak at about 150\ndays post-merger, followed by a relatively rapid decline. To date, various\nmodels have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a\nchoked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However,\nthe observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817\nlaunched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817\nexhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger.\nThis measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that,\nwhile the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow\n(cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and\nnarrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of <5 degrees, and observed from\na viewing angle of about 20 degrees.

Abstract: We present deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for a field along the outer\ndisk of M31 based on archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary\nCamera 2 observations in the F555W (~V) and F814W (~I) filters. The CMDs, which\ncontain a total of about 50,000 stars, feature a prominent red giant branch\n(RGB) along with a significant population of helium burning red clump stars.

Once convection has attained a statistically\nstationary state, a magnetic field is introduced. The magnetic field is\nsubsequently modified by the convective motions, and the resulting pumping\neffects are isolated by calculating various coefficients of the expansion of\nthe electromotive force, uxb, in terms of components of the mean magnetic\nfield. The dependence of the pumping effects on rotation, latitude and other\nparameters is studied. First numerical evidence is found for the existence of\npumping effects in the horizontal directions, unless the rotation axis\ncoincides with the vertical axis, as is the case on the poles. Evidence is\nfound that the pumping effects act differently on different components of the\nmean magnetic field.

Longitudinal pumping is mainly\nretrograde for the radial field but prograde for the latitudinal field.

The distances, mean reddening values,\nand age distributions of the stars in these regions were measured using the\nroutines of Dolphin (1997, 2002).

A slight distance\ngradient is seen across the major axis of the southern disk, and a mean\ndistance of 24.47+/-0.03 is found by combining the results. Higher mean\nreddening values follow the spiral structure. The stellar age distributions are\nconsistent with episodic star formation confined mainly to the gas-rich arm\nregions.

This has important implications for the study of thermal structures in\nclusters, especially when strong temperature gradients, like shock fronts, are\npresent. Because of this bias, in real observations shock fronts appear much\nweaker than what is predicted by emission-weighted temperature maps, and may\neven not be detected. This may explain why, although numerical simulations\npredict that shock fronts are a quite common feature in clusters of galaxies,\nto date there are very few observations of objects in which they are clearly\nseen. To fix this problem we propose a new formula, the spectroscopic-like\ntemperature function, and show that, for temperature larger than 3 keV, it\napproximates the spectroscopic temperature better than few per cent, making\nsimulations more directly comparable to observations. \n\n"}

We find that in the\nearly sinking the black holes lose memory of their initial orbital eccentricity\nif they co-rotate with the gaseous disc, forming a binary with a low\neccentricity, consistent with zero within our numerical resolution limit. The\ncause of circularization resides in the rotation present in the gaseous\nbackground where dynamical friction operates. Circularization may hinder\ngravitational waves from taking over and leading the binary to coalescence. In\nthe case of counter-rotating orbits the initial eccentricity does not decrease,\nand the black holes may bind forming an eccentric binary. When dynamical\nfriction has subsided, for equal mass black holes and regardless their initial\neccentricity, angular momentum loss, driven by the gravitational torque exerted\non the binary by surrounding gas, is nevertheless observable down to the\nsmallest scale probed. In the case of unequal masses, dynamical friction\nremains efficient down to our resolution limit, and there is no sign of\nformation of any ellipsoidal gas distribution that may further harden the\nbinary.

In contrast, galaxies with >10^11 solar masses z~0.3-0.75 have\nspecific SFRs less than the global average, and more than an order of magnitude\nlower than that for massive DRGs at z~1.5-3. Thus, the bulk of star formation\nin massive galaxies is largely complete by z~1.5. The red colors and large\ninferred stellar masses in the DRGs suggest that much of the star formation in\nthese galaxies occurred at redshifts z>5-6. Using model star-formation\nhistories that match the DRG colors and stellar masses at z~2-3, and\nmeasurements of the UV luminosity density at z>5-6, we consider what\nconstraints exist on the stellar initial mass function in the progenitors of\nthe massive DRGs at z~2-3. \n\n"}

We find sub-solar ratios of [Fe/H] and overabundances of [alpha/Fe],\n[La/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]. All abundance ratios exhibit a dispersion that exceeds\nthe measurement uncertainties. As seen in our previous studies of old open\nclusters and field giants, enhanced ratios of [alpha/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] reveal\nthat recent star formation has taken place in the outer disk.\n  The outer disk Cepheids appear to exhibit a bimodal distribution for [Fe/H]\nand [alpha/Fe]. Most of the Cepheids continue the trends with Galactocentric\ndistance exhibited by Andrievsky's larger Cepheid sample and we refer to these\nstars as the \"Galactic Cepheids\". A minority of the Cepheids show considerably\nlower [Fe/H] and higher [alpha/Fe] and we refer to these stars as the \"Merger\nCepheids\". One signature of a merger event would be composition differences\nbetween the \"Galactic\" and \"Merger\" Cepheids. The Cepheids satisfy this\nrequirement and we speculate that the distinct compositions suggest that the\n\"Merger Cepheids\" may have formed under the influence of significant merger or\naccretion events.

We have determined that seeing itself\ncan be responsible for correlated 5% variations in the light-curves of A and B.\nWe have found, however, that these effects can be accurately removed, by\nsubtracting the light from the lens galaxy, and by correcting for cross\ncontamination of light between the closely juxtaposed A and B images. We find\nthat these corrections improve the variations due to seeing from 5% to a level\nonly marginally detectable over photon shot noise (0.5%). \n\n"}

The model is the ghost condensate with the global shift symmetry\nsoftly broken by a potential. We show that this system can drive a cosmological\nexpansion with dH/dt > 0. Demanding the absence of instabilities in this model\nrequires dH/dt <~ H^2. We then construct a general low-energy effective theory\nthat describes scalar fluctuations about an arbitrary FRW background, and argue\nthat the qualitative features found in our model are very general for stable\nsystems that violate the NEC. Violating the NEC allows dramatically\nnon-standard cosmological histories. To illustrate this, we construct an\nexplicit model in which the expansion of our universe originates from an\nasymptotically flat state in the past, smoothing out the big-bang singularity\nwithin control of a low-energy effective theory. This gives an interesting\nalternative to standard inflation for solving the horizon problem. We also\nconstruct models in which the present acceleration has w < -1; a periodic\never-expanding universe and a model with a smooth ``bounce'' connecting a\ncontracting and expanding phase. \n\n"}

The binary test is effective for highly chaotic\nHamiltonian systems and orbits on a strange attractor and is particularly\nuseful as a marker of the transition from regularity to chaos.

{"id": "physics/0509118", "contents": "Title: Why dynamos are prone to reversals Abstract: In a recent paper (Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005), 184506; physics/0411050) it\nwas shown that a simple mean-field dynamo model with a spherically symmetric\nhelical turbulence parameter alpha can exhibit a number of features which are\ntypical for Earth's magnetic field reversals. In particular, the model produces\nasymmetric reversals, a positive correlation of field strength and interval\nlength, and a bimodal field distribution. All these features are attributable\nto the magnetic field dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional point of the\nspectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo operator. The negative slope of the\ngrowth rate curve between the nearby local maximum and the exceptional point\nmakes the system unstable and drives it to the exceptional point and beyond\ninto the oscillatory branch where the sign change happens. A weakness of this\nreversal model is the apparent necessity to fine-tune the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber and/or the radial profile of alpha. In the present paper, it is shown\nthat this fine-tuning is not necessary in the case of higher supercriticality\nof the dynamo. Numerical examples and physical arguments are compiled to show\nthat, with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, there is strong tendency for\nthe exceptional point and the associated local maximum to move close to the\nzero growth rate line. Although exemplified again by the spherically symmetric\nalpha^2 dynamo model, the main idea of this ''self-tuning'' mechanism of\nsaturated dynamos into a reversal-prone state seems well transferable to other\ndynamos. As a consequence, reversing dynamos might be much more typical and may\noccur much more frequently in nature than what could be expected from a purely\nkinematic perspective. \n\n"}
