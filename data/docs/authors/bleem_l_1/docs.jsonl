This effect needs to be\ndisentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology.

Finally, each\nindividual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on its\ncharacteristic luminosity, and the other based on its characteristic stellar\nmass.

These are among the most distant\nsubmillimeter-selected galaxies reliably identified through CO emission and\nalso some of the most luminous known. In terms of CO to bolometric\nluminosities, stellar mass and star formation rates (SFRs), these newly\ndiscovered z>4 SMGs are similar to z~1.5-3 SMGs studied to date. These z~4 SMGs\nhave much higher specific SFRs than typical B-band dropout Lyman break galaxies\nat the same redshift. The stellar mass-SFR correlation for normal galaxies does\nnot seem to evolve much further, between z~2 and z~4. A significant z=4.05\nspectroscopic redshift spike is observed in GOODS-N, and a strong spatial\noverdensity of B-band dropouts and IRAC selected z>3.5 galaxies appears to be\ncentered on the GN20 and GN20.2 galaxies.

We characterize bars and their host\ngalaxies and look for relations between the presence of a bar and the\nproperties of the underlying disk. We investigate whether the fraction and\nproperties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in the\nfield. The total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (median\nz=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). For the\ncluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,\nrespectively. We find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in the\nfield and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the bar\nfraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%).

We show that the\nbolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of\n~1000 Msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN) in this galaxy. Thus it has characteristics similar to those of\nz~2 submm galaxies (SMGs), with a mix of starburst and obscured AGN signatures.\nThis demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restricted\nto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) QSOs at z~5, but was also\noccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the Universe was less than\n10% of its current age. Assuming that we are seeing the major phase of star\nformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as a\nluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the space\ndensity of z>4 SMGs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous red\ngalaxy population at these early times. However, this leaves open the\npossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but more\nextended star formation events. If the progenitors of all of the luminous red\ngalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z>4 then the required\nvolume density of z>4 SMGs will exceed that predicted by current galaxy\nformation models by more than an order of magnitude. \n\n"}

Simple arguments show that the location of the\nlength-scale r_c, marking the transition from positive to negative\ncorrelations, is the same for any class of objects as for the full matter\ndistribution, i.e. it is invariant under biasing.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

Many\nprevious studies have investigated this topic, particularly in relation to the\nnon-linear regime of structure formation. However, no careful pre-selection of\nviable quintessence models with high precision cosmological data was performed.\nHere we show that this has led to a misinterpretation (and underestimation) of\nthe imprint of quintessence on the distribution of large scale structures. To\nthis purpose we perform a likelihood analysis of the combined Supernova Ia\nUNION dataset and WMAP5-years data to identify realistic quintessence models.\nDifferences from the vanilla LambdaCDM are especially manifest in the predicted\namplitude and shape of the linear matter power spectrum, though these remain\nwithin the uncertainties of the SDSS data. We use these models as benchmark for\nstudying the clustering properties of dark matter halos by performing a series\nof high resolution N-body simulations.

Roughly half\nthe data was taken through the Keck iodine cell which contains thousands of\nwell calibrated iodine lines. Using these iodine exposures to calibrate the\nnormal Th-Ar Keck data pipeline output we found absolute wavelength offsets of\n500 m/s to 1000 m/s with drifts of more than 500 m/s over a single night, and\ndrifts of nearly 2000 m/s over several nights. These offsets correspond to an\nabsolute redshift of uncertainty of about Delta z=10^{-5} (Delta lambda= 0.02\nAng), with daily drifts of around Delta z=5x10^{-6} (Delta lambda =0.01 Ang),\nand multiday drifts of nearly Delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 Ang). The causes of the\nwavelength offsets are not known, but since claimed shifts in the fine\nstructure constant would result in velocity shifts of less than 100 m/s, this\nlevel of systematic uncertainty makes may make it difficult to use Keck HIRES\ndata to constrain the change in the fine structure constant.

Assuming that the initial BH seeds are relatively massive, of the\norder of 10^5 Msun, and that seeding occurs around z~15 in dark matter haloes\nof mass 10^9-10^10 Msun, we find that it is possible to build up supermassive\nBHs (SMBHs) by z=6 that assemble most of their mass during extended\nEddington-limited accretion periods. The properties of the simulated SMBHs are\nconsistent with observations of z=6 quasars in terms of the estimated BH masses\nand bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within the\nhost halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions of\nthe host galaxy.

Generically,\nwe find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high\nredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as\nit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas\nexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher\nredshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and\nto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height\nof the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the\npresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole\nfeedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both\nboost the SF rate at late times.

Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF\nlaw.

Self-regulated feedback from accreting\nblack holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate\nbelow redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the\nform of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help. \n\n"}

Starting from $\\sim$ 7000 active galaxies\nin SDSS DR7, we assemble a sample of 87 type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [O\nIII]5007, profiles. The nuclear obscuration in the type 2 AGNs allows us to\ndetermine redshifts of host galaxies through stellar absorption lines. We\ntypically find that one peak is redshifted and another is blueshifted relative\nto the host galaxy. We find a strong correlation between the ratios of the\nshifts and the double peak fluxes. The correlation can be naturally explained\nby the Keplerian relation predicted by models of co-rotating dual AGNs. The\ncurrent sample statistically favors that most of the [O III] double-peaked\nsources are dual AGNs and disfavors other explanations, such as rotating disk\nand outflows. These dual AGNs have a separation distance at $\\sim 1$ kpc scale,\nshowing an intermediate phase of merging systems. The appearance of dual AGNs\nis about $\\sim 10^{-2}$, impacting on the current observational deficit of\nbinary supermassive black holes with a probability of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ (Boroson &\nLauer). \n\n"}

We also quantify how estimates of the fraction\nof `early' or `late' type galaxies depend on whether the samples were cut in\ncolor, concentration or light profile shape, and compare with similar estimates\nbased on morphology. Our fits show that Es account for about 20% of the r-band\nluminosity density, rho_Lr, and 25% of the stellar mass density, rho_*;\nincluding S0s and Sas increases these numbers to 33% and 40%, and 50% and 60%,\nrespectively. Summed over all galaxy types, we find rho_* ~ 3 * 10^8 M_Sun\nMpc^{-3} at z ~ 0. This is in good agreement with expectations based on\nintegrating the star formation history. However, compared to most previous\nwork, we find an excess of objects at large masses, up to a factor of ~ 10 at\nM_* ~ 5*10^{11} M_Sun. The stellar mass density further increases at large\nmasses if we assume different IMFs for Es and spiral galaxies, as suggested by\nsome recent chemical evolution models, and results in a better agreement with\nthe dynamical mass function. We also show that the trend for ellipticity to\ndecrease with luminosity is primarily because the E/S0 ratio increases at large\nL. However, the most massive galaxies, M_* > 5 * 10^{11} M_Sun, are less\nconcentrated and not as round as expected if one extrapolates from lower L, and\nthey are not well-fit by pure deVaucouleur laws. This suggests formation\nhistories with recent radial mergers. Finally, we show that the age-size\nrelation is flat for Es of fixed dynamical mass, but, at fixed M_dyn, S0s and\nSas with large sizes tend to be younger. Explaining this difference between E\nand S0 formation is a new challenge for models of early-type galaxy formation. \n\n"}

We performed a weak lensing analysis of the z=0.288 cluster Abell 611 on\ng-band data obtained by the blue-optimized Large Binocular Camera in order to\nestimate the cluster mass.\n  Methods. Due to the complexity of the PSF of LBC, we decided to use two\ndifferent approaches, KSB and Shapelets, to measure the shape of background\ngalaxies and to derive the shear signal produced by the cluster.

The combination of the large aperture of the telescope and the wide\nfield of view allowed us to map a region well beyond the expected virial radius\nof the cluster and to get a high surface density of background galaxies (23\ngalaxies/arcmin^2).

In particular, we focus\non the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central\ngalaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes\nthan blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar\nmass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and\nblue centrals, especially for M* $\\lsim$ 10^{10.5} h^{-2} Msun.

Assuming that the clusters have secure redshift estimates, we\nshow that the joint experiment enables a self-calibration of important\nsystematic errors including the source redshift uncertainty and the cluster\nmass-observable relation, by adopting a single population of background source\ngalaxies for the lensing analysis. It allows us to use the relative strengths\nof stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating the\nsource redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements of\nthe mean cluster mass in each bin. In addition, our formulation of stacked\nlensing signals in Fourier space simplifies the Fisher matrix calculations, as\nwell as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the most\nsignificant uncertainty in stacked lensing. We show that upcoming wide-field\nsurveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including dark\nenergy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that model\nsystematic uncertainties. Specifically, the stacked lensing information\nimproves the dark energy FoM by a factor of 4, compared to that from the\ncluster observables alone. The primordial non-Gaussianity parameter can also be\nconstrained with a level of f_NL~10. In this method, the mean source redshift\nis well calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1 in redshift, and the mean cluster mass\nin each bin to 5-10% accuracies, which demonstrates the success of the\nself-calibration of systematic uncertainties from the joint experiment.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

This is achieved by promoting the CC\nfrom a parameter which must to specified, to a field which can take many\npossible values. The observed value of Lambda ~ 1/(9.3 Gyrs)^2$ (approximately\n10^(-120) in Planck units) is determined by a new constraint equation which\nfollows from the application of a causally restricted variation principle.

The observed CC value,\nwhich we successfully predict, is typical within our model even before the\neffects of anthropic selection are included.

In order to identify those galaxy\nproperties that are causally connected with HI content, we compare results\nderived for the HI sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellar\nmass, size and NUV-$r$ colour.

One of\nthe key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic\noscillations in the distribution of Ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of a\nsample of ~150,000 z>2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter\ndistance at z\\approx2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the\nexpansion rate of the Universe at z > 2. One of the biggest challenges in\nachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over\n2.2 < z < 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. During the first year\nof the BOSS survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and tested\nto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in this\nredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. To achieve these surface densities,\nthe magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g <= 22.0 or r<=21.85.\nWhile detection of the BAO signature in the Ly-alpha absorption in quasar\nspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysical\nstudies do. We therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targets\ndeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%.

This modification of transport processes is of vital importance for\na wide variety of astrophysical processes including cosmic ray transport,\ntransfer of heavy elements in the interstellar medium, star formation etc.\nDealing with these processes one should keep in mind that in realistic\nastrophysical conditions magnetized fluids are turbulent. In this review we\nsingle out a single transport process, namely, heat transfer and consider how\nit occurs in the presence of the magnetized turbulence. We show that the\nability of magnetic field lines to constantly change topology and connectivity\nis at the heart of the correct description of the 3D magnetic field\nstochasticity in turbulent fluids. This ability is ensured by fast magnetic\nreconnection in turbulent fluids and puts forward the concept of reconnection\ndiffusion at the core of the physical picture of heat transfer in astrophysical\nplasmas. Appealing to reconnection diffusion we describe the ability of plasma\nto diffuse between different magnetized eddies explaining the advection of the\nheat by turbulence. Adopting the structure of magnetic field that follows from\nthe modern understanding of MHD turbulence, we also discuss thermal\nconductivity that arises as electrons stream along stochastic magnetic field\nlines.

In this model, gravitationally\nbound cores form uniformly in the clump following a prescribed core formation\nefficiency per unit time. After a contraction timescale which is equal to a few\ntimes their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and populate the\nIMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account in the form\nof stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective energy of the winds to the\ngravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is removed from the clump\nand core and star formation are quenched. The power of the radiation driven\nwinds has a strong dependence on metallicity and it increases with increasing\nmetallicity. Thus, winds from stars in the high metallicity models lead to a\nrapid evacuation of the gas from the protocluster clump and to a reduced star\nformation efficiency, as compared to their low metallicity counterparts. We\nderive the metallicity dependent star formation efficiency per unit time in\nthis model as a function of the gas surface density Sigma_g.

The elevated temperatures may therefore\nrepresent evidence for the earliest stages of He-II reionisation in the most\nbiased regions of the high-redshift Universe.

Starting with a galaxy mass, formation\nredshift, and adopting a particular form for the star formation rate, we\ndescribe the evolution of the stellar populations in the galaxy, the evolution\nof the metallicity and chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nthe propagation of the galactic wind, and the metal-enrichment of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind.

Such a term could also be\npresent in Lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidal\nfield. We measure the corresponding coupling strengths from the\nmatter-matter-halo bispectrum in numerical simulations and find a non-vanishing\ncoefficient for the tidal tensor term. We find no scale dependence of the bias\nparameters up to k=0.1 h/Mpc and that the tidal effect is increasing with halo\nmass. While the Lagrangian bias picture is a better description of our results\nthan the Eulerian bias picture, our results suggest that there might be a tidal\ntensor bias already in the initial conditions. We also find that the\ncoefficients of the quadratic density term deviate quite strongly from the\ntheoretical predictions based on the spherical collapse model and a universal\nmass function. Both quadratic density and tidal tensor bias terms must be\nincluded in the modeling of galaxy clustering of current and future surveys if\none wants to achieve the high precision cosmology promise of these datasets. \n\n"}

We carefully study the effect of metal\nabsorption lines on the shape of the PDF.

Abstract: While the existence of a starburst-AGN connection is undisputed, there is no\nconsensus on what the connection is. In this contribution, we begin by noting\nthat the mechanisms which drive gas inwards in disk galaxies are generally\ninefficient at removing angular momentum, leading to stalled inflows. Thus, a\ntiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest\nscales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN.\nSimilarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important\nto discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation. In this\ncontribution, we show that stellar feedback on scales of tens of parsecs plays\na critical role in first hindering and then helping accretion. We argue that it\nis only after the initial turbulent phases of a starburst that gas from slow\nstellar winds can accrete efficiently to smaller scales. This would imply that\nthe properties of the obscuring torus are directly coupled to star formation\nand that the torus must be a complex dynamical entity.

Dark matter occupies a three-dimensional\n'sheet' of free- fall observers, non-intersecting in six-dimensional\nvelocity-position phase space. At early times, the sheet was flat like an\norigami sheet, i.e. velocities were essentially zero, but as time passes, the\nsheet folds up to form cosmic structure. The present paper further illustrates\nthis analogy, and clarifies a Lagrangian definition of caustics and streams:\ncaustics are two-dimensional surfaces in this initial sheet along which it\nfolds, tessellating Lagrangian space into a set of three-dimensional regions,\ni.e. streams. The main scientific result of the paper is that streams may be\ncolored by only two colors, with no two neighbouring streams (i.e. streams on\neither side of a caustic surface) colored the same. The two colors correspond\nto positive and negative parities of local Lagrangian volumes. This is a severe\nrestriction on the connectivity and therefore arrangement of streams in\nLagrangian space, since arbitrarily many colors can be necessary to color a\ngeneral arrangement of three-dimensional regions. This stream two-colorability\nhas consequences from graph theory, which we explain. Then, using N-body\nsimulations, we test how these caustics correspond in Lagrangian space to the\nboundaries of haloes, filaments and walls. We also test how well outer caustics\ncorrespond to a Zel'dovich-approximation prediction. \n\n"}

We present a high-resolution MHD simulation of\ngas sloshing in a galaxy cluster coupled with subgrid simulations of\nrelativistic electron acceleration to test this hypothesis. Our simulation\nshows that the sloshing motions generate turbulence on the order of $\\delta{v}\n\\sim$ 50-200 km s$^{-1}$ on spatial scales of $\\sim$50-100 kpc and below in the\ncool core region within the envelope of the sloshing cold fronts, whereas\noutside the cold fronts, there is negligible turbulence. This turbulence is\npotentially strong enough to reaccelerate relativistic electron seeds (with\ninitial $\\gamma \\sim 100-500$) to $\\gamma \\sim 10^4$ via damping of\nmagnetosonic waves and non-resonant compression.

In this paper we focus on the influence of migration\nhalting mechanisms, including migration \"dead zones\", and inner truncation by\nthe stellar magnetic field. We show that the stellar accretion rate, stellar\nmagnetic field and the speed of migration in the proto-planetary disk are the\nmain factors affecting the final configuration of KOI-152. Our simulations\nsuggest that three planets may be around a star with low star accretion rate or\nwith high magnetic field. On the other hand, slow type I migration, which\ndecreases to one tenth of the linear analysis results, favors forming the\nconfiguration of KOI-152. Under such formation scenario, the planets in the\nsystem are not massive enough to open gaps in the gas disk. The upper limit of\nthe planetary masses are estimated to be about $15,~19$, and $24 M_\\oplus$,\nrespectively. Our results are also indicative of the near Laplacian\nconfigurations that are quite common in planetary systems. \n\n"}

In order to compare the model to observations, we use the GLIMPSE,\nMIPSGAL, and IRAS surveys to construct total emission spectra, as well as\nlongitude and latitude profiles for the emission. The distribution of stars and\ndust is taken from the SKY model, and the dust emissivities includes an\napproximation of the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in addition\nto thermal emission. The model emission is in broad agreement with the\nobservations, but a few modifications are needed to obtain a good fit. Firstly,\nby adjusting the model to include two major and two minor spiral arms rather\nthan four equal spiral arms, the fit to the longitude profiles for |l|>30\ndegrees can be improved. Secondly, introducing a deficit in the dust\ndistribution in the inner Galaxy results in a better fit to the shape of the\nIRAS longitude profiles at 60 and 100 microns. With these modifications, the\nmodel fits the observed profiles well, although it systematically\nunder-estimates the 5.8 and 8.0 microns fluxes. One way to resolve this\ndiscrepancy is to increase the abundance of PAH molecules by 50% compared to\nthe original model, although we note that changes to the dust distribution or\nradiation field may provide alternative solutions. Finally, we use the model to\nquantify which stellar populations contribute the most to the heating of\ndifferent dust types, and which stellar populations and dust types contribute\nthe most to the emission at different wavelengths. \n\n"}

We find that the fate of such a binary leads\nto the prompt (<1 Myr) formation of a close BH-BH system for the high end of\nthe allowed WR mass (M_WR>13 Msun).

We use a volume-limited sample of galaxies\nwith redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the SDSS DR7 to investigate the scale\ndependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of the\ncentral galaxy. Conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass range\nspanning two orders of magnitude. In central galaxies with masses less than\n10^10 M_sun, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 Mpc, well beyond\nthe virial radii of their dark matter halos. For low mass central galaxies,\nlarge-scale conformity with neighbours is only seen when the centrals have low\nstar formation rate or gas content. In contrast, at high stellar masses,\nconformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearly\nconfined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo of\nthe central galaxy. Our analysis of a mock catalogue from the Guo et al (2011)\nmodels shows that conformity-like effects are much weaker than observed, and\napply only to the low SFR/M* tail of neighbouring galaxies. In the models, the\nmedian and the upper percentiles of the SFR/M* distribution remain almost\nunchanged, which is in contradiction with the data.

Of these we directly detect in X-rays 49 sBzKs in CDFS and 32 sBzKs in\nCDFN. Stacking the undetected sources also reveals a significant X-ray signal.\nInvestigating the X-ray detection rate and stacked flux versus the IR excess\nparameter (i.e. SFRtotal/SFRUV,corr), we find no strong evidence for an\nincreased X-ray detection rate, or a harder X-ray spectrum in IR Excess sBzKs.\nThis is particularly the case when one accounts for the strong correlation\nbetween the IR excess parameter and the bolometric IR luminosity (LIR), e.g.\nwhen controlling for LIR, the IR Non-Excess sBzKs show a detection rate at\nleast as high. While both direct detections and stacking suggest that the AGN\nfraction in sBzK galaxies is high, there is no clear evidence for widespread\nCompton thick activity in either the sBzK population generally, or the IR\nExcess sBzK subsample. The very hard X-ray signal obtained for the latter in\nearlier work was most likely contaminated by a few hard X-ray sources now\ndirectly detected in deeper X-ray data. The X-ray detection fraction of passive\nBzK galaxies in our sample is if anything higher than that of sBZKs, so there\nis no evidence for coeval black hole growth and star formation from X-ray\nanalysis of the BzK populations. Because increased AGN activity in the IR\nexcess population is not indicated by our X-ray analysis, it appears that the\nbulk of the IR Excess sBzK population are luminous star-forming galaxies whose\nSFRs are either overestimated at 24 microns, underestimated in the UV, or both.\nThis conclusion reinforces recent results from Herschel which show similar\neffects. \n\n"}

These\noverdense gas substructures are generally a source of unresolved bias of X-ray\nobservations towards high density gas, but their bright luminosity peaks may be\nresolved sources within the ICM, that deep X-ray exposures may be (already)\ncapable to detect. In this paper we aim at investigating both features, using a\nset of high-resolution cosmological simulations with ENZO. First, we monitor\nhow the bias by unresolved gas clumping may yield incorrect estimates of global\ncluster parameters and affects the measurements of baryon fractions by X-ray\nobservations. We find that based on X-ray observations of narrow radial strips,\nit is difficult to recover the real baryon fraction to better than 10 - 20\npercent uncertainty. Second, we investigated the possibility of observing\nbright X-ray clumps in the nearby Universe (z<=0.3).

Modeling this empirical relation from\nfirst principles proves challenging, however, and many questions regarding its\nproperties remain open. For instance, the exact functional form of the relation\nis still debated and it is also unknown whether it applies at z>4, where CO\nobservations are sparse. Here, we analyze how the shape of the star formation\n-- gas relation affects the cosmic star formation history and global galaxy\nproperties using an analytic model that follows the average evolution of\ngalaxies in dark matter halos across cosmic time. We show that a linear\nrelation with an H2 depletion time of ~2.5 Gyr, as found in studies of nearby\ngalaxies, results in good agreement with current observations of galaxies at\nboth low and high redshift. These observations include the evolution of the\ncosmic star formation rate density, the z~4-9 UV luminosity function, the\nevolution of the mass -- metallicity relation, the relation between stellar and\nhalo mass, and the gas-to-stellar mass ratios of galaxies. In contrast, the\nshort depletion times that result from adopting a highly super-linear star\nformation -- gas relation lead to large star formation rates, substantial metal\nenrichment (~0.1 solar), and low gas-to-stellar mass ratios already at z~10, in\ndisagreement with observations. These results can be understood in terms of an\nequilibrium picture of galaxy evolution in which gas inflows, outflows, and\nstar formation drive the metallicities and gas fractions toward equilibrium\nvalues that are determined by the ratio of the accretion time to the gas\ndepletion time. In this picture, the cosmic modulation of the accretion rate is\nthe primary process that drives the evolution of stellar masses, gas masses,\nand metallicities of galaxies from high redshift until today. \n\n"}

We find\nthat the mean density within the scale radius, r_{-2} (where the halo density\nprofile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical density\nof the Universe at the time when the main progenitor's virial mass equals the\nmass enclosed within r_{-2}. Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and\ndensity, the mean MAH, expressed in terms of the critical density of the\nUniverse, M(\\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,\nM(<\\rho >), at z=0. Both follow closely the NFW profile, suggesting that the\nsimilarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo\nMAHs. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whose\naccretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show\ncorrelated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles.\nFitting both M(<\\rho >) and M(\\rho_{crit}) with either NFW or Einasto profiles\nyield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and\nextending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretion\nhistory. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to\ninitial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly from\nthe NFW shape show noticeable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a\nresult, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,\nwhich do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than\nCDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass\nprofile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong\nsupport for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose\nhere. \n\n"}

We introduce a method to compute the non-equilibrium\nionisation and cooling of diffuse gas exposed to the EGB. Our method iterates\nthe ionisation states of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling and uses\ntabulated ion-by-ion cooling and photo-heating efficiencies to update the\ntemperature of the gas. Our reaction network includes radiative and di-electric\nrecombination, collisional ionisation, photo-ionisation, Auger ionisation, and\ncharge transfer. We verify that our method reproduces published results for\ncollisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium, and photo-ionised\nequilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas,\nparticularly below 10^6 K. Photo-ionisation and non-equilibrium effects both\ntend to boost the degree of ionisation and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The\neffect of the EGB is larger for lower densities. Hence, photo-ionisation\naffects cooling more under isochoric than under isobaric conditions.\nNon-equilibrium effects are smaller in the presence of the EGB and are thus\noverestimated when using collisional-only processes. The inclusion of the EGB\nalters the observational diagnostics of diffuse, metal-enriched gas (e.g. metal\nabsorption lines) even more significantly than the cooling efficiencies.

Our main results are as follows: 1) light-weighted stellar\nages range from 6-12 Gyr from low to high sigma; 2) [Fe/H] varies by less than\n0.1 dex across the entire sample; 3) Mg closely tracks O, and both increase\nfrom ~0.0 at low sigma to ~0.25 at high sigma; Si and Ti show a shallower rise\nwith sigma, and Ca tracks Fe rather than O; 4) the iron peak elements V, Cr,\nMn, and Ni track Fe, while Co tracks O, suggesting that Co forms primarily in\nmassive stars; 5) C and N track O over the full sample and [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]\nexceed 0.2 at high sigma; and 6) the variation in Delta(Teff) with total\nmetallicity follows theoretical predictions based on stellar evolution theory.\nOur derived [Mg/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundance ratios are 0.05-0.1 dex lower than\nmost previous determinations. Under the conventional interpretation that the\nvariation in these ratios is due to star formation timescale variations, our\nresults suggest longer star formation timescales for massive early-type\ngalaxies than previous studies.

In the case with about $13\\%$ of the total masked area,\nthe fraction of peaks with SNR $\\nu\\ge 3$ is $\\sim 11\\%$ in comparison with\n$\\sim 7\\%$ of the mask-free case in our considered cosmological model. This can\ninduce a large bias on cosmological studies with weak lensing peak statistics.\nEven for a survey area of $9\\hbox{ deg}^2$, the bias in $(\\Omega_m, \\sigma_8)$\nis already close to $3\\sigma$. It is noted that most of the affected peaks are\nclose to the masked regions. Therefore excluding peaks in those regions can\nreduce the bias but at the expense of loosing usable survey areas.

It and other correlations led\nto the belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth.\nNew results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more\nplausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy\ncomponents. BHs are found in pure-disk galaxies, so classical\n(elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary to grow BHs. But BHs do not\ncorrelate with galaxy disks. And any correlations with disk-grown pseudobulges\nor halo dark matter are so weak as to imply no close coevolution.

First,\nthe amplitude of scalar curvature perturbations is not directly tied to the\nshape of the inflationary potential. This allows the theory to violate na\\\"ive\nformulations of the Lyth bound. Second, the tensor sector of the theory is\nsignificantly altered from the usual case: the non-Abelian gauge field\nperturbations have a tensor degree of freedom. One chirality of the this tensor\ncan be exponentially enhanced by a temporary instability near horizon crossing;\nthis chiral instability exists because of the classical gauge field background,\nwhich violates parity. These tensor fluctuations of the gauge field also couple\nto gravitational waves at linear order in perturbation theory and source a\nchiral spectrum of gravitational waves. This spectrum can be exponentially\nenhanced over the usual inflationary spectrum due to the instability in the\ngauge sector. These new features cause the theory in its present form to be in\nsignificant tension with current observational data. This is because the new\nscalar physics leads to a significant reddening of the spectral tilt in the\nsame region of parameter space where the exponential enhancement of the\ngravitational wave amplitude is small enough to satisfy current constraints on\nthe tensor-to-scalar index.

They were observed with PACS and SPIRE onboard\nHerschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. We focus on a systematic\ncomparison of the derived FIR properties (FIR luminosity, dust mass, dust\ntemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigate\nthe detection of a potential submm excess. The data reduction method is adapted\nfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.\nPACS flux densities are compared with the MIPS 70 and 160 microns bands. We use\ncolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determine\nthe dust properties of the DGS galaxies.

The location of the DGS galaxies on Herschel colour-colour\ndiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicity\ngalaxies. The dust in DGS galaxies is generally warmer than in KINGFISH\ngalaxies (T_DGS~32 K, T_KINGFISH~23 K). The emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 in\nthe DGS, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. The\ndust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:\nM_dust/M_star~0.02% for the DGS vs 0.1% for KINGFISH.

We find a weak, but statistically significant, dependence of\nthe total baryon fraction upon halo mass, scaling as M500^0.16. For M500>2e14,\nthe total baryon fractions within r500 are on average 18% (7%) below the\nUniversal value from the WMAP7 (Planck) analysis.

This situation occurs in single-dish HI\nobservations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshift\nobservations. M_dyn-measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonly\nobtained through observations of the CO line, the most abundant tracer of the\nmolecular medium.

We show how the integrated\nspectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial\ndistribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We\ndemonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects the\nshape of the global profiles.

It follows that a curvaton-like\nmechanism for generating $\\zeta$ requires an alternative to slow roll such as\nk-inflation. Second, accepting slow-roll inflation, the excursion of the\ninflaton field is at least of order Planck scale. As a result, the flatness of\nthe inflaton presumably requires a shift symmetry.\n  I point out that if such is the case, the resulting potential is likely to\nhave at least approximately the quadratic form suggested in 1983 by Linde,\nwhich is known to be compatible with the observed $r$ as well as the observed\nspectral index $\\ns$.

This\nproblem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass\nfractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic\nmean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a\nsignificant contribution from these regions.

We find\nthat density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of\nradius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial\nradius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous\ninfall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.\nDensity and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which\nprobes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of\nassembling.

Sizes of polarization maps from ground-based experiments are,\nhowever, limited by contamination of long wavelength modes of observational\nnoise. To further extract the lensing signals, we explore feasibility of\nmeasuring lensing signals from a collection of small sky maps each of which is\nobserved separately by a ground-based large telescope, i.e., lensing\nreconstruction from a patchwork map of large sky coverage organized from small\nsky patches.

Here we present a general framework (PCA\nmarginalization) to consistently incorporate systematic effects into a\nlikelihood analysis. This technique naturally accounts for degeneracies between\nnuisance parameters and can substantially reduce the dimension of the parameter\nspace that needs to be sampled. As a practical application, we apply PCA\nmarginalization to account for baryonic physics as an uncertainty in cosmic\nshear tomography. Specifically, we use CosmoLike to run simulated likelihood\nanalyses on three independent sets of numerical simulations, each covering a\nwide range of baryonic scenarios differing in cooling, star formation, and\nfeedback mechanisms. We simulate a Stage III (Dark Energy Survey) and Stage IV\n(Large Synoptic Survey Telescope/Euclid) survey and find a substantial bias in\ncosmological constraints if baryonic physics is not accounted for. We then show\nthat PCA marginalization (employing at most 3 to 4 nuisance parameters) removes\nthis bias.

At the same\ntime, the current best-fit value of $r$ suggests large field inflation delta\nphi>M_p, which requires a UV complete description of inflation.

Abstract: A century after the advent of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, both\ntheories enjoy incredible empirical success, constituting the cornerstones of\nmodern physics.

Motivations for violations of the notion of\nrelativistic locality include the Bell's inequalities for hidden variable\ntheories, the cosmological horizon problem, and Lorentz-violating approaches to\nquantum geometrodynamics, such as Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Here, we explore a\nrecent proposal for a \"real ensemble\" non-local description of quantum\nmechanics, in which \"particles\" can copy each others' observable values AND\nphases, independent of their spatial separation. We first specify the exact\ntheory, ensuring that it is consistent and has (ordinary) quantum mechanics as\na fixed point, where all particles with the same values for a given observable\nhave the same phases. We then study the stability of this fixed point\nnumerically, and analytically, for simple models.

Central galaxies with low-entropy, high-density\natmospheres frequently contain multiphase star-forming gas, while those with\nhigh-entropy, low-density atmospheres never do. The dividing line between these\ntwo populations in central entropy, and therefore central cooling time, is\namazingly sharp. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dichotomy.\nOne points out that thermal conduction can prevent radiative cooling of cluster\ncores above the dividing line. The other holds that cores below the dividing\nline are subject to thermal instability that fuels the central AGN through a\ncold-feedback mechanism. Here we explore those hypotheses with an analysis of\nthe H-alpha properties of ACCEPT galaxy clusters. We find that the two\nhypotheses are likely to be complementary. Our results support a picture in\nwhich cold clouds inevitably precipitate out of cluster cores in which cooling\noutcompetes thermal conduction and rain down on the central black hole, causing\nAGN feedback that stabilizes the cluster core. In particular, the observed\ndistribution of the cooling-time to freefall-time ratio is nearly identical to\nthat seen in simulations of this cold-feedback process, implying that\ncold-phase accretion, and not Bondi-like accretion of hot-phase gas, is\nresponsible for the AGN feedback that regulates star formation in large\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

We report\non a survey for X-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2)\nclusters of galaxies selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the\nSouth Pole Telescope data.

Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results\nrequires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface\ndensity threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure\nstripping in haloes less massive than ~10^14 Msun, and to modify our model for\nradio mode feedback.

For real fields, these solutions oscillate in time and are\nknown as oscillatons. The density profile is static, and is soliton. Such\nsolitons should be ubiquitous in models of axion dark matter, with the soliton\ncharacteristic mass and size depending on some inverse power of the axion mass.\nStable configurations of non-relativistic axions are studied numerically using\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson system. This method, and the resulting soliton\ndensity profiles, are reviewed. Using a scaling symmetry and the uncertainty\nprinciple, the core size of the soliton can be related to the central density\nand axion mass, $m_a$, in a universal way. Solitons have a constant central\ndensity due to pressure-support, unlike the cuspy profile of cold dark matter\n(CDM). One consequence of this fact is that solitons composed of ultra-light\naxions (ULAs) may resolve the `cusp-core' problem of CDM. In DM halos,\nthermodynamics will lead to a CDM-like Navarro-Frenk-White profile at large\nradii, with a central soliton core at small radii. Using Monte-Carlo techniques\nto explore the possible density profiles of this form, a fit to\nstellar-kinematical data of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is performed.

For a viable\ncosmology the vacuum energy just after a phase transition must be set by the\ncritical temperature of the next phase transition, which exposes the\ncosmological constant problem from a different angle. Here we propose to\nexperimentally test the properties of vacuum energy under circumstances\ndifferent from our current vacuum. One promising avenue is to consider the\neffect of high density phases of QCD in neutron stars. Such phases have\ndifferent vacuum expectation values and a different vacuum energy from the\nnormal phase, which can contribute an order one fraction to the mass of neutron\nstars. Precise observations of the mass of neutron stars can potentially yield\ninformation about the gravitational properties of vacuum energy, which can\nsignificantly affect their mass-radius relation. A more direct test of cosmic\nevolution of vacuum energy could be inferred from a precise observation of the\nprimordial gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies corresponding to phase\ntransitions.

We demonstrate\ninterferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including\nthe largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.\nThese wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes\nimpact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most\ndesirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a\ndipole or a phased array.

There\nis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity\ndependent. The space density of AGN with Lx<1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5\nbetween the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN\nappears to be milder.

The\n(0.5-10) keV spectrum is well described by a flat power law, which can be\ninterpreted as non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet. The source\nexhibits moderate flux variability on timescales of both months and years.\nCorrelated brightness variations in the (0.5-2) keV and (2-10) keV bands are\nexplained by a single variable spectral component, such as the jet. A possible\nsoft excess seen in the data from 2004 cannot be confirmed by the new \\xmm{}\nobservations in 2012. Any contribution to the total flux in 2004 is less than\n$20\\%$ of the power-law component. The (0.5-10) keV luminosities of PKS\n2004-447 are in the range of (0.5--2.7)$\\times10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}$. A\ncomparison of the X-ray properties among the known $\\gamma$-NLS1 galaxies shows\nthat X-ray spectrum is typically dominated by a flat power law without\nintrinsic absorption. These objects are moderately variable in their\nbrightness, while spectral variability is observed in at least two sources. The\nmajor difference across the X-ray spectra of $\\gamma$-NLS1s is the luminosity,\nwhich spans a range of almost two orders of magnitude, from\n$10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}$ to $10^{46}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}$ in the\n(0.5-10) keV band. \n\n"}

We first perform a stacking\nanalysis towards Planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. We detect infrared emission\nproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that the\ninfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tSZ effect. Modelling the\nemission with a Navarro--Frenk--White profile, we find that the radial profile\nconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. This indicates\nthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared flux\nthan cluster-core galaxies. We also study the cross-correlation between tSZ and\nCIB anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on power\nspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected in\nPlanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tSZ map built from Planck frequency maps;\nand (iii) using cross-spectra between Planck frequency maps.

To identify the BAO\nsignature, we would assemble individual CIB maps over conservatively large\ncontiguous areas of >~ 400 sq deg. The method can isolate the CIB spatial\nspectrum by z to sub-percent statistical accuracy.

The\nevolution of the resulting microscale turbulence is considered when the shear\nis switched off or reversed after one shear time (mimicking local behaviour of\na macroscopic flow), so a new macroscale configuration is superimposed on the\nmicroscale state left behind by the previous one. There is a threshold value of\nplasma beta: when $\\beta\\ll\\Omega/S$ (ion cyclotron frequency/shear rate), the\nemergence of firehose/mirror fluctuations driven unstable by shear and their\ndisappearance when the shear is removed/reversed are quasi-instantaneous\ncompared to the shear time, viz., the decay time of these fluctuations is\n$\\sim\\beta/\\Omega \\ll 1/S$ (this result follows from the free decay of the\nfluctuations being constrained by the same marginal-stability thresholds as\ntheir growth). In contrast, when $\\beta\\gtrsim\\Omega/S$ (\"ultra-high\" beta),\nthe old microscale state can only be removed on the shear timescale. In this\nregime, driven firehose fluctuations grow secularly to order-unity amplitudes,\ncompensating for the decay of the mean field and so pinning pressure anisotropy\nat marginal stability with no appreciable scattering of particles---which is\nunlike what happens at moderate $\\beta$. When the shear reverses, the shearing\naway of this firehose turbulence compensates for the increase in the mean field\nand thus prevents growth of the pressure anisotropy, stopping the system from\ngoing mirror-unstable. Therefore, at ultra-high beta, the system stays close to\nthe firehose threshold, the mirror instability is largely suppressed, while the\nmean magnetic energy barely changes at all.

Similarly, a direct\ncross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an\nanomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or\nWMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential\nexplanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS\ngalaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred. Simulations are used\nin the CFHTLenS pipeline to calibrate such biases, but no data-driven\nconstraints have been presented to date. In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al.

We note that the\nrelativistic constraint equation for $\\psi$ can be cast as a diffusion\nequation, with a diffusion length scale determined by the expansion of the\nUniverse. Exploiting the weak time evolution of $\\psi$ in all regimes of\ninterest, this equation can be further accurately approximated as a Helmholtz\nequation, with an effective relativistic 'screening' scale $\\ell$ related to\nthe Hubble radius. We demonstrate that it is thus possible to carry out N-body\nsimulations in the Newtonian gauge by replacing Poisson's equation with this\nHelmholtz equation, involving a trivial change in the Green's function kernel.\nOur results also motivate a simple, approximate (but very accurate) gauge\ntransformation - $\\delta_{\\rm N}(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx \\delta_{\\rm\nsim}(\\mathbf{k})\\times (k^2+\\ell^{-2})/k^2$ - to convert the density field\n$\\delta_{\\rm sim}$ of standard collisionless N-body simulations (initialised in\nthe comoving synchronous gauge) into the Newtonian gauge density $\\delta_{\\rm\nN}$ at arbitrary times. A similar conversion can also be written in terms of\nparticle positions. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a Jeans\nstability criterion induced by the expansion of the Universe.

Since the majority of\nthe mass density is in the form of dark matter that cannot be directly\nobserved, to do cosmology with large-scale structure one must use observable\n(baryonic) quantities that trace the underlying matter distribution in a\n(hopefully) predictable way.

These\nclusters, which span 0 < z < 1.5, were drawn from a larger, mass-selected\nsample of galaxy clusters discovered in the 2500 square degree South Pole\nTelescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. With a total combined exposure\ntime of 9.1 Ms, these data yield the strongest constraints to date on the\nevolution of the metal content of the intracluster medium (ICM). We find no\nevidence for strong evolution in the global (r<R500) ICM metallicity (dZ/dz =\n-0.06 +/- 0.04 Zsun), with a mean value at z=0.6 of <Z> = 0.23 +/- 0.01 Zsun\nand a scatter of 0.08 +/- 0.01 Zsun. These results imply that >60% of the\nmetals in the ICM were already in place at z=1 (at 95% confidence), consistent\nwith the picture of an early (z>1) enrichment. We find, in agreement with\nprevious works, a significantly higher mean value for the metallicity in the\ncenters of cool core clusters versus non-cool core clusters. We find weak\nevidence for evolution in the central metallicity of cool core clusters (dZ/dz\n= -0.21 +/- 0.11 Zsun), which is sufficient to account for this enhanced\ncentral metallicity over the past ~10 Gyr.

We also use the large frequency range probed by Planck, together\nwith component-separation techniques, to remove the contamination from both\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect (tSZ) signal, which dominate below 353 GHz.

Since velocities should be unbiased on large scales, the\nkSZ signal is an unbiased tracer of the large-scale electron distribution, and\nthus can be used to detect the \"missing baryon\" that evade most observational\ntechniques. While most current methods for kSZ extraction rely on the\navailability of very accurate redshifts, we revisit a method that allows\nmeasurements even in the absence of redshift information for individual\nobjects.

We constrain shear\ncalibration biases while simultaneously varying cosmological parameters, galaxy\nbiases and photometric redshift uncertainties. We find that CMB lensing from\nCMB S4 enables the calibration of the shear biases down to 0.2% - 3% in 10\ntomographic bins for LSST (below the ~0.5% requirements in most tomographic\nbins), down to 0.4% - 2.4% in 10 bins for Euclid and 0.6% - 3.2% in 10 bins for\nWFIRST.

This study is part of a larger\ncampaign that aims to robustly calibrate mass-observable scaling relations over\na wide range in redshift to enable improved cosmological constraints from the\nSPT cluster sample. We introduce new strategies to ensure that systematics in\nthe lensing analysis do not degrade constraints on cluster scaling relations\nsignificantly. First, we efficiently remove cluster members from the source\nsample by selecting very blue galaxies in V-I colour. Our estimate of the\nsource redshift distribution is based on CANDELS data, where we carefully mimic\nthe source selection criteria of the cluster fields. We apply a statistical\ncorrection for systematic photometric redshift errors as derived from Hubble\nUltra Deep Field data and verified through spatial cross-correlations. We\naccount for the impact of lensing magnification on the source redshift\ndistribution, finding that this is particularly relevant for shallower surveys.\nFinally, we account for biases in the mass modelling caused by miscentring and\nuncertainties in the concentration-mass relation using simulations.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run. \n\n"}

As such,\nthese objects could constitute probes of many details of early universe\nphysics, such as primordial phase-transitions, inflation, small scale\nexploration of the primordial density perturbation field and non-Gaussianity of\nthese density perturbations. The fact that they are also highly dark\nmatter-dominated objects means that they are attractive objects of study in the\ncontinuing hunt for the nature of Dark Matter (DM) through indirect detection.\nAnother reason to study such objects in the local environment is found in the\nconjecture that encounters with UCMHs could induce catastrophic events on\nplanets within our solar system, e.g. mass-extinction events on Earth.

As the most comprehensive statistics, this PDF encodes all\ncosmological information of large-scale modes, therefore, could serve as the\nbasis in the LSS modelling. Following the so-called PDF-based method from\nturbulence, we write down this PDF's evolution equation, which describes the\nprobability conservation. We show that this conservation equation's\ncharacteristic curves follow the same PDF history and could be considered as an\neffective dynamics of the coarse-grained field. Unlike the EFT of LSS, which\nconceptually would work at both realization and statistics level, this\neffective dynamics is valid only statistically. However, this `statistical\nequivalence' also provides valuable insight into scale interactions at the\nstatistical level. It also enables predicting a wide variety of statistics\nbeyond the typical N-point polyspectra, including, e.g. topologies, density PDF\nand non-linear covariance matrices etc. Our formula expresses the small-scale\neffect as the ensemble average of their interactions conditional on the\nlarge-scale modes.

The lines\npresumably emit from TDE debris or circumnuclear clouds photoionized by the\nflare. Line velocities however are much lower than expected from a stellar\ndisruption by supermassive black hole (SMBH), and are somewhat faster than\nexpected for the broad line region (BLR) clouds of a persistently active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). The distinctive spectral states are not strongly\nrelated to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use\nexhaustive photoionization modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud\nproperties that yield (e.g.) a He-overbright state where a large\nHeII(4686A)/H$\\alpha$ line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment.\nAlthough observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like\nillumination can not reproduce the observed equivalent widths.

A similar effect is not excluded for lower\ndensity contrasts but our results are then strongly contaminated by numerical\nnoise and thus hardly reliable. A potentially detectable signature of this\nscenario is a phantom-like equation of state $w< -1$, at redshifts $z\\gtrsim 4$\nfor a density contrast of $10^{-2}$ initially, relaxing slowly to $w \\approx\n-1$ today.

We determine global trends for beta as a\nfunction of radius from three suites of simulations, including accretion only\nand cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that both types of\nsimulations are consistent and predict strong radial anisotropy (<beta>~0.7)\nfor Galactocentric radii greater than 10 kpc. Previous observations of beta for\nthe MW's stellar halo claim a detection of an isotropic or tangential \"dip\" at\nr~20 kpc. Using the N-body+SPH simulations, we investigate the temporal\npersistence, population origin, and severity of \"dips\" in beta. We find dips in\nthe in situ stellar halo are long-lived, while dips in the accreted stellar\nhalo are short-lived and tied to the recent accretion of satellite material.

In this work, we investigate a bias to CMB lensing reconstruction\nfrom temperature anisotropies due to the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ)\neffect, that is, the Doppler shift of CMB photons induced by Compton-scattering\noff moving electrons. The kSZ signal yields biases due to both its own\nintrinsic non-Gaussianity and its non-zero cross-correlation with the CMB\nlensing field (and other fields that trace the large-scale structure). This\nkSZ-induced bias affects both the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum and its\ncross-correlation with low-redshift tracers. Furthermore, it cannot be removed\nby multifrequency foreground separation techniques because the kSZ effect\npreserves the blackbody spectrum of the CMB. While statistically negligible for\ncurrent datasets, we show that it will be important for upcoming surveys, and\nfailure to account for it can lead to large biases in constraints on neutrino\nmasses or the properties of dark energy. For a Stage 4 CMB experiment, the bias\ncan be as large as $\\approx$ 15% or 12% in cross-correlation with LSST galaxy\nlensing convergence or galaxy overdensity maps, respectively, when the maximum\ntemperature multipole used in the reconstruction is $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 4000$,\nand about half of that when $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 3000$.

The most critical one probably comes from the degeneracy\nexisting between lens models that was first formalized by the well-known\nmass-sheet transformation (MST). In this paper, we assess to what extent the\nsource position transformation (SPT), a more general invariance transformation\nwhich contains the MST as a special case, may affect the time delays predicted\nby a model. To this aim we use pySPT, a new open-source python package fully\ndedicated to the SPT that we present in a companion paper. For axisymmetric\nlenses, we find that the time delay ratios between a model and its SPT-modified\ncounterpart simply scale like the corresponding source position ratios, $\\Delta\n\\hat{t}/ \\Delta t \\approx \\hat{\\beta}/\\beta$, regardless of the mass profile\nand the isotropic SPT. Similar behavior (almost) holds for non-axisymmetric\nlenses in the double image regime and for opposite image pairs in the quadruple\nimage regime.

The spectral energy\ndistribution of the source is similar to the other gamma-ray NLSy1s, confirming\nits blazar-like nature.

The power spectra of these\nline fluctuations are a promising tool to test gravity over a large range of\nscales and redshifts. We simulate cosmological volumes of 21cm fluctuations in\ngeneral parametrisations of modified gravity, in order to calculate the\ncorresponding power spectra, where additional parameters are the initial\ncondition of matter perturbations $\\alpha$ and the scale-dependent modified\ngravity parameter $Y$ (also known as $G_\\mathrm{eff}$) that measures deviations\nfrom GR in the Poisson equation. We show the impact of these model-independent\nmodifications of gravity, to either delay or expedite reionisation. For the\n21cm intensity mapping survey to be performed by the SKA mission, we forecast\nthe ability of line intensity mapping to constrain the parameters $Y$ and\n$\\alpha$ at redshifts $z=6-11$, where $Y$ is assumed constant during this epoch\n(but without requiring constancy at all times).

An original way initiated by Bertschinger as\nearly as 1987, to legitimize the one-to-one comparison exercise down to the\ndetails, is to produce simulations constrained to resemble the cluster under\nstudy within its large scale environment. Subsequently several methods have\nemerged to produce simulations that look like the local Universe. This paper\nhighlights one of these methods and its essential steps to get simulations that\nnot only resemble the local Large Scale Structure but also that host the local\nclusters. It includes a new modeling of the radial peculiar velocity\nuncertainties to remove the observed correlation between the decreases of the\nsimulated cluster masses and of the amount of data used as constraints with the\ndistance from us.

If these\nfields have self-interactions, i.e., non-quadratic terms in the potential, the\nexperimental constraints on such forces can be drastically altered due to a\nscreening (chameleon) or enhancement effect. We explore how technically natural\nvalues for such self-interaction coupling constants modify the existing\nconstraints. We point out that assuming the existence of these natural\ninteractions leads to new constraints, contrary to the usual expectation that\nscreening leads to gaps in coverage.

For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits\nthe w(r_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r_p ~ 1-3\nMpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of \\xi(r). The\nimplied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminosity\nthreshold L grows as M_min ~ L at low luminosities and more steeply above L_*.\nThe mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than L is\nM_1 ~ 23 M_min(L). These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at\nfixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function\nextrapolation of the satellite population. HOD models nicely explain the joint\nluminosity-color dependence of w(r_p) in terms of the color fractions of\ncentral and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. The inferred HOD\nproperties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. \n\n"}

The\nexpected stellar end points can be found from evolutionary calculations and the\ncorresponding mass loss properties at this point can be estimated from typical\nvalues for Galactic stars. The mass loss densities of observed supernovae can\nbe estimated from observations of the thermal X-ray and radio synchrotron\nemission that result from the interaction of the supernova with the surrounding\nwind.

Because Type IIP supernovae have an\nextended period of high optical luminosity, Compton cooling can affect the\nradio emitting electrons, giving rise to a relatively flat radio light curve in\nthe optically thin regime.

Because these methods rely on the Friedmann equation which has not been\nindependently tested it is desirable to find alternative methods that work for\nboth general relativity and other theories of gravity.\n  Assuming that sufficiently large patches of a perturbed Robertson-Walker\nspacetime evolve like separate Robertson-Walker universes, that shear stress is\nunimportant on large scales and that energy and momentum are locally conserved,\nwe derive several relations between long-wavelength metric and matter\nperturbations.

Ground-based AO provides better light gathering power\nand in principle better resolution than HST, giving it the edge in high spatial\nresolution imaging and high resolution spectroscopy.

We concentrated on stars having a narrow range of\neffective temperature and very low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -2.5) to reduce the\neffects of systematic errors, and have made particular efforts to minimize\nrandom errors in equivalent width and effective temperature. A typical formal\nerror for our abundances is 0.033 dex (1-sigma), which represents a factor of\ntwo improvement on most previous studies. Our observed spread about the Li\nSpite plateau is a mere 0.031 dex (1-sigma), hence we conclude the intrinsic\nspread is effectively zero at the very metal-poor halo turnoff.

Previous claims for a lack of dependence of A(Li) on\n[Fe/H] are shown to have arisen from the use of noisier estimates of effective\ntemperatures and metallicities. Although we cannot rule out a uniform depletion\nmechanism, the lack of spread in the A(Li) abundances limits permissible\ndepletion by current rotationally- induced mixing models to < 0.1 dex.\nCorrecting for the GCE contribution to both 6Li and 7Li, we infer a primordial\nlithium abundance of A(Li) = 2.0 dex.

Measuring the\npolarization towards distant clusters provides the unique opportunity to\nobserve the evolution of the CMB quadrupole at moderate redshifts, z~0.5-3. We\ndemonstrate that for the local cluster population the polarization degree will\ndepend on the cluster celestial position. There are two extended regions in the\nsky, which are opposite to each other, where the polarization is maximal,\n0.1(tau/0.02) microK in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the CMB spectrum (tau being\nthe Thomson optical depth across the cluster) exceeding the contribution from\nthe cluster transverse peculiar motion if v_t<1300 km/s.

These polarization effects, which are of the order of\n(v_t/c)^2 tau, (v_t/c) tau^2 and (kT_e/m_ec^2) tau^2, as well as the\npolarization due to the CMB quadrupole, were previously calculated by Sunyaev\nand Zel'dovich for the Rayleigh-Jeans region.

On the one hand neutron\nstars are heated by the accreted matter at the stellar surface, but on the\nother hand they are also cooled down by the neutrino radiation. At the same\ntime, the accreted matter transports its angular momentum and mass to the star.\nWe have studied the evolution of the stellar mass, temperature and rotational\nfrequency.\n  The gravitational-wave-driven instability of the r-mode oscillation strongly\nsuppresses spinning-up of the star, whose final rotational frequency is well\nbelow the mass-shedding limit, typically as small as 10% of that of the\nmass-shedding state. On a very short time scale the rotational frequency tends\nto approach a certain constant value and saturates there as far as the amount\nof the accreted mass does not exceed a certain limit to collapse to a black\nhole.
