Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

This\nalso seems to be the case of Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center, where the\nbroad-band radiation is produced, likely via the synchrotron self-Compton\nmechanism. It has been proposed that strong-field gravitational lensing\nmagnifies the flares. The effect of lensing is generally weak and requires a\nfine-tuned geometrical arrangement, which occurs with only a low probability.\nHowever, there are several aspects that make Sagittarius A* a promising target\nto reveal strong gravity effects. Unlike type II (obscured) active galaxies,\nchances are that a flare is detected at high inclination, which would be\nfavourable for lensing. Time delays can then significantly influence the\nobserved flare duration and the form of light-curve profiles. Here we discuss\nan idea that the impact of lensing amplification should be considerably\nenhanced when the shape of the flaring clump is appropriately elongated in the\nform of a spiral wave or a narrow filament, rather than a simple (circular)\nspot which we employed previously within the phenomenological `orbiting spot\nmodel'.

Abstract: We consider the effect of mass segregation on the observable integrated\nproperties of star clusters. The measurable properties depend on a combination\nof the dynamical age of the cluster and the physical age of the stars in the\ncluster. To investigate all possible combinations of these two quantities we\npropose an analytical model for the mass function of segregated star clusters\nthat agrees with the results of N-body simulations, in which any combination\ncan be specified. For a realistic degree of mass segregation and a fixed\ndensity profile we find with increasing age an increase in the measured core\nradii and a central surface brightness that decreases in all filters more\nrapidly than what is expected from stellar evolution alone. Within a Gyr the\nmeasured core radius increases by a factor of two and the central surface\ndensity in all filters of a segregated cluster will be overestimated by a\nsimilar factor when not taking into account mass segregation in the conversion\nfrom light to mass. We find that the $V-I$ colour of mass segregated clusters\ndecreases with radius by about 0.1-0.2 mag, which could be observable. From\nrecent observations of partially resolved extra-galactic clusters a decreasing\nhalf-light radius with increasing wavelength was observed, which was attributed\nto mass segregation. These observations can not be reproduced by our models. We\nfind that the differences between measured radii in different filters are\nalways smaller than 5%. \n\n"}

We consider outermost planets with masses\nranging from 10 earth masses to 1 M_J. We also examine the case of outermost\nbodies with masses < 10 earth masses (M_E). Differential migration of the\nplanets due to disc torques leads to different evolution outcomes depending on\nthe mass of the outer protoplanet. For planets with mass < 3.5 M_E the type II\nmigration rate of the giant exceeds the type I migration rate of the outer\nbody, resulting in divergent migration. Outer bodies with masses in the range\n3.5 < m_o < 20 M_E become trapped at the edge of the gap formed by the giant\nplanet, because of corotation torques. Higher mass planets are captured into\nresonance with the inner planet. If 30 < m_o < 40 M_E or m_o=1 M_J, then the\n2:1 resonance is established.

In this work, we study the quark-hadron phase transition in the\ncontext of brane-world cosmologies, in which our Universe is a three-brane\nembedded in a five-dimensional bulk, and within an effective model of QCD. We\nanalyze the evolution of the physical quantities, relevant for the physical\ndescription of the early universe, namely, the energy density, temperature and\nscale factor, before, during, and after the phase transition. To study the\ncosmological dynamics and evolution we use both analytical and numerical\nmethods. In particular, due to the high energy density in the early Universe,\nwe consider in detail the specific brane world model case of neglecting the\nterms linearly proportional to the energy density with respect to the quadratic\nterms. A small brane tension and a high value of the dark radiation term tend\nto decrease the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma and of the\nhadronic fluid, respectively, and to significantly accelerate the transition to\na pure hadronic phase. By assuming that the phase transition may be described\nby an effective nucleation theory, we also consider the case where the Universe\nevolved through a mixed phase with a small initial supercooling and\nmonotonically growing hadronic bubbles. \n\n"}

This galaxy is unusual among late-type (Sc) disk galaxies in having a\nvery large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. We propose a head-on\ncollision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both the\noff-centered rings and the inflated radius. This scenario is supported by the\ndetection of a steep velocity gradient in the CO(1-0) map at the position of a\nsouthwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. This peak would\nrepresent the remnant of the disrupting companion. We use numerical models to\ndemonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. While ram pressure stripping\ncould in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce the\nstriking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group in\nX-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.\nThe collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,\nwhich accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on the\nsouthern side.

The\nhosts of FIR-faint QSOs show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-induced\nmorphological anomalies and larger QSO-to-host luminosity ratios on average\nthan the hosts of FIR-bright QSOs, consistent with late-merger evolution from\nFIR-bright to FIR-faint QSOs.

My method utilizes two\nexpansions: an inner expansion that keeps the size of the body fixed, and an\nouter expansion that lets the body shrink while holding its worldline fixed. By\nimposing the Lorenz gauge, I express the global solution to the Einstein\nequation in the outer expansion in terms of an integral over a worldtube of\nsmall radius surrounding the body.

Abstract: We investigate two potential mechanisms that will produce X-ray and gamma-ray\nflashes from Type Ia supernovae (SN-Ia). The mechanisms are the breakout of the\nthermonuclear burning front as it reaches the surface of the white dwarf and\nthe interaction of the rapidly expanding envelope with an accretion disk. Based\non the delayed-detonation scenario and detailed radiation-hydro calculation\nwhich include nuclear networks, we find that both mechanisms produce ~1 second\nflashes of high energy radiation with peak luminosities of 10^48 to 10^50\nerg/sec with fast rises and exponential declines. The X- and gamma-ray\nvisibility of a SN-Ia will depend strongly on self absorption within the\nprogenitor system, specifically on the properties of the accretion disk and its\norientation towards the observer. Such X-ray and gamma-ray flashes could be\ndetected as triggered events by Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) detectors on satellites,\nwith events in current GRB catalogs. We have searched through the GRB catalogs\n(for the BATSE, HETE, and Swift experiments) for GRBs that occur at the\nextrapolated time of explosion and in the correct direction for known Type Ia\nsupernovae with radial velocity of less than 3,000 km/s. For BATSE about\n12.9+-3.6 nearby SNe Ia should have been detected, but only 0.8+-0.7\nnon-coincidental matches have been found. With the HETE and Swift satellites,\nwe expect to see 5.6+-1.3 SN-Ia flashes from known nearby SNe Ia but, yet, no\nSN-Ia flashes were detected. These place observational limits that the\nbolometric peak luminosity of SN-Ia Flashes must be less ~10^46 erg/s. We\nattribute the difference between theory and observational limits to the\nabsorption of the X- and gamma-rays by the accretion disk of large scale height\nor common envelope that would be smothering the white dwarf. \n\n"}

Abstract: We systematically investigate the error sources for high-precision astrometry\nfrom adaptive optics based near-infrared imaging data.

Most important are the imperfectly subtracted seeing halos of\nneighboring stars, residual image distortions and unrecognized confusion of the\ntarget source with fainter sources in the background. Further contributors to\nthe error budget are the uncertainty in estimating the point spread function,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio induced statistical uncertainty, coordinate\ntransformation errors, the chromaticity of refraction in Earth's atmosphere,\nthe post adaptive optics differential tilt jitter and anisoplanatism. For stars\nas bright as mK=14, residual image distortions limit the astrometry, for\nfainter stars the limitation is set by the seeing halos of the surrounding\nstars.

In this framework the Ricci scalar acts as the kinetical\nterm of the strain field whose potential is represented by the additional\nterms. Here we are presenting the linearised version of the theory in order to\nanalyze its implications in the weak field limit. First we discuss the recovery\nof the Newtonian limit.

The facts that the system is magnetically active and that the\nhot spot has consistently existed on the inner hemisphere of the star indicate\nthat the two spots are formed by (1) magnetic dynamo-related activity on the\ncool star and (2) mass transfer from the primary to the secondary component.\nBased on 38 light-curve timings from the Wilson-Devinney code and all other\nminimum epochs, a period study of GW Cep reveals that the orbital period has\nexperienced a sinusoidal variation with a period and semi-amplitude of 32.6 yrs\nand 0.009 d, respectively.

However, a number of recent studies have emphasized\ninaccuracies of SPH in the treatment of fluid instabilities.

To this aim, we generalize the recently developed\nextended Zernike-Nijboer theory to carry out the analytical integration of the\nFresnel integral and present a natural basis set for the development of the\npoint spread function in case the wavefront is described using Zernike\nfunctions. We present a linear expansion of the point spread function in terms\nof analytic functions which, additionally, takes defocusing into account in a\nnatural way. This expansion is used to develop a very fast phase-diversity\nreconstruction technique which is demonstrated through some applications.

It can thus give information on the\nstar formation history of the universe. However, it is difficult to measure\ndirectly due to foreground radiation fields from the Galaxy and solar system.\nGamma-rays from extragalactic sources at cosmological distances (blazars and\ngamma-ray bursts) interact with EBL photons creating electron-positron pairs,\nabsorbing the gamma-rays. Given the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum of a source\nand its redshift, the EBL can in principle be measured. However, the intrinsic\ngamma-ray spectra of blazars and GRBs can vary considerably from source to\nsource and the from the same source over short timescales. A maximum intrinsic\nspectrum can be assumed from theoretical grounds, to give upper limits on the\nEBL absorption from blazars at low redshift with very high energy (VHE)\ngamma-ray observations with ground-based Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The\nFermi-LAT observations of blazars and GRBs can probe EBL absorption at higher\nredshifts. The lower energy portion of the LAT spectrum of these sources is\nunattenuated by the EBL, so that extrapolating this to higher energies can give\nthe maximum intrinsic spectrum for a source. Comparing this to the observed\nhigher energy LAT spectrum will then give upper limits on the EBL absorption.\nFor blazars which have been detected by both the Fermi-LAT and at higher\nenergies by Cherenkov telescopes, combined LAT-VHE observations can put more\nstringent constraints on the low redshift EBL. These procedures above can also\nbe reversed: for sources with an unknown redshift, a given EBL model and\ngamma-ray spectrum can lead to an upper limit on the source's redshift. \n\n"}

The time-averaged continuum emission is\nwell fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index Gamma = 1.75 and from\nconsideration of the Fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be\n350 keV < E < 25 MeV. Line emission from both near-neutral iron K_alpha at 6.39\nkeV and highly ionised iron, from Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi), is strongly detected\nin the Suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observations\nwith Chandra and XMM-Newton. We find the centroid energies for the Fe_(xxv) and\nFe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 keV and 6.95 keV respectively, with the latter\nappearing to be resolved in the Suzaku spectrum. We show that the Fe_(xxv) and\nFe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of column\ndensity N_(H) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). A Compton reflection component, e.g.,\noriginating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a Compton-thick torus,\nappears either very weak or absent in this AGN, subtending < 1 sr to the X-ray\nsource, consistent with previous findings. Indeed the absence of either neutral\nor ionised Compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic Fe K\nsignatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretion\ndisc is absent in this source.

We develop an approximate and explicit scheme in the\nfully general relativistic framework as a first implementation of the\nmicrophysics toward a more realistic and sophisticated modeling. In this paper,\nwe describe in detail a method for implementation of a realistic equation of\nstate, the electron capture and the neutrino cooling in a multidimensional,\nfully general relativistic code. The procedure is based on the so-called\nneutrino leakage scheme. To check the validity of the code, we perform a two\ndimensional (2D) simulation of spherical stellar core collapse. Until the\nconvective activities set in, our results approximately agree, or at least are\nconsistent, with those in the previous so-called state-of-the-art simulations.\nIn particular, the radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities and the time\nevolution of the neutrino luminosities agree quantitatively. The convection is\ndriven by negative gradients of the entropy per baryon and the electron\nfraction as in the previous 2D Newtonian simulations. We clarify which gradient\nis more responsible for the convection. Gravitational waves from the convection\nare also calculated.

Its mass is high enough that, even without an\naccompanying measurement of the stellar radius, it has a strong impact on our\nunderstanding of nuclear matter, gamma-ray bursts, and the generation of\ngravitational waves from coalescing neutron stars.

In the\nstandard approach to cosmology it is assumed that this relation is the same as\nin the homogeneous universe. As the real universe is not homogeneous there are\nseveral methods to calculate the correction. The weak lensing approximation and\nthe Dyer-Roeder relation are one of them. This paper establishes a link between\nthese two approximations. It is shown that if the universe is homogeneous with\nonly small, vanishing after averaging, density fluctuations along the line of\nsight, then the distance correction is negligible. It is also shown that a\nvanishing 3D average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of\ndensity fluctuations along the line of sight is zero. In this case, even within\nthe linear approximation, the distance correction is not negligible. The\nmodified version of the Dyer-Roeder relation is presented and it is shown that\nthis modified relation is consistent with the correction obtained within the\nweak lensing approximation. The correction to the distance for a source at z ~\n2 is of order of a few percent.

Color Gradients of Globular Cluster\n  Systems in Early-Type Galaxies Abstract: We use the largest homogeneous sample of globular clusters (GCs), drawn from\nthe ACSVCS and ACSFCS, to investigate the color gradients of GC systems in 76\nearly-type galaxies. We find that most GC systems possess an obvious negative\ngradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). For GC systems displaying color\nbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor GC subpopulations present shallower\nbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these two\nsubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. The FOV of ACS mainly restricts\nus to measuring the inner gradients of GC systems. These gradients, however,\ncan introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of GC\nsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. Inferred corrections\nto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the mean\ncolor of metal-poor GCs and their host galaxy luminosity. The GC color\ngradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens are\nweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarf\ngalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar mass\nof M_stellar~10^10M_sun. We also measure color gradients for field stars in the\nhost galaxies. We find that GC color gradients are systematically steeper than\nfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is the\nsame for both. If gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse and\nweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner GC\nsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidly\nwith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. The lack of\nstrong gradients in the GC systems of dwarfs, which probably have not\nexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos were\ninefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of GC formation. \n\n"}

Previous work has demonstrated that the black hole\nspins can have a strong impact on the accuracy of parameter measurement.\nRelativistic spin-induced precession modulates the waveform in a manner which\ncan break degeneracies between parameters, in principle significantly improving\nhow well they are measured. Recent studies have indicated, however, that spin\nprecession may be weak for an important subset of astrophysical binary black\nholes: those in which the spins are aligned due to interactions with gas. In\nthis paper, we examine how well a binary's parameters can be measured when its\nspins are partially aligned and compare results using waveforms that include\nhigher post-Newtonian harmonics to those that are truncated at leading\nquadrupole order. We find that the weakened precession can substantially\ndegrade parameter estimation. This degradation is particularly devastating for\nthe extrinsic parameters sky position and distance.

In general, observational approaches to galaxy formation\ninclude measuring basic galaxy properties, such as luminosities, stellar\nmasses, rotation speeds, star formation rates and how these features evolve\nthrough time. Theoretically, cosmologically based models collate the physical\neffects driving galaxy assembly - mergers of galaxies, accretion of gas, star\nformation, and feedback, amongst others, to form predictions which are matched\nto galaxy observables. An alternative approach is to examine directly, in an\nobservational way, the processes driving galaxy assembly, including the effects\nof feedback.

The SED of this cloud on angular scales of\n1{\\odot} is dominated by free-free emission in the cm-range. In LDN 1780 we\ndetected a 3 {\\sigma} excess in the SED on angular scales of 1{\\odot} that can\nbe fitted using a spinning dust model. In this cloud, there is a spatial\ncorrelation between the CBI data and IR images, which trace dust. The\ncorrelation is better with near-IR templates (IRAS 12 and 25 {\\mu}m) than with\nIRAS 100 {\\mu}m, which suggests a very small grain origin for the emission at\n31 GHz. We calculated the 31 GHz emissivities in both clouds.

The sample consists of 29 observations of 10 unique sources. We present\nmeasurements of the Fe Ka line parameters with the highest spectral resolution\ncurrently available.

From a comparison with the optical\nemission-line widths obtained from spectropolarimetric observations, we found\nthat the location of Fe Ka line-emitting material is a factor of ~0.7-11 times\nthe size of the optical BLR. Furthermore, compared to 13 type I AGNs for which\nthe best Fe Ka line FWHM constraints were obtained, we found no difference in\nthe FWHM distribution or the mean FWHM, and this conclusion is independent of\nthe central black hole mass.

As an attempt to discriminate among several possible\nproduction scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of\nthe directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they\nare supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the\nobservations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of\ndirectional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a\nnonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative\ndistributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected\nforms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived\nfrom fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.\nWe use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594\n(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale\nindices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between\nthose estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called\nMultiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each\nchoice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is\nbased on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet\ncoefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures\nand compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to\nisotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic\nnonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo\nstudy shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample\nsize, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of\nthe parameter ${J^{\\star}}$.

This virial state is a consequence of the low gas fractions within\nthe subclusters, caused by the accretion of gas onto the stars and the\naccretion-induced shrinkage of the subclusters. Because the subclusters are\ngas-poor, up to a length scale of 0.1-0.2 pc at the end of the simulation, they\nare only weakly affected by gas expulsion. The fraction of subclusters that\nreaches the high density required to evolve to a gas-poor state increases with\nthe density of the star-forming region.

In recent years,\nobservations have largely confirmed many of the properties of this model, which\nis based on a partitioning of the universe's energy density into three primary\nconstituents: matter, radiation, and a hypothesized dark energy which, in\nLambdaCDM, is assumed to be a cosmological constant Lambda. Yet with this\nprogress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) have\nemerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. One of\nthese is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon R_h(t_0) with the\ndistance ct_0 light has traveled since the big bang, in terms of the current\nage t_0 of the universe. This equality is very peculiar because it need not\nhave occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)\nin the context of LambdaCDM. In this paper, we propose an explanation for why\nthis equality may actually be required by GR, through the application of\nBirkhoff's theorem and the Weyl postulate, at least in the case of a flat\nspacetime. If this proposal is correct, R_h(t) should be equal to ct for all\ncosmic time t, not just its present value t_0. Therefore models such as\nLambdaCDM would be incomplete because they ascribe the cosmic expansion to\nvariable conditions not consistent with this relativistic constraint. We show\nthat this may be the reason why the observed galaxy correlation function is not\nconsistent with the predictions of the standard model. We suggest that an\nR_h=ct universe is easily distinguishable from all other models at large\nredshift (i.e., in the early universe), where the latter all predict a rapid\ndeceleration. \n\n"}

We show that various estimates for the\nGalactic SFR are consistent with one another once they have been normalized to\nthe same initial mass function (IMF) and massive star models, converging to 1.9\n+/- 0.4 M_sun/yr. However, standard SFR diagnostics are vulnerable to\nsystematics founded in the use of indirect observational tracers sensitive only\nto high-mass stars. We find that absolute SFRs measured using resolved\nlow/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H II regions are\nsystematically higher by factors of ~2-3 as compared with calibrations for SFRs\nmeasured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations\nfor this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law\nslope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were\nsteeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the\nextragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star\nformation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of\nO stars.

Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of\nimportant disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime on\nfundamental planetary properties.\n  Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population\nof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration\nand disk evolution.\n  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary\ninitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different\nroles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,\ngiant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both\nmore frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets\ncannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.\nIn contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot\nfor giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher\nplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be\ncompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low\nmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high\nmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of\nmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with\nmetallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of\ngiant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,\nbut migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate\nless.

In the single black hole case we find\nthat, after a short transient, the scalar field relaxes to static\nconfigurations, in agreement with perturbative calculations. Furthermore we\npredict analytically (and verify numerically) that accelerated black holes in a\nscalar-field gradient emit scalar radiation.

However, CMB constraints are currently derived using a number of\nreasonable but yet un-tested assumptions that could potentially lead to a\nmisestimation of the true bounds. In this paper we examine the potential impact\nof these systematic effects. In particular, we separately study the propagation\nof the secondary particles produced by annihilation in two energy regimes;\nfirst following the shower from the initial particle energy to the keV scale,\nand then tracking the resulting secondary particles from this scale to the\nabsorption of their energy as heat, ionization, or excitation of the medium. We\nimprove both the high and low energy parts of the calculation, in particular\nfinding that our more accurate treatment of losses to sub-10.2 eV photons\nproduced by scattering of high-energy electrons weakens the constraints on\nparticular DM annihilation models by up to a factor of two.

We include\nthe evaluation of the precise amount of excitation energy, in the form of\nLyman-alpha photons, produced by the propagation of the shower, and examine the\neffects of varying the Helium fraction and Helium ionization fraction. In the\nrecent literature, simple approximations for the fraction of energy absorbed in\ndifferent channels have often been used to derive CMB constraints: we assess\nthe impact of using accurate versus approximate energy fractions.

The \\textit{Chandra} detection of the ULX yields its\nmost accurate X-ray position, which is spatially coincident with compact radio\nemission at 1.6 GHz. The ULX \\textit{Chandra} X-ray luminosity,\n$L_\\mathrm{0.2-10.0 keV} = 3.4\\ \\times$ 10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, indicates that\nN4088--X1 could be located at the high-luminosity end of the high-mass X-ray\nbinary (HMXB) population of NGC\\,4088.

Confirming the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission near\n100 MeV is then of the greatest importance. Our paper is focused on a global\nre-assessment of all available data and models of particle acceleration in W44,\nwith the goal of determining on a firm ground the hadronic and leptonic\ncontributions to the overall spectrum. We also present new gamma-ray and CO\nNANTEN2 data on W44, and compare them with recently published AGILE and Fermi\ndata. Our analysis strengthens previous studies and observations of the W44\ncomplex environment and provides new information for a more detailed modeling.\nIn particular, we determine that the average gas density of the regions\nemitting 100 MeV - 10 GeV gamma-rays is relatively high (n= 250 - 300 cm^-3).\nThe hadronic interpretation of the gamma-ray spectrum of W44 is viable, and\nsupported by strong evidence. It implies a relatively large value for the\naverage magnetic field (B > 10^2 microG) in the SNR surroundings, sign of field\namplification by shock-driven turbulence. Our new analysis establishes that the\nspectral index of the proton energy distribution function is p1 = 2.2 +/- 0.1\nat low energies and p2 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 at high energies.

We consider\na simple, however rather realistic, mean-field galactic dynamo model where the\neffects of small-scale generation are represented by random injections of\nmagnetic field from star forming regions. We represent an encounter by the\nintroduction of large-scale streaming velocities and by an increase in\nsmall-scale magnetic field injections. The latter describes the effect of an\nincrease of the star formation rate caused by the encounter. We demonstrate\nthat large-scale streaming, with associated deviations in the rotation curve,\ncan result in an enhancement of the anisotropic turbulent (ordered) magnetic\nfield strength, mainly along the azimuthal direction, leading to a significant\ntemporary increase of the total magnetic energy during the encounter; the\nrepresentation of an increase in star formation rate has an additional strong\neffect. In contrast to expectations, the large-scale (regular) magnetic field\nstructure is not significantly destroyed by the encounter. It may be somewhat\nweakened for a relatively short period, and its direction after the encounter\nmay be reversed. The encounter causes enhanced total and polarized emission\nwithout increase of the regular magnetic field strength.

Here we present the results of a new study\nbased on very deep Ks-band imaging (with the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT) of\ntwo HST CANDELS fields (the UKIDSS Ultra-deep survey (UDS) field and\nGOODS-South). The new HAWK-I data (taken as part of the HUGS VLT Large Program)\nreach detection limits of Ks>26 (AB mag). We select a sample of\npassively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4<z<2.5. Thanks to the\ndepth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend the\nselection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.\nThrough extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that the\nobserved turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at K>22 is real. This\nhas enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescent\ngalaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter than\nKs~22(AB mag.).

Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background.

Abstract: Star formation is observed to be suppressed in group and cluster galaxies\ncompared to the field. To gain insight into the quenching process, we have\nanalysed ~2000 galaxies formed in the GIMIC suite of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations. The time of quenching varies from ~2 Gyr before\naccretion (first crossing of r200,c) to >4 Gyr after, depending on satellite\nand host mass. Once begun, quenching is rapid (>~ 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies\n(M* < 10^10 M_Sun), but significantly more protracted for more massive\nsatellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by\nram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forming\ninterstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (M* ~ 10^9\nM_Sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and\nclusters. Immediately before quenching is complete, this fraction rises to ~80%\neven for Milky Way analogues (M* ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun) in groups (M_host ~ 10^13.5\nM_Sun). We show that (i) ISM stripping was significantly more effective at\nearly times than at z = 0; (ii) approximately half the gas is stripped from\n`galactic fountains' and half directly from the star forming disk; (iii)\ngalaxies undergoing stripping experience ram pressure up to ~100 times the\naverage at a given group/cluster-centric radius, because they are\npreferentially located in overdense ICM regions.

Extending Lindquist and\nWheeler's work, we derive cosmological scale factors describing the evolution\nof all three types of universes, and we use these scale factors to show that\nthe universes' dynamics strongly resemble those of\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes.

This signal can be interpreted as resulting\nfrom WIMP annihilation, with the spectrum well-fit by dark matter annihilating\ndominantly into either bottom-quark or Higgs pairs. Supersymmetric models\nprovide a well-motivated framework to study the implications of this signal in\nthese channels. With a neutralino dark matter candidate, the gamma-ray excess\ncannot be easily accommodated in the minimal supersymmetric model, which in any\ncase requires tuning below the percent level to explain the observed Higgs\nmass. Instead we are naturally led to consider the next-to-minimal model with a\nsinglet superfield. This not only allows for the annihilation channel into\nbottom-quark pairs to be implemented, but also provides new possibilities for\nannihilation into Higgs-pseudoscalar pairs. We show that the fit to the\ngamma-ray excess for the Higgs-pseudoscalar channel can be just as good as for\nannihilation into bottom-quark pairs. Moreover, in the parameter range of\ninterest, the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model solves the mu-problem and\ncan explain the 125 GeV Higgs mass with improved naturalness. We also consider\nan extension by adding a right-handed neutrino superfield with the right-handed\nsneutrino acting as a dark matter candidate. Interestingly, this allows for the\nannihilation into pseudoscalar pairs which also provide a good fit to the\ngamma-ray excess. Furthermore, in the case of a neutralino LSP, the late decay\nof a sneutrino NLSP can non-thermally produce the observed relic abundance.\nFinally, the WIMP annihilation into scalar pairs allows for the possibility of\ndetecting the Higgs or pseudoscalar decay into two photons, providing a\nsmoking-gun signal of the model. \n\n"}

The parameter used in earlier versions of this model, referred to as\nthe reflection strength, is unsatisfactory, and it has been superseded by a\nparameter that provides insight into the accretion geometry, namely the\nreflection fraction. The reflection fraction is defined as the ratio of the\ncoronal intensity illuminating the disk to the coronal intensity that reaches\nthe observer. The relxill model combines a general relativistic ray-tracing\ncode and a photoionization code to compute the component of radiation reflected\nfrom an accretion that is illuminated by an internal source. The reflection\nfraction is a particularly important parameter for relativistic models with\nwell-defined geometry, such as the lamppost model, which is a focus of this\npaper. Relativistic spectra are compared for three inclinations and for four\nvalues of the key parameter of the lamppost model, namely the height above the\nblack hole of the illuminating, on-axis point source.

Progressing further in dark matter physics requires being able\nto understand structure formation in the non-linear regime, both for CDM and\nits alternatives. This short note describes a calculation, and accompanying\ncode, WarmAndFuzzy, incorporating the popular models of warm and fuzzy dark\nmatter (WDM and FDM) into the standard halo model to compute the non-linear\nmatter power spectrum. The FDM halo model power spectrum has not been computed\nbefore. The FDM implementation models ultralight axions and other scalar fields\nwith $m_a\\approx 10^{-22}\\text{ eV}$. The WDM implementation models thermal WDM\nwith mass $m_X\\approx 1\\text{ keV}$. The halo model shows that differences\nbetween WDM, FDM, and CDM survive at low redshifts in the quasi-linear and\nfully non-linear regimes.

The\nwave has been identified in both reflected sunlight from amateur observations\nbetween 2010 and 2015, thermal infrared imaging from the Very Large Telescope\nand near infrared imaging from the Infrared Telescope Facility.

The wave is moving westward at a\nphase speed slower (i.e., less negative) than the peak retrograde wind speed\n(-62 m/s), and is therefore moving east with respect to the SEBs jet peak.\nUnlike the retrograde NEBn jet near 17N, which is a location of strong vertical\nwind shear that sometimes hosts Rossby wave activity, the SEBs jet remains\nretrograde throughout the upper troposphere, suggesting the SEBs pattern cannot\nbe interpreted as a classical Rossby wave.

Abstract: Modified gravity theories are a popular alternative to dark energy as a\npossible explanation for the observed accelerating cosmic expansion, and their\ncosmological tests are currently an active research field. Studies in recent\nyears have been increasingly focused on testing these theories in the nonlinear\nregime, which is computationally demanding. Here we show that, under certain\ncircumstances, a whole class of theories can be ruled out by using background\ncosmology alone. This is possible because certain classes of models (i) are\nfundamentally incapable of producing specific background expansion histories,\nand (ii) said histories are incompatible with local gravity tests.

We review this\napproach and its application to density peaks providing several worked-out\nexamples. We then critically discuss the recent proposal to use constrained\nrealisations to modify the linear density field within and around the\nLagrangian patches that form dark-matter haloes. The ambitious concept is to\nforge `genetically modified' haloes with some desired properties after the\nnon-linear evolution. We demonstrate that the original implementation of this\nmethod is not exact but approximate because it tacitly assumes that protohaloes\nsample a set of random points with a fixed mean overdensity. We show that\ncarrying out a full genetic modification is a formidable and daunting task\nrequiring a mathematical understanding of what determines the biased locations\nof protohaloes in the linear density field. We discuss approximate solutions\nbased on educated guesses regarding the nature of protohaloes.

This technique allows us to explore the\nfreedom around the original algorithm for genetic modification. We find that\nthe quantity which is most sensitive to changes is the halo mass-accretion rate\nat the mass scale on which the constraints are set.

Using 162 GRBs with measured redshifts\nand spectra, we applied a local regression technique to calibrate the $E_{p,\ni}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation against the type Ia SN data to build a calibrated GRB\nHubble diagram. We tested the possible redshift dependence of the correlation\nand its effect on the Hubble diagram. Finally, we used the GRB Hubble diagram\nto investigate the dark energy EOS.

The spectroscopic signature of the redshift evolution is correlated\nat 98% with the signature of varying luminosity, indicating that they arise\nfrom the same physical mechanism. At a fixed luminosity, the average C IV FWHM\ndecreases with increasing redshift and is anti-correlated with C IV EW. The\nspectroscopic signature associated with C IV FWHM suggests that the trends in\nluminosity and redshift are likely caused by a superposition of effects that\nare related to black hole mass and Eddington ratio. The redshift evolution is\nthe consequence of a changing balance between these two quantities as quasars\nevolve toward a population with lower typical accretion rates at a given black\nhole mass. \n\n"}

In this paper\nwe present a third possibility, using only dark matter and ordinary matter. The\nmechanism relies on the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter\nthrough an effective metric. Dark matter couples to an Einstein-frame metric,\nand experiences a matter-dominated, decelerating cosmology up to the present\ntime. Ordinary matter couples to an effective metric that depends also on the\nDM density, in such a way that it experiences late-time acceleration. Linear\ndensity perturbations are stable and propagate with arbitrarily small sound\nspeed, at least in the case of `pressure' coupling.

The outer and inner regions are taken\nto be the Ba\\~{n}ados-Teitelbom-Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime and the vacuum ground\nstate anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, respectively. By applying the first law\nof thermodynamics to the extremal shell one shows that its entropy is an\narbitrary function of the gravitational area $A_+$ alone, $S=S(A_+)$. When the\nshell approaches its own gravitational radius $r_+$ and turns into an extremal\nrotating BTZ black hole, it is found that the entropy of the spacetime remains\nsuch a function of $A_+$. It is thus vindicated, that extremal black holes,\nhere extremal BTZ black holes, have different properties from the corresponding\nnonextremal black holes, which have the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S(A_+)=\n\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. It is argued that for\nthe extremal case $0\\leq S(A_+)\\leq \\frac{A_+}{4G}$. Thus, rather than having\njust two entropies for extremal black holes, as previous results debated, 0 and\n$\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, it is shown that extremal black holes may have a continuous\nrange of entropies, limited by precisely those two entropies. Surely, the\nentropy that a particular extremal black hole picks must depend on past\nprocesses, notably on how it was formed. It is also found a remarkable relation\nbetween the third law of thermodynamics and the impossibility for a massive\nbody to reach the velocity of light. In the procedure, it becomes clear that\nthere are two distinct angular velocities for the shell, the mechanical and\nthermodynamic angular velocities.

For example, symbiotic stars without shell burning on\ntheir white dwarfs have been revealed through their X-ray emission, UV excess,\nand UV variability. These purely accretion powered symbiotic stars have much\nweaker optical emission lines than those with shell burning, and are therefore\nharder to discover. Yet they may be as numerous as symbiotic stars with shell\nburning. Interestingly, both types of symbiotic stars are capable of driving\nstrong outflows, leading to colliding wind X-ray emission and spatially\nresolved jets. For nova eruptions, the most surprising discovery has been that\nthey are capable of particle acceleration as evidenced by Fermi detection of\nnovae as transient GeV gamma-ray sources.

Analysis shows that for positive\nalpha's the scalar curvature does not drop to zero at the star surface (as in\nGeneral Relativity) but exponentially decreases with distance. Also the stellar\nmass bounded by star surface decreases when the value alpha increases.\nNonetheless distant observers would observe a gravitational mass due to\nappearance of a so-called gravitational sphere around the star. The non-zero\ncurvature contribution to the gravitational mass eventually is shown to\ncompensate the stellar mass decrease for growing alpha's. We perform our\nanalysis for several equations of state including purely hadronic\nconfigurations as well as hyperons and quark stars. In all cases, we assess\nthat the relation between the parameter $\\alpha$ and the gravitational mass\nweakly depend upon the chosen equation of state. Another interesting feature is\nthe increase of the star radius in comparison to General Relativity for stars\nwith masses close to maximal, whereas for intermediate masses around 1.4-1.6\nsolar masses, the radius of star depends upon alpha very weakly. Also the\ndecrease in the mass bounded by star surface may cause the surface redshift to\ndecrease in R^2-gravity when compared to Einsteinian predictions. This effect\nis shown to hardly depend upon the observed gravitational mass. Finally, for\nnegative values of alpha our analysis shows that outside the star the scalar\ncurvature has damped oscillations but the contribution of the gravitational\nsphere into the gravitational mass increases indefinitely with radial distance\nputting into question the very existence of such relativistic stars. \n\n"}

Strong\ngas inflows produced during galaxy-galaxy interactions or as a result of strong\nlocal instabilities in gas-rich discs are able to produce both a quick dilution\nof the central gas-phase metallicity and a sudden increase of the sSFR. Our\nsimulations show that, during these events, a correlation between the\nmetallicity gradients and the sSFR can be set up if strong gas inflows are\ntriggered in the central regions in short timescales. Simulated galaxies\nwithout experiencing strong disturbances evolve smoothly without modifying the\nmetallicity gradients. Gas-rich systems show large dispersion along the\ncorrelation. The dispersion in the observed relation could be interpreted as\nproduced by the combination of galaxies with different gas-richness and/or\nexperiencing different types of interactions.

This thesis concerns an approach to\ntest such models known as \"Effective Theory of Dark Energy\" . It applies to all\nmodels where general relativity is modified by adding a single scalar degree of\nfreedom, called \"scalar-tensor theories\". In Chapter 1 I summarise the most\ngeneral class of such theories currently known, called \"Degenerate higher-Order\nScalar-Tensor\" (DHOST) theories. In Chapter 2, I introduce the effective theory\nof dark energy. The inclusion of a general coupling between matter and the\ngravitational sector is the subject of Chapter 3.

As the disk accretion rate increases, the disk innermost regions\nwould change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk (SAD).\nWhile JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce hard states (paper II),\nthe existence of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra non local cooling term.\nWe investigate the thermal structure and associated spectra of such a hybrid\ndisk configuration.

A small fraction of stars is expected, however, to follow the global\ndark matter shape of the cluster.

We investigate how these\nvery different, but somewhat complementary, processes change the optical depth\nof the circumburst medium. To this end, we adopt a canonical distribution of\ngraphite and silicate grain sizes, and a simple fragmentation model, and we\ncompute the post-burst/optical flash/afterglow optical depth of a circumburst\ncloud of constant density n and size R as a function of burst and afterglow\nisotropic-equivalent X-ray energy E and spectral index alpha, and optical flash\nisotropic-equivalent peak luminosity L: This improves upon previous analyses\nthat consider circumburst dust of a uniform grain size. We find that\ncircumburst clouds do not significantly extinguish (tau < 0.3) the optical\nafterglow if R < 10L_{49}^{1/2} pc, fairly independent of n, E, and alpha, or\nif N_H < 5x10^{20} cm^{-2}.

Most of these are relatively\nisolated, spiral galaxies with smooth disks. We find no cluster members with a\nstarburst or post-starburst spectrum. The striking similarity between the\nspectral and morphological properties of galaxies in these clusters and those\nof galaxies in more massive systems at similar redshifts implies that the\nphysical processes responsible for truncating star formation in galaxies are\nnot restricted to the rare, rich cluster environment, but are viable in much\nmore common environments.

The observed distribution shows a sharp peak\nat P_f ~ 0.55 d, which is primarily due to the RRab variables, whereas the\nmodel predictions instead indicate that the distribution should be more uniform\nin P_f, with a buildup of variables with shorter periods (P_f < 0.5 d).\nDetailed statistical tests show, for the first time, that the observed and\npredicted distributions are incompatible with one another at a high\nsignificance level. We show that the sharp peak in the M3 period distribution\nreceives a significant contribution from the Blazhko variables in the cluster.\nWe also show that M15 (NGC 7078) and M68 (NGC 4590) show similar peaks in their\nP_f distributions, which in spite of being located at a similar P_f value as\nM3's, can be primarily ascribed to the RRc variables.

In particular, we explore the degree to which the radial positions of\ngalaxy clusters can be determined tomographically, by using photometric\nredshifts of background source galaxies. We quantify the errors in the\ntomographic redshifts, and study their dependence on mass, redshift, detection\nsignificance, and filtering scheme.

These galaxies have been observed as\npart of the NUGA CO project, aimed at the study of AGN fueling mechanisms. Our\ncalculations allow us to derive the characteristic time-scales for gas flows\nand discuss whether torques from the stellar potentials are efficient enough to\ndrain the gas angular momentum in the inner 1 kpc of these galaxies. Results\nindicate paradoxically that feeding should be thwarted close to the AGN: in the\nfour cases analyzed, gravity torques are mostly positive inside r~200pc,\nresulting in no inflow on these scales. As a possible solution for the paradox,\nwe speculate that the agent responsible for driving inflow to still smaller\nradii is transient and thus presently absent in the stellar potential.\nAlternatively, the gravity torque barrier associated with the ILR of the bars\nin these galaxies could be overcome by other mechanisms that become competitive\nin due time against gravity torques. We find that viscosity can counteract\nmoderate--to--low gravity torques on the gas if it acts on a nuclear ring of\nhigh gas surface density contrast and a few 100pc size. We propose an\nevolutionary scenario in which gravity torques and viscosity act in concert to\nproduce recurrent episodes of activity during the typical lifetime of any\ngalaxy. In this scenario the recurrence of activity in galaxies is indirectly\nrelated to that of the bar instabilities. \n\n"}

To reach this goal, classical pupil apodization\n(CPA) unfortunately requires most of the light gathered by the telescope to be\nabsorbed, resulting in poor throughput and low angular resolution.\nPhase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) of the telescope pupil (Guyon 2003)\ncombines the advantages of classical pupil apodization (particularly low\nsensitivity to low order aberrations) with full throughput, no loss of angular\nresolution and little chromaticity, which makes it, theoretically, an extremely\nattractive coronagraph for direct imaging of ETPs.

All progenitor models we have tested with our Newtonian code\nexplode. We investigate the roles of the Standing-Accretion-Shock-Instability\n(SASI), the excitation of core g-modes, the generation of core acoustic power,\nthe ejection of matter with r-process potential, the wind-like character of the\nexplosion, and the fundamental anisotropy of the blasts. We find that the\nbreaking of spherical symmetry is central to the supernova phenomenon and the\nblasts, when top-bottom asymmetric, are self-collimating. We see indications\nthat the initial explosion energies are larger for the more massive\nprogenitors, and smaller for the less massive progenitors, and that the\nneutrino contribution to the explosion energy may be an increasing function of\nprogenitor mass. The degree of explosion asymmetry we obtain is completely\nconsistent with that inferred from the polarization measurements of Type Ic\nsupernovae.

A large number of high redshift galaxy candidates have been\nidentified within the HUDF, but until now analysis of their properties has been\nhampered by the difficulty of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for these faint\ngalaxies.

We use a sample of low luminosity radio galaxies\n(LLRGs) for comparison. In both Seyfert and LLRGs samples, X-ray and radio\nluminosities are significantly correlated over 8 orders of magnitude,\nindicating that the X-ray and radio emission sources are strongly coupled.\nMoreover, both samples show a similar regression slope, L(X)$\\propto$\nL(R)^(0.97), but Seyfert galaxies are three orders of magnitude less luminous\nin the radio band than LLRGs. This suggests that either similar physical\nmechanisms are responsible for the observed emission or a combination of\ndifferent mechanisms ends up producing a similar correlation slope. Indeed, the\ncommon belief for LLRG is that both the X-ray and radio emission are likely\ndominated by a relativistic jet component, while in Seyfert galaxies the X-ray\nemission probably arises from a disk-corona system and the radio emission is\nattributed to a jet/outflow component.

SN1998bw was unusually bright at maximum light\nand expansion velocities were large making SN1998bw a possible candidate for a\n\"hypernova\" with explosion energies exceeding 10^{52} erg.

In the brane world\nscenario anisotropy at the singularity is suppressed by an effective quadratic\nequation of state. There is no reason why the effective EoS of matter should be\nlinear at the highest energies, and a non-linear EoS may describe dark energy\nor unified dark matter (Paper I, astro-ph/0512224). In view of this, here we\nstudy the effects of a quadratic EoS in homogenous and inhomogeneous\ncosmological models in general relativity, in order to understand if in this\ncontext the quadratic EoS can isotropize the universe at early times. With\nrespect to Paper I, here we use the simplified EoS P=alpha rho + rho^2/rho_c,\nwhich still allows for an effective cosmological constant and phantom behavior,\nand is general enough to analyze the dynamics at high energies.

Preheating is the exponentially rapid transfer of energy from the\nnearly homogeneous inflaton field to fluctuations of other fields and/or the\ninflaton itself. This rapid transfer leaves these fields in a highly nonthermal\nstate with energy concentrated in infrared modes. We have performed lattice\nsimulations of the evolution of interacting scalar fields during and after\npreheating for a variety of inflationary models. We have formulated a set of\ngeneric rules that govern the thermalization process in all of these models.\nNotably, we see that once one of the fields is amplified through parametric\nresonance or other mechanisms it rapidly excites other coupled fields to\nexponentially large occupation numbers. These fields quickly acquire nearly\nthermal spectra in the infrared, which gradually propagates into higher\nmomenta. Prior to the formation of total equilibrium, the excited fields group\ninto subsets with almost identical characteristics (e.g. group effective\ntemperature). The way fields form into these groups and the properties of the\ngroups depend on the couplings between them.

We\nshow that $p$-brane states which wind around the extra dimension propagate\nsmoothly and unambiguously across the orbifold plane collision.

Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the acceleration of the Universe can be\nexplained as the backreaction effect of superhorizon perturbations using second\norder perturbation theory.

In such a gedanken universe it is possible to compute the deceleration\nparameter $q_0$ measured by comoving observers using local covariant Taylor\nexpansions rather than using second order perturbation theory. The result\nindicates that second order corrections to $q_0$ are present, but shows that if\n$q_0$ is negative then its magnitude is constrained to be less than or of the\norder of the square of the peculiar velocity on Hubble scales today.

In almost all the earlier\nanalyzes, unlike the canonical scalar field driven inflation, the\ntrans-Planckian effects are introduced to the scalar/tensor perturbation\nequations in an ad hoc manner -- without calculating the stress-tensor of the\ncosmological perturbations from the covariant Lagrangian. In this work, we\nperform the gauge-invariant cosmological perturbations for the single-scalar\nfield inflation with the Jacobson-Corley dispersion relation by computing the\nfluctuations of all the fields including the unit time-like vector field which\ndefines a preferred rest frame. We show that: (i) The non-linear effects\nintroduce corrections only to the perturbed energy density. The corrections to\nthe energy density vanish in the super-Hubble scales.
