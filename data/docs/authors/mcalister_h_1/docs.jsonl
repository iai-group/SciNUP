Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations.

In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

Abstract: The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship\n(M*-SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of\ngalaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with\na slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not\nonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other\nobservations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect\nmeasurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are\nobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is\nconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards\nmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is\ninvestigated in which the characteristic mass Mhat where the IMF turns over\nincreases with redshift. The observed and predicted M*-SFR evolution may be\nbrought into agreement if Mhat=0.5(1+z)^2 Mo out to z~2. Such evolution broadly\nmatches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting\nz=0 cumulative IMF is similar to the paunchy IMF favored by Fardal et al to\nreconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil\nlight measures.

This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution. In\nour model, the weaker CSM interaction giving rise to SN2006gy's characteristic\nType IIn spectrum and soft X-rays is not linked to the power source of the\nvisual continuum; instead, it arises after the blast wave breaks free of the\nopaque shell into the surrounding wind.

The faint X-ray source RX J1836.2+5925 that has been proposed\nas a possible counterpart of 3EG J1835+5918 is well within the AGILE error box.\nFuture continuous monitoring (both by AGILE and GLAST) is needed to confirm the\ngamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that is\ncurrently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts. \n\n"}

These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

The rotation curves were derived by\ninteractively fitting model data cubes to the observed cubes, taking rotation\ncurve shape, HI distribution, inclination, and the size of the beam into\naccount. This makes it possible to correct for the effects of beam smearing.\nThe dwarf galaxies in our sample have rotation-curve shapes that are similar to\nthose of late-type spiral galaxies, in the sense that their rotation curves,\nwhen expressed in units of disk scale lengths, rise as steeply in the inner\nparts and start to flatten at two disk scale lengths. None of the galaxies in\nour sample have solid-body rotation curves that extend beyond three scale\nlengths. The logarithmic outer rotation curve slopes are similar between\nlate-type dwarf and spiral galaxies. Thus, whether the flat part of the\nrotation curve is reached seems to depend more on the extent of the rotation\ncurve than on its amplitude.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation.

Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

We conclude that the strong\ndependence of the density PDF on the type of forcing must be taken into account\nin any theory using the PDF to predict properties of star formation.

In this paper we apply a\nspecific approach to spectral connectivity analysis (SCA; Lee & Wasserman 2009)\ncalled diffusion map. SCA is a class of non-linear techniques for transforming\nobserved data (e.g., photometric colours for each galaxy, where the data lie on\na complex subset of p-dimensional space) to a simpler, more natural coordinate\nsystem wherein we apply regression to make redshift predictions. As SCA relies\nupon eigen-decomposition, our training set size is limited to ~ 10,000\ngalaxies; we use the Nystrom extension to quickly estimate diffusion\ncoordinates for objects not in the training set. We apply our method to 350,738\nSDSS main sample galaxies, 29,816 SDSS luminous red galaxies, and 5,223\ngalaxies from DEEP2 with CFHTLS ugriz photometry. For all three datasets, we\nachieve prediction accuracies on par with previous analyses, and find that use\nof the Nystrom extension leads to a negligible loss of prediction accuracy\nrelative to that achieved with the training sets. As in some previous analyses\n(e.g., Collister & Lahav 2004, Ball et al. 2008), we observe that our\npredictions are generally too high (low) in the low (high) redshift regimes. We\ndemonstrate that this is a manifestation of attenuation bias, wherein\nmeasurement error (i.e., uncertainty in diffusion coordinates due to\nuncertainty in the measured fluxes/magnitudes) reduces the slope of the\nbest-fit regression line. Mitigation of this bias is necessary if we are to use\nphotometric redshift estimates produced by computationally efficient empirical\nmethods in precision cosmology. \n\n"}

The framework\nis developed from a randomized initial condition that leads to a sample of\nsimulated SN Ia whose Ni56 masses have a similar average and range to those\nobserved, and have many other modestly realistic features such as the velocity\nextent of intermediate mass elements. The intended purpose is to enable\nstatistically well-defined studies of both physical and theoretical parameters\nof the SN Ia explosion simulation. We present here a thorough description of\nthe outcome of the SN Ia explosions produced by our current simulations. A\nfirst application of this framework is utilized to study the dependence of the\nSN Ia on the Ne22 content, which is known to be directly influenced by the\nprogenitor stellar population's metallicity.

Although it cools efficiently, this gas remains\nrelatively hot, at a temperature near T ~ 8000 K, and consequently might be\nable to avoid fragmentation and collapse directly into a supermassive black\nhole (SMBH). In order for H_2--formation and cooling to be strongly suppressed,\nthe gas must be irradiated by a sufficiently intense ultraviolet (UV) flux. We\nperformed a suite of three--dimensional hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement\n(AMR) simulations of gas collapse in three different protogalactic halos with\nT_vir >~ 10^4 K, irradiated by a UV flux with various intensities and spectra.\nWe determined the critical specific intensity, Jcrit, required to suppress H_2\ncooling in each of the three halos. For a hard spectrum representative of\nmetal--free stars, we find (in units of 10^{-21} erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1} sr^{-1}\ncm^{-2}) 10^4<Jcrit<10^5, while for a softer spectrum, which is characteristic\nof a normal stellar population, and for which H^{-} --dissociation is\nimportant, we find 30<Jcrit<300. These values are a factor of 3--10 lower than\nprevious estimates. We attribute the difference to the higher, more accurate\nH_2 collisional dissociation rate we adopted. The reduction in Jcrit\nexponentially increases the number of rare halos exposed to super--critical\nradiation.

The MODS data reach J=24.2, H=23.1, K=23.1 (5sigma, Vega\nmagnitude) over 103 arcmin^2 (wide) and J=25.1, H=23.7, K=24.1 over 28 arcmin^2\n(deep) in the GOODS-North region.

The normalization\nof the mass function decreases with redshift and the integrated stellar mass\ndensity becomes ~ 8-18% of the local value at z~2 and ~ 4-9% at z~3, which are\nconsistent with results of previous studies in general fields. Furthermore, we\nfound that the low-mass slope becomes steeper with redshift from alpha ~- 1.3\nat z~1 to alpha ~- 1.6 at z~3, and that the evolution of the number density of\nlow-mass (10^9-10^10 Msun) galaxies is weaker than that of M* (~10^11 Msun)\ngalaxies.

However, over the radial range ~10-30kpc, the mass\nprofiles agree within the 1-sigma errors, indicating that even in this highly\ndisturbed system, agreement can be sought at an acceptable level of\nsignificance over intermediate radii, with both methods also indicating the\nneed for a dark matter halo.

We consider for the\nfirst time a non force-free field composed of a mixture of poloidal and\ntoroidal magnetic fields and we propose a specific configuration to illustrate\nour purpose. In the present paper, we estimate the relative role of the\ndifferent terms which appear in the modified stellar structure equations. We\nnote that the Lorentz tension plays a non negligible role in addition to the\nmagnetic pressure. This is interesting because most of the previous stellar\nevolution codes ignored that term and the geometry of the field. The solar\nstructure perturbations are, as already known, small and consequently we have\nbeen able to estimate each term semi-analytically. We develop a general\ntreatment to calculate the global modification of the structure and of the\nenergetic balance. We estimate also the gravitational multipolar moments\nassociated with the presence of a fossil large-scale magnetic field in\nradiative zone. The values given for the young Sun help the future\nimplementation in stellar evolution codes. This work can be repeated for any\nother field configuration and prepares the achievement of a solar MHD model\nwhere we will follow the transport of such field on secular timescales and the\nassociated transport of momentum and chemicals.

The\ncomposition of the models is also consistent with C abundances measured in\nmainstream silicon carbide grains.

The pre-main sequence (PMS) locus in the\ncolour-magnitude diagram is well reproduced by Palla & Stahler isochrones with\nan age of 3 to 5 1E+05 yr, confirming the very young age of the cluster.

We show that the pairing process is\nlargely dominated by chance alignment so that physical pairs are difficult to\ndisentangle from spurious ones based on our single epoch observation. Yet, we\nidentify 150 likely bound pairs, 30% of these with a separation smaller than\n0.5 arcsec (~1300AU). We further show that at the 2-sigma level massive stars\nhave more companions than lower-mass stars and that those companions are\nrespectively brighter on average, thus more massive. Finally, we find some\nhints of mass segregation for stars heavier than about 10 Msun. If confirmed,\nthe observed degree of mass segregation could be explained by dynamical\nevolution, despite the young age of the cluster. \n\n"}

I: First Systematics Abstract: Star clusters are studied widely both as benchmarks for stellar evolution\nmodels and in their own right. Cluster age and mass distributions within\ngalaxies are probes of star formation histories, and of cluster formation and\ndisruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the Universe is small,\nand it is well known that the integrated fluxes and colors have broad\nprobability distributions, due to small numbers of bright stars. This paper\ngoes beyond the description of predicted probability distributions, and\npresents results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an\nexplicitly stochastic context. The method developed is Bayesian. It provides\nposterior probability distributions in the age-mass-extinction space, using\nmulti-wavelength photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of clusters of finite stellar masses. Both UBVI and UBVIK datasets\nare considered, and the study conducted in this paper is restricted to the\nsolar metallicity. We first reassess and explain errors arising from the use of\nstandard analysis methods, which are based on continuous population synthesis\nmodels: systematic errors on ages and random errors on masses are large, while\nsystematic errors on masses tend to be smaller. The age-mass distributions\nobtained after analysis of a synthetic sample are very similar to those found\nfor real galaxies in the literature. The Bayesian approach on the other hand,\nis very successful in recovering the input ages and masses. Taking stochastic\neffects into account is important, more important for instance than the choice\nof adding or removing near-IR data in many cases. We found no immediately\nobvious reason to reject priors inspired by previous (standard) analyses of\ncluster populations in galaxies, i.e. cluster distributions that scale with\nmass as M^-2 and are uniform on a logarithmic age scale. \n\n"}

Mass is the most important parameter\nof a planet and can only be measured by observing the motion of the star around\nthe planet-star center of mass. A single image of a planet, however, does not\nprovide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable\nzone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the\nplanet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple\nepochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast. In this paper we address the question: \"Can a prior\nastrometric mission that can identify which stars have Earthlike planets\nsignificantly improve the science yield of a mission to image exo-Earths?\" We\nfind that the Occulting Ozone Observatory (a small external occulter mission\nthat cannot measure spectra) could confirm the orbits of ~4 to ~5 times as many\nexo-Earths if an astrometric mission preceded it to identify which stars had\nsuch planets. We find that in the case of an internal coronagraph, a survey of\nthe nearest ~60 stars could be done with a telescope of half the size if an\nastrometric mission had first identified the presence of Earth-like planets in\nthe habitable zone and measured their orbital parameters. \n\n"}

Using the Spitzer Space Telescope and its IRAC camera on the\npost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation of\nHD80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 January 2010. We complement this\nphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneously\nperformed with SOPHIE at Haute-Provence Observatory. This provides radial\nvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previously\nuncovered with spectroscopy. This new data set allows the parameters of this\nsingular planetary system to be significantly refined. We obtained a\nplanet-to-star radius ratio R_p/R_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lower\nthan the one measured from previous ground observations. We detected a feature\nin the Spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. We also found a\ntransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; this\ncould be caused by actual TTVs due to an additional body in the system or by\nunderestimated systematic uncertainties. The sky-projected angle between the\nspin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to\nbe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin\nanomaly. This allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitively\nrejected.

The different types of radioactive decay, alpha,\nbeta, and gamma decay, all are different types of interactions causing the\nsame, spontaneous, and time-independent decay of an unstable nucleus into\nanother and more stable nucleus. Nuclear reactions in cosmic sites re-arrange\nthe basic constituents of atomic nuclei (neutrons and protons) among the\ndifferent configurations which are allowed by Nature, thus producing\nradioactive isotopes as a by-product. Throughout cosmic history, such reactions\noccur in different sites, and lead to rearrangements of the relative abundances\nof cosmic nuclei, a process called cosmic chemical evolution, which can be\nstudied through the observations of radioactivity. The special role of\nradioactivity in such studies is contributed by the intrinsic decay of such\nmaterial after it has been produced in cosmic sites. This brings in a new\naspect, the clock of the radioactive decay. Observational studies of cosmic\nradioactivities intrinsically obtain isotopic information which are at the\nheart of cosmic nucleosynthesis. They are best performed by precision mass\nspectroscopy in terrestrial laboratories, which has been combined with\nsophisticated radiochemistry to extract meteoritic components originating from\noutside the solar system, and by spectroscopy of characteristic gamma-ray lines\nemitted upon radioactive decay in cosmic environments and measured with\nspace-based telescopes.

The radial expansion of the gradually cooling\nphotosphere gives rise to a near-constant luminosity up to >~100d after\nexplosion. The photosphere remains in the outer 0.5Msun of the ejecta for up to\n~50d after explosion. As the photosphere reaches the edge of the helium core,\nthe SN luminosity drops by an amount mitigated by the progenitor radius and the\n56Ni mass. Synthetic light-curves exhibit a bell-shape morphology, evolving\nfaster for more compact progenitors, and with an earlier peak and narrower\nwidth in bluer filters. UV and U-band fluxes are very sensitive to\nline-blanketing, the metallicity, and the adopted model atoms.

II.\n  Measuring the Size of the \"Frozen\" Zone Abstract: Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the\ninitial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding\nthat tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless\ncollisional fragmentation is effective.

These grains are\nexpected to carry nonzero negative charges in the weakly ionized disks, but its\neffect on their collisional growth has not been fully understood so far. In\nthis paper, we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust\nsize distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a\nweakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions.\nTo clarify the role of the size distribution, we divide our analysis into two\nsteps. First, we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming\na monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We show that the monodisperse\ngrowth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is\nmet, as is already expected in the previous work. Second, we numerically\nsimulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski's method to see how the outcome\nchanges when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve. We find that,\nunder certain conditions, the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a\nlimited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the\ndust mass in the system. This occurs because remaining small aggregates\nefficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being\nstrongly charged. We obtain a set of simple criteria that allows us to predict\nhow the size distribution evolves for a given condition.

Recent observations have shown\nthat a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrograde\norbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin.\nIt is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of\nthese misaligned hot Jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes after\nthe gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed\ninclination and eccentricity distributions. One particularly promising\ncandidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in the\nnon-linear regime of tides. Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scattered\ninto an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being\nless than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or\ncompletely ejected from the system. We find that as few as 5 and as many as 18\nof the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for\nscattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets must\nhave migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to\ntheir current positions. If stellar tides are unimportant $(Q_\\ast \\gtrsim\n10^7)$, disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot Jupiters\npresent in these systems. Additionally, we find that the disruption and/or\nejection of Jupiter-mass planets deposits a Sun's worth of angular momentum\nonto the host star. For systems in which planet-planet scattering is common, we\npredict that planetary hosts have up to a 35% chance of possessing an obliquity\nrelative to the invariable plane of greater than 90 degrees. \n\n"}

Analysis of the toroidal field component Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are believed to be old pulsars spun up by a surrounding\naccretion disc.

In some well-known analytic models, developed in the 1980s,\nthe B_phi profile was taken to be proportional to the relative angular velocity\nbetween the disc plasma and the neutron star, multiplied by a vertical dipolar\nfield. The present work stands in the line of improving those models,\nsuggesting a new profile for B.

Multimode pulsations can be also reconstructed in a\nnatural manner, as well as pulsations on components with tilted rotation axis\nof known direction.

Here, we show with high-resolution, adaptive-mesh\nsimulations that MHD turbulence is efficiently driven by extracting energy from\nthe gravitational potential during the collapse of a dense gas cloud.\nCompressible motions generated during the contraction are converted into\nsolenoidal, turbulent motions, leading to a natural energy ratio of E_sol/E_tot\nof approximately 2/3. We find that the energy injection scale of gravity-driven\nturbulence is close to the local Jeans scale. If small seeds of the magnetic\nfield are present, they are amplified exponentially fast via the small-scale\ndynamo process. The magnetic field grows most efficiently on the smallest\nscales, for which the stretching, twisting, and folding of field lines, and the\nturbulent vortices are sufficiently resolved. We find that this scale\ncorresponds to about 30 grid cells in the simulations. We thus suggest a new\nminimum resolution criterion of 30 cells per Jeans length in\n(magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating gas, in order to\nresolve turbulence on the Jeans scale, and to capture minimum dynamo\namplification of the magnetic field.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope. In\nthis paper, we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the\ncritical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of\nthe increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature\ngradient. Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form\nmassive envelopes before disc dissipation.

The aggregated X-ray spectra appear unlike standard sub-Eddington\naccretion state spectra which, alongside the lack of discernible variability at\nany energy, argues strongly against conventional two-component, sub-Eddington\nmodels. Although the lack of variability could be consistent with\ndisc-dominated spectra, sub-Eddington disc models are not sufficiently broad to\nexplain the observed spectra. Fits with a ~ Eddington accretion rate slim disc\nmodel are acceptable, but the fits show that the temperature decreases with\nflux, contrary to expectations, and this is accompanied by the appearance of a\nharder tail to the spectrum.

While many have counted\ngalaxy mergers using a variety of techniques, T_obs(z) for these techniques\nhave been poorly constrained. We address this problem by calibrating three\nmerger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations and\nthree galaxy formation models. We estimate T_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairs\nwith a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator G-M20, and\n(3) the morphology indicator asymmetry A. Then we apply these timescales to the\nobserved merger fractions at z < 1.5 from the recent literature. When our\nphysically-motivated timescales are adopted, the observed galaxy merger rates\nbecome largely consistent. The remaining differences between the galaxy merger\nrates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured by\ndifferent techniques and differing parent galaxy selection.

To determine the large frequency separation as accurately\nas possible a mean large frequency separation computed over several orders is\noften used. It is, however, known that the large frequency separation varies\nwith frequency in a second order effect. From observations it has been shown\nthat this frequency dependence is more important for main-sequence stars than\nit is for red-giant stars. Here we use YREC models to verify and explain this\nobservational result. We find that for stars with R > 8 Rsun the effect of the\nHelium second ionisation zone is relatively small. For these stars the deep\nlocation of the He II zone induces a frequency modulation covering only a few\nlarge separations, while the amplitude of the modulation is low due to the\nrelatively weak and extended He II layer, causing a shallow wide depression in\nthe first adiabatic exponent. For less evolved stars the He II zone is located\ncloser to the surface, and it is more confined, i.e. a deep narrow depression\nin the first adiabatic exponent. This causes frequency modulations with\nrelatively high amplitudes covering up to about 20 large separations, inducing\na relatively large frequency modulation. Additionally, we find that for less\nevolved stars the He II zone is stronger and more localised for more massive\nstars and for stars with low metallicities further increasing the amplitude of\nthe frequency modulation. \n\n"}

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure.

In particular, they can be used to discover and study a variety of\nbinary systems. A large number of binary lenses have already been found through\nmicrolensing surveys and a few of these systems show strong evidence of orbital\nmotion on the timescale of the lensing event. We expect that more binary lenses\nof this kind will be detected in the future. For binaries whose orbital period\nis comparable to the event duration, the orbital motion can cause the lensing\nsignal to deviate drastically from that of a static binary lens. The most\nstriking property of such light curves is the presence of quasi- periodic\nfeatures, which are produced as the source traverses the same regions in the\nrotating lens plane. These repeating features contain information about the\norbital period of the lens. If this period can be extracted, then much can be\nlearned about the lensing system even without performing time-consuming,\ndetailed light curve modeling. However, the relative transverse motion between\nthe source and the lens significantly complicates the problem of period\nextraction. To resolve this difficulty, we present a modification of the\nstandard Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis. We test our method for four\nrepresentative binary lens systems and demonstrate its efficiency in correctly\nextracting binary orbital periods. \n\n"}

I present here a review of the scientific\nliterature, outlining cases of fine-tuning in the classic works of Carter, Carr\nand Rees, and Barrow and Tipler, as well as more recent work. To sharpen the\ndiscussion, the role of the antagonist will be played by Victor Stenger's\nrecent book The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning: Why the Universe is Not Designed for\nUs. Stenger claims that all known fine-tuning cases can be explained without\nthe need for a multiverse. Many of Stenger's claims will be found to be highly\nproblematic.

In our\nmodel, all stars are initially formed as bound or unbound star clusters (SCs)\nformed from giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and the SCs can finally become GCs,\nopen clusters, and field stars depending on physical properties of their host\nGMCs. An essential ingredient of the model is that helium-rich stars are formed\nalmost purely from gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars. The helium-rich star formation is assumed to occur within massive SCs if\nthe masses of the progenitor GMCs are larger than a threshold mass (M_thres).\nThese massive SCs can finally become either massive GCs or helium-rich field\nstars depending on whether they are disintegrated or not. Using this model, we\nshow that if the initial mass functions (IMFs) in galactic spheroids are mildly\ntop-heavy, then the mass fractions of helium-rich main-sequence stars (F_He)\ncan be as large as ~ 0.1 for M_thres=10^7 M_sun. F_He is found to depend on\nIMFs and M_thres such that it can be larger for shallower IMFs and smaller\nM_thres. The inner regions of galactic spheroids show larger F_He in almost all\nmodels. Based on these results, we suggest that if the UV upturn of elliptical\ngalaxies is due to the larger fractions of helium-rich stars, then the origin\ncan be closely associated with top-heavy IMFs in the galaxies. \n\n"}

A false-positive\n  rate of 35% for Kepler close-in giant exoplanet candidates Abstract: The false-positive probability (FPP) of Kepler transiting candidates is a key\nvalue for statistical studies of candidate properties. A previous investigation\nof the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided an estimate for the\nFPP of less than 5% for most of the candidates. We report here the results of\nour radial velocity observations on a sample of 46 Kepler candidates with a\ntransit depth greater than 0.4%, orbital period less than 25 days and host star\nbrighter than Kepler magnitude 14.7. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on\nthe 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to establish the\nnature of the transiting candidates. In this sample, we found five undiluted\neclipsing binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and nine\nnew transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets.

We present a comparison that can\nshow the level of tidal dissipation (friction) as a function of the\ndistribution of the ages of the star and planet system, with known dependencies\non basic star and planet parameters.

Kepler-17 is a G2V sun-like star accompanied by a transiting planet\nwith a mass of ~2.5 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1.486 d, recently\ndiscovered by the Kepler space telescope. This star is highly interesting as a\nyoung solar analogue. Aims. We used about 500 days of high-precision,\nhigh-duty-cycle optical photometry collected by Kepler to study the rotation of\nthe star and the evolution of its photospheric active regions. Methods. We\napplied a maximum-entropy light curve inversion technique to model the flux\nrotational modulation induced by active regions that consist of dark spots and\nbright solar-like faculae with a fixed area ratio. Their configuration was\nvaried after a fixed time interval to take their evolution into account. Active\nregions were used as tracers to study stellar differential rotation, and\nplanetary occultations were used to constrain the latitude of some spots.\nResults. Our modelling approach reproduces the light variations of Kepler-17\nwith a standard deviation of the residuals comparable with the precision of\nKepler photometry. We find several active longitudes where individual active\nregions appear, evolve, and decay with lifetimes comparable to those observed\nin the Sun, although the star has a spotted area ~10-15 times larger than the\nSun at the maximum of the 11-yr cycle. Kepler-17 shows a solar-like latitudinal\ndifferential rotation, but the fast spot evolution prevents a precise\ndetermination of its amplitude. Moveover, the star shows a cyclic variation of\nthe starspot area with a period of 47.1 \\pm 4.5 d, particularly evident during\nthe last 200 days of the observations, similar to the solar Rieger cycles.\nPossible effects of the close-in massive planet on stellar photospheric\nactivity cannot be excluded, but require a long-term monitoring to be\nunambiguously detected. \n\n"}

The analysis of 12 galaxy clusters with excellent\ntotal masses shows a tight correlation between the stellar mass, or stellar\nfraction, and total mass within r500 with negligible intrinsic scatter: the 90%\nupper limit is 0.06 dex, the posterior mean is 0.027 dex. This scatter is\nsimilar to the one of best-determined mass proxies, such as Yx, i.e. the\nproduct of X-ray temperature and gas mass. The size of the cluster sample used\nto determine the intrinsic scatter is small, as in previous works proposing\nlow-scatter proxies because very accurate masses are needed to infer very small\nvalues of intrinsic scatter.

Keck\n  Nuller mid-infrared observations Abstract: We report on high contrast mid-infrared observations of Fomalhaut obtained\nwith the Keck Interferometer Nuller (KIN) showing a small resolved excess over\nthe level expected from the stellar photosphere. The measured null excess has a\nmean value of 0.35% +/- 0.10% between 8 and 11 microns and increases from 8 to\n13 microns. Given the small field of view of the instrument, the source of this\nmarginal excess must be contained within 2AU of Fomalhaut. This result is\nreminiscent of previous VLTI K-band observations, which implied the presence of\na ~ 0.88% excess, and argued that thermal emission from hot dusty grains\nlocated within 6 AU from Fomalhaut was the most plausible explanation. Using a\nparametric 2D radiative transfer code and a Bayesian analysis, we examine\ndifferent dust disk structures to reproduce both the near and mid-infrared data\nsimultaneously. While not a definitive explanation of the hot excess of\nFomalhaut, our model suggests that the most likely inner few AU disk geometry\nconsists of a two-component structure, with two different and spatially\ndistinct grain populations. The 2 to 11 microns data are consistent with an\ninner hot ring of very small (~ 10 to 300 nm) carbon-rich grains concentrating\naround 0.1AU. The second dust population consists of larger grains (size of a\nfew microns to a few tens of microns) located further out in a colder region\nwhere regular astronomical silicates could survive, with an inner edge around\n1AU. From a dynamical point of view, the presence of the inner concentration of\nsub-micron sized grains is surprising, as such grains should be expelled from\nthe inner planetary system by radiation pressure within only a few years.

Unlike standard N-body methods, the COLA method can\nstraightforwardly trade accuracy at small-scales in order to gain computational\nspeed without sacrificing accuracy at large scales. This is especially useful\nfor cheaply generating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required\nto study galaxy clustering and weak lensing, as those catalogs are essential\nfor performing detailed error analysis for ongoing and future surveys of LSS.\nAs an illustration, we ran a COLA-based N-body code on a box of size 100Mpc/h\nwith particles of mass ~5*10^9Msolar/h.

It\nhas been seen as improbable that we would find planets in such a small final\nfraction of their lives. The favored solution has been that the tidal\ndissipation is much weaker than expected, which would mean that the final\ninfall would be a larger fraction of the planets' life. We find no reason to\nexclude the explanation that a small number of planets are continuously sent\nmigrating inwards such that these planets indeed are in the last fraction of\ntheir lives. Following the observation that the distribution of medium planets\ndisfavors tidal dissipation being significantly weaker than has been found from\nobservations of binary stars, we now show that the numbers of planets in such a\n\"flow\" of excess planets migrating inwards is low enough that even depletion of\nthe three-day pileup is a plausible source.

Multi-planet\nevolved systems are particularly complex because of the mutual interactions\nbetween the planets. Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape.

We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape.

To investigate the\nstructural evolution of another type of celestial bodies, we use the MESA code\nto extend these calculations to gaseous planets. We show that this function is\nconserved for all models during the whole planetary evolution and is\nindependent of the planet mass. We also analyse the cases for which this\nfunction is not conserved during some stellar evolutionary phases. For the PMS\nto the WD cooling sequences, we have found a connection between the strong\nvariations of \\Gamma(M, EOS) during the intermediary evolutionary phases and\nthe specific nuclear power. A threshold for the specific nuclear power was\ndetermined. Below this limit this function is invariant (~ 0.4) for these\nmodels, i.e., at the initial and final stages (PMS and WD).

The strength of the emission component of H{\\alpha} increased,\nimplying that the SN was undergoing significant interaction with its\ncircumstellar medium (CSM). These features were blueshifted slightly and showed\na P-Cygni profile, likely indicating that the CSM was directly related to, and\nprobably previously ejected by, the progenitor system itself. These and other\nobservations led Dilday et al. (2012) to conclude that PTF11kx came from a\nsymbiotic nova progenitor like RS Oph. In this work we extend the spectral\ncoverage of PTF11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. These\nspectra of PTF11kx are dominated by H{\\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000\nkm/s), strong Ca II emission features (~10,000 km/s wide), and a blue\n\"quasi-continuum\" due to many overlapping narrow lines of Fe II. Emission from\noxygen, He I, and Balmer lines higher than H{\\alpha} is weak or completely\nabsent at all epochs, leading to large observed H{\\alpha}/H{\\beta} intensity\nratios. The broader (~2000 km/s) H{\\alpha} emission appears to increase in\nstrength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently decreases significantly along\nwith the Ca II emission. Our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility of\nnewly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the red\nwing of H{\\alpha}. During the same epochs, multiple narrow emission features\nfrom the CSM temporally vary in strength. The weakening of the H{\\alpha} and Ca\nII emission at late times is possible evidence that the SN ejecta have\novertaken the majority of the CSM and agrees with models of other strongly\ninteracting SNe Ia. The varying narrow emission features, on the other hand,\nmay indicate that the CSM is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells. \n\n"}

We found that\nstrongly twisted lines ranging from half-turn to one-turn twist were built up\njust before the M6.6- and X2.2 flares and disappeared after that. Because most\nof the twist remaining after these flares was less than half-turn twist, this\nresult suggests that the buildup of magnetic twist over the half-turn twist is\na key process in the production of large flares. On the other hand, even though\nthese strong twists were also built up just before the M1.0 and M1.1 flares,\nmost of them remained afterwords.

We extend previous modeling of SN\nII-P radiation to include photospheric and nebular phases, as well as\nmulti-band light curves and spectra. Our treatment does not assume local\nthermodynamic equilibrium, is time dependent, treats explicitly the effects of\nline blanketing, and incorporates non-thermal processes. We find that the color\nproperties of SNe II-P require large model atoms for FeI and FeII, much larger\nthan adopted in Dessart & Hillier (2011). The color properties also imply RSG\nprogenitors of limited extent (~500Rsun) --- larger progenitor stars produce a\nSN II-P radiation that remains too blue for too long. This finding calls for a\nreduction of RSG radii, perhaps through a strengthening of convective energy\ntransport in RSG envelopes. Increased overshoot and rotation reduce the ratio\nof ejecta to helium-core mass, similarly to an increase in main-sequence mass,\nand thus complicate the inference ofprogenitor masses. In contrast to the great\nsensitivity on progenitor radius, SN II-P color evolution appears insensitive\nto variations in explosion energy.

The correct computation of SN Ia radiation is not exclusively a\nsolution to an \"opacity problem\", characterized by the treatment of a large\nnumber of lines.

Besides handling line blanketing in non-LTE, we show that\nincluding forbidden line transitions of metals is increasingly important for\nthe temperature and ionization of the gas beyond maximum light.

These\nmodels allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will\ntake over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as\na function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find\nthat this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nincreases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop\nan analytic model that reproduces these results.\n  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary\nstate of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to\ndestruction by thermal sweeping.

We use a standard cross-correlation method to\nestimate the redshifts of galaxies, using a template set built using a PCA\nanalysis on a set of simulated, noise-free spectra. Darth Fader employs wavelet\nfiltering to both estimate the continuum & to extract prominent line features\nin each galaxy spectrum. A simple selection criterion based on the number of\nfeatures present in the spectrum is then used to clean the catalogue: galaxies\nwith fewer than six total features are removed as we are unlikely to obtain a\nreliable redshift estimate. Applying our wavelet-based cleaning algorithm to a\nsimulated testing set, we successfully build a clean catalogue including\nextremely low signal-to-noise data (SNR=2.0), for which we are able to obtain a\n5.1% catastrophic failure rate in the redshift estimates (compared with 34.5%\nprior to cleaning).

We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks.

Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes.

Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates.

Those with a more massive\ncomponent filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the\nRoche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes\nthat, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor),\nmass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of\nmass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show\nthat the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive\ncomponent (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the\nvalue determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge\nsticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical)\nmass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting\nfrom the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why\nwe observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to\npredictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the\nThermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass\nequalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with\nthis phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are\ncomparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27\nSD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both\ntypes of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer.

The most\nfavorable cases for producing Vega's exo-zodi have negative radial mass\ngradients, with sub-Saturn- to Jupiter-mass inner planets at 5-10 AU and outer\nplanets of 2.5 to 20 Earth masses. The mechanism fails if a Jupiter-sized\nplanet exists beyond ~15 AU because the planet preferentially ejects\nplanetesimals before they can reach the inner system.

The binary population is shown to be compatible with\nthe Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of\nbinaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic\nsystems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and\nnon-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are\ncompared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting\nnon-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational\nbiases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary\nplanets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the\ndistributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely\ndifferent. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is degenerate with\nthe spread in mutual inclination. Only a minimum occurrence rate can be\nproduced, which we find to be compatible with 9%.

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)!

There were\n108 colour-selected objects: 53 of them were observed in the three OH maser\nlines (1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz), with 24 detections (16 new for 1612 MHz); and\n106 of them were observed in the H2O maser line (22 GHz) with 24 detections (12\nnew). We identify a new potential water fountain source, IRAS19356+0754, with\nlarge velocity coverages of both OH and H2O maser emission. In addition,\nseveral objects with high velocity OH maser emission are reported for the first\ntime. The Q-parameters as well as the infrared [09]-[18] and [18]-[65] AKARI\ncolours of the surveyed objects are then calculated. We suggest that these\ninfrared properties are effective in isolating aspherical from spherical\nobjects, but the morphology may not necessarily be related to the evolutionary\nstatus. Nonetheless, by considering altogether the maser and infrared\nproperties, the efficiency of identifying oxygen-rich late/post-AGB stars could\nbe improved. \n\n"}

Full 3D\n  Simulations toward the Outer Disk Abstract: We perform 3D stratified shearing-box MHD simulations on the gas dynamics of\nprotoplanetary disks threaded by net vertical magnetic field Bz. All three\nnon-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar\ndiffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium\nchemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk. In addition, we find that the vertical magnetic flux\nis strongly concentrated into thin, azimuthally extended shells in most of our\nsimulations beyond 15AU.

We hypothesize that the\nin-situ breakup of small bodies such as asteroids spun to fission during the\ngiant branch phases of stellar evolution provides an important contribution to\nthis debris. The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the\noutward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared\nto the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star\nradiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km\nthat survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of\nabout 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent\ncomponents. This estimate is conservative, and would increase for highly\nasymmetric shapes or incorporation of the inward drag due to giant star stellar\nwind.

Here we report the\ndevelopment of a machine-learning framework capable of inferring fundamental\nstellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) using photometric-brightness\nvariations and color alone. A training set is constructed from a systematic\nspectroscopic survey of variables with Hectospec/MMT. In sum, the training set\nincludes ~9000 spectra, for which stellar parameters are measured using the\nSEGUE Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). We employed the random forest\nalgorithm to perform a non-parametric regression that predicts Teff, log g, and\n[Fe/H] from photometric time-domain observations. Our final, optimized model\nproduces a cross-validated root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 165 K, 0.39 dex,\nand 0.33 dex for Teff, log g, and [Fe/H], respectively. Examining the subset of\nsources for which the SSPP measurements are most reliable, the RMSE reduces to\n125 K, 0.37 dex, and 0.27 dex, respectively, comparable to what is achievable\nvia low-resolution spectroscopy. For variable stars this represents a ~12-20%\nimprovement in RMSE relative to models trained with single-epoch photometric\ncolors. As an application of our method, we estimate stellar parameters for\n~54,000 known variables. We argue that this method may convert photometric\ntime-domain surveys into pseudo-spectrographic engines, enabling the\nconstruction of extremely detailed maps of the Milky Way, its structure, and\nhistory. \n\n"}

Here we finalize the model by finding the correct value of the\npre-factor of the Parikh and Wilczek probability of emission. In fact, that\nexpression has the \"of order\" sign instead of the equality. In general, in this\nkind of leading order tunnelling calculations, the exponent arises indeed from\nthe classical action and the pre-factor is an order Planck constant correction.\nBut in the case of emissions of Hawking quanta, the variation of the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy is order 1 for an emitted particle having energy of\norder the Hawking temperature. As a consequence, the exponent in the Parikh and\nWilczek probability of emission is order unity and one asks what is the real\nsignificance of that scaling if the pre-factor is unknown. Here we solve the\nproblem assuming the unitarity of the black hole (BH) quantum evaporation and\nconsidering the natural correspondence between Hawking radiation and\nquasi-normal modes (QNMs) of excited BHs, in a \"Bohr-like model\" that we\nrecently discussed in a series of papers. In that papers, QNMs are interpreted\nas natural BH quantum levels (the \"electron states\" in the \"Bohr-like model\").\nHere we find the intriguing result that, although in general it is well\napproximated by 1, the pre-factor of the Parikh and Wilczek probability of\nemission depends on the BH quantum level n. We also write down an elegant\nexpression of the probability of emission in terms of the BH quantum levels. \n\n"}

This can lead to residual\ncooling flows and low-level star formation, the physics of which is not well\nunderstood.

Yet the connection between\nhost star metallicity and the properties of small planets is only just\nbeginning to be investigated. It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the\nother hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous\nrelationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.\nThe planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for\ndistinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth.

We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation.

The present study aims to contribute to the set of boundary conditions,\ndefined by observations, which must be met by physical models that describe the\nflickering. In particular, time lags in the occurrence of flickering events at\ndifferent wavelengths over the optical range are examined. To this end, the\ncross-correlation functions (CCFs) of numerous light curves of a sample of CVs\nare analysed that were observed simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously in\ndifferent bands of various photometric systems. Deviations of the maxima of the\nCCFs from zero time-shift indicate a dependence of the flickering activity on\nthe wavelength in the sense that flickering flares reach their maxima slightly\nearlier in the blue range than in the red. While the available observational\nmaterial does not permit detecting this individually in all observed systems,\nthe ensemble of all data clearly shows this effect.

Based on a population synthesis\nmodel, we estimate the fractions of core-collapse supernovae in which the\nlight-curve brightening by the collision can be observed. We find that 0.19% of\ncore-collapse supernova light curves can be observed with the collisional\nbrightening. Type Ibc supernova light curves are more likely to be brightened\nby the collision (0.53%) because of the high fraction of the progenitors being\nin binary systems and their proximity to the companion stars. Type II and IIb\nsupernova light curves are less affected (~1e-3% and ~1e-2%, respectively).\nAlthough the early, slow light-curve declines of some Type IIb and Ibc\nsupernovae are argued to be caused by the collision with the companion star\n(e.g. SN 2008D), the small expected fraction, as well as the unrealistically\nsmall separation required, disfavour the argument. The future transient survey\nby the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is expected to detect ~10 Type Ibc\nsupernovae with the early collisional brightening per year, and they will be\nable to provide information on supernova progenitors in binary systems. \n\n"}

However, a lack of atomic data has inhibited accurate\ntrans-iron element abundance determinations in astrophysical nebulae. Recently,\nphotoionization and recombination data were determined for Se and Kr, the two\nmost widely detected n-capture elements in nebular spectra.

These discrepancies were removed by\nadjusting the Kr$^+$--Kr$^{3+}$ photoionization cross sections within their\ncited uncertainties and the dielectronic recombination rate coefficients by\nslightly larger amounts.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works.

Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

The prior assumptions in\none's stellar population modelling dominate the error budget, creating a\ncolour-dependent bias of up to 0.6 dex if NIR fluxes are used (0.3 dex\notherwise). This matches the systematic errors associated with the method of\nspectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, indicating that MLCRs do not suffer\nfrom much additional bias. Moreover, MLCRs and SED fitting yield similar\ndegrees of random error ($\\sim$0.1-0.14 dex) when applied to mock galaxies and,\non average, equivalent masses for real galaxies with M$_* \\sim$ 10$^{8-11}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. The use of integrated photometry introduces additional uncertainty\nin M$_*$ measurements, at the level of 0.05-0.07 dex. We argue that using\nMLCRs, instead of time-consuming SED fits, is justified in cases with complex\nmodel parameter spaces (involving, for instance, multi-parameter star formation\nhistories) and/or for large datasets. Spatially-resolved methods for measuring\nM$_*$ should be applied for small sample sizes and/or when accuracies less than\n0.1 dex are required.

The star HD 80606 hosts a giant planet with 4 MJup\ndetected by both transit and radial velocity techniques, being one of the most\neccentric planets detected to date. We study condensation temperature Tc trends\nof volatile and refractory element abundances to determine whether there is a\ndepletion of refractories that could be related to the terrestrial planet\nformation. Methods. We carried out a high-precision abundance determination in\nboth components of the binary system, using a line-by-line strictly\ndifferential approach, using the Sun as a reference and then using HD 80606 as\nreference. We used an updated version of the program FUNDPAR, together with\nATLAS9 model atmospheres and the MOOG code. Conclusions. From the study of Tc\ntrends, we concluded that the stars HD 80606 and HD 80607 do not seem to be\ndepleted in refractory elements, which is different for the case of the Sun.\nThen, the terrestrial planet formation would have been less efficient in the\ncomponents of this binary system than in the Sun.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$.

Here, we present results of ground-based follow-up observations for\nthe K2-19 planetary system. We have performed high-dispersion spectroscopy and\nhigh-contrast adaptive-optics imaging of the host star with the HDS and HiCIAO\non the Subaru 8.2m telescope. We find that the host star is relatively old (>8\nGyr) late G-type star ($T_{eff}$ ~ 5350 K, $M_s$ ~ 0.9 $M_{Sun}$, and $R_{s}$ ~\n0.9 $R_{Sun}$). We do not find any contaminating faint objects near the host\nstar which could be responsible for (or dilute) the transit signals. We have\nalso conducted transit follow-up photometry for the inner planet with KeplerCam\non the FLWO 1.2m telescope, TRAPPISTCAM on the TRAPPIST 0.6m telescope, and\nMuSCAT on the OAO 1.88m telescope.

We find two statistically\nindistinguishable solutions for which the period ratios ($P_{c}/P_{b}$) are\nlocated slightly above and below the exact 3:2 commensurability. Despite the\ndegeneracy, we derive the orbital period of the inner planet $P_b$ ~ 7.921 days\nand the mass of the outer planet $M_c$ ~ 20 $M_{Earth}$. Additional transit\nphotometry (especially for the outer planet) as well as precise radial-velocity\nmeasurements would be helpful to break the degeneracy and to determine the mass\nof the inner planet. \n\n"}

We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case. Our results are applicable to MCs of essentially all sizes\nand densities, but we note how Lorentz forces and other physics (neglected\nhere) may change them in some regimes.

For a progenitor\norbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance\ncondition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than\nexpected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur\nalong the bar's minor or major axis respectively.

A growing body of research\nsuggests that small particles (\"pebbles\") continually drift inward through the\ndisk. If a fraction of drifting pebbles is trapped at the inner edge of the\ndisk a several Earth-mass core can quickly grow.

Of course,\nto reach the outer Solar System Jupiter's core must traverse the terrestrial\nplanet-forming region.\n  We use N-body simulations including synthetic forces from an underlying\ngaseous disk to study how the outward migration of Jupiter's core sculpts the\nterrestrial zone.

However, self-consistently linking a planetary\nsystem across these two phases of stellar evolution through the violent giant\nbranch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted\narchitectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and\nperform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed\nplanetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting\ntrends as a function of planet order and mass. We find that intrusive radial\nincursions in the vicinity of the white dwarf become less likely as the\ndispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may\nsustain a sufficiently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain\nobservations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than\nany variation in planetary mass.

The cause of this\ndepletion is investigated by accurately tracing the behaviour of the lithium\nabundances as a function of effective temperature. Globular clusters are ideal\nlaboratories for such an abundance analysis as the relative stellar parameters\nof their stars can be precisely determined. We performed a homogeneous chemical\nabundance analysis of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging\nfrom the cluster turnoff point to the tip of the red giant branch. NLTE\nabundances for Li, Ca, and Fe were derived where possible. Stellar parameters\nwere derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs V-I colour-magnitude\ndiagram. Independent effective temperatures were obtained from automated\nprofile fitting of the Balmer lines and by applying colour-T_eff calibrations\nto the broadband photometry. Li abundances of the turnoff and early subgiant\nstars form a thin plateau that is broken off abruptly in the middle of the SGB\nas a result of the onset of Li dilution caused by the first dredge-up.\nAbundance trends with effective temperature for Fe and Ca are observed and\ncompared to predictions from stellar structure models including atomic\ndiffusion and ad hoc additional mixing below the surface convection zone. The\ncomparison shows that the stars in M30 are affected by atomic diffusion and\nadditional mixing. After applying a conservative correction for atomic\ndiffusion, we find an initial Li abundance of A(Li) = $2.48\\pm0.10$ for the\nglobular cluster M30. \n\n"}

Abstract: Several studies have shown that the occultation of stellar active regions by\nthe transiting planet can generate anomalies in the high-precision transit\nlight curves, and these anomalies may lead to an inaccurate estimate of the\nplanetary parameters (e.g., the planet radius). Since the physics and geometry\nbehind the transit light curve and the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect\n(spectroscopic transit) are the same, the Rossiter-McLaughlin observations are\nexpected to be affected by the occultation of stellar active regions in a\nsimilar way. In this paper we perform a fundamental test on the spin-orbit\nangles as derived by Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, and we examine the\nimpact of the occultation of stellar active regions by the transiting planet on\nthe spin-orbit angle estimations. Our results show that the inaccurate\nestimation on the spin-orbit angle due to stellar activity can be quite\nsignificant (up to 30 degrees), particularly for the edge-on, aligned, and\nsmall transiting planets. Therefore, our results suggest that the aligned\ntransiting planets are the ones that can be easily misinterpreted as misaligned\nowing to the stellar activity.

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk.

In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone.

Pioneer radial velocity follow-up observations with the UVES\nspectrograph at the ESO - VLT of this system clearly ruled out the large radial\nvelocity variation, leaving a discrepancy between the observation and the\nprediction. In this paper, we further characterise the microlensing system by\nanalysing its spectral energy distribution (SED) derived using the UVES\nspectrum and new observations with the ARCoIRIS (CTIO) near-infrared\nspectrograph and the Keck adaptive optics instrument NIRC2 in the J, H, and Ks\nbands. We determine the mass and distance of the stars independently from the\nmicrolensing modelling. We find that the SED is compatible with a giant star in\nthe Galactic bulge and a foreground star with a mass of 0.94+/-0.09Msun at a\ndistance of 1.07+/-0.24kpc. We find that this foreground star is likely the\nlens.

Abstract: Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely.

In addition to the\noscillations induced by the precessional motion, whose amplitude is larger the\nsmaller the initial inner-disk-to-planet mass ratio, the spin--orbit angle also\nexhibits a secular growth in this case---driven by ongoing mass depletion from\nthe disk---that becomes significant when the inner disk's angular momentum\ndrops below that of the planet.

In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and\nin a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited\non top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core.

We performed semi-analytical calculations and\nnumerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the\nplanet and the two stars.

The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet.

The primary\nobjective is to determine basic characteristics, the nature and type of the\n2015 outburst of AG Peg. We achieved this aim by modelling the spectral energy\ndistribution using low-resolution spectroscopy (330-750 nm), medium-resolution\nspectroscopy (420-720 nm; R=11000), and $UBVR_{\\rm C}I_{\\rm C}$ photometry\ncovering the 2015 outburst with a high cadence. Optical observations were\ncomplemented with the archival HST and FUSE spectra from the preceding\nquiescence. During the outburst, the luminosity of the hot component was in the\nrange of 2-11$\\times 10^{37}(d/0.8{\\rm kpc})^2$ erg/s. To generate the maximum\nluminosity the white dwarf (WD) had to accrete at $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-7}$\nM$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$, which exceeds the stable-burning limit and thus led to\nblowing optically thick wind from the WD. We determined its mass-loss rate to a\nfew $\\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$. At the high temperature of the\nionising source, $1.5-2.3\\times 10^5$ K, the wind converted a fraction of the\nWD's photospheric radiation into the nebular emission that dominated the\noptical.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

Effect of stellar\n  metallicity Abstract: Observations of hot Jupiter type exoplanets suggest that their orbital period\ndistribution depends on the metallicity of their host star. We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region. While on the pre-main sequence the dissipation of a metal\npoor Sun-like star is higher than the dissipation of a metal rich Sun-like\nstar, on the main sequence it is the opposite. However, for the $0.4~M_{\\odot}$\nstar, the dependence of the dissipation with metallicity is much less visible.\n  Using an orbital evolution model, we show that changing the metallicity leads\nto different orbital evolutions (e.g., planets migrate farther out from an\ninitially fast rotating metal rich star). By using this model, we qualitatively\nreproduced the observational trends of the population of hot Jupiters with the\nmetallicity of their host stars. However, more steps are needed to improve our\nmodel to try to quantitatively fit our results to the observations. Namely, we\nneed to improve the treatment of the rotation evolution in the orbital\nevolution model and ultimately we need to consistently couple of the orbital\nmodel to the stellar evolution model. \n\n"}

Here,\nwe show that the temporal evolution is critic for explaining the spectral-line\nscattering polarization because of its sensitivity to rapidly-varying physical\nquantities and the possibility of signal cancellations and attenuation during\nextended time integration. For studying the combined effect of time-varying\nmagnetic fields and kinematics, we solved the 1.5D NLTE problem of the second\nkind in time-dependent 3D R-MHD solar models and we synthesized the Hanle and\nZeeman polarization in forward scattering for the chromospheric {\\lambda}4227\nline.

The main results obtained are: 1) The temporal\nbehavior of monthly means of daily total SSC in flaring and non-flaring active\nregions are different and these differences are also varying from cycle to\ncycle; 2) The periodicities detected in SSC of flaring and non-flaring active\nregions are quite different and these variations are also different from one\ncycle to another; the highest detected period in the flaring active regions is\n113 days, while there are much higher periodicities (327, 312, and 256 days) in\nnon-flaring regions. The detection of typical different periodicities in\nflaring and non-flaring regions can suggests both important differences and\nphysical interpretation in the magneto-hydrodynamic behavior of the Sun. For\nthis reason in the present paper we show a further periodicity analysis of the\nsunspot counts in flaring and in non-flaring active regions using the same data\nsource of that used by the above cited authors and applying a powerful wavelet\nanalysis tool which is particularly useful to detect multiscale features of\ncomplex unsteady and unevenly sampled time series.

X-ray observations of these systems reveal an\noptically thin boundary layer (BL) expected to appear as an inner hole in the\ndisk. Consequently, we truncate the inner disk. However, instead of removing\nthe inner disk, we impose the no-shear boundary condition at the truncation\nradius, thereby lowering the disk temperature and generating a spectrum that\nbetter fits the UV data. With our modified disk, we analyze the archival UV\nspectra of three novalikes that cannot be fitted with standard disks. For the\nVY Scl systems MV Lyr and BZ Cam, we fit a hot inflated white dwarf WD with a\ncold modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim $ a few $10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr). For V592 Cas,\nthe slightly modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr)\ncompletely dominates the UV. These results are consistent with Swift X-ray\nobservations of these systems [Balman et al 2014], revealing BLs merged with\nADAF-like flows and/or hot coronae, where the advection of energy is likely\nlaunching an outflow and heating the WD, thereby explaining the high WD\ntemperature in VY Scl systems. This is further supported by the fact that the\nX-ray hardness ratio increases with the shallowness of the UV slope in a small\nCV sample we examine. Furthermore, for 105 disk-dominated systems, the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra UV slope decreases in the same\norder as the ratio of the X-ray flux to optical/UV flux: from SU UMa's, to U\nGem's, Z Cam's, UX UMa's, and VY Scl's. \n\n"}

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

Abstract: Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness\ndistributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition\ndisks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms.

Bayesian\n  Generalised Lomb-Scargle Periodogram with Trend Abstract: Period estimation is one of the central topics in astronomical time series\nanalysis, where data is often unevenly sampled. Especially challenging are\nstudies of stellar magnetic cycles, as there the periods looked for are of the\norder of the same length than the datasets themselves. The datasets often\ncontain trends, the origin of which is either a real long-term cycle or an\ninstrumental effect, but these effects cannot be reliably separated, while they\ncan lead to erroneous period determinations if not properly handled. In this\nstudy we aim at developing a method that can handle the trends properly, and by\nperforming extensive set of testing, we show that this is the optimal procedure\nwhen contrasted with methods that do not include the trend directly to the\nmodel. The effect of the form of the noise (whether constant or\nheteroscedastic) on the results is also investigated.

In this paper, we revisit the\nstrength of this relation using an exhaustive compilation of observational\nresults from the literature on this issue.

We evolve our\nmodels, where possible, until they have produced a first hydrostatic core.\nModels with $\\zeta_\\text{cr}\\gtrsim10^{-13}$ s$^{-1}$ are indistinguishable\nfrom ideal MHD models and the evolution of the model with\n$\\zeta_\\text{cr}=10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ matches the evolution of the ideal MHD\nmodel within one per cent when considering maximum density, magnetic energy,\nand maximum magnetic field strength as a function of time; these results are\nindependent of $a_\\text{g}$. Models with very low ionisation rates\n($\\zeta_\\text{cr}\\lesssim10^{-24}$ s$^{-1}$) are required to approach\nhydrodynamical collapse, and even lower ionisation rates may be required for\nlarger $a_\\text{g}$. Thus, it is possible to reproduce ideal MHD and purely\nhydrodynamical collapses using non-ideal MHD given an appropriate cosmic ray\nionisation rate. However, realistic cosmic ray ionisation rates approach\nneither limit, thus non-ideal MHD cannot be neglected in star formation\nsimulations. \n\n"}

IRIS data are complemented by full-disk\nobservations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite, relevant to the\nphotosphere and the corona. The photospheric configuration of the EFR is also\nanalyzed by measurements taken with the spectropolarimeter aboard the Hinode\nsatellite, when the EFR was fully developed. Recurrent intense brightenings\nthat resemble UV bursts, with counterparts in all coronal passbands, are\nidentified at the edges of the EFR. Jet activity is also observed at\nchromospheric and coronal levels, near the observed brightenings. The analysis\nof the IRIS line profiles reveals the heating of dense plasma in the low solar\natmosphere and the driving of bi-directional high-velocity flows with speed up\nto 100 km/s at the same locations. Compared with previous observations and\nnumerical models, these signatures suggest evidence of several long-lasting,\nsmall-scale magnetic reconnection episodes between the emerging bipole and the\nambient field.

We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc.

Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time).

Our sample spans masses from 0.02 to 0.08\nMsol and has been characterised extensively in the past. To search for periods,\nwe utilize three different methods (autocorrelation, periodogram, Gaussian\nProcesses). The median period for brown dwarfs with disks is twice as long as\nfor those without (3.1 vs. 1.6 d), a signature of rotational braking by the\ndisk, albeit with small numbers. With an overall median period of 1.9 d, brown\ndwarfs in Taurus rotate slower than their counterparts in somewhat older (3-10\nMyr) star-forming regions, consistent with spin-up of the latter due to\ncontraction and angular momentum conservation, a clear sign that disk braking\noverall is inefficient and/or temporary in this mass domain.

Due to the ejection\nlocation, such a HVS initially has negligible azimuthal angular momentum Lz ~ 0\nkpc km/s. Even if the halo is mildly triaxial, Lz of a recently ejected nearby\nHVS remains negligible, since its flight time from the Galactic Center is too\nshort to accumulate noticeable torque. However, if we make a wrong assumption\nabout the Solar position and velocity, such a HVS would apparently have\nnoticeable non-zero azimuthal angular momentum, due to the wrong reflex motion\nof the Sun.

We find that\na little quenching in BMR tilt is sufficient to stabilize the dynamo growth.\nThe randomness and nonlinearity in the BMR emergences make the poloidal field\nunequal and cause some variability in the solar cycle. However, when observed\nscatter of BMR tilts around Joy's law with a standard deviation of $15^\\circ$,\nis considered, our model produces a variation in the solar cycle, including\nnorth-south asymmetry comparable to the observations. The morphology of\nmagnetic fields closely resembles observations, in particular the surface\nradial field possesses a more mixed polarity field. Observed scatter also\nproduces grand minima.

This parametrization is based on numerical\nhydrodynamical simulations and is more realistic than the simple linear\nparametrization widely used in previous analytic studies.

We aim to clarify whether the exomoon-like\nsignal is really caused by a large object in orbit around Kepler-1625b. We\nexplore several detrending procedures, i.e. polynomials and the Cosine\nFiltering with Autocorrelation Minimization (CoFiAM). We then supply a light\ncurve simulator with the co-planar orbital dynamics of the system and fit the\nresulting planet-moon transit light curves to the Kepler data. We employ the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether a single planet or a\nplanet-moon system is a more likely interpretation of the light curve\nvariations.

A low-mass companion, HD 142527 B,\nwas also found orbiting the primary star at $\\sim$14 au. This study aims to\nbetter characterize this companion, which could help explain its impact on the\npeculiar geometry of the disk. We observed the source with VLT/SINFONI in\n$H$+$K$ band in pupil-tracking mode. Data were post-processed with several\nalgorithms based on angular differential imaging (ADI). HD 142527 B is\nconspicuously re-detected in most spectral channels, which enables us to\nextract the first medium-resolution spectrum of a low-mass companion within\n0.1'' from its central star.

Pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks\nprovide a mass estimate of $0.34\\pm0.06 M_{\\odot}$, independent of the presence\nof a hot environment. However, the estimated stellar radius and age do depend\non that assumption; we find a radius of $1.37 \\pm 0.05 R_{\\odot}$ (resp. $1.96\n\\pm 0.10 R_{\\odot}$) and an age of $1.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5}$ Myr (resp. $0.75 \\pm\n0.25$ Myr) in the case of the presence (resp. absence) of a hot environment\ncontributing in $H$+$K$. Our new values for the mass and radius yield a mass\naccretion rate of $\\sim$5 $\\times 10^{-9} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2-3% that of\nthe primary). Our results illustrate thus the potential for SINFONI+ADI to\ncharacterize faint close-in companions.

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar\nmedium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,\nH$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII.

FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation.

One\nsuch system is HD 189733 for which six suitable SPI data sets exist, the result\nof spectroscopic monitoring to perform some of the first SPI searches and also\nto study the star's magnetic field. Here we perform a uniform analysis of six\narchival Ca II K data sets for HD 189733, spanning 2006 June through 2015 July,\nin order to search for magnetic SPI signatures in the chromospheric line\nvariations. We find significant evidence for modulations of Ca II K with a\n$2.29\\pm0.04$ day period in the 2013 August data, which is consistent with the\nplanet's orbital period. The peak in the orbital variations occurs at\n$\\phi_\\text{orb} \\approx 0.9$, which corresponds to the SPI emission leading\nthe planet with a phase difference of $\\Delta\\phi \\approx 40^\\circ$ from the\nsub-planetary point. This is consistent with the phase lead predictions of\nnon-linear force-free magnetic field SPI models. The stellar magnetic field\nstrength at the planet's orbit is greatest in 2013 August which, due to the\nenergy released in magnetic SPI scaling with $B_*$, lends strength to the SPI\ninterpretation. \n\n"}

Persistence with Nonuniform\n  Stratification and Radiative Damping Abstract: The Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI) occurs in the dead zones of\nprotoplanetary disks (PPDs) where perturbations excite baroclinic critical\nlayers, generating \"zombie\" vortices and turbulence. In this work, we\ninvestigate ZVI with nonuniform vertical stratification; while ZVI is triggered\nin the stratified regions away from the midplane, the subsequent turbulence\npropagates into and fills the midplane. ZVI turbulence alters the background\nKeplerian shear flow, creating a steady-state zonal flow. Intermittency is\nobserved, where the flow cycles through near-laminar phases of zonal flow\npunctuated by chaotic bursts of new vortices. ZVI persists in the presence of\nradiative damping, as long as the thermal relaxation timescale is more than a\nfew orbital periods. We refute the premature claim by Lesur & Latter (2016)\nthat radiative damping inhibits ZVI for disk radii r>0.3 au. Their conclusions\nwere based on unrealistically short cooling times using opacities with\nvirtually no grain growth. We explore different grain growth and vertical\nsettling scenarios, and find that the gas and dust in off-midplane regions are\nnot necessarily in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with each other. In\nsuch cases, thermal relaxation timescales can be orders of magnitude longer\nthan the optically thin cooling times assuming LTE because of the finite time\nfor energy to be exchanged between gas and dust grains via collisions. With\nminimal amounts of grain growth and dust settling, the off-midplane regions of\ndisks are susceptible to ZVI and much of the planet-forming regions can be\nfilled with zombie vortices and turbulence. \n\n"}

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions.

We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow.

However, there are theoretical and observational\nindications that mass transfer could occur in eccentric orbits. In particular,\neccentricity could be produced via sudden mass loss and velocity kicks during\nsupernova explosions, or Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations in hierarchical triple\nsystems, or, more generally, secular evolution in multiple-star systems.\nHowever, current analytic models of eccentric mass transfer are faced with the\nproblem that they are only well defined in the limit of very high\neccentricities, and break down for less eccentric and circular orbits. This\nprovides a major obstacle to implementing such models in binary and\nhigher-order population synthesis codes, which are useful tools for studying\nthe long-term evolution of a large number of systems. Here, we present a new\nanalytic model to describe the secular orbital evolution of binaries undergoing\nconservative mass transfer. The main improvement of our model is that the mass\ntransfer rate is a smoothly varying function of orbital phase, rather than a\ndelta function centered at periapsis. Consequently, our model is in principle\nvalid for any eccentricity, thereby overcoming the main limitation of previous\nworks. We implement our model in an easy-to-use and publicly available code\nthat can be used as a basis for implementations of our model into population\nsynthesis codes. We investigate the implications of our model in a number of\napplications with circular and eccentric binaries, and triples undergoing LK\noscillations. \n\n"}

Using a simple model for\nthe formation and evolution of dark halos, based on the extended\nPress-Schechter formalism and tested against N-body results, we show that the\ntheoretical predictions can be reconciled with observations if gas accretion in\nlow-mass halos is suppressed after the epoch of reionization. In this picture,\nthe observed dwarf satellites correspond to the small fraction of halos that\naccreted substantial amounts of gas before reionization.

In fact a weak rim of emission near the primary shock\nfront is discernable in the hardest X-ray image but it contains only a few\npercent of the hard X-ray emissivity. The equivalent width of the Fe-K line\nblend varies by more than an order of magnitude over the remnant, it is hard to\nexplain this as Fe-emission from the reverse shock heated ejecta given the\nejecta temperature and the age of the remnant. The uniquely high\nwavelength-dispersive RGS-spectrometer has allowed, for the first time, to\nextract monochromatic images in several highly ionised element species with\nhigh spectral resolution. We present here a preliminary result on the\nmeasurement of the O VIII Ly-alpha and Ly-beta brightness distribution and\nbrightness ratios. The large observed decrease of the Ly-alpha/Ly-beta ratio\ngoing from the N to the SE can be explained by small-scale (10 arcsec)\nvariations in the N_H column over the remnant and the potential presence of\nresonance scattering of the O VIII Ly-alpha photons in the limb brightened\nshell. \n\n"}

The spectra have also been fitted well\nusing the full relativistic disc line model of Laor, plus an absorption line.\nThis gives a restframe energy between 6.4 and 6.8 keV indicating that the line\nis from highly ionized iron K_alpha. The Laor model also shows that the line\noriginates at radii extending from ~10 Schwarzschild radii (r_S) outwards. The\nline is direct evidence for the black hole nature of the compact object.

I review this progress. Stellar atmospheres can be probed whenever\nthe source in a microlensing event passes over the caustic (contour of infinite\nmagnification) induced by the lens because the caustic effectively resolves the\nsource. Broad-band observations of four events have yielded limb-darkening\nmeasurements, which in essence map the atmospheric temperature as a function of\ndepth. And now, for the first time, spectroscopic observations of one event\npromise much richer diagnostics of the source atmosphere. In the past two\nyears, a practical method has finally been developed to systematically measure\nthe lens masses in microlensing events. This will permit a census of all\nmassive objects, both dark and luminous, in the Galactic bulge, including\nlow-mass stars, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The\nmethod combines traditional ground-based photometry with astrometric and\nphotometric measurements by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) in solar\norbit. Using a related technique SIM can also obtain accurate (>~ 1%) mass\nmeasurement of a dozen or so nearby stars, thus enabling precision tests of\nstellar models.

Observed clusters and groups, however, show strong\ndeviations from these predicted relations. We argue that these deviations are\nunlikely to be entirely due to observational biasses; we assume they are\nphysically based, due to the presence of excess entropy in the intracluster\nmedium in addition to that generated by accretion shocks during the formation\nof the cluster. Several mechanisms have been suggested as a means of generating\nthis entropy.

The source\nterm is not a usual power-law but rather a `pile-up' distribution, which can\nresult from the combination of a stochastic heating via second order Fermi\nprocess and radiative cooling. To validate this approach, we have performed\ntime-averaged fits of the well-known TeV emitter Mrk 501 during the 1997\nflaring activity period taking into account the attenuation of the high energy\ncomponent by cosmic diffuse infrared background (DIrB) and intrinsic absorption\nvia the pair creation process. The model can reproduce very satisfactorily the\nobserved spectral energy distribution (SED). A high Lorentz factor is required\nto avoid strong pair production; in the case of smaller Lorentz factor, an\nintense flare in the GeV range is predicted due to the sudden increase of soft\nphotons density below the Klein-Nishina threshold. The possible relevance of\nsuch a scenario is discussed. \n\n"}

We show for the first time that there is weak emission\nduring the `null' phases, which should therefore be considered to be a\ndifferent mode rather than a null. During this weak mode the profile is similar\nto that observed in the strong mode at low radio frequency. Using a\nphase-tracking method, the pattern of drifting subpulses during the strong mode\nis seen to be coherent across the whole profile. The drift rate is variable and\nincludes positive and negative values. Thirteen subpulse bands have been\ndirectly observed, covering the whole longitude range. The subpulses and their\nspacings ($P_2$) are wider in one half of the profile than those in the other\nhalf.

Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of Galactic sources have\nshown that the outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakens\ndramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifesting\nstructural changes in the accretion flow. It is reasonable to assume that SMBHs\nfollow the same trend. For low luminosity SMBHs in nearby elliptical galaxies\nand clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play the\ncentral role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). If the outflow is\nquenched in SMBHs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galactic\nsources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback of\nrapidly accreting SMBHs. We argue that elliptical galaxies and their central\nengines should then evolve through two stages. Early on, the central SMBH\nrapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-Eddington rate with high\nradiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. This stage\nterminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that its\nfeedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency,\nis able to suppress gas cooling.

For this purpose we\npresent relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with\nconformally flat approximation of the Einstein field equations and a physical,\nnon-zero temperature equation of state. Thick disc formation is highlighted as\na dynamical process caused by angular momentum transfer through tidal torques\nduring the merging process of asymmetric systems or in the rapidly spinning\ntriaxial post-merger object.

We use high-resolution simulations of idealized cluster mergers to show\nthat they are due to sloshing of the cool gas in the central gravitational\npotential, which is easily set off by minor mergers and can persist for\ngigayears. The only necessary condition is a steep entropy profile, as observed\nin cooling flow clusters. Even if the infalling subcluster has no gas during\ncore passage, the gravitational disturbance sets the main mass peak (gas and\ndark matter together) in motion relative to the surrounding gas. A rapid change\nin the direction of motion causes a change in ram pressure, which pushes the\ncool gas away from the dark matter peak and triggers sloshing. For nonzero\nimpact parameters, the cool gas acquires angular momentum, resulting in a\ncharacteristic spiral pattern of cold fronts. There is little visible\ndisturbance outside the cool core in such a merger. If the subcluster retains\nits gas during core passage, the cool central gas of the main cluster is more\neasily decoupled from the dark matter peak. Subsequently, some of that gas, and\noften the cool gas from the subcluster, falls back to the center and starts\nsloshing. However, in such a merger, global disturbances are readily visible in\nX-rays for a long time.

Previous NS atmosphere models incorporated this effect\napproximately, using transfer equations for the photon modes which are\ninadequate near the vacuum resonance, particularly for field strengths around\n$B_l\\simeq 7\\times 10^{13}$ G, where the vacuum resonance occurs near the\nphotosphere. In this paper, we provide an accurate treatment of the QED-induced\nmode conversion effect in NS atmosphere models, employing both the modal\nradiative transfer equations, coupled with an accurate mode conversion\nprobability at the resonance, and the full evolution equations for the photon\nStokes parameters. In doing so, we are able to quantitatively calculate the\neffects of vacuum polarization on the atmosphere emission spectra, beam\npatterns, and polarizations for the entire range of field strengths,\n$B=10^{12}-10^{15}$ G.

We demonstrate that the simulations\npredict the existence of a BH 'fundamental plane' (BHFP), of the form M_BH\nsigma^(3.0+-0.3)*R_e^(0.43+-0.19) or M_BH\nM_bulge^(0.54+-0.17)*sigma^(2.2+-0.5), similar to relations found\nobservationally. The simulations indicate that the BHFP can be understood\nroughly as a tilted intrinsic correlation between BH mass and spheroid binding\nenergy, or the condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-driven\noutflow. While changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters,\nprogenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ISM gas pressurization, and other\nparameters can drive changes in e.g. sigma at fixed M_bulge, and therefore\nchanges in the M_BH-sigma or M_BH-M_bulge relations, the BHFP is robust.

This evolution in the structural properties of merger\nremnants, to smaller R_e and larger sigma (and therefore larger M_BH,\nconserving the BHFP) at a given M_bulge, is driven by the fact that bulge\nprogenitors have characteristically larger gas fractions at high redshifts.\nAdopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with redshift, our\nsimulations predict the observed trends in both R_e(M_bulge) and M_BH(M_bulge). \n\n"}

The ratio of hard channel\n(1.3-10.0 keV) to soft channel (0.3-1.3 keV) counts in the Swift X-ray\ntelescope provides a new measure delineating the end time of this emission. We\ndefine $T_{H}$ as the time at which this transition takes place and measure for\n59 events a range of transition times that span $10^2$ s to $10^{4}$ s, on\naverage 5 times longer than the prompt $T_{90}$ duration observed in the\nGamma-ray band. It is very likely that the mysterious light curve plateau phase\nand the later powerlaw temporal evolution, both of which typically occur at\ntimes greater than $T_{H}$ and hence exhibit very little hardness ratio\nevolution, are both produced by external shocking of the surrounding medium and\nnot by the internal shocks thought responsible for the earlier emission.

In the model disk mass is constant\nuntil the largest planetesimals reach collisional equilibrium whereupon the\nmass falls off oc 1/t. We find that the detection statistics and trends seen at\nboth 24 and 70um can be fitted well by the model. While there is no need to\ninvoke stochastic evolution or delayed stirring to explain the statistics, a\nmoderate rate of stochastic events is not ruled out. Potentially anomalous\nsystems are identified by a high dust luminosity compared with the maximum\npermissible in the model (HD3003, HD38678, HD115892, HD172555). Their\nplanetesimals may have unusual properties (high strength or low eccentricity)\nor this dust could be transient. While transient phenomena are also favored for\na few systems in the literature, the overall success of our model, which\nassumes planetesimals in all belts have the same strength, eccentricity and\nmaximum size, suggests a large degree of uniformity in the outcome of planet\nformation. The distribution of planetesimal belt radii, once corrected for\ndetection bias, follows N(r) oc r^{-0.8+-0.3} for 3-120AU.

In an\nearlier paper, this scenario had been shown to lead naturally, in the absence\nof a central point mass, to a self-similar solution characterized by a flat\nrotation curve. In this article we investigate the entire parameter space\navailable for such self-regulated accretion disks and provide two non-trivial\nextensions of the model. The first extension is that of a bimodal disk,\nobtained by partially relaxing the self-regulation constraint, so that full\nmatching with an inner \"standard\" Keplerian accretion disk takes place. The\nsecond extension is the construction of self-regulated accretion disks embedded\nin a diffuse spherical \"halo\". The analysis is further strengthened by a\ncareful discussion of the vertical structure of the disk, in such a way that\nthe transition from self-gravity dominated to non-gravitating disks is covered\nuniformly. \n\n"}

Such an optical-UV flash can destroy dust in the beam by\nsublimation out to an appreciable distance, approximately 10 pc, and may clear\nthe dust out of as much as 10^7(\\Delta\\Omega/4\\pi)M_sun of molecular cloud\nmaterial on an apparent time scale of 10 seconds. Detection of time dependent\nextinction on this time scale would therefore provide strong constraints on the\nGRB source environment. Dust destruction implies that existing, or future,\nobservations of not-heavily-reddened fireballs are not inconsistent with GRBs\nbeing associated with star forming regions. In this case, however, if gamma-ray\nemission is highly beamed, the expanding fireball would become reddened on a 1\nweek time scale.\n  If the optical depth due to dust beyond approximately 8 pc from the GRB is\n0.2<\\tau_V<2, most of the UV flash energy is converted to infra-red, \\lambda\n\\sim 1 micron, radiation with luminosity \\sim 10^{41} erg/s extending over an\napparent duration of \\sim 20(1+z)(\\Delta\\Omega/0.01) day.

Pair Loading and\n  Radiative Acceleration in Gamma-ray Bursts Abstract: We consider the effects of rapid pair creation by an intense pulse of\ngamma-rays propagating ahead of a relativistic shock. Side-scattered photons\ncolliding with the main gamma-ray beam amplify the density of scattering\ncharges. The acceleration rate of the pair-loaded medium is calculated, and its\nlimiting bulk Lorentz factor related to the spectrum and compactness of the\nphoton source. One obtains, as a result, a definite prediction for the relative\ninertia in baryons and pairs. The deceleration of a relativistic shock in the\nmoving medium, and the resulting synchrotron emissivity, are compared with\nexisting calculations for a static medium. The radiative efficiency is\nincreased dramatically by pair loading. When the initial ambient density\nexceeds a critical value, the scattering depth traversed by the main gamma-ray\npulse rises above unity, and the pulse is broadened. These considerations place\nsignificant constraints on burst progenitors: a pre-burst mass loss rate\nexceeding 10^{-5} M_\\odot per year is difficult to reconcile with individual\npulses narrower than 10 s, unless the radiative efficiency is low. An\nanisotropic gamma-ray flux (on an angular scale \\Gamma^{-1} or larger) drives a\nlarge velocity shear that greatly increases the energy in the seed magnetic\nfield forward of the propagating shock. \n\n"}

Such a model is characterized by only three\nparameters in addition to those already appearing within the Standard Model: a\ndimensionless self-coupling and a mass for the new scalar, and a dimensionless\ncoupling, \\lambda, to the Higgs field. If the singlet is the dark matter, these\nparameters are related to one another by the cosmological abundance constraint,\nimplying that the coupling of the singlet to the Higgs field is large, \\lambda\n\\sim O(0.1 - 1). Since this parameter also controls couplings to ordinary\nmatter, we obtain predictions for the elastic cross section of the singlet with\nnuclei. The resulting scattering rates are close to current limits from both\ndirect and indirect searches. The existence of the singlet also has\nimplications for current Higgs searches, as it gives a large contribution to\nthe invisible Higgs width for much of parameter space.

Chief among these is the very accurate\ndetermination of the amount of cold dark matter in the universe from analyses\nusing WMAP data. The implications of this data for the mSUGRA parameter space\nare analyzed. It is shown that the data admits solutions on the hyperbolic\nbranch (HB) of the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry. A part of\nthe hyperbolic branch lies in the so called inversion region where the LSP\nneutralino $\\chi_1^0$ becomes essentially a pure Higgsino and degenerate with\nthe next to the lightest neutralino $\\chi_2^0$ and the light chargino\n$\\chi_1^{\\pm}$. Thus some of the conventional signals for the observation of\nsupersymmetry at colliders (e.g., the missing energy signals) do not operate in\nthis region. On the other hand the inversion region contains a high degree of\ndegeneracy of $\\chi_1^0$, $\\chi_2^0$, $\\chi_1^{\\pm}$ leading to coannihilations\nwhich allow for the satisfaction of the WMAP relic density constraints deep on\nthe hyperbolic branch.

These results dispel many\nforegone assumptions generally made up to now about inflation models and bring\nto the fore various elementary issues that must be addressed to do reliable\ncalculations from inflation models.

For a vacuum brane (with\nconstant brane tension) there is a continuum of normalizable Kaluza-Klein\nmodes, with m>3H/2, which remain in the vacuum state. A light radion mode, with\nm=\\sqrt{2}H, satisfies the boundary conditions for two branes but is not\nnormalizable in the single-brane case.
