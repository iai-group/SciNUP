We derive explicit formulas for the DM\nparticle mass m and for the number of ultra relativistic degrees of freedom g_d\nat decoupling. We find that for DM particles decoupling UR both at local\nthermal equilibrium (LTE) and out of LTE, m turns to be at the keV scale. For\nexample, for DM Majorana fermions decoupling at LTE the mass results m ~ 0.85\nkeV. For DM particles decoupling NR, sqrt{m T_d} results in the keV scale (T_d\nis the decoupling temperature) and the m value is consistent with the keV\nscale. In all cases, DM turns to be cold DM (CDM). Also, lower and upper bounds\non the DM annihilation cross-section for NR decoupling are derived.

Models and model\n  results Abstract: Different compositions of galaxy types in the field in comparison to galaxy\nclusters as described by the morphology-density relation in the local universe\nis interpreted as a result of transformation processes from late- to early-type\ngalaxies. This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes. For this\npurpose we model a grid of post-starburst galaxies by inducing a burst and/or a\nhalting of star formation on the normal evolution of spiral galaxies with our\ngalaxy evolution code GALEV.\n  From our models we find that the common E+A criteria exclude a significant\nnumber of post-starburst galaxies and propose that comparing their spectral\nenergy distributions leads to a more sufficient method to investigate\npost-starbust galaxies. We predict that a higher number of E+A galaxies in the\nearly universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher number of starburst, but\nis a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to more gas\ncontent of the galaxies in the early universe.

GCs beginning their\nformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their\nsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during\nformation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the\nmass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (\"blue tilt\") appears in the\nmetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies. We therefore suggest that\nself-enrichment is the primary driver for the mass-metallicity relation. Other\npredictions from our model are that the cluster-to-cluster metallicity spread\ndecreases amongst the highest mass clusters; and that the red GC sequence\nshould also display a more modest mass-metallicity trend if it can be traced to\nsimilarly high mass. \n\n"}

The flux\nratio H-alpha/FUV from these two star formation tracers shows strong\ncorrelations with the surface-brightness in H-alpha and the R band: Low Surface\nBrightness (LSB) galaxies have lower ratios compared to High Surface Brightness\ngalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models using\ncommonly favored IMF parameters.

The correlated variations of\nH-alpha/FUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of\ngalaxy scaling relations. The H-alpha/FUV correlations can not be due to dust\ncorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation history\ncan not explain the trends with both H-alpha and R surface brightness. LSB\ngalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons\nconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both\neffects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of\nthe star.

With the assumption that radio and X-ray\nluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,\nrespectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet\nproduction is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their\npower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with\ndirect, dynamical mass-measurements.

Our cladistic analysis breaks the sample into three novel groups. An\na posteriori kinematical analysis puts groups 1 and 2 in the halo, and group 3\nin the thick disc. The halo and disc clusters separately follow a\nluminosity-metallicity relation of much weaker slope than galaxies.

High-resolution radio VLBI (very long baseline interferometry)\nobservations allow zooming into a subparsec-scale region of the jet in the\nradio-loud galaxy 3C 390.3.

Internal two-body relaxation and external shocks will lead to\nfurther, gradual dissolution on timescales of up to a few hundred million years\nfor low-mass open clusters in the Milky Way, while the most massive clusters (>\n10^5 Msun) have lifetimes comparable to or exceeding the age of the Universe.\nThe low-mass end of the initial cluster mass function is well approximated by a\npower-law distribution, dN/dM ~ M^{-2}, but there is mounting evidence that\nquiescent spiral discs form relatively few clusters with masses M > 2 x 10^5\nMsun.

Icy Planet Formation as a Function of the\n  Bulk Properties and Initial Sizes of Planetesimals Abstract: We describe comprehensive calculations of the formation of icy planets and\ndebris disks at 30-150 AU around 1-3 solar mass stars. Disks composed of large,\nstrong planetesimals produce more massive planets than disks composed of small,\nweak planetesimals. The maximum radius of icy planets ranges from roughly 1500\nkm to 11,500 km. The formation rate of 1000 km objects - `Plutos' - is a useful\nproxy for the efficiency of icy planet formation. Plutos form more efficiently\nin massive disks, in disks with small planetesimals, and in disks with a range\nof planetesimal sizes. Although Plutos form throughout massive disks, Pluto\nproduction is usually concentrated in the inner disk. Despite the large number\nof Plutos produced in many calculations, icy planet formation is inefficient.\nAt the end of the main sequence lifetime of the central star, Plutos contain\nless than 10% of the initial mass in solid material. This conclusion is\nindependent of the initial mass in the disk or the properties of planetesimals.\nDebris disk formation coincides with the formation of planetary systems\ncontaining Plutos. As Plutos form, they stir leftover planetesimals to large\nvelocities. A cascade of collisions then grinds the leftovers to dust, forming\nan observable debris disk. In disks with small (< 1-10 km) planetesimals,\ncollisional cascades produce luminous debris disks with maximum luminosity\nroughly 0.01 times the stellar luminosity. Disks with larger planetesimals\nproduce much less luminous debris disks. Observations of debris disks around\nA-type and G-type stars strongly favor models with small planetesimals. In\nthese models, our predictions for the time evolution and detection frequency of\ndebris disks agree with published observations.

The velocity dispersions for the blue GCs about the\nmean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve have a significant\nvariation depending on the galactocentric radius. Comparison of observed\nstellar and GC velocity dispersion profiles with the velocity dispersion\nprofiles calculated from the stellar mass profile shows that the mass-to-light\nratio should increase as the galactocentric distance increases, indicating the\nexistence of an extended dark matter halo.

To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy.

In\naddition to this lack of observational evidence for a relation between black\nhole spin and jet properties in stellar mass black holes, we highlight the fact\nthat there appear to be at least three different ways in which the jet power\nand/or radiative efficiency from a black hole X-ray binary may vary, two of\nwhich are certainly independent of spin because they occur in the same source\non relatively short timescales, and the third which does not correlate with any\nreported measurements of black hole spin.

Several studies have modeled these hazes as\nradiation from the leptonic byproducts of dark matter annihilations, and\narguably no convincing astrophysical alternative has been suggested. We discuss\nthe characteristics of astrophysical cosmic ray sources that could potentially\nexplain this microwave and gamma-ray emission. The most promising astrophysical\nscenarios involve cosmic ray sources that are clustered such that many fall\nwithin ~1 kpc of the Galactic Center. For example, we show that several hundred\nGalactic Center supernovae in the last million years plus a diffusion-hardened\nelectron spectrum may be consistent with present constraints on this emission.\nAlternatively, it could be due to a burst of activity probably associated with\nSagittarius A* occurring ~1 Myr ago and producing >10^51 erg in cosmic ray\nelectrons. Different models predict different trends for the spectral index of\nthe microwave and gamma-ray spectrum as a function of angle from the Galactic\nCenter that should be robust to cosmic ray propagation uncertainties. In\nparticular, if the haze is from dark matter annihilations, it should have a\nvery hard microwave and gamma-ray spectrum for which the spectral shape does\nnot change significantly with angle, which we argue would be difficult to\nachieve with any astrophysical mechanism.

We\nanalyzed a sample of 97 X-ray light curves of 75 objects of all classes\nobserved with the XMM-Newton space telescope.

The X-ray flickering is typically composed of long\ntime scale events (1.5 < alpha < 3), with very similar strengths in all the\nsubtypes of cataclysmic variables (-3 < Sigma < -1.5). The X-ray data are\ndistributed in a much smaller area of the alpha-Sigma parameter space with\nrespect to those obtained with optical light curves.

Whereas\nthe average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before\nleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low\nHI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\nwhich is not the case within r25.

These authors studied the merger of two non-spinning\nblack holes in the presence of a magnetic field, perpendicular to the orbital\nplane and anchored by a circumbinary accretion disk, in the \"force-free\"\napproximation. They found that each black hole essentially acts as a \"straw\"\nthat stirs the magnetic field lines around the center of mass as the black\nholes inspiral. The twisting of the magnetic field lines then generates jets\naround each black hole, even though these are not spinning. Their simulations\nshow the formation of such a dual jet geometry and how it transitions to a\nsingle jet one, as the black holes merge due to gravitational wave emission. \n\n"}

After the binary orbit decays due to an interaction\nwith a massive circumbinary disk, the binary is decoupled from the circumbinary\ndisk because the orbital-decay timescale due to emission of gravitational wave\nbecomes shorter than the viscous timescale evaluated at the inner edge of\ncircumbinary disk. During the subsequent evolution, the accretion disk, which\nis truncated at the tidal radius because of the tidal torque, also shrinks as\nthe orbital decay. Assuming that the disk mass changed by this process is all\naccreted, the disk becomes radiatively inefficient when the semi-major axis is\nseveral hundred Schwarzschild radii. The high-energy radiations, in spite of a\nlow bolometric luminosity, are emitted from an accretion disk around each black\nhole long before the black hole coalescence as well as the gravitational wave\nsignals. The synchrotron process can notably produce potentially observable\nradio emissions at large distances if there is a strong, dipole magnetic field\naround each black hole. In unequal mass-ratio binaries, step-like light\nvariations are seen in the observed light curve because the luminosity is\nhigher and its duration time are shorter in the radio emission by the disk\naround the secondary black hole than those of the primary black hole. Such a\nprecursor would be unique to not a single black hole system but a binary black\nhole system, and implies that binary black holes finally merge without\naccretion disks. \n\n"}

Here we derive analytic corrections for the Planck-spectrum quantum\nstatistics of the photon energy distribution. These corrections can be deduced\ndirectly from the detailed-balance condition without the assumption of\nequilibrium as long as the photons are represented by a Planck spectrum.\nMoreover we show that these corrections affect not only the photodisintegration\nrates but also modify the conditions of nuclear statistical equilibrium as\nrepresented in the Saha equation. We deduce new analytic corrections to the\nclassical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics which can easily be added to the reverse\nreaction rates of existing reaction network tabulations. We show that the\neffects of quantum statistics, though generally quite small, always tend to\nspeed up photodisintegration rates and are largest for nuclei and environments\nfor which Q/kT ~ 1. As an illustration, we examine possible effects of these\ncorrections on the r-process, the rp-process, explosive silicon burning, the\n$\\gamma$-process and big bang nucleosynthesis.

Intergalactic Globular Clusters and\n  the Massive Globular Cluster System at the Core of the Coma Galaxy Cluster Abstract: Intracluster stellar populations are a natural result of tidal interactions\nin galaxy clusters.

The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1. The fraction of red IGCs (20%), and the red\ncolor of those GCs, implies that IGCs can originate from the halos of\nrelatively massive, L* galaxies, and not solely from the disruption of dwarf\ngalaxies.

Since period doubling\nwas observed only in Blazhko-modulated stars so far, the phenomenon can help in\nthe understanding of the modulation as well.

A period-doubling cascade was also\nfollowed up to an eight-period solution confirming that the destabilisation of\nthe limit cycle is indeed the underlying phenomenon. Floquet stability roots\nwere calculated to investigate the possible causes and occurrences of the\nphenomenon. A two-dimensional diagnostic diagram was constructed to display the\nvarious resonances between the fundamental mode and the different overtones.\nCombining the two tools, we confirmed that the period-doubling instability is\ncaused by a 9:2 resonance between the 9th overtone and the fundamental mode.\nDestabilisation of the limit cycle by a resonance of a high-order mode is\npossible because the overtone is a strange mode. The resonance is found to be\nsufficiently strong enough to shift the period of overtone with up to 10\npercent.

We examine the\noptical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars with\ncore emission unresolved by FIRST (on 5\" scale) have a redder color\ndistribution than radio-quiet quasars (S_{20}<1mJy); other classes of radio\nquasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars.\nThis analysis also suggests that optical colors of z<2.7 SDSS quasars are not\nstrongly (<0.1mag) biased blue. We show that the radio core-to-lobe flux\ndensity ratio (R) and the radio-to-optical (i-band) ratio of the quasar core\n(RI) are correlated, suggesting that both parameters are indicative of\nline-of-sight orientation. We investigate spectral line equivalent widths as a\nfunction of R and RI, including the [OIII] narrow line doublet and the CIV\n{\\lambda}1549 and MgII {\\lambda}2799 broad lines. We find that the rest\nequivalent widths (EWs) of the broad lines correlate positively with RI at the\n4-8{\\sigma} level. But we find no strong dependence of EW on R, in contrast to\nprevious results. One interpretation is that EWs increase as the line-of-sight\nangle to the radio-jet axis decreases. These results are in stark contrast to\ncommonly accepted orientation-based theories, which suggest that continuum\nemission should increase as the angle to the radio-jet axis decreases,\nresulting in smaller EW of emission lines (assumed isotropic). Finally, we find\nthat the Baldwin effect in our sample does not depend on quasar radio\nmorphology. \n\n"}

Recent studies have proposed to use optical variability or near-IR\ncolors to improve the identifications of the missing quasars in this redshift\nrange.

After a contraction timescale which is\nequal to a few times their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and\npopulate the IMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account\nin the form of stellar winds.

The power of\nthe radiation driven winds has a strong dependence on metallicity and increases\nwith increasing metallicity.

In this\ncontribution I focus on the mass-radius relation of CFRgs, how it can be\nuncovered by studying the gas expulsion phase of forming star clusters, and\nwhat the implications are.

We have tested this prediction using large-scale N-body\nexperiments.

However, this\nrate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by Chandrasekhar's\nformula in its most widely-used forms, implying longer time scales for\ninspiral.

We find that absolute SFRs measured using resolved\nlow/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H II regions are\nsystematically higher by factors of ~2-3 as compared with calibrations for SFRs\nmeasured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations\nfor this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law\nslope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were\nsteeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the\nextragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star\nformation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of\nO stars.

Font et\nal. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully\nreproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface\nbrightness profiles of the spheroids of the Milky Way and M31. A key to the\nsuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from\nstars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,\nstars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r < ~30 kpc. In\nthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a\nproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by\ndynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its\norigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely\nnet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid\ncomponent built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ\ncomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation.

Supersonic\nturbulence drives the density distribution to a lognormal with dispersion\nincreasing with Mach number; we generalize this to include scales >h (the disk\nscale height), and use it to construct the statistical properties of the\ndensity field smoothed on a scale R.

As such, an exact\n'bound object mass function' can be derived, from scales of the sonic length to\nabove the disk Jeans mass. This agrees remarkably well with observed GMC mass\nfunctions in the MW and other galaxies; the only inputs are the mass and size\nof the galaxies (to normalize the model).

Like that example, however,\nthis solution does not resolve the 'cloud in cloud' problem; it also does not\nextend to large scales that dominate the velocity/density fluctuations. In\nprinciple, these can change the results at the order-of-magnitude level. Here,\nwe use the results from Hopkins 2011 (H11) to generalize the excursion set\nformalism and derive the exact solution in this regime. We argue that the\nstellar IMF and core mass function (CMF) should be associated with the\nlast-crossing distribution, i.e. the mass spectrum of bound objects defined on\nthe smallest scale on which they are self-gravitating. This differs from the\nfirst-crossing distribution (mass function on the largest self-gravitating\nscale) which is defined cosmologically and which H11 show corresponds to the\nGMC mass function in disks. We derive an analytic equation for the\nlast-crossing distribution that can be used for an arbitrary collapse threshold\nin ISM and cosmological studies.

An Analytic Model for Stellar Correlation\n  Functions Abstract: Recently, we have shown that if the ISM is governed by super-sonic turbulent\nflows, the excursion-set formalism can be used to calculate the statistics of\nself-gravitating objects over a wide range of scales. On the largest\nself-gravitating scales ('first crossing'), these correspond to GMCs, and on\nthe smallest non-fragmenting self-gravitating scales ('last crossing'), to\nprotostellar cores. Here, we extend this formalism to rigorously calculate the\nauto and cross-correlation functions of cores (and by extension, young stars)\nas a function of spatial separation and mass, in analogy to the cosmological\ncalculation of halo clustering. We show that this generically predicts that\nstar formation is very strongly clustered on small scales: stars form in\nclusters, themselves inside GMCs. Outside the binary-star regime, the projected\ncorrelation function declines as a weak power-law, until a characteristic scale\nwhich corresponds to the characteristic mass scale of GMCs. On much larger\nscales the clustering declines such that star formation is not strongly biased\non galactic scales, relative to the actual dense gas distribution.

It has been extensively observed with ground based\ntelescopes and within the WISH Guaranteed Time Herschel Key Program. We present\nnew observations of the C18O 3-2 and the HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} lines towards NGC\n7129 FIRS 2. Combining these observations with Herschel data and modeling their\nemissions, we constrain the C18O and HDO abundance profiles across the\nprotostellar envelope. In particular, we derive the abundance of C18O and HDO\nin the hot core. The intensities of the C18O lines are well reproduced assuming\nthat the C18O abundance decreases through the protostellar envelope from the\nouter edge towards the centre until the point where the gas and dust reach the\nCO evaporation temperature (~20-25 K) where the C18O is released back to the\ngas phase. Once the C18O is released to the gas phase, the modelled C18O\nabundance is found to be ~1.6x10^{-8}, which is a factor of 10 lower than the\nreference abundance. This result is supported by the non-detection of C18O 9-8,\nwhich proves that even in the hot core (T_k>100 K) the CO abundance must be 10\ntimes lower than the reference value. Several scenarios are discussed to\nexplain this C18O deficiency. One possible explanation is that during the\npre-stellar and protostellar phase, the CO is removed from the grain mantles by\nreactions to form more complex molecules. Our HDO modeling shows that the\nemission of HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} line is maser and comes from the hot core\n(T_k>100 K). Assuming the physical structure derived by Crimier et al.

Both Type I\n(single exponential) and Type II (down-turning) observed disk\nsurface-brightness profiles can be explained by our findings. We relate these\nresults to the strong angular momentum outward transfer, resulting from torques\nand radial migration associated with multiple patterns, such as central bars\nand spiral waves of different multiplicity. We show that even for stars ending\nup on cold orbits, the changes in angular momentum exhibit complex structure as\na function of radius, unlike the expected effect of transient spirals alone.\nFocussing on one of our models, we find evidence for non-linear coupling among\nm=1, 2, 3 and 4 density waves, where m is the pattern multiplicity. We suggest\nthat the naturally occurring larger resonance widths at galactic radii beyond\nfour scale-lengths may have profound consequences on the formation and location\nof breaks in disk density profiles, provided spirals are present at such large\ndistances. We also consider the effect of gas inflow and show that when\nin-plane smooth gas accretion of ~5 M_sun/yr is included, the outer disks\nbecome more unstable, leading to a strong increase in the stellar velocity\ndispersion. This, in turn, causes the formation of a Type III (up-turning)\nprofile in the old stellar population. We propose that observations of Type III\nsurface brightness profiles, combined with an up-turn in the stellar velocity\ndispersions beyond the disk break, could be a signature of ongoing\ngas-accretion. The results of this study suggest that disk outskirts comprised\nof stars migrated from the inner disk would have relatively large radial\nvelocity dispersions, and significant thickness when seen edge-on.

Mrk 509 shows a clear (EW=58 eV) neutral Fe Kalpha emission line\nthat can be decomposed into a narrow (sigma=0.027 keV) component (found in the\nChandra HETG data) plus a resolved (sigma=0.22 keV) component. We find the\nfirst successful measurement of a linear correlation between the intensity of\nthe resolved line component and the 3-10 keV flux variations on time-scales of\nyears down to a few days. The Fe Kalpha reverberates the hard X-ray continuum\nwithout any measurable lag, suggesting that the region producing the resolved\nFe Kalpha component is located within a few light days-week (r<~10^3 rg) from\nthe Black Hole (BH). The lack of a redshifted wing in the line poses a lower\nlimit of >40 rg for its distance from the BH. The Fe Kalpha could thus be\nemitted from the inner regions of the BLR, i.e. within the ~80 light days\nindicated by the Hbeta line measurements. In addition to these two neutral Fe\nKalpha components, we confirm the detection of weak (EW~8-20 eV) ionised Fe K\nemission. This ionised line can be modeled with either a blend of two narrow\nFeXXV and FeXXVI emission lines or with a single relativistic line produced, in\nan ionised disc, down to a few rg from the BH. Finally, we observe a\nweakening/disappearing of the medium and high velocity high ionisation Fe K\nwind features found in previous XMM-Newton observations. This campaign has made\npossible the first reverberation measurement of the resolved component of the\nFe Kalpha line, from which we can infer a location for the bulk of its emission\nat a distance of r~40-1000 rg from the BH. \n\n"}

Lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellar\nenvironments, so its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among different\nmodels proposed to account for multiple populations. In order to reproduce the\nobserved O-Na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiple\npopulations, the formation of second generation stars must occur from the\nnuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible of the chemical anomalies,\ndiluted with pristine gas having the composition of first generation stars. The\nlithium abundance in the unprocessed gas -which is very likely to be equal to\nthe lithium abundance emerging from the Big Bang- affects the lithium chemical\npatterns among the cluster stars. This paper focuses on a scenario in which\nprocessed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine\nthe predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiple\npopulations. We study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in the\nejecta of massive AGB (A(Li)~2), and, at the same time, we explore how our\nmodels can constrain the extremely large ---and very model dependent--- lithium\nyields predicted by recent super--AGB models. We show that the super--AGB\nyields may be tested by examining the lithium abundances in a large set of blue\nmain sequence stars in wCen and/or NGC2808. In addition, we examine the\ndifferent model results obtained by assuming for the pristine gas either the\nBig Bang abundance predicted by the standard models (A(Li)=2.6-2.7), or the\nabundance detected at the surface of population II stars (A(Li)=2.2-2.3). Once\na chemical model is well constrained, the O--Li distribution could perhaps be\nused to shed light on the primordial lithium abundance. \n\n"}

One important question is\nwhether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition\nof the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely\naffected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or\nprovide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which\ncan help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE\n1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to\nobserve the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the\nS I line. A 3sigma$upper limit on the equivalent width (EW) of any line in our\nspectrum is EW<0.66 pm. Using either one-dimensional static or\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamical model-atmospheres, this translates into a\nrobust upper limit of [S/H]<-2.6. Conclusions: This upper limit does not\nprovide conclusive evidence for or against dust-gas winnowing, and the evidence\ncoming from other elements (e.g., Na and Ti) is also inconclusive or\ncontradictory. The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the\nmetals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive \"fall-back\" are not mutually\nexclusive. It is possible that dust formation distorts the peculiar abundance\npattern created by a supernova with fall-back, thus the abundance ratios in HE\n1327-2326 may be used to constrain the properties of the supernova(e) that\nproduced its metals, but with some caution. \n\n"}

Given the age of the system, this\nplanet should have been tidally circularized a long time ago. Many attempts to\nexplain this were proposed in recent years, either involving abnormally weak\ntides, or the perturbing action of a distant companion. We address here the\nlatter issue based on Kozai migration. We propose that GJ 436b was formerly\nlocated further away from the star and that it underwent a migration induced by\na massive, inclined perturber via Kozai mechanism. In this context, the\nperturbations by the companion trigger high amplitude variations to GJ 436b\nthat cause tides to act at periastron. Then the orbit tidally shrinks to reach\nits present day location. We numerically integrate the 3-body system including\ntides and General Relativity correction. We first show that starting from the\npresent-day location of GJ 436b inevitably leads to damping the Kozai\noscillations and to rapidly circularizing the planet. Conversely, starting from\n5-10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak\neccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major axis of the planet. The net\nresult is an evolution characterized by two phases: a first one with Kozai\ncycles and a slowly shrinking semi-major axis, and a second one once the planet\ngets out of the Kozai resonance characterized by a more rapid decrease. The\ntimescale of this process appears in most cases much longer than the standard\ncircularization time of the planet by a factor larger than 50. This model can\nprovide a solution to the eccentricity paradox of GJ 436b. Depending on the\nvarious orbital configurations, it can take several Gyrs to GJ 436b to achieve\na full orbital decrease and circularization. According to this scenario, we\ncould be witnessing today the second phase of the scenario where the semi-major\naxis is already reduced while the eccentricity is still significant. We then\nexplore the parameter space and derive in which conditions this model can be\nrealistic given the age of the system.

The light curve exhibits an abrupt\ntransition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau to a steep bolometric decline.\nLeading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits signs of\ninteraction with circumstellar material (CSM), in the form of relatively narrow\nP-Cygni features of H I and He I superimposed on broad Lorentzian wings. For\nthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni\nprofiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after the plateau has ended,\nthe SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden\ntransitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum. At this stage,\nthe light curve exhibits a low luminosity that is comparable to that\nsub-luminous Type II-P supernovae, and a relatively fast visual-wavelength\ndecline that is significantly steeper than the Co-56 decay rate. However, the\ntotal bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56\ndecay, and implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun). We therefore characterize\nSN 2011ht as a bona-fide core-collapse SN very similar to the peculiar SNe IIn\n1994W and 2009kn.

This study marks the first time that this physical mechanism has been\nshown to dominate the radio light curve of an astrophysical transient. We do\nnot observe a thermal signature from the nova ejecta or synchrotron emission\nfrom the shock, due to the fact that these components were hidden behind the\nabsorbing screen of the Mira wind.\n  We estimate a mass loss rate for the Mira wind of Mdot_w ~ 10^-6 M_sun/yr.

Networks of GW interferometers\nhave poor angular resolution on the sky and their EM signatures are predicted\nto be faint. Therefore, a challenging goal will be to unambiguously pinpoint\nthe EM counterparts to GW mergers. We perform the first comprehensive\nend-to-end simulation that focuses on: i) GW sky localization, distance\nmeasures and volume errors with two compact binary populations and four\ndifferent GW networks, ii) subsequent detectability by a slew of\nmultiwavelength telescopes and, iii) final identification of the merger\ncounterpart amidst a sea of possible astrophysical false-positives.

In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using\nthe now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is\ndemonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first\n5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with\nsolar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes a\nstarburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar\nsystem.

While both direct detections and stacking suggest that the AGN\nfraction in sBzK galaxies is high, there is no clear evidence for widespread\nCompton thick activity in either the sBzK population generally, or the IR\nExcess sBzK subsample.

We use a new observational constraint, which relates the\nluminosity of AGNs to the star-formation rate (SFR) of their host galaxies. We\nshow that this new constraint is important in various aspects: a) it indicates\nthat BH accretion events are episodic; b) it favours a scenario in which BH\naccretion is triggered by merger events of all mass ratios; c) it constrains\nthe duration of both merger-induced star-bursts and BH accretion events.

The high surface density of the natal core around the protostar\nleads to high extinction, even at these relatively long wavelengths, causing\nthe observed flux to be dominated by that emerging from the near-facing outflow\ncavity. However, emission from the far-facing cavity is still clearly detected.\nWe combine these results with fluxes from the near-infrared to mm to construct\na spectral energy distribution (SED). For isotropic emission the bolometric\nluminosity would be 3.3x10^4 Lsun. We perform radiative transfer modeling of a\nprotostar forming by ordered, symmetric collapse from a massive core bounded by\na clump with high mass surface density, Sigma_cl. To fit the SED requires\nprotostellar masses ~20-34 Msun depending on the outflow cavity opening angle\n(35 - 50 degrees), and Sigma_cl ~ 0.4-1 g cm-2.

This monitoring was performed in\norder to investigate variabilities of the Be disk due to the interaction with\nthe neutron star in recent X-ray active phase from 2008 to 2011. Such\nvariabilities give a clue to uncleared detailed mechanism for very bright X-ray\noutbursts, which are unique to some Be/X-ray binaries with relatively wide and\neccentric orbit. In the previous letter (Moritani et al. 2011), a brief\noverview of line profile variabilities around the 2009 giant outburst was given\nand the possibility of a warped Be disk was discussed. In this paper, a full\nanalysis of the Halpha line profiles as well as other line profiles is carried\nout. A bright blue component, or blue \"shoulder\", showing up after periastron\nindicates the presence of a dense gas stream toward the neutron star, which is\nassociated with observed outbursts.

While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy.

All-sky model of thermal dust emission Abstract: This paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the Planck 857,\n545 and 353 GHz, and IRAS 100 micron data. Using a modified black-body fit to\nthe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and\nspectral index over the 353-3000 GHz range. This model is a tight\nrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. It shows variations of the order of 30\n% compared with the widely-used model of Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel. The\nPlanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole\nsky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to\nprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. An\nincrease of the dust opacity at 353 GHz, tau_353/N_H, from the diffuse to the\ndenser interstellar medium (ISM) is reported. It is associated with a decrease\nin the observed dust temperature, T_obs, that could be due at least in part to\nthe increased dust opacity. We also report an excess of dust emission at HI\ncolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust in\nthe warm ionized medium. In the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitude, we\nreport an anti-correlation between tau_353/N_H and T_obs while the dust\nspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency\n(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant.

The strength of the halo field is\ncomparable to that of the disk. The total and turbulent magnetic field strength\nis (weakly) increasing with the star formation. There are, however, indications\nthat stronger star formation reduces the magnetic field regularity globally.\nThe magnetic field in spiral galaxies is generally thought to be amplified and\nmaintained by dynamo action. During the galaxy's formation and evolution the\nturbulent dynamo amplifies the field strength to energy equipartition with the\nturbulent gas, while the large-scale (mean-field) dynamo mainly orders the\nmagnetic field. Hence, the large-scale magnetic field pattern evolves with\ntime. Supernova explosions causes a further continuous injection of turbulent\nmagnetic fields. Assuming that this small-scale field injection is situated\nonly within the spiral arm region where star formation mostly occurs lead to a\nlarge-scale field structure in which the magnetic field regularity is stronger\nin the interarm region as observed in several nearby spiral galaxies.

At intermediate metallicities of 1e-5--1e-3Zsun,\nhowever, the disks are found to be strongly unstable with Q ~ 0.1--1 since dust\ncooling, which is effective only in the disks due to their high density (> 1e10\ncm^-3), makes the temperature in the disks lower than that in the envelopes.\nThis indicates that masses of the individual stars formed as a result of the\nprotostellar disk fragmentation can be significantly smaller than their parent\ncore in this metallicity range. The typical stellar mass in this case would be\na few Msun, which is consistent with the observationally suggested mass-scale\nof extremely metal-poor stars. \n\n"}

Young massive cluster (YMC) progenitor\nclouds in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density without\nforming stars that the initial protostellar densities are close to the final\nstellar density. For this to hold in the disk, the time scale to accumulate the\ngas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star formation\ntimescale. Otherwise the gas begins forming stars while it is being accumulated\nto high density. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two\nenvironments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally-dependent\ndensity thresholds for star formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of\nsimilar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initial\nprotostellar densities. The fact that no systematic variations in fundamental\nproperties are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests\nstellar mass assembly is not strongly affected by the initial protostellar\ndensity. We review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate on\nthree key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant\n(im)mortality and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude: the initial\nprotostellar distribution is likely hierarchical; YMCs likely experienced a\nformation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gas\nexpulsion; YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age; and YMCs have age\nspreads much smaller than their mean age.

Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sersic index and\nbulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40-50%) among star-forming\ngalaxies above 10^11 Msun.

Furthermore, slowdown of\nbar pattern speed weakens substantially with increasing `lambda,' until it\nceases completely.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod to probe sub-parsec BBHs through microlensing of lensed QSOs. If a QSO\nhosts a sub-parsec BBH in its center, it is expected that the BBH is surrounded\nby a circum-binary disk, each component of the BBH is surrounded by a small\naccretion disk, and a gap is opened by the secondary component in between the\ncircum-binary disk and the two small disks. Assuming such a BBH structure, we\ngenerate mock microlensing light curves for some QSO systems that host BBHs\nwith typical physical parameters. We show that microlensing light curves of a\nBBH QSO system at the infrared-optical-UV bands can be significantly different\nfrom those of corresponding QSO system with a single massive black hole (MBH),\nmainly because of the existence of the gap and the rotation of the BBH (and its\nassociated small disks) around the center of mass.

On the other hand, the\nfraction of clumpy galaxies increases with increasing both SFR and SSFR in all\nthe redshift ranges we investigated. In particular, we found that the SSFR\ndependences of the fractions are similar among galaxies with different stellar\nmasses, and the fraction at a given SSFR does not depend on the stellar mass in\neach redshift bin. The evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies from z~0.9\nto z~0.3 seems to be explained by such SSFR dependence of the fraction and the\nevolution of SSFRs of star-forming galaxies. The fraction at a given SSFR also\nappears to decrease with time, but this can be due to the effect of the\nmorphological K-correction.

We\npresent a picture in which the population of AGN can be divided into two\ndistinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes\nthat produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ~1% of\nthe Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black\nholes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the\ntotal mass budget in these black holes in ~10 Gyr.

In addition, the increase in stellar ages with time for\nmassive galaxies is consistent with passive evolution since z = 0.7. Taken\ntogether, these results favor a scenario in which the inner ~ 0.3-3 R_e of\nmassive quiescent galaxies have been passively evolving over the last half of\ncosmic time. Interestingly, the derived stellar ages are considerably younger\nthan the age of the universe at all epochs, consistent with an equivalent\nsingle-burst star formation epoch of z < 1.5.

The simulations without the quenching of the gas cooling\nin large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z < 2$ and fail to reproduce\ngalaxy downsizing. The simulations that do not employ the radiation pressure\nfeedback from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation.

Some stripped galaxies, in particular in merging\nclusters, develop spectacular star-forming tails, giving them a jellyfish-like\nappearance.

The high excitation of CO lines in\nmergers is dominated by an excess of high-density gas, and the high turbulent\nvelocities and compression that create this dense gas excess result in broad\nlinewidths and low CO intensity-to-H2 mass ratios. When applied to\nhigh-redshift gas-rich disks galaxies, the same model predicts that their\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor is almost as high as in nearby spirals, and much\nhigher than in starbursting mergers.

Our sample spans stellar\nmasses of 10^9 to 6*10^11 solar masses, SFRs of 0.4 to 270 solar masses per\nyear, and metal abundances of 12+log(O/H)~8.3-9.1 (~0.4-2.6 solar metallicity).\nThe correlations that we find between the Ha-based SFR and stellar mass (i.e.,\nthe star-forming \"main sequence\"), and between the stellar mass and\nmetallicity, are both consistent with previous z~1 studies of star-forming\ngalaxies. We then study the relationship between the three properties using\nvarious plane-fitting techniques (Lara-Lopez et al.) and a curve-fitting\nprojection (Mannucci et al.). In all cases, we exclude strong dependence of the\nM-Z relation on SFR, but are unable to distinguish between moderate and no\ndependence. Our results are consistent with previous mass-metallicity-SFR\nstudies. We check whether dataset limitations may obscure a strong dependence\non the SFR by using mock samples drawn from the SDSS.

Additionally, there is a distinct, spherically symmetric excess of gamma\nrays seen by Fermi-LAT in the GeV range. A cosmic ray flare, occurring in the\nGalactic Center, $10^4$ years ago has been proposed to explain the TeV Ridge.\nAn alternative, steady-state model explaining all three data sets (TeV, GeV,\nand radio) invokes purely leptonic processes. We show that the flare model from\nthe Galactic Center also provides an acceptable fit to the GeV and radio data,\nprovided the diffusion coefficient is energy independent. However, if\nKolmogorov-type turbulence is assumed for the diffusion coefficient, we find\nthat two flares are needed, one for the TeV data (occurring approximately $10^4\n$ years ago) and an older one for the GeV data (approximately $10^5$ years\nold). We find that the flare models we investigate do not fit the spherically\nsymmetric GeV excess as well as the usual generalized Navarro-Frenk-White\nspatial profile, but are better suited to explaining the Ridge.

Such a calibration\nshould include well understood correlations with halo mass, and the possibility\nto identify galaxies which dominate their potential well (centrals), and their\nsatellites. Focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmental\ncalibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to medium\nresolution spectroscopic surveys. Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures\non different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for\nsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is\nfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case\nthe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the\naperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an\nobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure\nand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is\nmost meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of\nenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on\nstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites.

The\nclassic unheated and unperturbed cooling flow model predicts dramatic cooling\nrates and an isobaric X-ray spectrum with constant differential luminosity\ndistribution. The observed cores of clusters (and groups) show instead a strong\ndeficit of soft X-ray emission: $dL_{\\rm x}/dT \\propto (T/T_{\\rm\nhot})^{\\alpha=2\\pm1}$. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such\ndeficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability\ncondensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN\noutflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The\nresultant average distribution slope is $\\alpha \\simeq 2$, oscillating within\nthe observed $1<\\alpha<3$. In the absence of thermal instability, the X-ray\nspectrum remains isothermal ($\\alpha > 8$), while unopposed cooling drives a\ntoo shallow slope, $\\alpha<1$. AGN outflows deposit their energy inside-out,\nreleasing more heat in the inner cooler phase; radially distributed heating\nalone induces a declining spectrum, $1<\\alpha<2$. Turbulence further steepens\nthe spectrum and increases the scatter: the turbulent Mach number in the hot\nphase is subsonic, while it becomes transonic in the cooler phase, making\nperturbations to depart from the isobaric mode.

The orbital histories of these satellites provide the\nkey to understanding the role of the MW/M31 halo, lower-mass groups, and cosmic\nreionization on the evolution of dwarf galaxies. We examine the virial-infall\nhistories of satellites with M_star = 10^{3-9} M_sun using the ELVIS suite of\ncosmological zoom-in dissipationless simulations of 48 MW/M31-like halos.\nSatellites at z = 0 fell into the MW/M31 halos typically 5 - 8 Gyr ago at z =\n0.5 - 1. However, they first fell into any host halo typically 7 - 10 Gyr ago\nat z = 0.7 - 1.5. This difference arises because many satellites experienced\n\"group preprocessing\" in another host halo, typically of M_vir ~ 10^{10-12}\nM_sun, before falling into the MW/M31 halos. Satellites with lower mass and/or\nthose closer to the MW/M31 fell in earlier and are more likely to have\nexperienced group preprocessing; half of all satellites with M_star < 10^6\nM_sun were preprocessed in a group. Infalling groups also drive most\nsatellite-satellite mergers within the MW/M31 halos. Finally, none of the\nsurviving satellites at z = 0 were within the virial radius of their MW/M31\nhalo during reionization (z > 6), and only < 4% were satellites of any other\nhost halo during reionization. Thus, effects of cosmic reionization versus\nhost-halo environment on the formation histories of surviving dwarf galaxies in\nthe LG occurred at distinct epochs, separated typically by 2 - 4 Gyr, so they\nare separable theoretically and, in principle, observationally. \n\n"}

We find no strong dependence of fesc on galaxy mass or\nredshift. In our simulations, the intrinsic ionizing photon budgets are\ndominated by stellar populations younger than 3 Myr, which tend to be buried in\ndense birth clouds.

We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently\nreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120\ndegrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc\ndecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component\nin about 6 dynamical times. During the late evolution of the misaligned gas\ndisc, the centre aligns faster than the outskirts, resulting in a warped disc.\nWe discuss the observational consequences of the long survival of our\nmisaligned gas disc and how our results can be used to calibrate merger rate\nestimates from observed gas misalignments. \n\n"}

According to the standard\nparadigm of galaxy formation, galaxies grow through a continuous accretion of\nfresh gas and a hierarchical merging with smaller galaxies from high redshift\nto the present day. This implies that the mass and size of disc, bulge, and\nhalo change with time. We investigate the effect of assuming a live Galactic\npotential on the orbital history of halo objects and its consequences on their\ninternal evolution. We numerically integrate backwards the equations of motion\nof different test objects located in different Galactocentric distances in both\nstatic and time-dependent Galactic potentials in order to see if it is possible\nto discriminate between them. We show that in a live potential, the birth of\nthe objects, 13 Gyr ago, would have occurred at significantly larger\nGalactocentric distances, compared to the objects orbiting in a static\npotential.

Here, we present a high-precision\ndifferential abundance analysis of the XO-2 wide stellar binary based on high\nresolution HARPS-N@TNG spectra.

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down.

We present the results of\na semi-analytical galaxy formation model that follows the evolution of dark\nmatter halos along merger trees, as well as that of the baryonic components.\nThis model allows us to study the evolution of NSCs in a cosmological context,\nby taking into account the growth of NSCs due to both dynamical friction-driven\nmigration of stellar clusters and star formation triggered by infalling gas,\nwhile also accounting for dynamical heating from (binary) MBHs. We find that\nin-situ star formation contributes a significant fraction (up to ~80%) of the\ntotal mass of NSCs in our model. Both NSC growth through in-situ star formation\nand through star cluster migration are found to generate NSC -- host galaxy\nscaling correlations that are shallower than the same correlations for MBHs.

We use HST\ngrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields,\nmore than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these\ndata with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a\npopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, using\nK-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0<z<2.5.

We infer from the kinematics and\nspatial distribution of Halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized\ngas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By\ncombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are\nconsistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc to\nV_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is\ndominated by the dense stellar component.

This direct collapse process is a leading\ncandidate for rapid formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high\nz. To circumvent the Courant condition at small radii, we have used the sink\nparticle method, and focus on the evolution on scales ~0.01-10 pc. The collapse\nproceeds in two stages, with the secondary runaway happening within the central\n10 pc, and with no detected fragmentation. The sink particles form when the\ncollapsing gas requires additional refinement of the grid size at the highest\nrefinement level. Their mass never exceeds ~10^3 Mo, with the sole exception of\nthe central seed which grows dramatically to ~ 2 x 10^6 Mo in ~2 Myr,\nconfirming the feasibility of this path to the SMBH. The time variability of\nangular momentum axis in the accreted gas results in the formation of two\nmisaligned disks --- a small inner disk, and a more massive, outer disk which\nis inclined by ~45^o to the inner disk. The self-gravity of these disks is\nheavily diluted --- both disks lie within the Roche limit of the central seed.\nWhile the inner disk is geometrically thin and weakly asymmetric, the outer\ndisk flares due to turbulent motions as a result of the massive inflow along a\npair of penetrating filaments. The geometry of inflow via filaments determines\nthe dominant and secondary Fourier modes in this disk --- these modes have a\nnon-self-gravitational origin. We do not confirm that m=1 is a principal mode\nthat drives the inflow in the presence of a central massive object. While the\npositions of the disks depend on the scale chosen to break the self-similar\ncollapse, the overall configuration appears to be generic, and is expected to\nform when the central seed becomes sufficiently massive. \n\n"}

Since filaments are tracers of medium-to-high density\nregions, we expect that galaxy properties associated with the environment are\ndependent on the distance to the nearest filament. Our analysis demonstrates\nthat a red galaxy or a high-mass galaxy tend to reside closer to filaments than\na blue or low-mass galaxy. After adjusting the effect from stellar mass, on\naverage, early-forming galaxies or large galaxies have a shorter distance to\nfilaments than late-forming galaxies or small galaxies.

The spectral fit of the four components is consistent\nwith a scenario in which the outer lobes are still active or the jets recently\nswitched off, while emission of the inner lobes is the result of a mix-up of\nnew and old jet activity.

Abstract: Large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relative\nto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before\nreionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple\narguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in\nlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have\nimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely\nmetal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost\nimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is\ntoo low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars\nmay contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in\nlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)\ncan be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling\nabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard\ncore-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We\nalso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in\nthese species agrees with our simulations.

This suggests that (1)\ndust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light\nelement abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust\nwhere they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis. \n\n"}

For $z>2.6$, where\nthe corresponding Ly$\\beta$ is redshifted to the optical, we have developed the\ntechnique to differentiate between these two alternatives. We have applied this\ntechnique to SDSS-III quasar survey at $z = 2.6$ - 3.3, and we present a sample\nof five CoSLA candidates with $\\tau_{\\rm{eff}}$ on 15 $h^{-1}$ Mpc greater than\n$4.5\\times$ the mean optical depth. At lower redshifts of $z < 2.6$, where the\nbackground quasar density is higher, the overdensity can be traced by\nintergalactic absorption groups using multiple sight lines. Our overdensity\nsearches fully utilize the current and next generation of Ly$\\alpha$ forest\nsurveys which cover a survey volume of $> (1\\ h^{-1}$ Gpc)$^3$. In addition,\nsystems traced by CoSLAs will build a uniform sample of the most massive\noverdensities at $z > 2$ to constrain the models of structure formation, and\noffer a unique laboratory to study the interactions between galaxy\noverdensities and the intergalactic medium. \n\n"}

Abstract: The largest observed supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have a mass of M_BH ~\n10^{10} M_sun, nearly independent of redshift, from the local (z~0) to the\nearly (z>6) Universe. We suggest that the growth of SMBHs above a few 10^{10}\nM_sun is prevented by small-scale accretion physics, independent of the\nproperties of their host galaxies or of cosmology. Growing more massive BHs\nrequires a gas supply rate from galactic scales onto a nuclear region as high\nas >10^3 M_sun/yr. At such a high accretion rate, most of the gas converts to\nstars at large radii (~10-100 pc), well before reaching the BH. We adopt a\nsimple model (Thompson et al. 2005) for a star-forming accretion disk, and find\nthat the accretion rate in the sub-pc nuclear region is reduced to the smaller\nvalue of at most a few M_sun/yr. This prevents SMBHs from growing above\n~10^{11} M_sun in the age of the Universe. Furthermore, once a SMBH reaches a\nsufficiently high mass, this rate falls below the critical value at which the\naccretion flow becomes advection dominated. Once this transition occurs, BH\nfeeding can be suppressed by strong outflows and jets from hot gas near the BH.\nWe find that the maximum SMBH mass, given by this transition, is between\nM_{BH,max} ~ (1-6) * 10^{10} M_sun, depending primarily on the efficiency of\nangular momentum transfer inside the galactic disk, and not on other properties\nof the host galaxy. \n\n"}

This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored. We use this \"drift and\nshift\" (DASH) method in the Cycle 23 COSMOS-DASH program, which will obtain 456\nWFC3 $H_{160}$ pointings in 57 orbits, covering an area of 0.6 degree$^2$ in\nthe COSMOS field down to $H_{160} = 25$. When completed, the program will more\nthan triple the area of extra-galactic survey fields covered by near-IR imaging\nat HST resolution.

We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing\nmodel to simulate the UV/optical lightcurves of NGC 5548. We show that disc\nreprocessing of the observed hard X-ray lightcurve produces optical lightcurves\nwith too much fast variability as well as too short a lag time. Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to\natomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the\nscale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it\nradiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft\nX-ray excess. The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonised disc region emits FUV\nflux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc but while this gives\nreprocessed variable emission which is much closer to the observed UV and\noptical lightcurves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the\ndata.

To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon.

We review the main mechanisms of gravitational-wave\nproduction, ranging from quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field to\nother mechanisms that can take place during or after inflation. These include\ne.g. gravitational waves generated as a consequence of extra particle\nproduction during inflation, or during the (p)reheating phase.

The mainstream response to this\nconundrum is to invoke large quantities of `dark matter' -- which purportedly\nsupplies the needed extra gravity -- and also of `dark energy', to account for\nfurther anomalies in cosmology, such as the observed, accelerated expansion.\nThe MOND paradigm offers a different solution: a breakdown of standard dynamics\n(gravity and/or inertia) in the limit of low accelerations -- below some\nacceleration $a_0$. In this limit, dynamics become space-time scale invariant,\nand is controlled by a gravitational constant $\\mathcal{A}_0\\equiv Ga_0$, which\nreplaces Newton's $G$. With the new dynamics, the various detailed\nmanifestations of the anomalies in galaxies are predicted with no need for dark\nmatter. The cosmological anomalies could, but need not have to do with small\naccelerations. For example, the need for dark matter in accounting for the\nexpansion history of the Universe is eliminated if the relevant gravitational\nconstant is $\\approx 2\\pi G$.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum.

However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed.

Here we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the\nlargest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II\ntelescope.

The mass-to-light ratio is M/L=48 M_sun/L_sun, and the dark\nmatter fraction is 98 percent within the half-light radius. The high mass of\nDragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population. From deep\nGemini imaging taken in 0.4\" seeing we infer that Dragonfly 44 has 94 globular\nclusters, similar to the counts for other galaxies in this mass range.

The predicted number density of DCBH\nseeds is highly sensitive to the minimum value of the ultraviolet (UV) flux\nrequired to suppress H$_{2}$ formation, $J_{\\rm crit}$.

We find that shock dissipation is a steep function of\nradius, with most of the energy dissipated within 30 kpc, while radiative\ncooling loses area less concentrated. However, adiabatic processes and mixing\n(of post-shock materials and the surrounding gas) are able to redistribute the\nheat throughout the core.

Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the\nnear-infrared 10830 \\AA~and 2 $\\mu$m lines of He I. We first consider a double\ndetonation model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This\nmodel has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0.03 $M_{\\odot}$ and our\ncalculations suggest that the 2 $\\mu$m feature is expected to be very weak but\nthat the 10830 \\AA~feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta.\nConsequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nexpected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum\nlight.

Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in\nprimarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale\nfluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling\nof dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on\ngrain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order\ncorrection. We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three\ndimensionless numbers in the limit of weak background magnetic fields: the\nturbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional to grain size) and a\ndust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to\ngeneralize our simulations to a wide range of conditions. \n\n"}

At a\nfixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher $D_n4000$ have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. $D_n4000$ is a proxy for stellar population age,\nthus these trends suggest that older galaxies typically have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. We combine velocity dispersion and size into a\ndynamical mass estimator, $\\sigma^2 R$. At a fixed stellar mass, $\\sigma^2 R$\ndepends on $D_n4000$. The S\\'ersic index is also correlated with $D_n4000$. The\ndependence of $\\sigma^2 R$ and S\\'ersic index on $D_n4000$ suggests that\nquiescent galaxies are not structurally homologous systems.

We considered galaxies up to 10 $h^{-1}$Mpc from\nfilaments, i.e. deep inside voids. The filaments were defined by a point\nprocess (the Bisous model) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 10.\nIn order to remove the dependence of galaxy properties on the environment\ndensity and redshift, we applied weighting to normalise the corresponding\ndistributions of galaxy populations in each bin. After the normalisation with\nrespect to environment density and redshift, several residual dependencies of\ngalaxy properties still remain. Most notable is the trend of morphology\ntransformations, resulting in a higher elliptical-to-spiral ratio while moving\nfrom voids towards filament spines, bringing along a corresponding increase in\nthe $g-i$ colour index and a decrease in star formation rate. After separating\nelliptical and spiral subsamples, some of the colour index and star formation\nrate evolution still remains. The mentioned trends are characteristic only for\ngalaxies brighter than about $M_{r} = -20$ mag.

Unlike previous cluster-scale lens\nanalyses, our technique accounts for the full three-dimensional mass structure\nin the beam, including galaxies along the line of sight. In contrast with past\ncluster analyses that use only lensed image positions as constraints, we use\nthe full surface brightness distribution of the images.

At cosmological scales, inferred dynamics are also\ninconsistent with GR and the observed distribution of mass. The current\naccelerated expansion rate requires the introduction of a hypothetical dark\nenergy dominant component. We here show that for a Schwarzschild metric at\ngalactic scales, the scalar curvature, K, multiplied by $(r^{4}/M)$ at the\ncritical MOND transition radius, $r=R_{c}$, has an invariant value of\n$\\kappa_{B}=K(r^{4}/M)=28Ga_{0}/c^{4}$. Further, assuming this condition holds\nfor $r>R_{c}$, is consistent with the full spacetime which under GR corresponds\nto a dominant isothermal dark matter halo, to within observational precision at\ngalactic level.

The RQS\nprogram aims to provide a large and diverse quasar data set for studying\nvariations in quasar spectra on timescales of years, a comparison sample for\nthe FES quasar programs, and opportunity for discovering rare, serendipitous\nevents. The FES programs cover a wide variety of phenomena in both quasars and\nstars. Quasar FES programs target broad absorption line quasars, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio normal broad line quasars, quasars with double-peaked or\nvery asymmetric broad emission line profiles, binary supermassive black hole\ncandidates, and the most photometrically variable quasars. Strongly variable\nstars are also targeted for repeat spectroscopy, encompassing many types of\neclipsing binary systems, and classical pulsators like RR Lyrae. Other stellar\nFES programs allow spectroscopic variability studies of active ultracool dwarf\nstars, dwarf carbon stars, and white dwarf/M dwarf spectroscopic binaries.

Abstract: Radio mode feedback, associated with the propagation of powerful outflows in\nactive galaxies, is a crucial ingredient in galaxy evolution. Extragalactic\njets are well collimated and relativistic, both in terms of thermodynamics and\nkinematics. They generate strong shocks in the ambient medium, associated with\nobserved hotspots, and carve cavities that are filled with the shocked jet\nflow. In this Letter, we compare the pressure evolution in the hotspot and the\ncavity generated by relativistic and classical jets. Our results show that the\nclassical approach underestimates the cavity pressure by a factor larger or\nequal to 2 for a given shocked volume during the whole active phase. The\ntension between both approaches can only be alleviated by unrealistic jet flow\ndensities or gigantic jet areas in the classical case. As a consequence, the\nefficiency of a relativistic jet heating the ambient is typically around 20%\nlarger compared with a classical jet, and the heated volume is 2 to 10 times\nlarger during the time evolution. This conflict translates into two\nsubstantially disparate manners, both spatially and temporal, of heating the\nambient medium. These differences are expected to have relevant implications on\nthe star formation rates of the host galaxies and their evolution. \n\n"}

It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small\nscales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo\nconnection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the\n\"accurate\" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful\ntreatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling\napproach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional\ntwo-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard\n$\\Lambda\\mathrm{CDM}$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies.\nSpecifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity\nfunction and galaxy number density as constraints.

It goes under the name of ${\\Lambda}$CDM.\nHowever, there are still challenging questions that remain unanswered by this\nmodel, such as what causes the observed accelerated expansion of the universe,\nand many alternatives have been proposed. This thesis concerns an approach to\ntest such models known as \"Effective Theory of Dark Energy\" . It applies to all\nmodels where general relativity is modified by adding a single scalar degree of\nfreedom, called \"scalar-tensor theories\". In Chapter 1 I summarise the most\ngeneral class of such theories currently known, called \"Degenerate higher-Order\nScalar-Tensor\" (DHOST) theories. In Chapter 2, I introduce the effective theory\nof dark energy. The inclusion of a general coupling between matter and the\ngravitational sector is the subject of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 analyses in details\nthe stability of different classes of theories. Notably, I show that the most\ngeneral class of theories free from instabilities reduces to the so-called\nHorndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories, up to a non minimal coupling to\nmatter. Another goal of the thesis is to study the observable effects of\ndeviations from ${\\Lambda}$CDM. In Chapter 5, I consider the possibility of an\ninteraction between dark matter and dark energy and I analyse the constraining\npower of future surveys on the free parameters of the theory. Chapter 6 focuses\non the observational effects of theories where a kinetic mixing between matter\nand the scalar field exists.

The study of the fragmentation process has been motivated\nby simple analytical models. However, only a few comprehensive studies have\nanalysed the evolution of filaments using numerical simulations where the\nfilaments form self-consistently as part of molecular clouds. We address the\nearly evolution of pc-scale filaments that form within individual clouds. We\nfocus on three questions: How do the line masses of filaments evolve? How and\nwhen do the filaments fragment? How does the fragmentation relate to the line\nmasses of the filaments? We examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in\nkpc-scale numerical simulations performed with the FLASH code. We compare the\nproperties of the identified filaments with the predictions of analytic\nfilament stability models. The line masses and mass fraction enclosed in the\nidentified filaments increase continuously after the onset of self-gravity. The\nfirst fragments appear early when the line masses lie well below the critical\nline mass of Ostriker's hydrostatic equilibrium solution. The average line\nmasses of filaments identified in 3D density cubes increases far more quickly\nthan those identified in 2D column density maps. Our results suggest that\nhydrostatic or dynamic compression from the surrounding cloud has a significant\nimpact on the early dynamical evolution of filaments.

Combining DES16C2nm with ten similar events from the literature, we\nshow that there exists a homogeneous class of SLSNe-I in the UV (~2500A), with\npeak luminosities in the (rest-frame) U band, and increasing absorption to\nshorter wavelengths. There is no evidence that the mean photometric and\nspectroscopic properties of SLSNe-I differ between low (z<1) and high redshift\n(z>1), but there is clear evidence of diversity in the spectrum at <2000A,\npossibly caused by the variations in temperature between events. No significant\ncorrelations are observed between spectral line velocities and photometric\nluminosity. Using these data, we estimate that SLSNe-I can be discovered to\nz=3.8 by DES. While SLSNe-I are typically identified from their blue observed\ncolors at low redshift (z<1), we highlight that at z>2 these events appear\noptically red, peaking in the observer-frame z-band. Such characteristics are\ncritical to identify these objects with future facilities such as the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid, and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey\nTelescope, which should detect such SLSNe-I to z=3.5, 3.7, and 6.6,\nrespectively. \n\n"}

It consists of two populations of different colour distributions,\ndubbed pseudo-blue and pseudo-red, respectively, with each further separated\ninto central and satellite galaxies. We define a global parameterization of\nthese four colour-magnitude distributions and their dependence on halo mass,\nand we infer parameter values by simultaneously fitting the space densities and\nauto-correlation functions of 79 galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey defined by fine bins in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The model\ndeprojects the overall galaxy CMD, revealing its tomograph along the halo mass\ndirection. The bimodality of the colour distribution is driven by central\ngalaxies at most luminosities, though at low luminosities it is driven by the\ndifference between blue centrals and red satellites. For central galaxies, the\ntwo pseudo-colour components are distinct and orthogonal to each other in the\nCCMD: at fixed halo mass, pseudo-blue galaxies have a narrow luminosity range\nand broad colour range, while pseudo-red galaxies have a narrow colour range\nand broad luminosity range.

Here, we\ninvestigate the combined effect of gas angular momentum and radiation feedback\non the accretion flow, by performing 2D axially symmetric radiation\nhydrodynamics simulations that solve the flow structure across the Bondi radius\nand the outer part of the accretion disc simultaneously. The accreting gas with\nfinite angular momentum forms a rotationally-supported disc inside the Bondi\nradius, where the accretion proceeds by the angular momentum transport due to\nassumed alpha-type viscosity. We find that the interplay of radiation and\nangular momentum significantly suppresses accretion even if the radiative\nfeedback is weakened in an equatorial shadowing region. The accretion rate is\nO(alpha)\\sim O(0.01-0.1) times the Bondi value, where alpha is the viscosity\nparameter.

For each system in this sample, we measure dM/dt using archival\nChandra X-ray data and acquire the SFR and systematic uncertainty in the SFR by\ncombining over 330 estimates from dozens of literature sources.

For these systems, we measure a slope in the SFR-dM/dt relation\ngreater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores\nare also cooling more efficiently. We propose that this may be related to, on\naverage, higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which\ncould influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and\ndominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback. For systems with dM/dt <\n30 Msun/yr, we find that the SFR and dM/dt are uncorrelated, and show that this\nis consistent with star formation being fueled at a low (but dominant) level by\nrecycled ISM gas in these systems.

For J1456,\nthe HI column density is $20.6\\pm0.2$, with za=2.3138, nearly identical to the\nquasar redshift (z=2.3142) determined from the [OIII] emission line. The\nmetallicity of this system is typical of DLAs and there is high ionization\ntherein, suggesting that the PDLA system is multiphase, putting it in the\nquasar environment. For J2153, we measure the HI column density to be\n$21.5\\pm0.1$ at za=3.511, slightly redshifted with respect to the quasar\n(z=3.490) measured from CIII]. The metallicity of this system is quite low and\nthere is a lack of significant high-ionization absorption lines therein,\nsuggesting that the system is beyond the quasar host galaxy. The residual flux\nis wide (1000 km/s) in J1456, with a significance of $8\\sigma$, while also wide\n(1500 km/s) but with a smaller significance of $3\\sigma$ in J2153. Among many\nexplanations, we find that Lya fuzz or resonant scattering can be used to\nexplain the residual flux in the two sources while partial coverage cannot be\nexcluded for J1456. By comparing these two cases, together with similar cases\nreported previously, we suggest that the strength of the residual flux is\nrelated to properties such as metallicity and high-ionization absorption lines\nof PDLAs. The residual flux recorded upon the PDLA absorption trough opens a\nwindow for us to see the physical conditions and processes of the quasar\nenvironment, and their profile and strength further remind us of their spatial\nscales. \n\n"}

The [CI] is consistent with a rotating\ndisc, aligned with the dust and stellar continuum, while the [OIII] likely\ntraces an outflow, aligned with two AGN-driven radio lobes. We model the [CI]\ncube using 3D disc models, which give best-fit rotation velocities V~310 km/s\nand velocity dispersions sigma<30 km/s. Hence, the [CI] disc has V/sigma>10 and\nis not particularly turbulent, similar to local galaxy discs. The dynamical\nmass (~10^11 Msun) is comparable to the baryonic mass within the errors. This\nsuggests that baryons dominate the inner galaxy dynamics, similar to massive\ngalaxies at z=0.

Abstract: We consider implications of high-energy neutrino emission from blazar flares,\nincluding the recent event IceCube-170922A and the 2014-2015 neutrino flare\nthat could originate from TXS 0506+056. First, we discuss their contribution to\nthe diffuse neutrino intensity taking into account various observational\nconstraints. Blazars are likely to be subdominant in the diffuse neutrino\nintensity at sub-PeV energies, and we show that blazar flares like those of TXS\n0506+056 could make <1-10 percent of the total neutrino intensity. We also\nargue that the neutrino output of blazars can be dominated by the flares in the\nstandard leptonic scenario for their gamma-ray emission, and energetic flares\nmay still be detected with a rate of <1 per year.

Instead, we found that the long periodic family of\n10.5-11.4 d (presumably) quasi-periods showing light variations up to 0.07 mag\nmay arise owing to the rotational revolution of disc inhomogeneities located\nbetween 16-20 solar radii.

The standoff\ndistance is influenced by a number of additional effects, e.g. (1) the\ngravitational pull of the main cluster (causing acceleration/deceleration of\nthe infalling subcluster), (2) the density and pressure gradients of the\natmosphere in the main cluster, (3) the non-spherical shape of the subcluster,\nand (4) projection effects.

The model was designed to match the local MZRs for both gas and stars\nsimultaneously. This is achieved by invoking a time-dependent metal enrichment\nprocess which assumes either a time-dependent metal outflow with larger metal\nloading factors in galactic winds at early times, or a time-dependent Initial\nMass Function (IMF) with steeper slopes at early times. We compare the\npredictions from this model with data sets covering redshifts 0<z<3.5. The data\nsuggests a two-phase evolution with a transition point around z ~ 1.5.

These scalars acquire non-zero expectation values during inflation\nthrough linear couplings to a function of an inflaton. After the inflaton\ndecay, the model possesses approximate U(1)-invariance, explicitly broken by a\nsmall mass splitting. This splitting leads to the baryogenesis in the early\nUniverse. Resulting baryon asymmetry is automatically small for the scalars\nwith the masses about the Grand Unification scale and larger. It is fully\ndetermined by the inflaton dynamics and the Lagrangian parameters, i.e., is\nindependent of initial pre-inflationary conditions for the scalars. As a\nconsequence, baryon perturbations are purely adiabatic. We point out a possible\norigin of the mass splitting: masses of scalars degenerate at some large energy\nscale may acquire different loop corrections due to the interaction with the\ninflaton. Compared to electroweak baryogenesis and conventional Affleck-Dine\nscenarios, our mechanism generically leads to the proton decay suppressed by\nthe powers of the superheavy scalar masses, which makes this scenario\npotentially testable. \n\n"}

First, we construct a two component model of the\nthree-dimensional phase space distribution of haloes surrounding clusters up to\n50 $h^{-1}$Mpc from cluster centres based on $N$-body simulations. We find that\nthe three-dimensional phase space distribution shows a clear cluster mass\ndependence up to the largest scale examined. We then calculate the probability\ndistribution function of pairwise line-of-sight velocities between clusters and\nhaloes by projecting the three-dimensional phase space distribution along the\nline-of-sight with the effect of the Hubble flow.

Although the method was initially developed to improve non-LTE\nsynthesis of spectral lines, it has been recently employed to model solar\nspectral irradiance variability. Such irradiance reconstruction techniques\ncombine spectral synthesis of different types of structures, which are\nperformed making use of factors derived from a reference, quiet Sun model.\nBecause the opacity scales in a complex way with plasma physical properties,\nthe question arises whether, and to what extent, fudge factors derived using a\nreference model can be used to adjust the opacity of models representing\ndifferent types of quiet and magnetic features.

We find that\nmodels of this type are disfavored relative to a simple dark matter halo model\nbecause the Milky Way data requires a substantial amplification of the radial\nacceleration with little amplification of the vertical acceleration. We\nconclude that models which result in a MOND-like force struggle to\nsimultaneously explain both the rotational velocity and vertical motion of\nnearby stars in the Milky Way. \n\n"}

We show that the neutrino\ndistribution has almost no unique observable imprint, as it is almost entirely\ndegenerate with the effective number of neutrino flavours, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$,\nand the neutrino mass, $m_{\\nu}$. Performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nanalysis with current cosmological data, we demonstrate that the neutrino mass\nbound heavily depends on the assumed momentum distribution of relic neutrinos.\nThe message of this work is simple and has to our knowledge not been pointed\nout clearly before: Cosmology allows that neutrinos have larger masses if their\naverage momentum is larger than that of a perfectly thermal distribution. Here\nwe provide an example in which the mass limits are relaxed by a factor of two. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.05616", "contents": "Title: Gravitational redshift profiles of MaNGA BCGs Abstract: The gravitational potential well of an $M>10^{13}$ $M_\\odot$ galaxy will lead\nto a gravitational redshift differential of order 1 km/s between the galaxy\ncore and its outskirts. Current surveys of massive galaxies with spatially\nresolved spectroscopy have reached a size which makes feasible attempts to\ndetect gravitational redshifts within galaxies. We use spectra from the Mapping\nNearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) experiment to attempt a\nmeasurement of the averaged stellar redshift profile of large elliptical\ngalaxies. We find that systematic effects (possibly related to charge transfer\nor wavelength calibration accuracy) make the standard MaNGA data pipeline\nunsuitable for measuring the relevant sub km/s wavelength shifts. We therefore\ndevelop a cross-correlation technique to mitigate these effects, but caution\nthat we are working beyond the design accuracy of the MaNGA experiment. With a\nsample of $272$ galaxies in halos with $\\log (M/M_\\odot)>13$, we attempt a\nmeasurement of the gravitational redshift profile, achieving $1 \\sigma$ errors\nof size $\\sim 0.5$ km/s, but are unable to make a significant detection of the\nsignal. Even without a detection, our measurement can be used to limit the dark\nmatter mass within the half light radius of elliptical galaxies to $1.2$ times\nthe stellar mass, at the 68% confidence level. We also perform weighting scheme\ntests and split sample tests, and address target selection issues and other\nrelativistic effects, including the transverse Doppler effect and relativistic\nbeaming of stars. Future detections could lead to new constraints on the galaxy\nmass distribution that are different from kinematic and lensing determinations\nand open a window on galaxy properties and tests of gravity. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.07571", "contents": "Title: Near-Field Cosmology with the Lowest-Mass Galaxies Abstract: The premise of \"near-field cosmology\" is that the study of nearby low-mass\ngalaxies on a star-by-star basis has implications that extend far beyond the\nlocal Universe and include the nature of dark matter, lives and deaths of the\nfirst stars, cosmic reionization, and galaxy formation across cosmic time. In\nresponse to the Astro2020 call for science white papers, we provide a\nhigh-level synopsis of several major questions in near-field cosmology, the\npotential for transformative progress in the next decade and beyond, and\nmechanisms for achieving these goals. Our recommendations include: (i)\nobtaining kinematic information from large samples of individual line-of-sight\nand transverse velocities of stars and from spatially resolved gas observations\nin nearby dwarf galaxies to directly inform our understanding of dark matter\ninteractions in the deeply nonlinear regime; and (ii) an intensive program of\noptical imaging and UV and optical spectroscopy of resolved stars in low-mass\ngalaxies, including low-metallicity massive stars and HII regions (which are\ncentral to understanding faint galaxies at all earlier epochs). Realizing these\naims requires a large aperture ($\\gtrsim 9$m) UV/optical space telescope, a\ntwo-fold community investment in ground-based optical spectroscopy through both\nELTs and a dedicated wide-field spectroscopic survey on a 10m class telescope,\nand radio facilities that can measure high-precision, spatially resolved\nrotation curves of low-mass galaxies. Finally, we suggest that a servicing\nmission to extend the life of HST beyond 2025 should be seriously explored. \n\n"}

The very high accretion rate makes it\npossible that massive black holes hosted in xA quasars radiate at a stable,\nextreme luminosity-to-mass ratio. This in turns translates into stable physical\nand dynamical conditions of the mildly ionized gas in the quasar low-ionization\nline emitting region. In this contribution, we analyze the main optical and UV\nspectral properties of extreme Population A quasars that make them easily\nidentifiable in large spectroscopic surveys at low-z (z < 1) and intermediate-z\n(2 < z < 2.6), and the physical conditions that are derived for the formation\nof their emission lines. Ultimately, the analysis supports the possibility of\nidentifying a virial broadening estimator from low-ionization line widths, and\nthe conceptual validity of the redshift-independent luminosity estimates based\non virial broadening for a known luminosity-to-mass ratio. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.11036", "contents": "Title: Black hole scaling relations of active and quiescent galaxies:\n  Addressing selection effects and constraining virial factors Abstract: Local samples of quiescent galaxies with dynamically measured black hole\nmasses (Mbh) may suffer from an angular resolution-related selection effect,\nwhich could bias the observed scaling relations between Mbh and host galaxy\nproperties away from the intrinsic relations. In particular, previous work has\nshown that the observed Mbh-Mstar (stellar mass) relation is more strongly\nbiased than the Mbh-sigma (velocity dispersion) relation. Local samples of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) do not suffer from this selection effect, as in\nthese samples Mbh is estimated from megamasers and/or reverberation\nmapping-based techniques. With the exception of megamasers, Mbh-estimates in\nthese AGN samples are proportional to a virial coefficient fvir. Direct\nmodelling of the broad line region suggests that fvir~3.5. However, this\nresults in a Mbh-Mstar relation for AGN which lies below and is steeper than\nthe one observed for quiescent black hole samples. A similar though milder\ntrend is seen for the Mbh-sigma relation. Matching the high-mass end of the\nMbh-Mstar and Mbh-sigma relations observed in quiescent samples requires\nfvir~15 and fvir~7, respectively. On the other hand, fvir~3.5 yields Mbh-sigma\nand Mbh-Mstar relations for AGN which are remarkably consistent with the\nexpected `intrinsic' correlations for quiescent samples (i.e., once account has\nbeen made of the angular resolution-related selection effect), providing\nadditional evidence that the sample of local quiescent black holes is biased.\nWe also show that, as is the case for quiescent black holes, the Mbh-Mstar\nscaling relation of AGN is driven by velocity dispersion, thus providing\nadditional key constraints to black hole-galaxy co-evolution models. \n\n"}
