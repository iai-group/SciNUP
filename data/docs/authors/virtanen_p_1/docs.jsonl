With the ample confirmation of\nquantum mechanical predictions by experiments, entanglement has evolved from a\nphilosophical conundrum to a key resource for quantum-based technologies, like\nquantum cryptography and computation. In particular, maximal entanglement of\nmore than two qubits is crucial to the implementation of quantum error\ncorrection protocols.

For\nchiral topological states with robust chiral edge states, another fundamental\ntopological property is the edge state chiral central charge $c$. In this paper\nwe propose a new approach to compute the topological spin and chiral central\ncharge in lattice models by defining a new quantity named as the momentum\npolarization. Momentum polarization is defined on the cylinder geometry as a\nuniversal subleading term in the average value of a \"partial translation\noperator\". We show that the momentum polarization is a quantum entanglement\nproperty which can be computed from the reduced density matrix, and our\nanalytic derivation based on edge conformal field theory shows that the\nmomentum polarization measures the combination $h_a-\\frac{c}{24}$ of\ntopological spin and central charge.

It is noted that\nphysical systems being appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the\nmain strongly correlated electron system (SCES) properties, when they are\nsolved in the HF approximation, by also allowing crystal symmetry breaking\neffects and non-collinear spin orientations of the HF orbitals.

When two neighboring superconductors tend to have\nthe same phase, the ground state does not change with the positions of domain\nwalls. On the other hand, when two neighboring superconductors tend to have\n$\\pi$-phase differences, the ground state has a phase transition depending on\nthe positions of domain walls; when the two walls are close to each other,\nfrustration occurs because of the coupling between the two superconductors\nbesides the thin superconductor.

Suppression of the Hall voltage near charge neutrality in such systems\ngives rise to a strong quasiparticle drift in the direction perpendicular to\nthe electric current and magnetic field. This drift is responsible for a strong\ngeometrical increase of resistance even in weak magnetic fields. Combining the\nBoltzmann kinetic equation with sample electrostatics, we develop a microscopic\ntheory of magnetotransport in two and three spatial dimensions. The compensated\nHall effect in confined geometry is always accompanied by electron-hole\nrecombination near the sample edges and at large-scale inhomogeneities. As the\nresult, classical edge currents may dominate the resistance in the vicinity of\ncharge compensation. The effect leads to linear magnetoresistance in two\ndimensions in a broad range of parameters. In three dimensions, the\nmagnetoresistance is normally quadratic in the field, with the linear regime\nrestricted to rectangular samples with magnetic field directed perpendicular to\nthe sample surface.

This paper\nattempts to show that, despite a popular misconception, QBism is no minor tweak\nto Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is something quite distinct.\nAlong the way, we lay out three tenets of QBism in some detail: 1) The Born\nRule---the foundation of what quantum theory means for QBism---is a normative\nstatement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should\nstrive for; it is not a descriptive \"law of nature\" in the usual sense. 2) All\nprobabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they\nnever tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum\nstates thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world. 3) Quantum measurement outcomes\njust are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them.

It is shown here that the same experiment can be viewed in two\ndifferent ways, depending on which basis of the which-way detector states one\nchooses to look at. In one view, the loss of interference arises due to the\nentanglement of the two paths of the particle with two orthogonal states of the\nwhich-way detector. In another view, the loss of interference can be\ninterpreted as arising from random momentum kicks of magnitude $h/2d$ received\nby the particle, $d$ being the slit separation.

We first classify higher-order Dirac models according to the\ntime-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries, and determine the\neven-oddness of the order of band crossing in each symmetry class. The\neven-oddness further constrains the rotational symmetry $m$ permitted in a\nsymmetry class.

A complementarity is\ndiscovered as the maximum fidelity is accompanied by a minimum of MMC. And at\nthe instant, which is just half of the characteristic time required to\naccomplish a perfect QST, the MMC can reach its maximum value one. A large\nclass of perfect QST models with a certain spectrum structure are discovered to\nsupport our analytical results. \n\n"}

We expose the actual accounting principles in a pure mathematics\nlanguage. After that we simulated the accounting principles on quantum\ncomputers. We show that all arbitrary accounting actions are exhausted by the\ndescribed basic actions. The main problem of accounting are reduced to some\nsystem of linear equations in the economic model of Leontief. In this\nsimulation we use our constructed quantum Gau\\ss-Jordan Elimination to solve\nthe problem and the time of quantum computing is some square root order faster\nthan the time in classical computing. \n\n"}

Present theoretical treatment of photo-detectors is highly idealized\nand fails to consider many important physical effects. We present a physically\nmotivated model for photo-detectors which accommodates for the effects of\nfinite resolution, bandwidth and efficiency, as well as dark-counts and\ndead-time. We apply our model to two simple well known applications, which\nillustrates the significance of these characteristics. \n\n"}

We first calculate the\nposition detection probabilities for particles projected upwards against\ngravity around the classical turning point and also around the point of initial\nprojection, which exhibit mass dependence at both these points. We then compute\nthe mean arrival time of freely falling particles using the quantum probability\ncurrent, which also turns out to be mass dependent. The mass dependence of both\nthe position detection probabilities and the mean arrival time vanish in the\nlimit of large mass. Thus, compatibility between the weak equivalence principle\nand quantum mechanics is recovered in the macroscopic limit of the latter. \n\n"}

The structure function or density of states for any two-level system\nis a simple power (1, 3, 0 or -1) of the length of its polarization vector,\nwhile the magnitude of the energy of the system, in all four cases, is the\nnegative of the logarithm of the determinant of the corresponding\ntwo-dimensional density matrix.

In the standard complex case, this yields an interesting\nalternative, meeting certain probabilistic requirements recently set forth by\nLavenda, to the more conventional (hyperbolic tangent) Brillouin function of\nparamagnetism (which, Lavenda argues, fails to meet such specifications). \n\n"}
