Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies).

Our study aims at\nquantifying the star-formation and AGN processes in these sources which recent\nresults suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. To\ndo this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and\nextinction.

Outside the\nmain ring, while some systems exhibit smooth surface brightness profiles (SB)\nthat fall off roughly as r**-3.5, others display large luminosity drops at the\nring's outer edge and steeper radial SB profiles. We seek to understand this\ndiversity of outer edge profiles under the ``natural'' collisional evolution of\nthe system, without invoking external agents such as planets or gas. We use a\nstatistical code to follow the evolution of a collisional population, ranging\nfrom dust grains (submitted to radiation pressure) to planetesimals and\ninitially confined within a belt (the 'birth ring'). The system typically\nevolves toward a \"standard\" steady state, with no sharp edge and SB \\propto\nr**-3.5 outside the birth ring. Deviations from this standard profile, in the\nform of a sharp outer edge and a steeper fall-off, occur only when two\nparameters take their extreme values: 1) When the birth ring is so massive that\nit becomes radially optically thick for the smallest grains. However, the\nrequired disc mass is here probably too high to be realistic. 2) When the\ndynamical excitation of the dust-producing planetesimals is so low (<e> <0.01)\nthat the smallest grains, which otherwise dominate the total optical depth, are\npreferentially depleted. This low-excitation case, although possibly not\ngeneric, cannot be ruled out by observations. Our \"standard\" profile provides a\nsatisfactory explanation for a large group of debris discs with outer edges and\nSB falling as r**-3.5.

One\nof our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost\nall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values.

Abstract: We present evidence that the optically unidentified radio source, FIRST\nJ121839.7+295325, may be strongly lensing a background galaxy. We estimate the\nredshift of the assumed gravitational arc, discovered in parallel imaging with\nHST, from MMT-Blue Channel spectroscopy to be z_{arc}=2.48_-0.05^+0.14. We\npresent lens models with an Einstein radius of R_E=1.3\" which contains a mass\nof M_{dyn}=10^{12 +- 0.5} M_{sol}, where the uncertainty reflects the range of\npossible lens redshifts. The putative lens is not detected to J_{lim}=22.0 mag\nand H_{lim}=20.7 mag in our MMT-SWIRC imaging. Using the flux limits from WFPC2\nand SWIRC, we estimate that the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of\nJ121839.7+295325 is M_{dyn}/L_B >~ 10 M_sol/L_sol for A_V=1 mag, and this lower\nlimit could be as high as 30 M_sol/L_sol for A_V=0 mag.

The detection\nof BAO requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. \"Transversal\"\n(angular distance) BAO measure the angular size of this scale, while\n\"line-of-sight\" (or \"radial\") BAO require precise redshifts, but provide a\ndirect measurement of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, a more\nsensitive probe of dark energy. The main goal of this paper is to show that a\nprecision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure BAO in the radial\ndirection. This precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using a\nfilter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 A, from ~\n4000 A to ~ 8000 A, supplemented by two broad-band filters. We describe a\npractical implementation, a new galaxy survey, PAU, to be carried out with a\ntelescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering\n8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years.

Assuming a power-law spectrum of $E_{\\gamma}^{-a_2}$ for the\nphoton intensity of very high energy (VHE) gamma rays, $a_1 \\gtrsim 405$ and\n$a_2\\gtrsim 6.4$ are inferred by the integrated photon fluxes measured by MAGIC\nand HESS.

Position of gamma-ray emitting region $R_{\\rm{\\gamma}}$ determines\nthe relative contributions of this two diffuse radiation to the total\nabsorption for 10 GeV--1 TeV gamma rays. The internal absorption could make\nspectral shape of gamma rays more complex than only corrected for the external\nabsorption, and could lead to the formation of arbitrary softening and\nhardening gamma-ray spectra.

Here, we estimate\nthe overall probabilities for lensing by substructures in a host halo closely\naligned to the line of sight to a background quasar. Under the assumption that\nthe quasar can be approximated as a point source, the optical depth for strong\ngravitational lensing by subhalos typically turns out to be very small (tau <\n0.01), contrary to previous claims. We therefore conclude that it is currently\nnot feasible to use this strategy to put the simulation predictions for the\ndark matter subhalo population to the test. However, if one assumes the source\nto be spatially extended, as is the case for a quasar observed at radio\nwavelengths, there is a reasonable probability for witnessing substructure\nlensing effects even at rather large projected distances from the host galaxy,\nprovided that the angular resolution is sufficient.

Abstract: Along with compacting baryon (neutron) spacing, two very important factors\ncome into play at once: the lack of self-stabilization within a compact neutron\nstar (NS) associated with possible black hole (BH) horizon appearance and the\nphase transition - color deconfinement and QCD-vacuum reconstruction - within\nthe nuclear matter. That is why both phenomena should be taken into account\nside by side, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since, under the\nabove transition, the hadronic-phase vacuum (filled up with gluon and chiral\n$q\\bar q$-condensates) turns into the \"empty\" (perturbation) subhadronic-phase\none and, thus, the corresponding (very high) pressure falls down rather\nabruptly, the formerly cold (degenerated) nuclear medium starts to implode into\nthe new vacuum. If the mass of a star is sufficiently large, then this\nimplosion produces an enormous heating, which stops only after quark-gluon\nplasma of a temperature about 100 MeV (or even higher) is formed to withstand\nthe gravitational compression (whereas the highest temperatures of supernovae\nbursts are, at least, one order lower).

Our NIR data\ntaken around peak optical emission show an evolution that is largely consistent\nwith a cooling blackbody, with tentative evidence for a growing NIR excess\nstarting at day ~100. Our late-time Keck adaptive optics (AO) NIR image, taken\non day 723, shows little change from previous NIR observations taken around day\n400. Furthermore, the optical HST observations show a reduced decline rate\nafter day 400, and the SN is bluer on day 810 than it was at peak.

The late-time optical\nobservations require the existence of a scattered light echo, which may be\ngenerated by the same dust that contributes to the NIR echo.

These data confirm earlier\nindications about a very rapid increase of galaxy volume emissivity up to z~1.\nThis is the fastest evolution rate observed for galaxies at any wavelengths.\nThe observed Spitzer counts at 24 micron require a combination of fast\nevolution for the dominant population and a bumpy spectrum with substantial PAH\nemission at z~1 to 2. Confusion-limited number counts at longer wavelengths\nconfirm these results. All the present data require that the fast observed\nevolution from z=0 to 1 flattens around redshift 1 and then keeps approximately\nconstant up to z~2.5 at least.

MOND, indeed, predicts a quasi-universal value of this quantity\nfor objects of all masses and of any internal structure, provided they are\nmostly in the Newtonian regime; i.e., that their mean acceleration is at or\nabove a0. The predicted value is qSm, with Sm= a0/2 pi G= 138 solar masses per\nsquare parsec for the nominal value of a0, and q a constant of order 1 that\ndepends only on the form of the MOND interpolating function. This gives in the\nabove units log(Sm)=2.14, which is consistent with that found by Doanato et al.\nof 2.15+-0.2. MOND predicts, on the other hand, that this quasi-universal value\nis not shared by objects with much lower mean accelerations. It permits halo\ncentral surface densities that are arbitrarily small, if the mean acceleration\ninside the object is small enough. However, for such low-surface-density\nobjects, MOND predicts a halo surface density that scales as the square root of\nthe baryonic one, and so the range of the former is much compressed relative to\nthe latter. This explains, in part, the finding of Donato et al. that the\nuniversal value applies to low acceleration systems as well. Looking at\nliterature results for a number of the lowest surface-density disk galaxies\nwith rotation-curve analysis, I find that, indeed, their halo surface densities\nare systematically lower then the above \"universal\" value. The prediction of Sm\nas an upper limit, and accumulation value, of halo central surface densities,\npertains, unlike most other MOND predictions, to a pure \"halo\" property, not to\na relation between baryonic and \"dark matter\" properties. \n\n"}

Here we determine the velocity distribution functions\nfrom two of the highest resolution numerical simulations of Galactic dark\nmatter structure (Via Lactea II and GHALO), and study the effects for these\nscenarios. For directional detection, we find that the observed departures from\nMaxwell-Boltzmann increase the contrast of the signal and change the typical\ndirection of incoming DM particles. For iDM, the expected signals at direct\ndetection experiments are changed dramatically: the annual modulation can be\nenhanced by more than a factor two, and the relative rates of DAMA compared to\nCDMS can change by an order of magnitude, while those compared to CRESST can\nchange by a factor of two. The spectrum of the signal can also change\ndramatically, with many features arising due to substructure. For LDM the\nspectral effects are smaller, but changes do arise that improve the\ncompatibility with existing experiments. We find that the phase of the\nmodulation can depend upon energy, which would help discriminate against\nbackground should it be found. \n\n"}

However, with\nthe addition of spectroscopic information it is possible to distinguish between\nblends and areas where the light is dominated by a single star using the widths\nof absorption features. We describe a procedure for identifying locations in\nkinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,\nand apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution covering\nthe 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of M32. Targets for\ndetailed investigation are selected as areas of localized brightness\nenhancement. Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from\na single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars\nwith very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving\nnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral\ntype. The lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper AGB\nwithin the central arcsec of M32 has a dispersion in J-K of only a few\nhundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii. One\nstar has weaker atomic absorption lines than the others, such that [M/H] is 0.2\ndex lower. Such a difference in metallicity is consistent with the metallicity\ndispersion inferred from the width of the AGB in M32. The use of line width to\ndistinguish between blends involving many relatively faint stars, none of which\ndominate the light output, and areas that are dominated by a single\nintrinsically bright star could be extended to crowded environments in other\nnearby galaxies. \n\n"}

Our results provide direct\nobservational evidence of `radio mode' AGN feedback in action, stripping the\ncentral galaxy of its lowest entropy gas and preventing star-formation.

The mass of the uplifted gas in the arms is\ncomparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpc\ncore, demonstrating that the AGN has a profound effect on its immediate\nsurroundings. The coolest X-ray emitting gas in M87 has a temperature of ~0.5\nkeV and is spatially coincident with Halpha+NII nebulae, forming a multiphase\nmedium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments.

In smaller clusters (M_vir ~10^14 h^-1 M_Sun) the\nmean RP are approximately one order of magnitude lower at all redshifts.

We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to\nassess the role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we\nconfirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e.g., there\nis no apparent color bimodality for AGN hosts from z~0-2, but non-AGN galaxy\ncolor bimodality exists up to z~3; most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the\nAGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~2-3; and the\ncolors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass\nincreases up to z~2-3. Second, we point out that it is critical to use\nmass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and\nnon-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z~2-3, AGN hosts\nlie in the same CMD region as non-AGN galaxies; i.e., there is no specific\nclustering of AGN hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or\nthe green valley in between. The AGN fraction (~10%) is mostly independent of\nhost-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of SMBH growth in\ntypical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with\nnon-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and\nthe AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find,\nfor mass-matched samples, that the SFRs of AGN hosts are typically a factor of\n~2-3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z~0-1, whereas this difference\ndiminishes at z~1-3. Our results can be reasonably explained by two main\ningredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution of\ngalaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN\nfeedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~80% of cosmic time. \n\n"}

Its domain of applicability, that is baryonic densities ranging from about\n$\\rho>10^8$ g $\\cdot$ cm$^{-3}$ to normal nuclear density, temperatures between\n1 and 20 MeV and proton fractions between 0.5 and 0, make it suitable for the\ndescription of baryonic matter produced in supernovae explosions and\nproto-neutron stars. The first finding is that, contrary to the common belief,\nthe crust-core transition is not first order, and for all subsaturation\ndensities matter can be viewed as a continuous fluid mixture between free\nnucleons and massive nuclei. As a consequence, the equations of state and the\nassociated observables do not present any discontinuity over the whole\nthermodynamic range.

This velocity variation makes the shape of the energy spectrum harder,\nbut this change in the shape is too small to see unless $b/a\\agt 10^6$.

We focus on\ncompact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a cold\ndegenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of such\nsystems. A fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realistic\nWDNS head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical time\nscales and length scales involved. For this reason, we construct an equation of\nstate (EOS) which captures the main physical features of NSs while, at the same\ntime, scales down the size of WDs. We call these scaled-down WD models\n\"pseudo-WDs (pWDs)\". Using pWDs, we can study these systems via a sequence of\nsimulations where the size of the pWD gradually increases toward the realistic\ncase. We perform two sets of simulations; One set studies the effects of the NS\nmass on the final outcome, when the pWD is kept fixed. The other set studies\nthe effect of the pWD compaction on the final outcome, when the pWD mass and\nthe NS are kept fixed.

One\nspecific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the\ncurvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In\nthis work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show\nthat certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant\nimprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton\ntrajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without\ninterrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses\napproaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasise that turning is defined with\nrespect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether\nthis is canonical or non-trivial. The imprints generically take the form of\ndamped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum. In the particular case\nof two-field models, if one of the fields is sufficiently massive compared to\nthe scale of inflation, we are able to compute an effective low energy theory\nfor the adiabatic mode encapsulating certain relevant operators of the full\nmulti-field dynamics. As expected, a particular characteristic of this\neffective theory is a modified speed of sound for the adiabatic mode which is a\nfunctional of the background inflaton trajectory and the turns traversed during\ninflation. Hence in addition, we expect non-Gaussian signatures directly\nrelated to the features imprinted in the power spectrum. \n\n"}

We\nprovide evidence that this 3.6um excess is due to Halpha emission redshifted\ninto the 3.6um band, and classify these 3.6um excess galaxies to be Halpha\nemitter (HAE) candidates. The selection of HAE candidates using an excess in\nbroad-band filters is sensitive to objects whose rest-frame H$\\alpha$\nequivalent width is larger than 350A, star formation rates of 20-500 Msun/yr.\nThe Halpha-to-UV luminosity ratio of HAEs is on average larger than that of\nlocal starbursts. Possible reasons for such strong Halpha emission in these\ngalaxies include different dust extinction properties, young stellar population\nage, continuous star formation history, low metallicity, and top-heavy stellar\ninitial mass function. Although the correlation between UV slope beta and\nL(Ha)/L(UV) raises the possibility that HAEs prefer a dust extinction curve\nwhich is steeper in the UV, the most dominant factor that results in strong\nHalpha emission appears to be star formation history.

Abstract: Observations of the clustering of galaxies can provide useful information\nabout the distribution of dark matter in the Universe.

The large-scale bias of galaxies can be quantified either\nby directly measuring the large-scale ({\\lambda} >~ 60 hinv Mpc) power spectrum\nof galaxies or by modeling the halo occupation distribution of galaxies using\ntheir clustering on small scales ({\\lambda} <~ 30 hinv Mpc). We compare the\nluminosity dependence of the galaxy bias (both the shape and the normalization)\nobtained by these methods and check for consistency. Our comparison reveals\nthat the bias of galaxies obtained by the small scale clustering measurements\nis systematically larger than that obtained from the large scale power spectrum\nmethods.

Our method is\nbased on characterizing the SEDs of galaxies as a function of their LIR surface\ndensity, which is motivated by the indications that the majority of IR luminous\nstar-forming galaxies at 1 < z < 3 have extended star-forming regions, in\ncontrast to the strongly nuclear concentrated, merger-induced starbursts in\nlocal luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies. We validate our procedure for\nestimating LIR by comparing the resulting LIRs with those measured from far-IR\nobservations at 0 < z < 2.8. AGNs were excluded using X-ray and 3.6-8.0 micron\nobservations, which are generally available in deep cosmological survey fields.\nThe Gaussian fits to the distribution of the discrepancies between the LIR\nmeasurements from single-band 24 micron and Herschel observations have sigma <\n0.1 dex, with ~10% of objects disagreeing by more than 0.2 dex. Since the 24\nmicron estimates are based on SEDs for extended galaxies, this agreement\nsuggests that ~90% of IR galaxies at high z are indeed much more physically\nextended than local counterparts of similar LIR, consistent with recent\nindependent studies of the fractions of galaxies forming stars in the\nmain-sequence and starburst modes, respectively.

The model uses a\ndescription of the Disordered Charge Distribution (DCD) combined with the\npresence of Two-Level Systems (TLS) defects in the amorphous solid composing\nthe grains. The goal of this paper is to confront this new model to\nastronomical observations of different Galactic environments in the FIR/submm,\nin order to derive a set of canonical model parameters to be used as a Galactic\nreference to be compared to in future Galactic and extragalactic studies. We\nconfront the TLS model with existing astronomical data. We consider the average\nemission spectrum at high latitudes in our Galaxy as measured with FIRAS and\nWMAP, as well as the emission from Galactic compact sources observed with\nArcheops, for which an inverse relationship between the dust temperature and\nthe emissivity spectral index has been evidenced. We show that, unlike models\npreviously proposed which often invoke two dust components at different\ntemperatures, the TLS model successfully reproduces both the shape of the\nGalactic SED and its evolution with temperature as observed in the Archeops\ndata. The best TLS model parameters indicate a charge coherence length of\n\\simeq 13 nm and other model parameters in broad agreement with expectations\nfrom laboratory studies of dust analogs. We conclude that the millimeter excess\nemission, which is often attributed to the presence of very cold dust in the\ndiffuse ISM, is likely caused solely by TLS emission in disordered amorphous\ndust grains.

While many have counted\ngalaxy mergers using a variety of techniques, T_obs(z) for these techniques\nhave been poorly constrained. We address this problem by calibrating three\nmerger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations and\nthree galaxy formation models. We estimate T_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairs\nwith a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator G-M20, and\n(3) the morphology indicator asymmetry A. Then we apply these timescales to the\nobserved merger fractions at z < 1.5 from the recent literature. When our\nphysically-motivated timescales are adopted, the observed galaxy merger rates\nbecome largely consistent. The remaining differences between the galaxy merger\nrates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured by\ndifferent techniques and differing parent galaxy selection.

For C/O >= 1, most of the atmospheric\noxygen is occupied by CO for T > 1400 K and pressure (P) < 1 bar, causing a\nsubstantial depletion in H2O, and an overabundance of CH4 compared to those\nobtained by assuming solar abundances (C/O = 0.54) in chemical equilibrium.\nThese differences in chemistry cause distinctly observable signatures in\nspectra.

The Wiener Filter method is used to recover the full 3D peculiar\nvelocity field from the observed map of radial velocities and to recover the\nunderlying linear density field. The velocity field within a data zone of 3000\nkm/s is decomposed into a local component that is generated within the data\nzone and a tidal one that is generated by the mass distribution outside that\nzone. The tidal component is characterized by a coherent flow toward the\nNorma-Hydra-Centaurus (Great Attractor) region while the local component is\ndominated by a flow toward the Virgo Cluster and away from the Local Void.

The basic principle is that, even in rather shallow\nsurveys, substantial information on cluster redshift and temperature is present\nin the raw X-ray data and can be statistically extracted; in parallel, such\ndiagrams can be readily predicted from an ab initio cosmological modeling. We\nillustrate the methodology for the case of a 100 deg2 XMM survey having a\nsensitivity of ~10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 and fit at the same time, the survey\nselection function, the cluster evolutionary scaling-relations and the\ncosmology; our sole assumption -- driven by the limited size of the sample\nconsidered in the case-study -- is that the local cluster scaling relations are\nknown.

In the absence of individual cluster redshifts, the CR-HR method\nappears to be much more efficient than the traditional approach based on\ncluster counts (i.e. dn/dz, requiring redshifts).

Pairs tend to avoid the extreme\nenvironments of clusters and void centres. While pairs in groups can include\ngalaxies that are both blue, both red, or one of each color, in the field it is\nrare for pair galaxies to both be red. We find that physically bound pairs\ncloser than 250 h^{-1} kpc tend to have higher sSFRs than the galaxy population\nas a whole. However, the sSFR of a bound galaxy relative to galaxies in a\ncomparable local density environment (determined by the distance to the fifth\nnearest neighbor, rho_5), differs depending on the local density. In regions of\nhigh rho_5 the bound population has a higher fraction of star-forming (bluer)\ngalaxies, whereas there is very little difference between bound and unbound\ngalaxies in low rho_5 regions. This effect on the star-forming fraction may be\ndriven by the higher fraction of bound HI-rich galaxies compared to unbound\ngalaxies, particularly at high local densities. It appears that being in a pair\nhas an incremental, but not overwhelming, effect on the star formation rate of\nthe paired galaxies, compared to the more pronounced trend where galaxies\noverall have low sSFR (are red) in clusters and higher sSFR (blue) at the\ncentre of voids.

The major flare from December 1993\nshows spectral evidence of three such self-absorbed components. The analysis\nyields an estimate of the power that is required to eject the plasmoids from\nthe central engine that is independent of other estimates that exist in the\nliterature for different flares. The technique has an advantage since the\nabsorbed spectrum contains an independent constraint provided by the optical\ndepth at each epoch of observation. The modeling procedure presented here\nself-consistently determines the dimensions of the radio emitting plasma from\nthe spectral shape. Thus, structural dimensions are determined analytically\nthat can be much smaller than interferometer beam-widths.

Kinematics and\n  close environment classification Abstract: (Abridged) Processes driving mass assembly are expected to evolve on\ndifferent timescales along cosmic time. A transition might happen around z ~ 1\nas the cosmic star formation rate starts its decrease. Identifying the\ndynamical nature of galaxies on a representative sample is necessary to infer\nand compare the mass assembly mechanisms across cosmic time. We present an\nanalysis of the kinematics properties of 50 galaxies with 0.9 < z < 1.6 from\nthe MASSIV sample observed with SINFONI/VLT with 4.5x10^9 Msun < M < 1.7x10^11\nMsun and 6 Msun/yr < SFR < 300 Msun/yr. This is the largest sample with\n2D-kinematics in this redshift range. We provide a classification based on\nkinematics as well as on close galaxy environment. We find that 29% of galaxies\nare experiencing merging or have close companions that may be gravitationally\nlinked. This is placing a lower limit on the fraction of interacting galaxies.\nWe find that at least 44% of the galaxies display ordered rotation whereas at\nleast 35% are non-rotating objects. All rotators except one are compatible with\nrotation-dominated (Vmax/sigma > 1) systems. Non-rotating objects are mainly\nsmall objects (Re < 4 kpc). Combining our sample with other 3D-spectroscopy\nsamples, we find that the local velocity dispersion of the ionized gas\ncomponent decreases continuously from z ~ 3 to z = 0. The proportion of disks\nalso seems to be increasing in star-forming galaxies when the redshift\ndecreases. The number of interacting galaxies seems to be at a maximum at z ~\n1.2. These results draw a picture in which cold gas accretion may still be\nefficient at z ~ 1.2 but in which mergers may play a much more significant role\nat z ~ 1.2 than at higher redshift.

Abstract: Observations from Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) provided strong evidence for an\nexpanding accelerating Universe at intermediate redshifts. This means that the\nUniverse underwent a transition from deceleration to acceleration phases at a\ntransition redshift $z_t$ of the order unity whose value in principle depends\non the cosmology as well as on the assumed gravitational theory. Since\ncosmological accelerating models endowed with a transition redshift are\nextremely degenerated, in principle, it is interesting to know whether the\nvalue of $z_t$ itself can be observationally used as a new cosmic\ndiscriminator. After a brief discussion of the potential dynamic role played by\nthe transition redshift, it is argued that future observations combining SNe\nIa, the line-of-sight (or \"radial\") baryon acoustic oscillations, the\ndifferential age of galaxies, as well as the redshift drift of the spectral\nlines may tightly constrain $z_t$, thereby helping to narrow the parameter\nspace for the most realistic models describing the accelerating Universe. \n\n"}
{"id": "1205.4694", "contents": "Title: Evolution of the baryon fraction in the Local Group: accretion versus\n  feedback at low and high z Abstract: Using hydrodynamical zoom simulations in the standard LCDM cosmology, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the distribution of baryons (gas and stars) in a\nlocal group-type universe. First, with standard star formation and supernova\nfeedback prescriptions, we find that the mean baryonic fraction value estimated\nat the virial radius of the two main central objects (i.e. the Milky Way and\nAndromeda) is decreasing over time, and is 10-15% lower than the universal\nvalue, 0.166, at z=0. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that the amount\nof accretion of dissipative gas onto the halo, especially at low redshift, is\nin general much lower than that of the dissipationless dark matter. Indeed, a\nsignificant part of the baryons does not collapse onto the haloes and remains\nin their outskirts, mainly in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).\nMoreover, during the formation of each object, some dark matter and baryons are\nalso expelled through merger events via tidal disruption. In contrast to\nbaryons, expelled dark matter can be more efficiently re-accreted onto the\nhalo, enhancing both the reduction of fb inside Rv, and the increase of the\nmass of WHIM outside Rv. Varying the efficiency of supernovae feedback at low\nredshift does not seem to significantly affect these trends. Alternatively,\nwhen a significant fraction of the initial gas in the main objects is released\nat high redshifts by more powerful sources of feedback, such as AGN from\nintermediate mass black holes in lower mass galaxies, the baryonic fraction at\nthe virial radius can have a lower value (fb~0.12) at low redshift. Hence\nphysical mechanisms able to drive the gas out of the virial radius at high\nredshifts will have a stronger impact on the deficit of baryons in the mass\nbudget of Milky Way type-galaxies at present times than those that expel the\ngas in the longer, late phases of galaxy formation. \n\n"}

Abstract: A significant fraction of massive stars in the Milky Way and other galaxies\nare located far from star clusters. It is known that some of these stars are\nrunaways and therefore most likely were formed in embedded clusters and then\nejected into the field because of dynamical few-body interactions or\nbinary-supernova explosions. However, there exists a group of field O stars\nwhose runaway status is difficult to prove via direct proper motion\nmeasurements or whose low space velocities and/or young ages appear to be\nincompatible with their large separation from known star clusters. The\nexistence of this group led some authors to believe that field O stars can form\nin situ. In this paper, we examine the runaway status of the best candidates\nfor isolated formation of massive stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic\nClouds by searching for bow shocks around them, by using the new reduction of\nthe Hipparcos data, and by searching for stellar systems from which they could\noriginate within their lifetimes. We show that most of the known O stars\nthought to have formed in isolation are instead very likely runaways. We show\nalso that the field must contain a population of O stars whose low space\nvelocities and/or young ages are in apparent contradiction with the large\nseparation of these stars from their parent clusters and/or the ages of these\nclusters. These stars (the descendants of runaway massive binaries) cannot be\ntraced back to their parent clusters and therefore can be mistakenly considered\nas having formed in situ. We argue also that some field O stars could be\ndetected in optical wavelengths only because they are runaways, while their\ncousins residing in the deeply embedded parent clusters might still remain\ntotally obscured. The main conclusion of our study is that there is no\nsignificant evidence whatsoever in support of the in situ proposal on the\norigin of massive stars. \n\n"}

To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we\ndesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,\nwhich until very recently were restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report\nthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in the\ncore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giant\nKIC7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft.

From the observed\nrotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nGalactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal\nsphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii. There are so many HCCs that they will make\nup all the missing Halo mass density if there is spherical symmetry and their\naverage mass is of order 15,000 Mo. This compares well with the Jeans mass of\ncirca 40,000 Mo and puts forward that the HCCs are in fact Jeans clusters,\nconstituting all the Galactic dark matter and much of its missing baryons, a\nconclusion deduced before from a different field of the sky (Nieuwenhuizen,\nSchild and Gibson 2011).

We argue on statistical grounds that the Higgs field would be highly\nunlikely to begin in the small field meta-stable region in the early universe,\nand thus some new physics should enter in the energy range of order, or lower\nthan, the instability scale to remove the large field unstable region.

We\nverify the improved accuracy through simulations of the MRI in accretion disks,\nthat reproduce its correct linear growth rate. Using this new MHD code, we\nsimulate the formation of isolated disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way using\nidealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields.

Far from the Galactic plane (|b| > 30 degrees), the observed\ngamma-ray emission is nearly invariant with latitude, and is consistent with\narising from inverse Compton scattering of the interstellar radiation field by\ncosmic-ray electrons with an approximately power-law spectrum. The same\nelectrons in the presence of microgauss-scale magnetic fields can also generate\nthe the observed microwave \"haze\". At lower latitudes (b < 20 degrees), in\ncontrast, the spectrum of the emission correlated with the Bubbles possesses a\npronounced spectral feature peaking at 1-4 GeV (in E^2 dN/dE) which cannot be\ngenerated by any realistic spectrum of electrons. Instead, we conclude that a\nsecond (non-inverse-Compton) emission mechanism must be responsible for the\nbulk of the low-energy, low-latitude emission. This second component is\nspectrally similar to the excess GeV emission previously reported from the\nGalactic Center (GC), and also appears spatially consistent with a luminosity\nper volume falling approximately as r^-2.4, where r is the distance from the\nGC. We argue that the spectral feature visible in the low-latitude Bubbles is\nthe extended counterpart of the GC excess, now detected out to at least 2-3 kpc\nfrom the GC. The spectrum and angular distribution of the signal is consistent\nwith that predicted from ~10 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to leptons,\nor from ~50 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to quarks, following a\ndistribution similar to the canonical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile.

In our\nmodified equation the viscous torque in the disk is treated in full GR, while\nthe tidal torque is handled in the Newtonian limit. Our GR-hybrid treatment is\nreasonable because the tidal torque is concentrated near the orbital radius of\nthe secondary and is most important prior to binary-disk decoupling, when the\norbital separation is large and resides in the weak-field regime. The tidal\ntorque on the disk diminishes during late merger and vanishes altogether\nfollowing merger.

Wolf-Rayet stars are the\nmost plausible LGRB progenitors, since the free-fall time of the envelope is\nconsistent with the duration, and the natural outcome of the progenitor is a\nType Ic SN. While a new population of ultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), GRB 111209A,\nGRB 101225A, and GRB 121027A, has a duration of ~ 10^4 s, two of them are\naccompanied by superluminous-supernova (SLSN) like bumps, which are <~ 10 times\nbrighter than typical hypernovae. Wolf-Rayet progenitors cannot explain ULGRBs\nbecause of too long duration and too bright SN-like bump. A blue supergiant\n(BSG) progenitor model, however, can explain the duration of ULGRBs. Moreover,\nSLSN-like bump can be attributed to the so-called cocoon-fireball photospheric\nemissions (CFPEs). Since a large cocoon is inevitably produced during the\nrelativistic jet piercing though the BSG envelope, this component can be a\nsmoking-gun evidence of BSG model for ULGRBs.

In this class\nof models the apparent power loss at large scales is caused by the background\ndynamics which involves a sharp transition from a fast-roll power law phase to\na period of Starobinsky-like slow-roll inflation. An interesting feature of\nthis class of string inflationary models is that the number of e-foldings of\ninflation is inversely proportional to the string coupling to a positive power.\nTherefore once the string coupling is tuned to small values in order to trust\nstring perturbation theory, enough e-foldings of inflation are automatically\nobtained without the need of extra tuning.

Depending on\nthe structure of the stellar progenitor, each of these instabilities can\ndominate the evolution of the gain region prior to the onset of explosion, with\nimplications for the ensuing asymmetries. Here we examine the flow dynamics in\nthe neighborhood of explosion by means of parametric two-dimensional,\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic simulations for which the linear stability\nproperties are well understood.

To do this, two classes of massive (M* >= 10^10.5 Msun) galaxy are\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Munich semi-analytic\nmodel of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies. The first class is selected by high\nspecific star formation rates (sSFR) and high Zg, and the second class by low\nsSFR and low Zg. These criteria roughly distinguish disc-dominant galaxies from\nmetal-poor, elliptical galaxies. In the semi-analytic model, the second class\nof galaxies obtain low sSFR and low Zg due to gradual dilution of the\ninterstellar medium by accretion of metal-poor gas via infalling clumps and\nlow-mass satellites.

At a given radius in units of r180, the Fe abundance in the ICM of\nthe four galaxy groups were consistent or smaller than those of clusters of\ngalaxies. The Mg/Fe and Si/Fe ratios in the ICM are nearly constant at the\nsolar ratio out to 0.5 r180.

This method can be used to\nsimulate several configurations of physical interest, such as relativistic\ncorrections to structure formation, the lensing of gravitational waves and the\nevolution of perturbations in a cosmological void model. This paper focuses on\nthe latter problem, i.e. structure formation in a Hubble scale void in the\nlinear regime. This is considerably more complicated than linear perturbations\nof a homogeneous and isotropic background because the inhomogeneous background\nleads to coupling between density perturbations and rotational modes of the\nspacetime geometry, as well as gravitational waves. Previous analyses of this\nproblem ignored this coupling in the hope that the approximation does not\naffect the overall dynamics of structure formation in such models. We show that\nfor a giga-parsec void, the evolution of the density contrast is well\napproximated by the previously studied decoupled evolution only for very\nlarge-scale modes.

Based on the initial conditions such as the inflaton mass and its\ndecay branching ratio to DM, reheating temperature, and the DM mass and\ninteraction rate with the thermal bath, the DM particles can either thermalize\n(fully/partially) with the primordial bath or remain non-thermal throughout\ntheir evolution history. In the thermal case, the final abundance is set by the\nstandard freeze-out mechanism for large annihilation rates, irrespective of the\ninitial conditions. For smaller annihilation rates, it can be set by the\nfreeze-in mechanism, also independent of the initial abundance, provided it is\nsmall to begin with. For even smaller interaction rates, the DM decouples while\nbeing non-thermal, and the relic abundance will be essentially set by the\ninitial conditions. We put model-independent constraints on the DM mass and\nannihilation rate from over-abundance by exactly solving the relevant Boltzmann\nequations, and identify the thermal freeze-out, freeze-in and non-thermal\nregions of the allowed parameter space. We highlight a generic fact that\ninflaton decay to DM inevitably leads to an overclosure of the Universe for a\nlarge range of DM parameter space, and thus poses a stringent constraint that\nmust be taken into account while constructing models of DM. For the thermal DM\nregion, we also show the complementary constraints from indirect DM search\nexperiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, Planck\nmeasurements, and theoretical limits due to the unitarity of S-matrix. For the\nnon-thermal DM scenario, we show the allowed parameter space in terms of the\ninflaton and DM masses for a given reheating temperature, and compute the\ncomoving free-streaming length to identify the hot, warm and cold DM regimes. \n\n"}

In this paper we will reformulate the Bardeen approach in a\ncompletely covariant manner.

With such\nsmall scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as\ndeterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple\nconsequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by\napproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a\nrandom walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at\nthe previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of\nstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for\nstochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are\ncorrelated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an\nexpectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have\na relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and\nits evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important\nobservables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby\ndwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.\nThe evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways\nto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as\nmergers.

Although they are rare today, integrated over time they may be an\nimportant pathway to the red sequence. This work uses SDSS, GALEX, and WISE\nobservations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fully\nquenched post-starbursts in the narrow mass range $\\log M(M_\\odot) =\n10.3-10.7$, and identifies \"transiting\" post-starbursts which are intermediate\nbetween these two populations. In this mass range, $\\sim 0.3\\%$ of galaxies are\nstarbursts, $\\sim 0.1\\%$ are quenched post-starbursts, and $\\sim 0.5\\%$ are the\ntransiting types in between. The transiting post-starbursts have stellar\nproperties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphological\ncharacteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. The AGN\nfraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts is\nabout 3 times higher ($\\gtrsim 36 \\pm 8 \\%$) than that of normal star-forming\ngalaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between the\nstarburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical AGN activity (median age\ndifference of $\\gtrsim 200 \\pm 100$ Myr), in agreement with previous studies.\nThe time delay is inferred by comparing the broad-band near NUV-to-optical\nphotometry with stellar population synthesis models. We also find that\nstarbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust-obscured than normal\nstar-forming galaxies in the same mass range.

We use a \"forced photometry\"\ntechnique, using measured SDSS source positions, star-galaxy separation and\ngalaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in the\nWISE images. We perform photometry with The Tractor image modeling code,\nworking on our \"unWISE\" coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread\nfunction and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each\nSDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands,\nso often the measurements we report are consistent with zero.

The pulsar has a transverse velocity of 236 +/- 11 km s^-1 at position\nangle 22 +/- 2 deg East of North at a projected separation of 0.097 pc from Sgr\nA*.

Because the ionization\ndegree in star forming clouds is extremely low, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation work strongly\nduring protostellar collapse. These effects have significant impacts in the\nearly phase of star formation as they redistribute magnetic flux and suppress\nangular momentum transport by magnetic fields. We perform three-dimensional\nnested-grid radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations including Ohmic\ndissipation and ambipolar diffusion. Without these effects, magnetic fields\ntransport angular momentum so efficiently that no rotationally supported disk\nis formed even after the second collapse. Ohmic dissipation works only in a\nrelatively high density region within the first core and suppresses angular\nmomentum transport, enabling formation of a very small rotationally supported\ndisk after the second collapse. With both Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar\ndiffusion, these effects work effectively in almost the entire region within\nthe first core and significant magnetic flux loss occurs. As a result, a\nrotationally supported disk is formed even before a protostellar core forms.\nThe size of the disk is still small, about 5 AU at the end of the first core\nphase, but this disk will grow later as gas accretion continues. Thus the\nnon-ideal MHD effects can resolve the so-called magnetic braking catastrophe\nwhile maintaining the disk size small in the early phase, which is implied from\nrecent interferometric observations. \n\n"}

Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a variant of supersymmetric hybrid inflation in which\nthe inflaton is a matter field (which can be charged under gauge symmetries)\nand inflation ends by a GUT-scale phase transition of a waterfall field. These\nfeatures make tribrid inflation a promising framework for realising inflation\nwith particularly close connections to particle physics. Superpotentials of\ntribrid inflation involve effective operators suppressed by some cutoff scale,\nwhich is often taken as the Planck scale. However, these operators may also be\ngenerated by integrating out messenger superfields with masses below the Planck\nscale, which is in fact quite common in GUT and/or flavour models. The values\nof the inflaton field during inflation can then lie above this mass scale,\nwhich means that for reliably calculating the model predictions one has to go\nbeyond the effective theory description. We therefore discuss realisations of\neffective theories of tribrid inflation and specify in which cases effects from\nthe messenger fields are expected, and under which conditions they can safely\nbe neglected. In particular, we point out how to construct realisations where,\ndespite the fact that the inflaton field values are above the messenger mass\nscale, the predictions for the observables are (to a good approximation)\nidentical to the ones calculated in the effective theory treatment where the\nmessenger mass scale is identified with the (apparent) cutoff scale. \n\n"}

Our model tests a range of\nplausible scenarios, differing in the response of haloes to disc formation, the\nrelative angular momentum of baryons and dark matter, the impact of selection\neffects, and the abundance matching parameters.

These surveys are among the deeper wide-field surveys that can be used\nto uncovered large numbers of z~6 quasars.

From this first set of combined survey\ncatalogues covering ~250 deg^2 we selected point sources down to Z_AB=22 that\nhad a very red i-Z (i-Z>2.2) colour.

Asymmetry in this emission imparts a recoil kick to the merged BH,\nwhich can eject the BH from its host galaxy altogether. Recoiling BHs could be\nobserved as offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). Several candidates have been\nidentified, but systematic searches have been hampered by large uncertainties\nregarding their observability. By extracting merging BHs and host galaxy\nproperties from the Illustris cosmological simulations, we have developed a\ncomprehensive model for recoiling AGN. Here, for the first time, we model the\neffects of BH spin alignment and recoil dynamics based on the gas-richness of\nhost galaxies. We predict that if BH spins are not highly aligned,\nseeing-limited observations could resolve offset AGN, making them promising\ntargets for all-sky surveys. For randomly-oriented spins, less than about 10\nspatially-offset AGN may be detectable in HST-COSMOS, and > 10^3 could be found\nwith Pan-STARRS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. Nearly a thousand velocity-offset\nAGN are predicted within the SDSS footprint; the rarity of large broad-line\noffsets among SDSS quasars is likely due in part to selection effects but\nsuggests that spin alignment plays a role in suppressing recoils. Nonetheless,\nin our most physically motivated model where alignment occurs only in gas-rich\nmergers, hundreds of offset AGN should be found in all-sky surveys. Our\nfindings strongly motivate a dedicated search for recoiling AGN. \n\n"}

To distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly bias\nscenarios, we search for relics of energetic feedback events in the\nneighbourhood of central galaxies with different specific star formation rates.\nWe find a significant excess of very high mass ($\\log M_* > 11.3$) galaxies out\nto a distance of 2.5 Mpc around low SFR/$M_*$ central galaxies compared to\ncontrol samples of higher SFR/$M_*$ central galaxies with the same stellar mass\nand redshift.

The observation of the system with\nSwift/XRT on June 30 2015 revealed the presence of five concentric ring-like\nstructures centred at the position of V404 Cyg. Follow-up Swift/XRT\nobservations allowed a time-dependent study of the X-ray rings. Assuming that\nthese are the result of small-angle, single X-ray scattering by dust grains\nalong the line of sight, we find that their angular size scales as $\\theta\n\\propto\\sqrt{t}$ in agreement with theoretical predictions. The dust grains are\nconcentrated in five dust layers located at about 2.12, 2.05, 1.63, 1.50 and\n1.18 kpc from the observer. These coincide roughly with locations of enhanced\nextinction as determined by infrared photometry. Assuming that the grain size\ndistribution is described by a generalized Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck model, we\nfind that the power-law index of the most distant cloud is $q\\sim 4.4$, while\n$q \\sim 3.5-3.7$ in all other clouds.

The calcium II\ntriplet (CaT) index has recently become a popular metal abundance indicator\nthanks to its sensitivity to GC metallicity. Here we revisit and assess the\nreliability of CaT as a metallicity indicator using our new stellar population\nsynthesis simulations based on empirical, high-resolution fluxes. The model\nshows that the CaT strength of old ($>$ 10 Gyr) GCs is proportional to ${\\rm\n[Fe/H]}$ below $-0.5$. In the modest metal-rich regime, however, CaT does not\nincrease anymore with ${\\rm [Fe/H]}$ due to the little contribution from\ncoolest red giant stars to the CaT absorption. The nonlinear nature of the\ncolor--$CaT$ relation is confirmed by the observations of GCs in nearby\nearly-type galaxies.

From a\nsample of quadruple image lenses we find that this selection function can\nintroduce a 3.5% bias on the inferred time-delay distances if the ensemble of\ndeflector properties is used as a prior for a cosmographical analysis. This\nbias remains at the 2.4% level when high resolution imaging of the quasar host\nis used to precisely infer the density profiles of individual lenses.

However, all of\nthese studies have solely focused on estimating the potentially detrimental\neffects of either Type II supernovae (SNII) or Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs),\nignoring the contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). In this study we follow two different approaches, based on (i)\nthe amplitude of deleterious radiation and (ii) the total planet-hosting volume\nirradiated by deleterious radiation. We simultaneously track the contributions\nfrom the key astrophysical sources (SNII, SNIa, AGN and GRBs) for the entire\nUniverse, for both scenarios, to determine its habitability through 13.8\nbillion years of cosmic time. We find that SNII dominate the total radiation\nbudget and the volume irradiated by deleterious radiation at any cosmic epoch\nclosely followed by SNIa (that contribute half as much as SNII), with GRBs and\nAGN making up a negligible portion (<1%). Secondly, as a result of the total\nmass in stars (or the total number of planets) slowly building-up with time and\nthe total deleterious radiation density, and volume affected, falling-off after\nthe first 3 billion years, we find that the Universe has steadily increased in\nhabitability through cosmic time.

Cluster\nparticles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by\nlocal gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is\nterminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium.\nWe test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift, by\ncomparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star\nclusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a\nSchechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with\nobservations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is $\\alpha\\approx 1.8-2$,\nwhile the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate. A related\ntrend is a positive correlation between the surface density of star formation\nrate and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters.

The star is\nbehind, or embedded in, the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus molecular cloud, and obscured by\n28 magnitudes of extinction at optical wavelengths by the foreground cloud.\nMid-IR polarization of WL 16, mainly arises from aligned elongated dust grains\npresent along the line of sight, suggesting a uniform morphology of\npolarization vectors with an orientation of 33\\degr (East from North) and a\npolarization fraction of $\\sim$ 2.0\\%. This orientation is consistent with\nprevious polarimetric surveys in the optical and near-IR bands to probe\nlarge-scale magnetic fields in the Ophiuchus star formation region, indicating\nthat the observed mid-IR polarization toward WL 16 is produced by the dichroic\nabsorption of magnetically aligned foreground dust grains by a uniform magnetic\nfield. Using polarizations of WL 16 and Elias 29, a nearby polarization\nstandard star, we constrain the polarization efficiency,\n\\textit{$p_{10.3}/A_{10.3}$}, for the dust grains in the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus\nmolecular cloud to be $\\sim$ 1.0\\% mag$^{-1}$. WL 16 has polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission features detected at 8.6, 11.2, 12.0, and 12.7\n$\\mu$m by our spectroscopic data, and we find an anti-correlation between the\nPAH surface brightness and the PAH ionization fraction between the NW and SW\nsides of the disk. \n\n"}

So a telescope that merely achieves its stated science goals is\nnot achieving its potential scientific productivity. Several next-generation\nastronomical survey telescopes are currently being designed and constructed\nthat will significantly expand the volume of observational parameter space, and\nshould in principle discover unexpected new phenomena and new types of object.\nHowever, the complexity of the telescopes and the large data volumes mean that\nthese discoveries are unlikely to be found by chance. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to plan explicitly for these unexpected discoveries in the design and\nconstruction of the telescope. Two types of discovery are recognised:\nunexpected objects, and unexpected phenomena. This paper argues that\nnext-generation astronomical surveys require an explicit process for detecting\nthe unexpected, and proposes an implementation of this process.

Radial Gradients Abstract: There is good evidence that the centers of massive early-type galaxies have a\nbottom-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) compared to the IMF of the\nMilky Way. Here we study the radial variation of the IMF within such galaxies,\nusing a combination of high quality Keck spectroscopy and a new suite of\nstellar population synthesis models that cover a wide range in metallicity. As\nin the previous studies in this series, the models are fitted directly to the\nspectra and treat all elemental abundance ratios as free parameters. Using\nnewly obtained spectroscopy for six galaxies, including deep data extending to\n~1Re for the galaxies NGC1407, NGC1600, and NGC2695, we find that the IMF\nvaries strongly with galactocentric radius. For all six galaxies the IMF is\nbottom-heavy in the central regions, with average mass-to-light ratio\n\"mismatch\" parameter a~2.5 at R=0. The IMF rapidly becomes more bottom-light\nwith increasing radius, flattening off near the Milky Way value (a~1.1) at\nR>0.4Re. A consequence is that the luminosity-weighted average IMF depends on\nthe measurement aperture: within R=Re we find <a>=1.3-1.5, consistent with\nrecent lensing and dynamical results from SLACS and ATLAS-3D. Our results are\nalso consistent with several earlier studies that were based on analyses of\nradial gradients of line indices. The observed IMF gradients support galaxy\nformation models in which the central regions of massive galaxies had a\ndifferent formation history than their outer parts. Finally, we make use of the\nhigh signal-to-noise central spectra of NGC1407 and NGC2695 to demonstrate how\nwe can disentangle IMF effects and abundance effects. \n\n"}

We focus on the regime where the local thermal\ntimescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale, corresponding to inefficient\nconvective energy transport. We begin with initially weak magnetic fields\nrelative to the thermal pressure, from 100-1000G in differing geometries. The\nunstable density inversion amplifies the magnetic field, increasing the\nmagnetic energy density to values close to equipartition with the turbulent\nkinetic energy density. By providing pressure support, the magnetic field's\npresence significantly increases the density fluctuations in the turbulent\nenvelope, thereby enhancing the radiative energy transport by allowing photons\nto diffuse out through low density regions.

Furthermore, we develop a numerical approach to efficiently\ncompute a large number of kernels based on the separability of the\neigenfunctions into their horizontal and radial dependence. The validation is\nperformed using a hydrodynamic simulation of linear wave propagation in the\nSun, which includes a standard single-cell meridional flow profile. We show\nthat, using the Born approximation, it is possible to accurately model\nobservational quantities relevant for time-distance helioseismology such as the\nmean power spectrum, disc-averaged cross-covariance functions, and travel times\nin the presence of a flow field. In order to closely match the model to\nobservations, we show that it is beneficial to use mode frequencies and damping\nrates which were extracted from the measured power spectrum. Furthermore, the\ncontribution of the radial flow to the total travel time is found to reach 20%\nof the contribution of the horizontal flow at travel distances over $40^\\circ$.\nUsing the Born kernels and a 2D SOLA inversion of travel times, we can recover\nmost features of the input meridional flow profile.

In a highly eccentric binary, the tidal potential of one body can\nexcite oscillatory modes in the other during a pericenter passage, resulting in\nenergy exchange between the modes and the binary orbit. These modes exhibit one\nof three behaviors over multiple passages: low-amplitude oscillations, large\namplitude oscillations corresponding to a resonance between the orbital\nfrequency and the mode frequency, and chaotic growth.

A newly captured star around a\nblack hole can experience significant orbital decay and heating due to the\nchaotic growth of the mode amplitude and dissipation.

The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent\non the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The\nanisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of\ndisk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits\nare isotropic in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of\nradius, although this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and\nluminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second\nGaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies.

Among these is\nunderstanding the nature of dark matter (DM)---one of the major unsolved\nproblems in particle physics. Characterizing DM through its astrophysical\nsignatures will require a robust understanding of its distribution in the sky\nand the use of novel statistical methods.\n  The first part of this thesis describes the implementation of a novel\nstatistical technique which leverages the \"clumpiness\" of photons originating\nfrom point sources (PSs) to derive the properties of PS populations hidden in\nastrophysical datasets.

The amplitude of the tSZ power spectrum is found to\nbe sensitive to the effective electron temperature, $\\bar{T}_e$, of the cluster\nsample. Omitting the corresponding modifications leads to an underestimation of\nthe $yy$-power spectrum amplitude. Relativistic corrections thus add to the\nerror budget of tSZ power spectrum observables such as $\\sigma_8$.

These features, most clearly seen in the late-time spectra\nof the bright, recent type Ia supernovae ASASSN-14lp and SN 2017bzc, appear as\nnarrow absorptions at ~4840 A, ~5000 A, and as a sharp inflection at ~4760 A on\nthe red side of the prominent late-time 4700 A feature.

Based on a comparison to\nsingle stellar population models, we show that the region of galaxy along the\nmajor-axis of the bar (unlike the region outside the bar) is comprised of\nstellar populations with ages $\\geq$ 350 Myr, with a star-forming clump in the\ncenter of younger ages ($\\sim$ 150Myr).

Here, we investigate the\nenrichment of the IGM by the expulsion of dust grains from galaxies by\nradiation pressure. We use already completed cosmological simulations, to which\nwe add dust assuming that most dust can reach the equilibrium point between\nradiation pressure and gravitational forces. We find that the expulsion of dust\nand its subsequent (partial) destruction in the IGM can plausibly account for\nthe observed level of C and Si enrichment of the z=3 IGM. At low-z, dust\nejection and destruction could explain a substantial fraction of the metals in\nclusters, but it cannot account for all of the chemical species observed. Dust\nexpelled by radiation pressure could give clusters a visual opacity of up to\n0.2-0.5 mag in their central regions even after destruction by the hot\nintracluster medium; this value is interestingly close to limits and claimed\nobservations of cluster extinction. We also comment on the implications of our\nresults for the opacity of the general IGM.

It is, however, highly uncertain which physical processes are\nresponsible for this suppression. We present the results of a numerical\ninvestigation of how the global tidal field of a cluster dynamically influences\nthe reservoir of halo gas surrounding a disk galaxy as it falls into the\ncluster from the surrounding field.

From our fits to the observed optical-IR SEDs, these\nobjects appear to involve massive galaxies hosting luminous starbursts (SFR 100\nMo/yr). Our evolutionary scheme considers a bimodal star formation (SF),\nincluding long-lived quiescent SF, and enhanced SF taking place during\ntransient events recurrently triggered by interactions and merging. We\ninterpret the strong observed evolution as an increase with z of the rate of\ninteractions between galaxies (density evolution) and an increase of their IR\nluminosity due to the more abundant fuel available in the past (luminosity\nevolution). Very schematically, we associate the origin of the bulk of the\noptical/NIR background to the quiescent evolution, while the CIRB is\ninterpreted as mostly due the dusty starburst phase (the latter possibly\nleading to the formation of galaxy spheroids). The large energy contents in the\nCIRB and optical backgrounds are not easily explained, considering the moderate\nefficiency of energy generation by stars: a top-heavy stellar IMF associated\nwith the starburst phase (and compared with a more standard IMF during the\nquiescent SF) would alleviate the problem.

This\nprescription was later shown to be ineffective. In this paper, we discuss the\nbasic microphysics of the reconnection process and conclude that a more rapid\nprescription is permissible. Assuming dissipation to set in at some distance\noutside the light-cylinder, we compute the resulting radiation signature and\nfind that the synchrotron emission of heated particles appears periodic, in\ngeneral showing both a pulse and an interpulse. The predicted spacing of these\nagrees well with observation in the case of the Crab and Vela pulsars. Using\nparameters appropriate for the Crab pulsar - magnetization parameter at the\nlight cylinder sigma_L = 6 x 10^4, Lorentz factor Gamma=250 - reasonable\nagreement is found with the observed total pulsed luminosity.

In an attempt to explore these mechanisms,\nhydrodynamical simulations were run for each case and compared to observations\nusing customized column density and kinematic constraints. The spiral structure\ncan be accounted for both by an unseen bar or triaxial halo, the former fitting\nthe observations slightly better. However, the large bar mass or halo pattern\nfrequency required make it unlikely that the spiral wave is driven by an\nexternal perturber. In particular, the spin parameter is much higher than\npredicted by current cold dark matter (CDM) structure formation scenarios. The\nmassive disk models show that when the observed gas surface density is scaled\nup by a factor about 10, the disk develops a spiral structure resembling\nclosely the observed one, in perturbed density as well as perturbed velocity.\nThis is consistent with more limited studies in other galaxies and suggests\nthat the disk of NGC 2915 contains much more mass than is visible, tightly\nlinked to the neutral hydrogen.

We compute the\ncumulative DLA abundance by using the relation between DLA cross-section and\nthe total halo mass inferred from the simulations. Our approach includes a\nphenomenological model of galactic wind. We employ the ``conservative entropy''\nformulation of SPH, and utilise a series of simulations of varying box-size and\nparticle number to isolate the impact of numerical resolution on our results.\nWe show that the DLA abundance was overestimated in previous studies for three\nreasons: (1) the overcooling of gas occurring with non-conservative\nformulations of SPH, (2) a lack of numerical resolution, and (3) an inadequate\ntreatment of feedback. Our new results for the total neutral hydrogen mass\ndensity, DLA abundance, and column density distribution function all agree\nreasonably well with observational estimates at redshift z=3, indicating that\nDLAs arise naturally from radiatively cooled gas in dark matter haloes that\nform in a Lambda CDM universe.

An approximate Paczynski-Wiita pseudo-Newtonian potential is used.\nHydrodynamical disks are linearly unstable inside a radius which differs\nslightly from the classical R_ms value because of finite pressure and radial\nstratification effects.

However, the strongest\npulsars can be observed at 5 GHz, offering the benefit of lower combined\nionospheric and tropospheric phase errors, which usually limit VLBI astrometric\naccuracy. The pulsars B0329+54, B0355+54 and B1929+10 were observed for 7\nepochs spread evenly over 2 years. For B0329+54, large systematic errors lead\nto only an upper limit on the parallax (pi < 1.5 mas). A new proper motion and\nparallax were measured for B0355+54 (pi = 0.91 +- 0.16 mas), implying a\ndistance of 1.04+0.21-0.16 kpc and a transverse velocity of 61+12-9 km/s.

An alternative in the form of quasi-thermal Comptonization in a high\ncompactness source has difficulties in reproducing the peak of the observed\nphoton distribution below a few hundred keV. We show here that for typical\nparameters expected in the GRB ejecta the observed spectra in the 20-1000 keV\nBATSE energy range can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of the\nsynchrotron radiation in a partially self-absorbed regime. If the particles are\ncontinuously accelerated/heated over the life-time of a source rather than\nbeing instantly injected, a prominent peak develops in their distribution at a\nLorentz factor gamma ~ 30-100, where synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses are\nbalanced by acceleration and heating due to synchrotron self-absorption. The\nsynchrotron peak should be observed at 10-100 eV, while the self-absorbed\nlow-energy tail with F_E ~ E^2 can produce the prompt optical emission (like in\nthe case of GRB 990123). The first Compton scattering radiation by nearly\nmonoenergetic electrons can then be as hard as F_E ~ E^1 reproducing the\nhardness of most of the observed GRB spectra. The second Compton peak should be\nobserved in the high energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for the\nemission detected by EGRET in GRB 941017. A significant electron-positron pair\nproduction reduces the available energy per particle, moving the spectral peaks\nto lower energies as the burst progresses.

This\nprevents any kinematical estimate (using a Jeans analysis) of the inner slope\nof the DM density profile. The gas fraction rises, but the baryon fraction\ndecreases with radius, at least out to 10 effective radii (R_e). Even with\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion (VD) measurements at 4 to 6 R_e with 20 km/s\naccuracy and perfectly known velocity anisotropy, the total mass within the\nvirial radius (r_v) is uncertain by a factor over 3. The DM distributions found\nin LCDM simulations are consistent with the stellar VD profiles, but appear\ninconsistent with the low VDs measured by Romanowsky et al. (2003) of planetary\nnebulae between 2 and 5 R_e, which imply such low M/Ls that the baryon fraction\nwithin r_v must be greater than the universal value. Replacing the NFW DM model\nby the new model of Navarro et al. (2004) decreases slightly the VD at a given\nradius. So, given the observed VD measured at 5 R_e, the inferred M/L within\nr_v is 40% larger than predicted with the NFW model.

We find that pulses with hard spectra have the\nlargest lags, and that there is a similar, but weaker correlation between\nhardness-intensity correlation index, eta, and lag. We also find that the lags\ndiffer considerably between pulses within a burst. Furthermore, the peak energy\nmainly decreases with increasing lag. Assuming a lag-luminosity relation as\nsuggested by Norris et al., there will thus be a positive\nluminosity--peak-energy correlation. We also find that the hardness ratio, of\nthe total flux in two channels, only weakly correlates with the spectral\nevolution parameters. These results are consistent with those found in the\nanalytical and numerical analysis in Paper I. Finally, we find that for these\nbursts, dominated by a single pulse, there is a correlation between the\nobserved energy-flux, F, and the inverse of the lag, t_lag: F propto\nt_lag^{-1}.

We found that the rate of average mass accretion to the nucleus due\nto the radiation drag exerted by newly formed stars in the forming galaxy is\n$\\approx 10^{-5}M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. As a result of this accretion, an IMBH\nwith $\\approx 10^{4}M_{\\odot}$ can be formed in the center of the spiral galaxy\nat $z\\sim 4$.

The mass ratio of the BH to the dark matter halo\nis nearly constant $\\approx (1-3) \\times 10^{-6}$ from $z\\sim 10$ to $z\\sim 2$.\nThis is because that change in the dark matter potential enhances star\nformation in the central part of the galaxy, and as a result the BH evolves due\nto mass accretion via the radiation drag. Therefore, our model naturally\npredicts a correlation between massive BHs and dark matter halos. Moreover, it\nis found that the final BH-to-bulge mass ratio ($\\approx 5\\times 10^{-5}$) in a\nsmall spiral galaxy at high-$z$ is much smaller than that in the large galaxies\n($\\approx 10^{-3}$).

It is shown that if [Si/C] is indeed as high as ~0.7 in\nthe IGM, then VMSs associated with pair-instability supernovae (PI-SNe) in\nlow-mass halos at high redshift must produce at least 50% of the Si. The\nremainder is from later galactic outflows of SN II debris, which also provide\nmost of the C and O. Both sources are required to account for the metal\ninventory in the IGM. The early VMS production must continue until redshift\nz~15 so that the efficiency of VMS formation per low-mass halo is significantly\nbelow unity. Contributions from the later galactic outflows mainly occur at\nz~4-6. Using a Salpeter initial mass function, we infer that the number of VMSs\nproducing massive black holes (MBHs) is 0.72 times the the number of VMSs\nassociated with PI-SNe. The amount of metals (particularly Si) in the IGM that\nis attributable to PI-SNe is thus closely coupled with the total mass of MBHs\nproduced in epochs prior to galaxy formation. Production of ~50% of the Si in\nthe IGM by PI-SNe corresponds to an early inventory of MBHs that is comparable\nto the global mass budget of the central supermassive black holes in\npresent-day galaxies.

Using SFR estimates that include the\nreradiated IR emission, the DRGs at z=1.5-3 with stellar masses > 10^11 solar\nmasses have specific SFRs (SFRs per unit stellar mass) ranging from 0.2 to 10\nGyr^-1, with a mean value of ~2.4 Gyr^-1.

Abstract: There is growing evidence that the estimations of the beaming Doppler factor\nin TeV BL Lac object based on the Self Synchrotron Compton (SSC) models are in\nstrong disagreement with those deduced from the unification models between\nblazars and radio galaxies. When corrected from extragalactic absorption by the\ndiffuse infrared background (DIrB), the SSC one-zone models require very high\nLorentz factor (around 50) to avoid strong gamma-gamma absorption. However, the\nstatistics on beamed vs. unbeamed objects, as well as the luminosity contrast,\nfavors much lower Lorentz factor of the order of 3. In this paper, we show that\nfor the special case of Markarian 501, the need for very high Lorentz factor is\nunavoidable for all one-zone models where all photons are assumed to be\nproduced at the same location at the same time. Models assuming a double\nstructure with two different beaming patterns can partially solve the problem\nof luminosity contrast, but we point out that they are inconsistent with the\nstatistics on the number of detected TeV sources. The only way to solve the\nissue is to consider inhomogeneous models, where low energy and high energy\nphotons are not produced at the same place, allowing for much smaller Lorentz\nfactors. It implies that the jet is stratified, but also that the particle\nenergy distribution is close to a monoenergetic one, and that pair production\nis likely to be significant.

An application and extension of a\nsimple model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old recycled MSP\nB1957+20.

For other MSP in the Galactic field\nwhere the spectral index of the non-pulsed component has been measured (i.e.,\nPSR B1937+21, J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar wind to the non-pulsed\nX-ray luminosity is estimated. For the MSPs in the core regions of globular\nclusters, the pulsar wind nebula is likely affected by its interaction with the\ndense stellar environment, possibly leading to a diminished contribution to the\ntotal X-ray emission.

The\ncorrelation is used to transform the distribution of the observable into an\nestimate of the distribution of black hole masses. However, different\nobservables provide different estimates: the Mbh-sigma relation predicts fewer\nmassive black holes than does the Mbh-L relation. This is because the sigma-L\nrelation in black hole samples currently available is inconsistent with that in\nthe SDSS sample, from which the distributions of L or sigma are based: the\nblack hole samples have smaller L for a given sigma or have larger sigma for a\ngiven L. This is true whether L is estimated in the optical or in the NIR. If\nthis is a selection rather than physical effect, then the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L\nrelations currently in the literature are also biased from their true values.\nWe provide a framework for describing the effect of this bias. We then combine\nit with a model of the bias to make an estimate of the true intrinsic\nrelations. While we do not claim to have understood the source of the bias, our\nsimple model is able to reproduce the observed trends.

To carry out this analysis we have developed a cross-correlation\ntechnique which classifies faint galaxy spectra into one of six types based on\nlocal galaxy templates. Tests and simulations show that this technique yields\nclassifications correct to within one type for more than 90% of the galaxies in\nour sample. We have also developed extensions of the step-wise maximum\nlikelihood method and the STY parametric method for estimating LFs which are\napplicable to recovering an evolving LF from multiple samples. We find that:\n(i) The spectra and LF of E/S0 galaxies show no appreciable evolution out to at\nleast z ~ 0.5. (ii) Early-type spirals show modest evolution, characterised by\na gradual steepening of the faint end of their LF with redshift. (iii) Out to z\n~ 0.5, the overall evolution of the galaxy population is dominated by changes\nseen in late-type spirals. The characteristic luminosity (L^*) of these\ngalaxies appears to brighten with redshift and there are signs of strong\ndensity evolution (a rapid increase in \\phi^*). These effects appear to be\nluminosity dependent so that the LF steepens at higher redshift. These trends\nare accompanied by a steep increase in the median [OII] equivalent width,\nimplying a rapid increase in the star-formation rate with redshift at fixed\nluminosity---a given star-formation rate is found at higher redshift in\ngalaxies of higher luminosity.

The fast rise is determined by the time that the\nrelativistic shell prodcues gamma rays. The decay has the form of a power law\nand arises from the curvature of the shell. The amount of curvature comes from\nthe overall size of the shell so the duration of the decay phase is related to\nthe time the shell expands before converting its energy to gamma rays.

The model aims to reproduce the three-dimensional mass\ndensity of Binney, Gerhard & Spergel (1997), which was obtained through\ndeprojection of the COBE surface photometry, and to reproduce the observed\nkinematics in three windows - namely Baade's Window and two off-axis fields.\nThe model fits essentially all the available data within the innermost 3 kpc.\nThe axis ratio and the morphology of the projected density contours of the COBE\nbar are recovered to good accuracy within corotation. The kinematic quantities\n- the line-of-sight streaming velocity and velocity dispersion, as well as the\nproper motions when available - are recovered, not merely for the fitted\nfields, but also for three new fields.

In the first step, the core collapse of a star with mass $\\ge\n19M_\\odot$ leads to a massive neutron star and a normal supernova, and\nsubsequently hypercritical accretion of the neutron star from the supernova\nejecta may give rise to a jet through neutrino annihilation and/or Poynting\nflux along the stellar rotation axis. However, because of too much surrounding\nmatter, this jet rapidly enters a nonrelativistic phase and evolves to a large\nbubble. In the second step, the neutron star promptly implodes to a rapidly\nrotating black hole surrounded by a torus when the mass of the star increases\nto the maximum mass and meanwhile its rotation frequency increases to the upper\nlimit due to the accreted angular momentum. The gravitational binding energy of\nthe torus may be dissipated by a magnetized relativistic wind, which may then\nbe absorbed by the supernova ejecta, thus producing an energetic hypernova. The\nrotational energy of the black hole may be extracted by the Blandford-Znajek's\nmechanism, leading to another jet. This jet is relatively free of baryons and\nthus may be accelerated to an ultrarelativistic phase because the first jet has\npushed out of its front matter and left a baryon-free exit. We expect that the\nsecond jet generates a GRB and its afterglow. Our two-step model may alleviate\nthe baryon-contamination problem suffered possibly from in the hypernova\nmodels.

The matter content consists of an anisotropic scalar field\nminimally coupled to gravity and of two isotropic perfect fluids that represent\ndust matter and radiation. The spacetime is described by a spatially\nhomogeneous, Bianchi type III metric with a conformal expansion. The model\nrespects the evolution of the scale factor predicted by standard cosmology, as\nwell as the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background. Remarkably, the\nintroduction of the scalar field, apart from explaining the spacetime\nanisotropy, gives rise to an energy density that is close to the critical\ndensity. As a consequence, the model is quasiflat during the entire history of\nthe universe.

We argue that the explanations provided by inflation for the\nhomogeneity, isotropy, and flatness of our universe are not satisfactory, and\nthat a proper explanation of these features will require a much deeper\nunderstanding of the initial state of our universe. On the other hand,\ninflationary models are spectacularly successful in providing an explanation of\nthe deviations from homogeneity. We point out here that the fundamental\nmechanism responsible for providing deviations from homogeneity -- namely, the\nevolutionary behavior of quantum modes with wavelength larger than the Hubble\nradius -- will operate whether or not inflation itself occurs. However, if\ninflation did not occur, one must directly confront the issue of the initial\nstate of modes whose wavelength was larger than the Hubble radius at the time\nat which they were \"born\".

We show that a\nvariety of trajectories are possible for the radius of the compactified\ndimension, depending on the nature of the string gas, including a demonstration\nwithin the context of General Relativity (i.e. without a dilaton) of a solution\nwhere the radius of the extra dimension oscillates about the self-dual radius,\nwithout invoking matter that violates the various energy conditions. In\nparticular, we find that in the case where the string gas is in thermal\nequilibrium, the radius of the compactified dimension dynamically stabilizes at\nthe self-dual radius, after which a period of usual Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\ncosmology of the three uncompactified dimensions can set in. We show that our\nradion stabilization mechanism requires a stringy realization of inflation as\nscalar field driven inflation invalidates our mechanism. We also show that our\nstabilization mechanism is consistent with observational bounds. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0403001", "contents": "Title: Beauty is Attractive: Moduli Trapping at Enhanced Symmetry Points Abstract: We study quantum effects on moduli dynamics arising from the production of\nparticles which are light at special points in moduli space. The resulting\nforces trap the moduli at these points, which often exhibit enhanced symmetry.\nModuli trapping occurs in time-dependent quantum field theory, as well as in\nsystems of moving D-branes, where it leads the branes to combine into stacks.\nTrapping also occurs in an expanding universe, though the range over which the\nmoduli can roll is limited by Hubble friction. We observe that a scalar field\ntrapped on a steep potential can induce a stage of acceleration of the\nuniverse, which we call trapped inflation. Moduli trapping ameliorates the\ncosmological moduli problem and may affect vacuum selection. In particular,\nrolling moduli are most powerfully attracted to the points with the largest\nnumber of light particles, which are often the points of greatest symmetry.\nGiven suitable assumptions about the dynamics of the very early universe, this\neffect might help to explain why among the plethora of possible vacuum states\nof string theory, we appear to live in one with a large number of light\nparticles and (spontaneously broken) symmetries. In other words, some of the\nsurprising properties of our world might arise not through pure chance or\nmiraculous cancellations, but through a natural selection mechanism during\ndynamical evolution. \n\n"}

Here we show that if a phase transition occurs on a\nflat brane, so as to change its tension, then the brane will not remain flat.\nIn other words, there is really no self-tuning in such models, which can in\nfact be understood in four-dimensional terms and are therefore subject to\nWeinberg's no-go theorem. \n\n"}

One can try to improve in this aspect in a\nnumber of ways. For instance, it has been suggested to employ a field whose\nkinetic term is not sign definite, in the hope that the background may be\noverall stable. We show that this is not the case; the physical perturbations\n(gravity included) of the system do not extend across the zeros of the kinetic\nterm; hence, all the modes are entirely localized either where the kinetic term\nis positive, or where it is negative; this second type of modes are ghosts. We\nshow that this conclusion does not depend on the specific choice for the\nkinetic and potential functions for the bulk scalar. \n\n"}
