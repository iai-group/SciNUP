In [25] and [26] the\nauthors showed that with the help of a multi-scale analysis stochastic systems\nwith both continuous variables and finite state spaces can be approximated by\ndynamical systems whose leading order time evolution is given by a combination\nof ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and Markov chains.

It is an approach based on\nanother known universal dynamics: The evolutionary dynamics first conceived by\nDarwin and Wallace, referring to as Darwinian dynamics in the present paper,\nhas been found to be universally valid in biology; The statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics, while enormously successful in physics, have been in an\nawkward situation of wanting a consistent dynamical understanding; Here we\npresent from a formal point of view an exploration of the connection between\nthermodynamics and Darwinian dynamics and a few related topics. We first show\nthat the stochasticity in Darwinian dynamics implies the existence temperature,\nhence the canonical distribution of Boltzmann-Gibbs type. In term of relative\nentropy the Second Law of thermodynamics is dynamically demonstrated without\ndetailed balance condition, and is valid regardless of size of the system. In\nparticular, the dynamical component responsible for breaking detailed balance\ncondition does not contribute to the change of the relative entropy. Two types\nof stochastic dynamical equalities of current interest are explicitly discussed\nin the present approach: One is based on Feynman-Kac formula and another is a\ngeneralization of Einstein relation. Both are directly accessible to\nexperimental tests. Our demonstration indicates that Darwinian dynamics\nrepresents logically a simple and straightforward starting point for\nstatistical mechanics and thermodynamics and is complementary to and consistent\nwith conservative dynamics that dominates the physical sciences. Present\nexploration suggests the existence of a unified stochastic dynamical framework\nboth near and far from equilibrium. \n\n"}

We consider two separate cases, namely,\nthe {\\it original CM}, in which each edge, regardless of its multiplicity,\nreceives an independent exponential weight, as well as the {\\it erased CM}, for\nwhich there is an independent exponential weight between any pair of direct\nneighbors.

Oancea, the same authors have\nrecently computed the Rabinowitz-Floer homology of the cotangent disk bundle\nD^*M of a closed manifold M, by establishing a long exact sequence. The first\naim of this paper is to present a chain level construction of this exact\nsequence. In fact, we show that this sequence is the long homology sequence\ninduced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes, which involves the Morse\nchain complex and the Morse differential complex of the energy functional for\nclosed geodesics on M. These chain maps are defined by considering spaces of\nsolutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation on half-cylinders, with suitable\nboundary conditions which couple them with the negative gradient flow of the\ngeodesic energy functional. The second aim is to generalize this construction\nto the case of a fiberwise uniformly convex compact subset W of T^*M whose\ninterior part contains a Lagrangian graph. Equivalently, W is the energy\nsublevel associated to an arbitrary Tonelli Lagrangian L on TM and to any\nenergy level which is larger than the strict Mane' critical value of L.

That theory was shown to enjoy analogs of most of the standard\nalgebraic properties of group cohomology, but various analytic features of\nthose cohomology groups were only partially understood.\n  This paper re-examines some of those issues. At its heart is a simple\ndimension-shifting argument which enables one to `regularize' measurable\ncocycles, leading to some simplifications in the description of the cohomology\ngroups. A range of consequences are then derived from this argument.\n  First, we prove that for target modules that are Fr\\'echet spaces, the\ncohomology groups agree with those defined using continuous cocycles, and hence\nthey vanish in positive degrees when the acting group is compact. Using this,\nwe then show that for Fr\\'echet, discrete or toral modules the cohomology\ngroups are continuous under forming inverse limits of compact base groups, and\nalso under forming direct limits of discrete target modules.\n  Lastly, these results together enable us to establish various circumstances\nunder which the measurable-cochains cohomology groups coincide with others\ndefined using sheaves on a semi-simplicial space associated to the underlying\ngroup, or sheaves on a classifying space for that group.

Two types of coarse variables are considered. The\nfirst type consists of running finite time averages of phase functions.\nApproaches to construct the coarse evolution equation for this type are\ndiscussed and implemented on a 'Forced' Lorenz system and a singularly\nperturbed system whose fast flow does not necessarily converge to an\nequilibrium. We explore two strategies. In one, we compute (locally) invariant\nmanifolds of the fast dynamics, parameterized by the slow variables. In the\nother, the choice of our coarse variables automatically guarantees them to be\n'slow' in a precise sense. This allows their evolution to be phrased in terms\nof averaging utilizing limit measures (probability distributions) of the fast\nflow. Coarse evolution equations are constructed based on these approaches and\ntested against coarse response of the 'microscopic' models. The second type of\ncoarse variables are defined as (non-trivial) scalar state functions that are\nrequired by design to evolve autonomously, to the extent possible, with the\ngoal of being candidate state functions for unambiguously initializable coarse\ndynamics. The question motivates a mathematical restatement in terms of a\nfirst-order PDE. A computational approximation is developed and tested on the\nLorenz system and the Hald Hamiltonian system. \n\n"}

The canonical\nrepresentation of the frame matroid of a complete graph is also known as a\nDowling geometry, as it was first introduced by Dowling for finite groups.\n  In this paper, we extend these matroids in two ways.

Here we analyse a class of\npreferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main\nresults supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion\nepsilon>0 of the oldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has\nexponential instead of power law tails; (2) the largest degree in the network\ndrops from being of the order of a power of the network size n to being just\nlogarithmic in n; (3) the typical distances in the network increase from order\nlog log n to order log n; and (4) the network becomes vulnerable to random\nremoval of nodes.

The problem of finding\nnon-block-factor finitely dependent processes dates back to 1965. The first\npublished example appeared in 1993, and we provide arguably the first natural\nexamples. More precisely, Schramm proved in 2008 that no stationary 1-dependent\n3-coloring of the integers exists, and conjectured that no stationary\nk-dependent q-coloring exists for any k and q. We disprove this by constructing\na 1-dependent 4-coloring and a 2-dependent 3-coloring, thus resolving the\nquestion for all k and q.\n  Our construction is canonical and natural, yet very different from all\nprevious schemes. In its pure form it yields precisely the two finitely\ndependent colorings mentioned above, and no others. The processes provide\nunexpected connections between extremal cases of the Lovasz local lemma and\ndescent and peak sets of random permutations.

We consider the Aztec diamond with a two-periodic\nweighting which exhibits all three possible phases that occur in these types of\nmodels, often referred to as solid, liquid and gas. To analyze this model, we\nuse entries of the inverse Kasteleyn matrix which give the probability of any\nconfiguration of dominoes.

In the present paper we explore the phase space in energy\nintervals where we have orbits that act as building blocks for boxy-peanut\n(b/p) and \"{\\sf X}-shaped\" structures in rotating potentials of galactic type.\nWe underline the significance of the rotational tori around the 3D families\nx1v1 and x1v1$^{\\prime}$ that have been bifurcated from the planar x1 family.\nThese tori play a multiple role: (i) They belong to quasi-periodic orbits that\nreinforce the local density. (ii) They act as obstacles for the diffusion of\nchaotic orbits and (iii) they attract a large number of chaotic orbits that\nbecome sticky to them. There are also bifurcations of unstable families (x1v2,\nx1v2$^{\\prime}$). Their unstable asymptotic curves wind around the x1v1 and\nx1v1$^{\\prime}$ tori generating orbits with hybrid morphologies between that of\nx1v1 and x1v2. In addition, a new family of multiplicity 2, called x1mul2, is\nfound to be important for the peanut construction.

Our representations are\nbased on the unit square grid whose cells we call pixels in 2D and voxels in\n3D. Two pixels are adjacent if they share an edge, two voxels if they share a\nface. We call a connected set of pixels or voxels a blob. Given a graph, we\nrepresent its vertices by disjoint blobs such that two blobs contain adjacent\npixels or voxels if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent. We are\ninterested in the size of a representation, which is the number of pixels or\nvoxels it consists of.\n  We first show that finding minimum-size representations is NP-complete.

The key idea, which has been known in varying\ndegrees of generality for many years, is to associate to the IFS a parametrized\nfamily of positive, linear, Perron-Frobenius operators $L_s$. In our context,\n$L_s$ is studied in a space of $C^m$ functions and is not compact.\nNevertheless, it is has a strictly positive $C^m$ eigenfunction $v_s$ with\npositive eigenvalue $\\lambda_s$ equal to the spectral radius of $L_s$. Under\nappropriate assumptions on the IFS, the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant\nset of the IFS is the value $s=s_*$ for which $\\lambda_s =1$. To compute the\nHausdorff dimension of an IFS associated to complex continued fractions, (which\nmay arise from an infinite iterated function system), we again approximate the\neigenvalue problem by a collocation method, but now using continuous piecewise\nbilinear functions. Using the theory of positive linear operators and explicit\na priori bounds on the partial derivatives of the strictly positive\neigenfunction $v_s$, we are able to give rigorous upper and lower bounds for\nthe Hausdorff dimension $s_*$, and these bounds converge to $s_*$ as the mesh\nsize approaches zero. We also demonstrate by numerical computations that\nimproved estimates can be obtained by the use of higher order piecewise tensor\nproduct polynomial approximations, although the present theory does not\nguarantee that these are strict upper and lower bounds. An important feature of\nour approach is that it also applies to the much more general problem of\ncomputing approximations to the spectral radius of positive transfer operators,\nwhich arise in many other applications. \n\n"}

Firstly, it gives a relative version: any factor map from one ergodic\nautomorphism to another can be enlarged by arbitrarily little entropy to become\nrelatively Bernoulli. Secondly, using some facts about relative orbit\nequivalence, the analogous result holds for all free and ergodic\nmeasure-preserving actions of a countable amenable group.\n  The key to this work is a new result about measure concentration. Suppose now\nthat $\\mu$ is a probability measure on a finite product space $A^n$, and endow\nthis space with its Hamming metric. We prove that $\\mu$ may be represented as a\nmixture of other measures in which (i) most of the weight in the mixture is on\nmeasures that exhibit a strong kind of concentration, and (ii) the number of\nsummands is bounded in terms of the difference between the Shannon entropy of\n$\\mu$ and the combined Shannon entropies of its marginals. \n\n"}

These\nfunctional representations of networks, or networks for short, specialize in\nthe finite setting to (possibly asymmetric) adjacency matrices and derived\nrepresentations such as distance or kernel matrices. Existing literature\nutilizing these constructions cannot, however, benefit from continuous\nformulations because the continuum limits of finite networks under this\ndistance are not well-understood. For example, while there are currently\nnumerous persistent homology methods on finite networks, it is unclear if these\nmethods produce well-defined persistence diagrams in the infinite setting. We\nresolve this situation by introducing the collection of compact networks that\narises by taking continuum limits of finite networks and developing sampling\nresults showing that this collection admits well-defined persistence diagrams.\nCompared to metric spaces, the isomorphism class of the generalized\nGromov-Hausdorff distance over networks is rather complex, and contains\nrepresentatives having different cardinalities and different topologies. We\nprovide an exact characterization of a suitable notion of isomorphism for\ncompact networks as well as alternative, stronger characterizations under\nadditional topological regularity assumptions. Toward data applications, we\ndescribe a unified framework for developing quantitatively stable network\ninvariants, provide basic examples, and cast existing results on the stability\nof persistent homology methods in this extended framework.

It was previously shown in several research papers that\ngraphs generated by the SPA model are similar to real-world networks in many\naspects.

Two\npopular (variational) approximation schemes for estimating the free energy of\ngeneral Ising models (in particular, even in regimes where correlation decay\ndoes not hold) are: (i) the mean-field approximation with roots in statistical\nphysics, which estimates the free energy from below, and (ii) hierarchies of\nconvex relaxations with roots in theoretical computer science, which estimate\nthe free energy from above. We show, surprisingly, that the tight regime for\nboth methods to compute the free energy to leading order is identical.\n  More precisely, we show that the mean-field approximation is within\n$O((n\\|J\\|_{F})^{2/3})$ of the free energy, where $\\|J\\|_F$ denotes the\nFrobenius norm of the interaction matrix of the Ising model.

Both models are known to exhibit a freezing\ntransition between a high temperature phase where the entropy is extensive and\na low-temperature phase of finite entropy.

This models are known to be substantially\nmore flexible than Gaussian based models. One current problem of this approach\nis the unavailability of a tractable exact analysis of likelihood based\nstochastic volatility models for the returns of log prices of stocks.\n  With this point in mind, the likelihood models of Barndorff-Nielsen and\nShephard are viewed as members of a much larger class of models. That is\nlikelihoods based on n conditionally independent Normal random variables whose\nmean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a common\nunobserved Poisson random measure. The analysis of these models is facilitated\nby applying the methods in James (2005, 2002), in particular an Esscher type\ntransform of Poisson random measures; in conjunction with a special case of the\nWeber-Sonine formula. It is shown that the marginal likelihood may be expressed\nin terms of a multidimensional Fourier-cosine transform.

The essential\nfeature of a KCSM is that the creation/destruction of a particle at a given\nsite can occur only if the current configuration of empty sites around it\nsatisfies certain constraints which completely define each specific model. No\nother interaction is present in the model. From the mathematical point of view,\nthe basic issues concerning positivity of the spectral gap inside the\nergodicity region and its scaling with the particle density $p$ remained open\nfor most KCSM (with the notably exception of the East model in $d=1$\n\\cite{Aldous-Diaconis}). Here for the first time we: i) identify the ergodicity\nregion by establishing a connection with an associated bootstrap percolation\nmodel; ii) develop a novel multi-scale approach which proves positivity of the\nspectral gap in the whole ergodic region; iii) establish, sometimes optimal,\nbounds on the behavior of the spectral gap near the boundary of the ergodicity\nregion and iv) establish pure exponential decay for the persistence function.\nOur techniques are flexible enough to allow a variety of constraints and our\nfindings disprove certain conjectures which appeared in the physical literature\non the basis of numerical simulations. \n\n"}
