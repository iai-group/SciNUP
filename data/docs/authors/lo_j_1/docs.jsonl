II Abstract: Previous work by the authors (this journal, \\vol{60} (2008), 1009-1044)\nproduced equations that hold on certain loci of the Jacobian of a cyclic\n$C_{rs}$ curve. A curve of this type generalizes elliptic curves, and the\nequations in question are given in terms of (Klein's) generalization of\nWeierstrass' $\\sigma$-function. The key tool is a matrix with entries that are\npolynomial in the coordinates of the affine plane model of the curve, thus can\nbe expressed in terms of $\\sigma$ and its derivatives. The key geometric loci\non the Jacobian of the curve give a stratification of Brill-Noether type. The\nresults are of the type of Riemann-Kempf singularity theorem, the methods are\ngermane to those used by J.D. Fay, who gave vanishing tables for Riemann's\n$\\theta$-function and its derivatives. The main objects we use were developed\nby several contemporary authors, aside from the classical definitions:\nmeromorphic differentials were expressed in terms of the coordinates mainly by\nV.M.

By representing the potentially unstable\nbound states as multi-centered black hole solutions in N=2 supergravity, we\nprovide two fully general and explicit formulae for the change in the (refined)\nindex across the wall. The first, \"Higgs branch\" formula relies on Reineke's\nresults for invariants of quivers without oriented loops, specialized to the\nAbelian case. The second, \"Coulomb branch\" formula results from evaluating the\nsymplectic volume of the classical phase space of multi-centered solutions by\nlocalization. We provide extensive evidence that these new formulae agree with\neach other and with the mathematical results of Kontsevich and Soibelman (KS)\nand Joyce and Song (JS). The main physical insight behind our results is that\nthe Bose-Fermi statistics of individual black holes participating in the bound\nstate can be traded for Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, provided the (integer)\nindex \\Omega(\\gamma) of the internal degrees of freedom carried by each black\nhole is replaced by an effective (rational) index \\bar\\Omega(\\gamma)=\n\\sum_{m|\\gamma} \\Omega(\\gamma/m)/m^2. A similar map also exists for the refined\nindex. This observation provides a physical rationale for the appearance of the\nrational Donaldson-Thomas invariant \\bar\\Omega(\\gamma) in the works of KS and\nJS. The simplicity of the wall crossing formula for rational invariants allows\nus to generalize the \"semi-primitive wall-crossing formula\" to arbitrary decays\nof the type \\gamma\\to M\\gamma_1+N\\gamma_2 with M=2,3. \n\n"}

In this article we define and\nsystematically investigate what might be called \"$F$-zips with a\n$G$-structure\", for an arbitrary reductive linear algebraic group $G$.\n  These objects come in two incarnations. One incarnation is an exact linear\ntensor functor from the category of finite dimensional representations of $G$\nto the category of $F$-zips over $S$. Locally any such functor has a type\n$\\chi$, which is a cocharacter of $G$. The other incarnation is a certain\n$G$-torsor analogue of the notion of $F$-zips. We prove that both incarnations\ndefine stacks that are naturally equivalent to a quotient stack of the form\n$[E_{G,\\chi}\\backslash G_k]$ that was studied in an earlier paper.

We define a space L_K(M) of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary of M that extend to M. Our goal is to understand an\nopen part of L_K(M) as a Lagrangian in the symplectic space of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary, and as a K_2-Lagrangian, meaning that the\nK_2-avatar of the symplectic form restricts to zero. We construct an open part\nof L_K(M) from data assigned to a hypersimplicial K-decomposition of an ideal\ntriangulation of M, generalizing Thurston's gluing equations in 3d hyperbolic\ngeometry, and combining them with the cluster coordinates for framed flat\nPGL(K)-connections on surfaces. Using a canonical map from the complex of\nconfigurations of decorated flags to the Bloch complex, we prove that any\ngeneric component of L_K(M) is K_2-isotropic if the boundary satisfies some\ntopological constraints (Theorem 4.2). In some cases this implies that L_K(M)\nis K_2-Lagrangian.

In a\nsequence of hyperelliptic curves whose genera tend to infinity, these measures\ntend to the natural measure on the space of rank two bundles. This is a\nfunction field analogue of Duke's theorem on the equidistribution of Heegner\npoints, and can be proven similarly: it follows from a manipulation of zeta\nfunctions, plus the Riemann Hypothesis for curves.\n  Likewise, a sequence of hyperelliptic curves equipped with line bundles gives\nrise to a sequence of measures on the space of pairs of rank 2 bundles.

Compact subspaces\n  of moduli spaces of stable bundles over class VII surfaces Abstract: This article deals with two topics: the first, which has a general character,\nis a variation formula for the the determinant line bundle in non-K\\\"ahlerian\ngeometry. This formula, which is a consequence of the non-K\\\"ahlerian version\nof the Grothendieck-Riemann Roch theorem proved recently by Bismut, gives the\nvariation of the determinant line bundle corresponding to a perturbation of a\nFourier-Mukai kernel ${\\cal E}$ on a product $B\\times X$ by a unitary flat line\nbundle on the fiber $X$. When this fiber is a complex surface and ${\\cal E}$ is\na holomorphic 2-bundle, the result can be interpreted as a Donaldson invariant.\n  The second topic concerns a geometric application of our variation formula,\nnamely we will study compact complex subspaces of the moduli spaces of stable\nbundles considered in our program for proving existence of curves on minimal\nclass VII surfaces. Such a moduli space comes with a distinguished point\n$a=[{\\cal A}]$ corresponding to the canonical extension ${\\cal A}$ of $X$. The\ncompact subspaces $Y\\subset {\\cal M}^\\st$ containing this distinguished point\nplay an important role in our program.

This paper is a\ntutorial and colloquial introduction to the explicit classification of Fano\n3-folds (Q-Fano 3-folds), a subject that we hope is nearing completion. With\nthe intention of remaining accessible to beginners in algebraic geometry, we\ninclude examples of elementary calculations of graded rings over curves and K3\nsurfaces. For us, K3 surfaces have at worst Du Val singularities and are\npolarised by an ample Weil divisor; they occur as the general elephant of a\nFano 3-fold. A second section of the paper runs briefly through the classical\ntheory of nonsingular Fano 3-folds and Mukai's extension to indecomposable\nGorenstein Fano 3-folds. Ideas sketched out by Takagi at the Singapore\nconference reduce the study of Q-Fano 3-folds with g>=2 to indecomposable\nGorenstein Fano 3-folds together with unprojection data.\n  Much of the information about the anticanonical ring of a Fano 3-fold or K3\nsurface is contained in its Hilbert series.

Moreover, the partially completed CM systems--in which\ndynamics of particles are continued through collisions--have been identified as\nmeromorphic Hitchin systems, giving natural ``geometric action-angle\nvariables'' for the CM system. Motivated by relations of the CM system to\nnonlinear PDE, we introduce a new class of generalizations of the spin CM\nparticle systems, the framed (rational, trigonometric and elliptic) CM systems.\nWe give two algebro-geometric descriptions of these systems, via meromorphic\nHitchin systems with decorations (framing data) on (cuspidal, nodal and smooth)\ncubic curves and via one-dimensional sheaves on corresponding ``twisted'' ruled\nsurfaces. We also present a simple geometric formulation of the flows of all\nmeromorphic GL_n Hitchin systems (with no regularity assumptions) as tweaking\nflows on spectral sheaves. Using this formulation, we show that all spin and\nframed CM systems are identified with hierarchies of tweaking flows on the\ncorresponding spectral sheaves. This generalizes the well-known description of\nspinless CM systems in terms of tangential covers. \n\n"}

This theory has the usual properties of a Borel-Moore theory on\nfinite type k-schemes: it is covariantly functorial for projective morphisms,\ncontravariantly functorial for morphisms of smooth schemes, and has a\nprojective bundle formula, homotopy property, Mayer-Vietoris and localization\nsequences.\n  Finally, we show that the regulator map defined by Park from the additive\nChow groups of 1-cycles to the modules of absolute Kaehler differentials of an\nalgebraically closed field of characteristic zero is surjective, giving an\nevidence of conjectured isomorphism between these two groups. \n\n"}
