Thanks to this, the degeneracy\nbetween P11-S11 pairs from same level is relaxed, while the remaining states\nbelonging to same level remain practically degenerate. The model describes the\ncorrect mass ordering in the P11-S11 pairs through the nucleon spectrum as a\ncombined effect of the above conformal symmetry breaking, on the one side, and\na parity change of the diquark from a scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar\nat higher masses, on the other. The quality of the wave functions is\nillustrated by calculations of realistic mean-square charge radii and electric\ncharge form-factors on the examples of the proton, and the protonic P11(1440),\nand S11(1535) resonances. The scheme also allows for a prediction of the\ndressing function of an effective instantaneous gluon propagator from the\nFourier transform of the gauge potential.

We divide a two-dimensional Fermi sea into distinct wedges,\ncharacterized by the opening angle 2Theta and depth Q ~ pF, where pF is the\nFermi momentum. In each wedge, the energy is lowered by forming a single chiral\nspiral. The optimal values for Theta and Q are chosen by balancing this gain in\nenergy versus the cost of deforming the Fermi surface (which dominates at large\nTheta) and patch-patch interactions (dominant at small Theta). Using a\nnon-local four-Fermi interaction model, we estimate the gain and cost in energy\nby expanding in terms of 1/Nc (where Nc is the number of colors), lqcd/Q, and\nTheta. Due to a form factor in our non-local model, at small 1/Nc the mass gap\n(chiral condensate) is large, and the interaction among quarks and the\ncondensate local in momentum space. Consequently, interactions between\ndifferent patches are localized near their boundaries, and it is simple to\nembed many chiral spirals.

We study the impact on the maximum\npossible neutron-star mass of an \"exotic\" core consisting of non-nucleonic\nmatter. For this purpose, we study the occurrence of a first-order phase\ntransition in nucleonic matter. Given the current lack of knowledge of\nnon-nucleonic matter, we consider the stiffest possible equation of state\nsubject only to the constraints of causality and thermodynamic stability. The\ncase of a hadron-quark phase transition is discussed separately. The purely\nnucleonic matter is described using a set of unified equations of state that\nhave been recently developed to permit a consistent treatment of both\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. We then compute the mass-radius relation\nof cold nonaccreting neutron stars with and without exotic cores from the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations.

{"id": "1208.3722", "contents": "Title: Too massive neutron stars: The role of dark matter? Abstract: The maximum mass of a neutron star is generally determined by the equation of\nstate of the star material. In this study, we take into account dark matter\nparticles, assumed to behave like fermions with a free parameter to account for\nthe interaction strength among the particles, as a possible constituent of\nneutron stars. We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory. Furthermore, in this particular case, we point out that the dark matter\naround a neutron star should also contribute to the mass measurement due to its\npure gravitational effect. However, our numerically calculation illustrates\nthat such contribution could be safely ignored because of the usual diluted\ndark matter environment assumed.

The former feature leads to an extremely\nintensive gluon radiation and energy dissipation at the early stage of\nhadronization, either in vacuum or in a medium. As a result, a leading hadron\nmust be produced on a short length scale. Evaluation within a model of\nperturbative fragmentation confirms the shortness of the production length.\nThis result is at variance with the unjustified assumption of long production\nlength, made within the popular energy loss scenario.

While the two-flavor effective models may be sufficient\nto describe the phenomenon of pion condensation, it is interesting to study the\nroles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly.

In the\nmean-field approximation, the model predicts a phase transition from the vacuum\nto the pion superfluid phase, which takes place at $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ equal to the\npion mass $m_\\pi$. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly, the strangeness degree of\nfreedom couples to the light quark degrees of freedom and the strange quark\neffective mass depends on the pion condensate.

Besides, these jets have a peculiar\nstructure: the main fraction of the jet energy is carried by a single leading\nhadron, so such jets are very rare.

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to\nobtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with\nmasses below 1.6 solar masses. In particular, we find that if the neutron-skin\nthickness of 208Pb falls within the (0.20-0.26) fm range, large enough\ntransition pressures can be generated to explain the large Vela glitches\nwithout invoking an additional angular-momentum reservoir beyond that confined\nto the solid crust.

At tree-level, the emission of a soft gauge\nboson at subleading order in its energy is given by the Low-Burnett-Kroll\ntheorem, with the angular momentum operator acting on a lower-point amplitude.\nFor well separated particles at tree-level, we prove the Low-Burnett-Kroll\ntheorem using matrix elements of subleading SCET Lagrangian and operator\ninsertions which are individually gauge invariant.

A model based on coherent energy loss\nis able to explain the available quarkonium suppression data in a broad range\nof rapidities, from fixed-target to collider energies, suggesting cold energy\nloss to be the dominant effect in quarkonium suppression in p-A collisions.\nThis could be further tested in a high-energy fixed-target experiment using a\nproton or nucleus beam.

On the level of observables, this reduction\nmanifests itself in an enhancement of the Polyakov loop and in a suppression of\nthe light quark condensates (inverse magnetic catalysis) in the transition\nregion. In this paper, we report on lattice simulations of 1+1+1-flavor QCD at\nan unprecedentedly high value of the magnetic field eB = 3.25 GeV^2. Based on\nthe behavior of various observables, it is shown that even at this extremely\nstrong field, inverse magnetic catalysis prevails and the transition, albeit\nbecoming sharper, remains an analytic crossover. In addition, we develop an\nalgorithm to directly simulate the asymptotically strong magnetic field limit\nof QCD. We find strong evidence for a first-order deconfinement phase\ntransition in this limiting theory, implying the presence of a critical point\nin the QCD phase diagram. Based on the available lattice data, we estimate the\nlocation of the critical point. \n\n"}

{"id": "1505.02257", "contents": "Title: Relative contributions of the weak, main and fission-recycling r-process Abstract: There has been a persistent conundrum in attempts to model the\nnucleosynthesis of heavy elements by rapid neutron capture (the $r$-process).\nAlthough the location of the abundance peaks near nuclear mass numbers 130 and\n195 identify an environment of rapid neutron capture near closed nuclear\nshells, the abundances of elements just above and below those peaks are often\nunderproduced by more than an order of magnitude in model calculations. At the\nsame time there is a debate in the literature as to what degree the $r$-process\nelements are produced in supernovae or the mergers of binary neutron stars. In\nthis paper we propose a novel solution to both problems. We demonstrate that\nthe underproduction of elements above and below the $r$-process peaks\ncharacteristic in the main or weak $r$-process events (like magnetohydrodynamic\njets or neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae) can be supplemented\nvia fission fragment distributions from the recycling of material in a\nneutron-rich environment such as that encountered in neutron star mergers. In\nthis paradigm, the abundance peaks themselves are well reproduced by a\nmoderately neutron rich, main $r$-process environment such as that encountered\nin the magnetohydrodynamical jets in supernovae supplemented with a\nhigh-entropy, weakly neutron rich environment such as that encountered in the\nneutrino-driven-wind model to produce the lighter $r$-process isotopes.\nMoreover, we show that the relative contributions to the $r$-process abundances\nin both the solar-system and metal-poor stars from the weak, main, and\nfission-recycling environments required by this proposal are consistent with\nestimates of the relative Galactic event rates of core-collapse supernovae for\nthe weak and main $r$-process and neutron star mergers for the\nfission-recycling $r$-process. \n\n"}

The spin-orbit term as well as two tensor terms contribute\nat second order to the energy per particle. The simultaneous calculation of the\nisotropic Fermi-liquid parameters provides a rigorous check through the\nvalidity of the Landau relations. It is found that published results for these\nsecond order contributions are incorrect in most cases. In particular,\ninterference terms between $s$-wave and $p$-wave components of the interaction\ncan contribute only to (isospin or spin) asymmetry energies. Even with nine\nadjustable parameters, one does not obtain a good description of the empirical\nnuclear matter saturation curve in the low density region $0<\\rho<2\\rho_0$. The\nreason for this feature is the too strong density-dependence $\\rho^{8/3}$ of\nseveral second-order contributions.

{"id": "1506.06880", "contents": "Title: Shape evolution and collective dynamics of quasifission in TDHF Abstract: Background: At energies near the Coulomb barrier, capture reactions in\nheavy-ion collisions result either in fusion or in quasifission. The former\nproduces a compound nucleus in statistical equilibrium, while the second leads\nto a reseparation of the fragments after partial mass equilibration without\nformation of a compound nucleus. Extracting the compound nucleus formation\nprobability is crucial to predict superheavy-element formation cross-sections.\nIt requires a good knowledge of the fragment angular distribution which itself\ndepends on quantities such as moments of inertia and excitation energies which\nhave so far been somewhat arbitrary for the quasifission contribution.\n  Methods: We investigate the evolution of the nuclear density in\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations leading to quasifission. Our\nmain goal is to extract ingredients of the formula used in the analysis of\nexperimental angular distributions. These include the moment-of-inertia and\ntemperature. We study the dependence of these quantities on various initial\nconditions of the reaction process.\n  Results: The evolution of the moment of inertia is clearly non-trivial and\ndepends strongly on the characteristics of the collision. The temperature rises\nquickly when the kinetic energy is transformed into internal excitation. Then,\nit rises slowly during mass transfer.\n  Conclusions: Fully microscopic theories are useful to predict the complex\nevolution of quantities required in macroscopic models of quasifission. \n\n"}

One aspect that can be addressed is the low dimensionality of\nall its subgroups. Why not much larger groups like SU(7), or for that matter,\nSP(38) or E7?

For l > 0, this is\nthe first lattice QCD calculation using the Luscher finite-volume formalism.\nThis required the design and implementation of novel lattice methods involving\ndisplaced sources and momentum-space cubic sinks. To demonstrate the utility of\nour approach, the calculations were performed in the SU(3)-flavor limit where\nthe light quark masses have been tuned to the physical strange quark mass,\ncorresponding to m_pi = m_K ~ 800 MeV.

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb.

Open-shell nuclei have\nbeen further addressed by implementing variants based on the concept of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking (and restoration).\n  Purpose: In order to access the spectroscopy of open-shell nuclei more\nsystematically while controlling the numerical cost, we design a novel\nmany-body method that combines the merit of breaking and restoring symmetries\nwith those brought about by low-rank individual excitations.\n  Methods: The recently proposed truncated configuration-interaction method\nbased on optimized symmetry-broken and -restored states is extended to the\nz-signature symmetry associated with a discrete subgroup of SU(2). The\nhighly-truncated N-body Hilbert subspace within which the Hamiltonian is\ndiagonalized is spanned by a z-signature broken and restored Slater determinant\nvacuum and associated low-rank excitations.\n  Results: The proposed method provides an excellent reproduction of the\nground-state energy and of low-lying excitation energies of various\nz-signatures and total angular momenta.

Noting that Majorana neutrinos can behave\nquite differently from Dirac ones when they are non-relativistic, we show that,\nat leading order, the angular distribution of the daughters in the decay of a\nheavy neutrino into a lighter one and a self-conjugate boson is isotropic in\nthe parent's rest frame if the neutrinos are Majorana, independent of the\nparent's polarization. If the neutrinos are Dirac fermions, this is, in\ngeneral, not the case. This result follows from CPT invariance and is\nindependent of the details of the physics responsible for the decay. We explore\nthe feasibility of using these angular distributions -- or, equivalently, the\nenergy distributions of the daughters in the laboratory frame -- in order to\naddress the Majorana versus Dirac nature of neutrinos if a fourth, heavier\nneutrino mass eigenstate reveals itself in the current or next-generation of\nhigh-energy colliders, intense meson facilities, or neutrino beam experiments. \n\n"}

This approach differs from previous work\nin that it does not implicitly assume that each static zero mode is associated\nwith a dynamical zero mode. It is demonstrated explicitly in the context of the\nSkyrmion that there are fewer dynamical zero modes than static ones due to the\nWitten-Wess-Zumino term in the action.

In our scenario,\nrapid initial heating of the parton system provides a driving force for the\nchiral field, moving it away from the true vacuum and forcing it to go to the\nopposite point on the vacuum manifold. This converts the entire hot region into\na single DCC domain. Subsequent rolling down of the chiral field to its true\nvacuum will then lead to emission of a large number of (approximately) coherent\npions. The requirement of suppression of thermal fluctuations to maintain the\n(approximate) coherence of such a large DCC domain, favors three dimensional\nexpansion of the plasma over the longitudinal expansion even at very early\nstages of evolution.

We discuss Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) which was first\nintroduced by Maskawa and Yamawaki (MY). Following MY, we present canonical\nformalism of DLCQ and the zero-mode constraint through which the zero mode can\nactually be solved away in terms of other modes,thus establishing the trivial\nvacuum. Due to this trivial vacuum, existence of the massless Nambu-Goldstone\n(NG) boson coupled to the current is guaranteed by the non-conserved charge\nsuch that Q |0> = 0 and dot{Q} ne 0. The SSB (NG phase) in DLCQ can be realized\non the trivial vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the NG\nboson m_{pi} is introduced so that the NG-boson zero mode integrated over the\nLF exhibits singular behavior sim 1/m_{pi}^2 in such a way that dot{Q} ne 0 in\nthe symmetric limit m_{pi} -> 0.

The\nsecond potential set is based on the recent SU(3) extension of the Nijmegen\nsoft-core potential NSC97 with strongly attractive $YY$ interactions which may\nallow for deeply bound hypernuclear matter. The results show that, for the\nfirst potential set, the $\\Sigma$ hyperon does not appear at all in the bulk at\nany baryon density and for all strangeness fractions. The binding energy curves\nof the resulting $N\\Lambda\\Xi$ system vary smoothly with density and the system\nis stable (or metastable if we include the weak force).

Both of these two aspects have been considered in the framework of\nchiral topological models of QCD. The whole content of the thesis may be\ndivided into two main parts. In the first part the original Skyrme model with\nfinite pion mass has been extended by inclusion of the light scalar - isoscalar\nsigma - meson. The Lagrangian has been further extended by explicit inclusion\nof sigma, rho and omega - mesons as well. In order to get a more complete\npicture of NN potential the appropriate meson - nucleon vertex form - factors\nare obtained.

Abstract: Entropy production in the compression stage of heavy ion collisions is\ndiscussed within three distinct macroscopic models (i.e. generalized RHTA,\ngeometrical overlap model and three-fluid hydrodynamics). We find that within\nthese models \\sim 80% or more of the experimentally observed final-state\nentropy is created in the early stage. It is thus likely followed by a nearly\nisentropic expansion. We employ an equation of state with a first-order phase\ntransition. For low net baryon density, the entropy density exhibits a jump at\nthe phase boundary. However, the excitation function of the specific entropy\nper net baryon, S/A, does not reflect this jump. This is due to the fact that\nfor final states (of the compression) in the mixed phase, the baryon density\n\\rho_B increases with \\sqrt{s}, but not the temperature T. Calculations within\nthe three-fluid model show that a large fraction of the entropy is produced by\nnuclear shockwaves in the projectile and target.

When\nthe often-used Ball-Chiu Ansatz is used to construct the quark-photon vertex\ndirectly from the quark propagator, less than half of $r_\\pi^2$ is generated.\nThe remainder of $r^2_\\pi$ is seen to be attributable to the presence of the\n$\\rho$-pole in the solution of the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation. \n\n"}

This can\nbe applied successfully to the physically relevant density range. \n\n"}

To this order in small momenta, the amplitude is finite and a\nsum of two- and three-body interactions with no undetermined parameters. We\ncalculate the S-wave multipoles for threshold production and the deuteron\nS-wave cross section as a function of the photon virtuality. We also discuss\nthe sensitivity to the elementary neutron amplitudes. \n\n"}

The transition from the low density\nLenz potential, proportional to scattering length, to the high density Hartree\npotential is found to begin at fairly low densities. Exact non-relativistic\ncalculations of the kaon energy in a simple cubic crystal of neutrons are used\nto test the Wigner-Seitz and the Ericson-Ericson approximation methods. All the\ncalculations indicate that by $\\sim 4$ times nuclear matter density the Hartree\nlimit is reached, and as the Hartree potential is less attractive, the density\nfor kaon condensation appears to higher than previously estimated. Effects of a\nhypothetical repulsive core in the $K^-N$ potential are also studied. \n\n"}
