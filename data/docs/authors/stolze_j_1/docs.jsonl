For this model, the mean-field theory (i.e. a fully connected\nmodel) predicts a transition from elastic depinning to hysteretic plastic\ndepinning as disorder or viscous coupling is increased. A functional RG\nanalysis shows that any small inter-layer viscous coupling destablizes the\nstandard (decoupled) elastic depinning FRG fixed point for d <= 4, while for d\n> 4 most aspects of the mean-field theory are recovered. A one-loop study at\nnon-zero velocity indicates, for d<4, coexistence of a moving state and a\npinned state below the elastic depinning threshold, with hysteretic plastic\ndepinning for periodic and non-periodic driven layers. A 2-loop analysis of\nquasi-statics unveils the possibility of more subtle effects, including a new\nuniversality class for non-periodic objects.

Under magnetic fields,\nferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations develop around the\nantiferromagnetic QTCP in addition to antiferromagnetic ones, which is in sharp\ncontrast with the conventional antiferromagnetic quantum critical point.

The convex temperature dependence of\nchi0^{-1} is the characteristic feature of the QTCP, which is never seen in the\nconventional spin fluctuation theory.

However, in some\nexperiments the apparent width of the double-layer capacitor is substantially\nsmaller. We propose an alternate, non-mean-field theory of the ionic\ndouble-layer to explain such large capacitance values.

In this case, at small temperature and zero applied voltage dipoles\nform a correlated liquid on both contacts. We show that at small voltages the\ncapacitance of the double-layer is determined by the transfer of dipoles from\none electrode to the other and is therefore limited only by the weak\ndipole-dipole repulsion between bound ions, so that the capacitance is very\nlarge.

In our theory, a\nquasi-particle tunneling operator is found to be a single-valued function of\ntunneling point coordinates, and its phase depends on the topology determined\nby the positions of Ohmic contacts.

Grassl and Roetteler devised an algorithm to encode a quantum\nconvolutional code with a \"pearl-necklace encoder.\" Despite their theoretical\nsignificance as a neat way of representing quantum convolutional codes, they\nare not well-suited to practical realization. In fact, there is no\nstraightforward way to implement any given pearl-necklace structure. This paper\ncloses the gap between theoretical representation and practical implementation.\nIn our previous work, we presented an efficient algorithm for finding a\nminimal-memory realization of a pearl-necklace encoder for\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) convolutional codes. This work extends our\nprevious work and presents an algorithm for turning a pearl-necklace encoder\nfor a general (non-CSS) quantum convolutional code into a realizable quantum\nconvolutional encoder. We show that a minimal-memory realization depends on the\ncommutativity relations between the gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.\nWe find a realization by means of a weighted graph which details the\nnon-commutative paths through the pearl-necklace. The weight of the longest\npath in this graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement\nthe encoder. The algorithm has a polynomial-time complexity in the number of\ngate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder. \n\n"}

From\ndensity-functional theory, we generate the set of eight Fe $d$ and As $p$\nlocalized Wannier functions for LaOFeAs and their tight-binding (TB)\nHamiltonian, $h(k)$.

We then\ncouple the layers, mainly via interlayer hopping between As $p_{z}$ orbitals,\nand give the formalism for simple and body-centered tetragonal stackings. This\nallows us to explain the material-specific 3D band structures. Due to the high\nsymmetry, several level inversions take place as functions of $k_{z}$ or\npressure, resulting in linear band dispersions (Dirac cones). The underlying\nsymmetry elements are, however, easily broken, so that the Dirac points are not\nprotected, nor pinned to the Fermi level.

For any\nfinite chain size, one of the two solutions become real as the anisotropy is\nlowered below a certain value.

It has been noticed for a long time that the\nphenomenon is \"scale-free\", indicating some type of criticality. In spite of\nattempts to invoke \"Self-Organized Criticality\", the physical origin of this\ncriticality, and also its universal nature, being quite insensitive to the\nnature of microscopic interactions, remained elusive. Recently we proposed that\nthe precise nature of this critical behavior is manifested by a spinodal point\nof a thermodynamic phase transition. Moreover, at the spinodal point there\nexists a divergent correlation length which is associated with the\nsystem-spanning instabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to\nthe mechanical yield. Demonstrating this requires the introduction of an \"order\nparameter\" that is suitable for distinguishing between disordered amorphous\nsystems, and an associated correlation function, suitable for picking up the\ngrowing correlation length. The theory, the order parameter, and the\ncorrelation functions used are universal in nature and can be applied to any\namorphous solid that undergoes mechanical yield. Critical exponents for the\ncorrelation length divergence and the system size dependence are estimated.

In ionic compounds,\nelectrostatic finite size effects have been well characterised, but\nself-interaction of charge neutral defects is often discounted or assumed to\nfollow an asymptotic behaviour and thus easily corrected with linear elastic\ntheory. Here we show that elastic effects are also important in the description\nof defects in ionic compounds and can lead to qualitatively incorrect\nconclusions if inadequately small supercells are used; moreover, the spurious\nself-interaction does not follow the behaviour predicted by linear elastic\ntheory. Considering the exemplar cases of metal oxides with fluorite structure,\nwe show that numerous previous studies, employing 96-atom supercells,\nmisidentify the ground state structure of (charge neutral) Schottky defects. We\nshow that the error is eliminated by employing larger cells (324, 768 and 1500\natoms), and careful analysis determines that elastic effects, not\nelectrostatic, are responsible. The spurious self-interaction was also observed\nin non-oxide ionic compounds and irrespective of the computational method used,\nthereby resolving long standing discrepancies between DFT and force-field\nmethods, previously attributed to the level of theory.

We find that weak interactions increase the d.c.\nconductance in the localized regime while they decrease the d.c. conductance in\nthe diffusive regime. Strong interactions always decrease the conductance. We\nalso study the localization of single-particle excitations close to the Fermi\nenergy which turns out to be only weakly influenced by the interactions. \n\n"}

It is shown that generalized\nHeisenberg-Weyl algebra, suggested by the author to describe quantum\nnon-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems, is a commutant Lie algebra. As the other\nexample of commutant Lie algebra, it is considered a generalized Poisson\nalgebra for differential 1-forms.\n  Note that non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) quantum theory has a broad range of\napplication for non-critical strings in \"coupling constant\" phase space and\nbosonic string in non-Riemannian (for example, affine-metric) curved space\nwhich are non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems. \n\n"}

The quantum walk is average uniform mixing on circulants with bounded\neigenvalue multiplicity. This extends a known fact about the cycles. 2.\nExplicit analysis of the probability distribution of the quantum walk on the\njoin of circulants. This explains why complete partite graphs are not average\nuniform mixing, using the fact the complete n-vertex graph is the join of a\n1-vertex graph and the (n-1)-vertex complete graph, and that the complete\nm-partite graph, where each partition has size n, is the m-fold join of the\nempty n-vertex graph. 3. The quantum walk on the Cartesian product of a\nm-vertex path P and a circulant G, is average uniform mixing if G is. This\nhighlights a difference between circulants and the hypercubes.
