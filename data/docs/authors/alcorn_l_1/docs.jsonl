Abstract: Abreg: By combining HST/UDF imagery with kinematics from VLT/GIRAFFE we\nderive a physical model of distant galaxy J033245.11-274724.0 in a way similar\nto what can be done in the nearby Universe. Here we study the properties of a\ndistant compact LIRGs galaxy. Given the photometric and spectro photometric\naccuracies, we can decompose the galaxy in sub components and correct them for\nreddening. The galaxy is dominated by a dust enshrouded disk revealed by UDF\nimagery. The disk radius is half that of the Milky Way and the galaxy have a\nSFR=20Mo/yr. Morphology and kinematics show that gas and stars together spiral\ninwards rapidly to feed the disk and the central regions. A combined system of\na bar and two non rotating spiral arms regulates the material accretion,\ninduces large sigma, with sigma larger than 100 km/s and redistributes the\nangular momentum (AM). The detailed physical properties resemble to the\nexpectations from modeling a merger of two equal mass, gaseous rich galaxies,\n0.5 Gyr after the merger. In its later evolution, this galaxy could become a\nlate type galaxy which falls on the T-F relation, with an AM mostly induced by\nthe orbital AM of the merger. \n\n"}

This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes. For this\npurpose we model a grid of post-starburst galaxies by inducing a burst and/or a\nhalting of star formation on the normal evolution of spiral galaxies with our\ngalaxy evolution code GALEV.\n  From our models we find that the common E+A criteria exclude a significant\nnumber of post-starburst galaxies and propose that comparing their spectral\nenergy distributions leads to a more sufficient method to investigate\npost-starbust galaxies. We predict that a higher number of E+A galaxies in the\nearly universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher number of starburst, but\nis a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to more gas\ncontent of the galaxies in the early universe.

GCs beginning their\nformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their\nsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during\nformation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the\nmass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (\"blue tilt\") appears in the\nmetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies.

All three correlations have scatter similar to or smaller than\nthe scatter in the well known correlation between MBH and sigma. The new\ncorrelations are remarkable in view of the dichotomy between ellipticals with\ncores and those with central extra light.

But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure.

Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be\nultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr\nspectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the Gemini\nNear-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and\nseveral absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z>2\nquiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar\npopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3\nMsol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 Msol. We detect\nseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [NII]/Halpha,\n[SII]/Halpha and [OII]/[OIII] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line\nregions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies\nactive star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this\ngalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it implies\nthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that\nlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects.\nNuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we\nshow that the AGN contributes <8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A\npossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;\nalthough a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up <10% of the total stellar\nmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light.

The radial variation of the third harmonic terms are well\ndescribed by a logarithmic spiral, from which we interpret that the\ngravitational potential is weakly perturbed by a two-arm spiral density wave\nwith inferred pitch angle of of 52+/-4 degrees. This interpretation predicts a\ntwo-arm spiral distortion in the surface brightness, as hinted by the dust\nstructures in central images of NGC1097, and predicts a combined one-arm and\nthree-arm spiral structure in the velocity field, as revealed in the\nnon-circular motions of the ionised gas within the circumnuclear region of this\ngalaxy. Next, we use a simple spiral perturbation model to constrain the\nfraction of the measured non-circular motions that is due to radial inflow. We\ncombine the resulting inflow velocity with the gas density in the spiral arms,\ninferred from emission line ratios, to estimate the mass inflow rate as a\nfunction of radius, which reaches about 0.011 Msun/yr at a distance of 70 pc\nfrom the center.

As a result, we find that dust extinction\nreduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a\nfactor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks\nincreases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2.

The metal-rich and metal-poor clusters have systematically\ndifferent locations and kinematics in their host galaxies. However, the red and\nblue clusters have similar internal properties, such as the masses, sizes, and\nages. It is therefore interesting to explore whether both metal-rich and\nmetal-poor clusters could form by a common mechanism and still be consistent\nwith the bimodal distribution. We present such a model, which prescribes the\nformation of globular clusters semi-analytically using galaxy assembly history\nfrom cosmological simulations coupled with observed scaling relations for the\namount and metallicity of cold gas available for star formation. We assume that\nmassive star clusters form only during mergers of massive gas-rich galaxies and\ntune the model parameters to reproduce the observed distribution in the Galaxy.\nA wide, but not entire, range of model realizations produces metallicity\ndistributions consistent with the data.

For primaries, we estimate\nthe contributions from astrophysical sources (supernova remnants and pulsars)\nby considering all known local objects within 2 kpc and a smooth distribution\nbeyond. We find that the electron flux in the energy range 5-30 GeV is well\nreproduced by a smooth distant distribution of sources with index $\\gamma\\sim\n2.3-2.4$, while local sources dominate the flux at higher energy.

Solar flares and gamma ray busts are usually associated with\nmagnetic reconnection. Previous work has concentrated on showing how\nreconnection can be rapid in plasmas with very small collision rates. Here we\npresent numerical evidence, based on three dimensional simulations, that\nreconnection in a turbulent fluid occurs at a speed comparable to the rms\nvelocity of the turbulence, regardless of the value of the resistivity. In\nparticular, this is true for turbulent pressures much weaker than the magnetic\nfield pressure so that the magnetic field lines are only slightly bent by the\nturbulence. These results are consistent with the proposal by Lazarian and\nVishniac (1999) that reconnection is controlled by the stochastic diffusion of\nmagnetic field lines, which produces a broad outflow of plasma from the\nreconnection zone.

I consider the evolution of the magnetic\nfield inside such a bubble, using a mixture of analytic and numerical methods.\nIt is found that the field relaxes into an equilibrium filling the entire\nvolume of the bubble. The timescale on which this happens depends critically on\nthe magnetisation and helicity of the outflow as well as on properties of the\nsurrounding ICM. If the outflow is strongly magnetised, the magnetic field\nundergoes reconnection on a short timescale, magnetic energy being converted\ninto heat whilst the characteristic length scale of the field rises; this\nprocess stops when a global equilibrium is reached. The strength of the\nequilibrium field is determined by the magnetic helicity injected into the\nbubble by the AGN: if the outflow has a consistent net flux and consequently a\nlarge helicity then a global equilibrium will be reached on a short timescale,\nwhereas a low-helicity outflow results in no global equilibrium being reached\nand at the time of observation reconnection will be ongoing. However, localised\nflux-tube equilibria will form. If, on the other hand, the outflow is very\nweakly magnetised, no reconnection occurs and the magnetic field inside the\nbubble remains small-scale and passive.

We use an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model for the Galactic\nhalo to predict both the mean trend and scatter of C/O and N/O. In one set of\nmodels, we assume that massive stars enrich the interstellar medium during both\nthe stellar wind and supernovae phases. In the second set, we consider that in\nthe earliest phases (Z <10^-8), stars with masses above 40 Msun only enrich the\ninterstellar medium via stellar winds, collapsing directly into black holes. We\npredict a larger scatter in the C/O and N/O ratios at low metallicities when\nallowing the more massive fast-rotating stars to contribute to the chemical\nenrichment only via stellar winds. The latter assumption, combined with the\nstochasticity in the star formation process in the primordial Galactic halo can\nexplain the wide spread observed in the N/O and C/O ratios in normal\nvery-metal-poor stars. For chemical elements with stellar yields that depend\nstrongly on initial mass (and rotation) such as C, N, and neutron capture\nelements, within the range of massive stars, a large scatter is expected once\nthe stochastic enrichment of the early interstellar medium is taken into\naccount.

How these\ncool outflows arise is still in question. Hot gas from supernovae has long been\nsuspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendency\nto destroy the cool gas as the latter is accelerated. We propose a modification\nof the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty.\n  Star formation is observed to take place in clusters; in a given galaxy, the\nbulk of the star formation is found in the ~20 most massive clusters. We show\nthat, for L* galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with M>10^6 M_sun\nis able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circular\nvelocity of the disk galaxy. This cool gas can travel above the galactic disk\nin less than 2 Myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.\nOnce above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, and\nsupernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, which\ndrive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. Because the\nradiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gas\nis more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction if\nthey do eventually encounter hot gas. Therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,\nradiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. We identify these\ncluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. Another implication of\nour model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, are\nable to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism.

We combine our PDF with a model for Galactic and\nextra-Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission to obtain an estimator and projected\nerror on dark matter particle properties (mass and annihilation cross section)\nusing the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We compare the estimator obtained\nfrom the true PDF to that obtained from the simpler Poisson analysis. We find\nthat, although both estimators are unbaised in the presence of backgrounds, the\nerror on dark matter properties derived from the true PDF is ~50% smaller than\nwhen utilizing the Poisson-based analysis. \n\n"}

The\nevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of the\nvirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated model\nfor disk evolution inside growing NFW dark matter haloes. In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations. We emphasize, though, that this weak evolution\ndoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. On the contrary,\nindividual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a way\nthat they move largely along the scaling relations. Finally, recent\nobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-forming\ndisk galaxies at z \\sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that high\nredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters.

Monte-Carlo Simulations and an Analytical Description Abstract: In this Paper, we present theoretical arguments that the observationally\nestablished index saturation effect vs mass accretion rate is a signature of\nthe bulk (converging) flow onto the black hole. We demonstrate that the index\nsaturation value depends on the plasma temperature of converging flow. We\nself-consistently calculate the Compton cloud (CC) plasma temperature as a\nfunction of mass accretion rate using the energy balance between energy\ndissipation and Compton cooling. We explain the observable phenomenon, index-\nmdot correlations using a Monte-Carlo simulation of radiative processes in the\ninnermost part (CC) of a BH source and we account for the Comptonization\nprocesses in the presence of thermal and bulk motions, as basic types of plasma\nmotion. We show that, when mdot increases, BH sources evolve to high and very\nsoft states (HSS and VSS, respectively), in which the strong blackbody-like and\nsteep power-law components are formed in the resulting X-ray spectrum. The\nsimultaneous detections of these two components strongly depends on sensitivity\nof high energy instruments, given that the relative contribution of the hard\npower-law tail in the resulting VSS spectrum can be very low, which is why, to\ndate {\\it RXTE} observations of the VSS X-ray spectrum has been characterized\nby the presence of the strong BB-like component only.

{"id": "1102.1013", "contents": "Title: Modeling the formation and evolution of star cluster populations in\n  galaxy simulations Abstract: (Abridged) The formation and evolution of star cluster populations are\nrelated to the galactic environment. Cluster formation is governed by processes\nacting on galactic scales, and star cluster disruption is driven by the tidal\nfield. In this paper, we present a self-consistent model for the formation and\nevolution of star cluster populations, for which we combine an N-body/SPH\ngalaxy evolution code with semi-analytic models for star cluster evolution. The\nmodel includes star formation, feedback, stellar evolution, and star cluster\ndisruption by two-body relaxation and tidal shocks. We apply the model by\nsimulating a suite of 9 isolated disc galaxies and 24 galaxy mergers. The\nevolutionary histories of individual clusters in these simulations are\ndiscussed to illustrate how the environment of clusters changes in time and\nspace. The resulting variability of the disruption rate with time and space\naffects the properties of star cluster populations. The combined effect of\nclusters escaping their dense formation sites (`cluster migration') and the\npreferential disruption of clusters residing in dense environments (`natural\nselection') implies that the mean disruption rate of the population decreases\nwith cluster age. This affects the slope of the cluster age distribution, which\nbecomes a function of the star formation rate density. The evolutionary\nhistories of clusters in a galaxy merger vary widely and determine which\nclusters survive the merger. This impacts the age distributions and the\nlocations of the surviving clusters at all times during a merger. We conclude\nthat accounting for the interplay between the formation, disruption, and\norbital histories of clusters enables a more sophisticated interpretation of\nobserved properties of cluster populations, thereby extending the role of\ncluster populations as tracers of galaxy evolution. \n\n"}

Abstract: To gain new insights into the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy reported for\nactive galactic nuclei, we examine radio loudness as a function of Eddington\nratio for a previously published sample of 199 AGN from five different\npopulations. After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries. We conclude that if the\nmass-corrected core radio luminosity is a good measure of jet power, then black\nhole spin may have considerably less impact on jet power than previously\nreported, or that our sample does not include the extremes of spin. If the\nspread in jet power is small then we suggest that characteristics of the\nambient environment and/or the radio source age could be equally as important\nin producing a radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy seen in total radio luminosity. \n\n"}

If the same optimization method is adopted for\ncombinations of other structural parameters such as the CAS system, the merger\nindicator we introduce yields merger samples of equal or higher statistical\nquality than the samples obtained through the use of other structural\nparameters. We explore the ability of the method presented here to select minor\nmergers by identifying a sample of visually classified mergers that would not\nhave been picked up by the use of the CAS system, when using its usual limits.\nGiven the low prevalence of mergers among the general population of galaxies\nand the optimization used here, we find that the merger diagnostic introduced\nin this work is best used as a negative merger test, i.e., it is very effective\nat selecting non-merging galaxies.

We use numerical simulations of merging\ndisc galaxies to investigate which mechanism dominates. The simulations include\na model for the formation and dynamical disruption of the entire star cluster\npopulation. We find that the dynamical heating of clusters by tidal shocks is\nabout an order of magnitude higher in interacting galaxies than in isolated\ngalaxies. This is driven by the increased gas density, and is sufficient to\ndestroy star clusters at a higher rate than new clusters are formed: the total\nnumber of clusters in the merger remnant is 2-50% of the amount in the\nprogenitor discs, with low-mass clusters being disrupted preferentially. By\nadopting observationally motivated selection criteria, we find that the\nobserved surplus of star clusters in nearby merging galaxies is caused by the\nbias to detect young, massive clusters. We provide a general expression for the\nsurvival fraction of clusters, which increases with the gas depletion\ntime-scale. Due to the preferential disruption of low-mass clusters, the mass\ndistribution of the surviving star clusters in a merger remnant develops a peak\nat a mass of about 10^3 Msun, which evolves to higher masses at a rate of\n0.3-0.4 dex per Gyr.

In order to understand the origin of the Galactic\nGCs with heavy element abundance spread (\"HEAS\"), we investigate the formation\nprocesses of massive GCs (MGCs) with masses larger than 10^6 M_sun in gas-rich\ndwarf galaxies interacting and merging with the very young Galaxy. We find that\nmassive and compact stellar clumps with masses larger than 10^6 M_sun, which\ncan be regarded as progenitors of MGCs, can form from massive gas clumps that\nare developed through merging of gaseous regions initially at different regions\nand thus with different metallicities. Therefore it is inevitable that MGCs\nformed in dwarfs have HEAS. The abundance spread in each individual MGC depends\non the radial metallicity gradient of the host dwarf such that it can be larger\nfor the steeper metallicity gradient. For example, MGCs formed in a dwarf with\na central metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.1 and the radial gradient of -0.2 dex\nkpc^{-1} can have the abundance spread of Delta [Fe/H] ~.2.

Our study is aimed at developing independent constraints on\nthese models. In such models, DDM decays into a less massive, stable dark\nmatter (SDM) particle and a significantly lighter particle. The small mass\nsplitting between the parent DDM and the daughter SDM provides the SDM with a\nrecoil or \"kick\" velocity vk, inducing a free-streaming suppression of matter\nfluctuations. This suppression may be probed via weak lensing power spectra\nmeasured by a number of forthcoming imaging surveys that aim primarily to\nconstrain dark energy. Using scales on which linear perturbation theory alone\nis valid (multipoles < 300), surveys like Euclid or LSST can be sensitive to vk\n> 90 km/s for lifetimes ~ 1-5 Gyr. To estimate more aggressive constraints, we\nmodel nonlinear corrections to lensing power using a simple halo evolution\nmodel that is in good agreement with numerical simulations.

On one hand,\nradiative emission drastically decreases the thermal energy content of the\ninterstellar plasma (ISM), inducing a slow cooling flow toward the centre. On\nthe other hand, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) struggles to prevent the\nrunaway cooling catastrophe, injecting huge amount of energy in the ISM. The\npresent study intends to deeply investigate the role of mechanical AGN feedback\nin (isolated or massive) elliptical galaxies, extending and completing the mass\nrange of tested cosmic environments. Our previously successful feedback models,\nin galaxy clusters and groups, demonstrated that AGN outflows, self-regulated\nby cold gas accretion, are able to properly quench the cooling flow, without\ndestroying the cool core. Via 3D hydrodynamic simulations (FLASH 3.3),\nincluding also stellar evolution, we show that massive mechanical AGN outflows\ncan indeed solve the cooling flow problem for the entire life of the galaxy, at\nthe same time reproducing typical observational features and constraints, such\nas buoyant underdense bubbles, elliptical shock cocoons, sonic ripples,\ndredge-up of metals, subsonic turbulence, and extended filamentary or nuclear\ncold gas. In order to avoid overheating and totally emptying the isolated\ngalaxy, the frequent mechanical AGN feedback should be less powerful and\nefficient (~1.e-4), compared to the heating required for more massive and bound\nellipticals surrounded by the intragroup medium (efficiency ~1.e-3). \n\n"}

We have previously argued that filaments of cold (~10^4 K) gas\ncondense out of the intracluster medium (ICM) in hydrostatic and thermal\nequilibrium when the ratio of the thermal instability timescale to the\nfree-fall time $t_{TI}/t_{ff}$ falls below 5-10. This criterion corresponds to\nan upper limit on the density of the ICM and motivates a model in which a\ndensity core forms wherever $t_{TI}/t_{ff} \\lesssim 10$. Consistent with\nobservations and numerical simulations, this model predicts larger and more\ntenuous cores for lower-mass halos---while the core density in a cluster may be\nas large as ~ 0.1 cm^{-3}, the core density in the Galactic halo should not\nexceed ~ 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. We can also explain the large densities in smaller\nmass halos (galactic `coronae') if we include the contribution of the central\ngalaxy to the gravitational potential.

Because\nof the smaller mass in the ICM and much larger mass available for star\nformation, the majority of the baryons in low mass halos ($\\lesssim 10^{13}$\nMsun) can be expelled beyond the virial radius due to supernova feedback.

Here we develop a new test of the cosmic evolution of supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies by considering the local population of\nSMBHs. We show that substantial SMBH growth in spiral galaxies is required as\ndisks assemble. SMBHs exhibit a tight relation between their mass and the\nvelocity dispersion of the spheroid within which they reside, the M_BH-sigma\nrelation. In disk galaxies the bulge is the spheroid of interest. We explore\nthe evolution of the M_BH-sigma relation when bulges form together with SMBHs\non the M_BH-sigma relation and then slowly reform a disk around them. The\nformation of the disk compresses the bulge raising its sigma. We present\nevidence for such compression in the form of larger velocity dispersion of\nclassical bulges compared with elliptical galaxies at the same mass. This\ncompression leads to an offset in the M_BH-sigma relation if it is not\naccompanied by an increased M_BH. We quantify the expected offset based on\nphotometric data and show that, on average, SMBHs must grow by ~ 50-65% just to\nremain on the M_BH-sigma relation. We find no significant offset in the\nM_BH-sigma relations of classical bulges and of ellipticals, implying that\nSMBHs have been growing along with disks. Our simulations demonstrate that SMBH\ngrowth is necessary for the local population of disk galaxies to have remained\non the M_BH-sigma relation. \n\n"}

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This\nvariability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR).

Emission from molecular clouds is often analyzed by decomposition\ninto approximately beam-sized clumps. Such clumps in 30 Doradus follow similar\ntrends in size, linewidth, and surface density to Milky Way clumps.

As in previous studies, the\nforming cloud begins to undergo gravitational collapse because it rapidly\nacquires a mass much larger than the average Jeans mass. Thus, the collapse\nsoon becomes nearly pressureless, proceeding along its shortest dimension\nfirst. This naturally produces filaments in the cloud, and clumps within the\nfilaments. The filaments are not in equilibrium at any time, but instead are\nlong-lived flow features, through which the gas flows from the cloud to the\nclumps. The filaments are long-lived because they accrete from their\nenvironment while simultaneously accreting onto the clumps within them; they\nare essentially the locus where the flow changes from accreting in two\ndimensions to accreting in one dimension. Moreover, the clumps also exhibit a\nhierarchical nature: the gas in a filament flows onto a main, central clump,\nbut other, smaller-scale clumps form along the infalling gas. Correspondingly,\nthe velocity along the filament exhibits a hierarchy of jumps at the locations\nof the clumps. Two prominent filaments in the simulation have lengths ~15 pc,\nand masses ~600 Msun above density n ~ 10^3 cm-3 (~2x10^3 Msun at n > 50 cm-3).\nThe density profile exhibits a central flattened core of size ~0.3 pc and an\nenvelope that decays as r^-2.5, in reasonable agreement with observations.\nAccretion onto the filament reaches a maximum linear density rate of ~30 Msun\nMyr^-1 pc^-1. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, we want to determine above which gas density this variation arises\nand what changes in the grain optical properties/size distribution are\nrequired.

We test a range of optical properties and size\ndistributions for the grains: dust of the diffuse interstellar medium\n(interstellar PAHs and amorphous carbons and silicates) and both compact and\nfluffy aggregates. We find that the grain opacity has to increase across the\nfilament to fit simultaneously the near-IR extinction and Herschel emission\nprofiles of L1506. We interpret this change to be a consequence of the\ncoagulation of dust grains to form fluffy aggregates. Grains similar to those\nin the diffuse medium have to be present in the outer layers of the cloud,\nwhereas aggregates must prevail above gas densities of a few 1000 H/cm3. This\ncorresponds to line-of-sights with visual extinction in the V band of the order\nof 2 to 3.

In this\nwork, we self-consistently account for the plasma effects for the first time by\nanalysing the results of time-dependent 3D force-free and magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of pulsar magnetospheres. We show that if a neutron star is\nspherically symmetric and is embedded with a dipolar magnetic moment, the\npulsar evolves so as to minimise its spin-down luminosity: both vacuum and\nplasma-filled pulsars evolve toward the aligned configuration ($\\alpha=0$).\nHowever, they approach the alignment in qualitatively different ways.

Only $\\sim5$ per cent of star-forming\ngalaxies in both the group and field sample show a significant enhancement in\nstar formation, which suggests that quenching is the primary process in the\ntransition from the star-forming to the quiescent state.

We find that with no delay, the quenching timescale needs\nto be long in order to match the observed quiescent fraction, but then this\nmodel produces too many intermediate galaxies. Fixing a delay time of 3 Gyr, as\nsuggested from the local universe, produces too few quiescent galaxies.

ETGs brighter than $M_r=-21$\nmag are older than 13 Gyr and spend up to 10 Gyr of their overall evolutionary\ntime in the BC before they reach the RS migrating through the GV. Fainter ETGs\nare younger, of about 2 Gyr on average, and evolve for about 7-8 Gyr along the\nBC. The turn-off occurs at z ~ 0.3-0.4. Therefore these ETGs spend up to 3-5\nGyr crossing the GV; UGC 06324, the faintest ETG in the sample, still is in the\nGV. The mechanism driving their evolution is gravitational, due to merging\nand/or interaction. Our SPH simulations suggest that ETG members of these\ngroups evolved toward the RS before and during the group collapse phase. This\nresult is consistent with the dynamical analysis of both groups showing that\nthey are not yet virialized. \n\n"}

It turns out\nthat the nonlocal aspect of gravity in this theory can simulate dark matter;\nindeed, in the Newtonian regime of nonlocal gravity, we recover the\nphenomenological Tohline-Kuhn approach to modified gravity. A simple\ngeneralization of the Kuhn kernel in the context of nonlocal general relativity\nleads to a two-parameter modified Newtonian force law that involves an\nadditional repulsive Yukawa-type interaction.

We test the\neffectiveness of the IR luminosity as an SFR indicator by applying it to\nsynthetic spectral energy distributions generated from three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies and galaxy mergers.

This new model is used to investigate the effect of such a\nfeedback on shaping the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution. Star\nformation activity is significantly suppressed in dwarf galaxies by the new\nfeedback effect, and the faint-end slope of local luminosity functions can be\nreproduced with a reasonable strength of supernova feedback, which is in\ncontrast to the previous models that require a rather extreme strength of\nsupernova feedback.

But\nother observational evidence suggest there is a significant variation of the\ndust-to-metals ratio with metallicity. As we demonstrate in this paper, a\nsimple star-dust scenario is problematic also in the sense that it requires\nthat destruction of dust in the interstellar medium (e.g., due to passage of\nsupernova shocks) must be highly inefficient. We suggest a model where stellar\ndust production is indeed efficient, but where interstellar dust growth is\nequally important and acts as a replenishment mechanism which can counteract\nthe effects of dust destruction. This model appears to resolve the seemingly\ncontradictive observations, given that the ratio of the effective (stellar)\ndust and metal yields is not universal and thus may change from one environment\nto another, depending on metallicity. \n\n"}

Observations of the CO line at\nredshifts of 2-4 are crucial to investigate the gas mass, star formation\nactivity and accretion onto SMBHs, as well as the effect of AGN feedback.\nPotential correlations between AGN and host galaxy properties can be\nhighlighted by observing extreme objects.

Remarkably, the number\ndensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 to\nthe present.

While the cores appear to form early, the\ngalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total masses\nincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radii\nincrease by a factor of 5-6.

For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity\nwaves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially tangential\nturbulence. For M>0.5, sound waves start to significantly contribute, passing\nthe leading role to compressive pressure fluctuations, associated with\nisotropic (or slightly radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations\nare then characterized by the dominant process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic\n(high M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters reside in the\nintermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence\ndrifting towards isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the regime,\nthe variance of density perturbations is comparable to the 1D Mach number.

Our modern understanding of\nthe baryon cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of the\nfresh gas supply may quench satellite galaxies long before stripping events\noccur, a process we call overconsumption. We compile measurements from the\nliterature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts to\ndetermine if satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gas\nstripping events -- either direct stripping of the disk (ram pressure\nstripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) -- or from\ninternally-driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. The observed\ntimescales show significant deviation from the evolution expected for gas\nstripping mechanisms and suggest that either ram pressure stripping is much\nmore efficient at high redshift, or that secular outflows quench satellites\nbefore orbit-based stripping occurs. Given the strong redshift evolution of\nstar formation rates, at high redshift (z > 1.5) even moderate outflow rates\nwill lead to extremely short quenching times with the expectation that such\nsatellites will be quenched almost immediately following the cessation of\ncosmological inflow, regardless of stripping events. Observations of high\nredshift satellites give an indirect but sensitive measure of the outflow rate\nwith current measurements suggesting that outflows are no larger than 2.5 times\nthe star formation rate for galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^{10.5} solar\nmasses. \n\n"}

We\ninvestigate a merger-feature time useful for understanding the morphological\ntransformation of galaxy mergers via numerical simulations. We use\nN-body/hydrodynamic simulations, including gas cooling, star formation, and\nsupernova feedback. We run a set of simulations with various initial orbital\nconfigurations and with progenitor galaxies having different morphological\nproperties mainly for equal-mass mergers. As reference models, we ran\nadditional simulations for non-equal mass mergers and mergers in a large halo\npotential. Mock images using the SDSS $r$ band are synthesized to estimate a\nmerger-feature times and compare it between the merger simulations. The mock\nimages suggest that the post-merger features involve a small fraction of stars,\nand the merger-feature time depends on galaxy interactions. In an isolated\nenvironment, the merger-feature time is, on average, $\\sim$ 2 times the final\ncoalescence time for a shallow surface bright limit of 25 mag/arcsec^2.

In this Letter we report a\nsystematic exploration of the optical extinction (A_V) and the silicate\nabsorption optical depth (\\Delta\\tau9.7) of 110 type 2 AGNs. We derive A_V from\nthe Balmer decrement based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, and\n\\Delta\\tau9.7 from the Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph data. We find that with a\nmean ratio of A_V/\\Delta\\tau9.7 ~ 5.5, the optical-to-silicate extinction\nratios of these AGNs are substantially lower than that of the Galactic diffuse\ninterstellar medium (ISM) for which A_V/\\Delta\\tau9.7 ~ 18.5. We argue that the\nanomalously low A_V/\\Delta\\tau9.7 ratio could be due to the predominance of\nlarger grains in the AGN torus compared to that in the Galactic diffuse ISM. \n\n"}

For both populations the clustering is\nstronger for galaxies brighter in rest-frame optical and the trend is\nparticularly strong for PE galaxies, indicating that passive galaxies with\nlarger stellar masses reside in more massive halos. In contrast, at rest-frame\nUV we find that while the clustering of SF galaxies increases with increasing\nluminosity, it decreases for PE galaxies; a possible explanation lies in\nquenching of star formation in the most massive halos. Furthermore, we find two\ncomponents in the correlation functions for both SF and PE galaxies,\nattributable to one- and two-halo terms.

The technique provides 3-D measurements of galaxy clustering and\nmoments of the galaxy luminosity function. Furthermore, the linear portion of\nthe power spectrum can be used to measure the total line emission intensity\nincluding all sources through cosmic time with redshift information naturally\nencoded. Total line emission, when compared to the total star formation\nactivity and/or other line intensities reveals evolution of the interstellar\nconditions of galaxies in aggregate.

Using N-body simulations we study the\nprocess by following the evolution of a disky dwarf orbiting a Milky Way-like\nhost. We focus on the effect of the orientation of the dwarf galaxy disk's\nangular momentum with respect to the orbital one.

The effect is strongest for the exactly prograde and weakest for\nthe exactly retrograde orbit. In the prograde case the stellar component forms\na strong bar and remains prolate until the end of the evolution, while its\nrotation is very quickly replaced by random motions of the stars. In the\nretrograde case the dwarf remains oblate, does not form a bar and loses\nrotation very slowly. Our results suggest that resonant effects are the most\nimportant mechanism underlying the evolution while tidal shocking plays only a\nminor role. \n\n"}

The removal efficiency of an element\n(e.g., Fe, Mg, and Ca) through radiation-driven dust wind in a galaxy is\nassumed to depend both on the dust depletion level of the element in\ninterstellar medium and the total luminosity of the galaxy in the new model. We\nparticularly focus on the time evolution of [alpha/Fe] and its dependence on\nmodel parameters for dust wind in this study. The principal results are as\nfollows. The time evolution of [Ca/Fe] is significantly different between\nmodels with and without dust wind in the sense that [Ca/Fe] can be\nsystematically lower in the models with dust wind. The time evolution of\n[Mg/Fe], on the other hand, can not be so different between the models with and\nwithout dust wind owing to the lower level of dust depletion for Mg. As a\nresult of this, [Mg/Ca] can be systematically higher in the models with dust\nwind. We compare these results with the observed elemental features of stars in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), because a growing number of observational\nstudies on [alpha/Fe] for the LMC have been recently accumulated for a detailed\ncomparison.

The unique\nband of the AKARI IRC spectroscopy enables us to access both the 3.3 um\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission feature from star forming\nactivity and the continuum of torus-dust emission heated by an active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). Applying our AGN diagnostics to the AKARI spectra, we discover\n14 buried AGNs. The large fraction of buried AGNs suggests that AGN activity\nbehind the dust is almost ubiquitous in ultra-/luminous infrared galaxies\n(U/LIRGs). We also find that both the fraction and energy contribution of\nburied AGNs increase with infrared luminosity from 10 < log(L_IR / Lsun) < 13,\nincluding normal infrared galaxies with log (L_IR / Lsun) < 11. The energy\ncontribution from AGNs in the total infrared luminosity is only ~7% in LIRGs\nand ~20% in ULIRGs, suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosity\noriginates from starburst activity.

We determine the\nSMF of the z=0.44 cluster of galaxies MACS J1206.2-0847 separately for passive\nand star-forming (SF) galaxies, in different regions of the cluster, from the\ncenter out to approximately 2 virial radii.

The whole\ncluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster\nSF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population\nhas a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50\nMpc), highest density cluster region, than in more external, lower density\nregions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant galaxies is maximum in this\ninnermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently increases\nagain toward the cluster outskirts. This is also reflected in a decreasing\nradial trend of the average stellar mass per cluster galaxy. On the other hand,\nthe stellar mass fraction, i.e., the ratio of stellar to total cluster mass,\ndoes not show any significant radial trend. Conclusions.

A requirement of\nthis model, at least in its current form, is that young massive (i.e.\nproto-globular) clusters are not able to eject the unused gas and dust from the\nstar-formation process from the cluster for 20-30 Myr after the formation of\nthe first generation of stars, i.e. the cluster remains embedded within the gas\ncloud in which it forms. Here, we test this prediction by performing a\nliterature search for young massive clusters in nearby galaxies, which have\nages less than 20 Myr that are not embedded. We report that a number of such\nclusters exist, with masses near, or significantly above 10^6 Msun, with ages\nbetween a few Myr and ~15 Myr, suggesting that even high mass clusters are able\nto clear any natal gas within them within a few Myr after formation.\nAdditionally, one cluster, Cluster 23 in ESO~338-IG04, has a metallicity below\nthat of some Galactic globular clusters that have been found to host multiple\nstellar populations, mitigating any potential effect of differences in\nmetallicity in the comparison.

Eight radio source\nsamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with\n0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and\nradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes. Comparing with large\nsamples of local radio-AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the cosmic\nevolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-AGN class is\nindependently derived. Radiative-mode radio-AGN show an order of magnitude\nincrease in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with these\nAGN being fuelled by cold gas. In contrast, the space density of jet-mode\nradio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <\n1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities. Simple models are\ndeveloped to explain the observed evolution.

We recover the sequence in\nassociation of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several\nindicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the\nstellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the\nthree SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and\noccur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter\nshowing the weakest correlation.

Several theoretical models\nimplement AGN feedback to explain the observed galaxy luminosity function, and\npossibly the color and morphological transformation of spiral galaxies into\npassive ellipticals. To understand the importance of AGN feedback, a study of\nthe AGN populations in the radio-optical domain is crucial.

We observed a\nsample of 119 intermediate-redshift (0.04<z<0.4) SDSS-FIRST radio emitters with\nthe Effelsberg 100-m telescope at 4.85 and 10.45 GHz and obtained spectral\nindices. We find indications of spectral index flattening in high-metallicity\nstar-forming galaxies, composite galaxies, and Seyferts.

The radio data are consistent\nwith either the radio emission coming from the parsec-scale base of a\nsynchrotron wind originating in the magnetised corona above the accretion disk,\nor from the inner ionised edge of the accretion disk or torus. In the former\ncase, the narrow line region (NLR) clouds may form a part of the broad outflow,\nwhile in the latter, the NLR clouds may form a part of an extended disk beyond\nthe torus. The radio and NLR emission may also be decoupled so that the radio\nemission originates in an outflow while the NLR is in a disk, and vice versa.\nWhile with the present data, it is not possible to clearly distinguish between\nthese scenarios, there appears to be greater circumstantial evidence supporting\nthe coronal wind picture in KISSR1494. From the kiloparsec-scale radio\nemission, the time-averaged kinetic power of this outflow is estimated to be\n$Q\\approx1.5\\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is typical of radio outflows in\nlow-luminosity AGN.

The resulting redshift uncertainties inhibit\nthe efficient search for [C II] in z~7 galaxies with sub-mm instruments such as\nALMA, given their limited scan speed for faint lines.

At z~6.8, galaxies exhibit IRAC colors as blue as\n[3.6]-[4.5] ~-1, likely due to the contribution of [O III]+Hb to the 3.6 mum\nflux combined with the absence of line contamination in the 4.5 mum band.

A primary goal for identifying these rare galaxies is to\nexamine whether the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) between stellar\nmass, gas metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR) holds for low stellar mass\nand high SFR galaxies. The FMR suggests that higher SFR galaxies have lower\nmetallicity (at fixed stellar mass). To test this trend, we combine\nspectroscopic measurements of metallicity and dust-corrected SFRs, with stellar\nmass estimates from modeling the optical photometry. We find that these\ngalaxies are $1.05\\pm0.61$ dex above the z~1 stellar mass-SFR relation, and\n$0.23\\pm0.23$ dex below the local mass-metallicity relation.

We find that a magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a\nsupernova-driven interstellar medium, which features a flow of hot gas from the\ndisk to the halo, reproduces the temperature but significantly underpredicts\nthe 0.5-2.0 keV surface brightness of the halo (by two orders of magnitude, if\nwe compare the median predicted and observed values). This is true for versions\nof the model with and without an interstellar magnetic field. We consider\ndifferent reasons for the discrepancy between the model predictions and the\nobservations.

We find that this surface density is generally\nconstant across a wide range of maximum circular velocities of $\\sim$ 10 to 400\nkm s$^{-1}$, irrespective of different density distribution in each of the\ngalaxies. This common surface density at high halo-mass scales is found to be\nnaturally reproduced by both cold and warm dark matter (CDM and WDM) models,\neven without employing any fitting procedures. However, the common surface\ndensity at dwarf-galaxy scales, for which we have derived from the Milky Way\nand Andromeda dwarf satellites, is reproduced only in a massive range of WDM\nparticle masses, whereas CDM provides a reasonable agreement with the observed\nconstancy. This is due to the striking difference between mass-concentration\nrelations for CDM and WDM halos at low halo-mass scales.

We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc.

This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc\ndecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component\nin about 6 dynamical times.

Comparison with RRL templates verifies the recovery of the free-free\nemission along the Galactic plane. Comparison of the high-latitude Halpha\nemission with our free-free map shows residuals that correlate with dust\noptical depth, consistent with a fraction (~30%) of Halpha having been\nscattered by high-latitude dust. We highlight a number of diffuse spinning dust\nmorphological features at high latitude. There is substantial spatial variation\nin the spinning dust spectrum, with the emission peak ranging from below 20GHz\nto more than 50GHz. There is a strong tendency for the spinning dust component\nnear many prominent HII regions to have a higher peak frequency, suggesting\nthat this increase in peak frequency is associated with dust in the\nphotodissociation regions around the nebulae. The emissivity of spinning dust\nin these diffuse regions is of the same order as previous detections in the\nliterature. Over the entire sky, the commander solution finds more anomalous\nmicrowave emission than the WMAP component maps, at the expense of synchrotron\nand free-free emission.

Our\nprimary results are as follows: 1) The inferred average stellar mass evolution\nobtained via a constant comoving number density assumption is systematically\nbiased compared to the merger tree results at the factor of $\\sim$2(4) level\nwhen tracking galaxies from redshift $z=0$ out to redshift $z=2(3)$; 2) The\nmedian number density evolution for galaxy populations tracked forward in time\nis shallower than for galaxy populations tracked backward in time; 3) A similar\nevolution in the median number density of tracked galaxy populations is found\nregardless of whether number density is assigned via stellar mass, stellar\nvelocity dispersion, or dark matter halo mass; 4) Explicit tracking reveals a\nlarge diversity in galaxies' assembly histories that cannot be captured by\nconstant number-density analyses; 5) The significant scatter in galaxy linking\nmethods is only marginally reduced by considering a number of additional\nphysical and observable galaxy properties as realized in our simulation.

In the model, populations of stellar clusters form in the high-pressure\ndiscs of high-redshift ($z>2$) galaxies (a rapid-disruption phase due to tidal\nperturbations from the dense interstellar medium), after which the galaxy\nmergers associated with hierarchical galaxy formation redistribute the\nsurviving, massive clusters into the galaxy haloes, where they remain until the\npresent day (a slow-disruption phase due to tidal evaporation). The high galaxy\nmerger rates of $z>2$ galaxies allow these clusters to be `liberated' into the\ngalaxy haloes before they are disrupted within the high-density discs. This\nphysically-motivated toy model is the first to include the rapid-disruption\nphase, which is shown to be essential for simultaneously reproducing the wide\nvariety of properties of observed GC systems, such as their universal\ncharacteristic mass-scale, the dependence of the specific frequency on\nmetallicity and galaxy mass, the GC system mass-halo mass relation, the\nconstant number of GCs per unit supermassive black hole mass, and the colour\nbimodality of GC systems. The model predicts that most of these observables\nwere already in place at $z=1$-$2$, although under rare circumstances GCs may\nstill form in present-day galaxies. In addition, the model provides important\nconstraints on models for multiple stellar populations in GCs by putting limits\non initial GC masses and the amount of pristine gas accretion.

The majority of them is at high redshifts (z~2-3), at the\npeak epoch of star formation in the Universe. Infrared, optical, radio, and\nX-ray data suggest that hot DOGs contain heavily obscured, extremely luminous\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). This class may represent a short phase in the\nlife of the galaxies, signifying the transition from starburst- to\nAGN-dominated phases. Hot DOGs are typically radio-quiet, but some of them show\nmJy-level emission in the radio (microwave) band. We observed four hot DOGs\nusing the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The 1.7-GHz\nobservations with the European VLBI Network (EVN) revealed weak radio features\nin all sources. The radio is free from dust obscuration and, at such high\nredshifts, VLBI is sensitive only to compact structures that are characteristic\nof AGN activity. In two cases (WISE J0757+5113, WISE J1603+2745), the flux\ndensity of the VLBI-detected components is much smaller than the total flux\ndensity, suggesting that ~70-90 per cent of the radio emission, while still\ndominated by AGN, originates from angular scales larger than probed by the EVN.\nThe source WISE J1146+4129 appears a candidate compact symmetric object, and\nWISE J1814+3412 shows a 5.1-kpc double structure, reminiscent of hot spots in a\nmedium-sized symmetric object. Our observations support that AGN residing in\nhot DOGs may be genuine young radio sources where starburst and AGN activities\ncoexist. \n\n"}

Along the jet axis we find\nstrong velocity reversals where the projected velocity swings from -150 km/s to\n+150 km/s. A simple model of a molecular jet precessing around an axis close to\nthe plane of the sky can reproduce the observations. The velocity of the\noutflowing gas is difficult to constrain due to the velocity reversals but we\nestimate it to be between 240 and 850 km/s and the jet to precess with a period\nP=0.3-1.1 Myr. The CO emission is clumpy along the jet and the total molecular\nmass in the high-velocity (+-(60 to 150 km/s)) gas lies between 2e6 Msun (light\njet) and 2e7 Msun (massive jet). There is also CO emission extending along the\nminor axis of NGC1377. It holds >40% of the flux in NGC1377 and may be a\nslower, wide-angle molecular outflow which is partially entrained by the\nmolecular jet.\n  We discuss the driving mechanism of the molecular jet and suggest that it is\neither powered by a very faint radio jet or by an accretion disk-wind similar\nto those found towards protostars. The nucleus of NGC1377 harbours intense\nembedded activity and we detect emission from vibrationally excited HCN J=4-3\nv_2=1f which is consistent with hot gas and dust.

It does not depend on the susceptibility. Here, the focus is on\ncarbon-rich molecules which are diamagnetic. The same process must occur if the\nmolecule is paramagnetic or bathes in an electric field instead.\n  A semi-empirical method of chemical modeling was used extensively to\nillustrate and quantify these concepts as applied to a hydrocarbon molecule.\nThe motion of a rotating molecule in a field was monitored in time so as to\nreveal the energy transfer and visualize the evolution of its orientation\ntowards the stable configuration. \n\n"}

Candidate carriers\ninclude water ice, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), silicon carbide,\ncrystalline silicates or even carbonates. All are known constituents of cosmic\ndust in one or more types of environments, though not necessarily together. In\nthis paper we present new ground-based 8-13 micron spectra of one evolved star,\nseveral embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) and a background source lying\nbehind a large column of the interstellar medium (ISM) toward the Galactic\nCentre. Our observations, obtained at a spectral resolution of approximately\n100, are compared with previous lower resolution data, as well as data obtained\nwith the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) on these and other targets. By\npresenting a subset of a larger sample our aim is to establish the reality of\nthe feature and subsequently speculate on its carrier. All evidence points\ntoward crystalline silicate. For instance, the 11 micron band profile is well\nmatched with the emissivity of crystalline olivine. Furthermore, the apparent\nassociation of the absorption feature with a sharp polarisation signature in\nthe spectrum of two previously reported cases suggests a carrier with a\nrelatively high band strength compared to amorphous silicates. If true, this\nwould either set back the evolutionary stage in which silicates are\ncrystallised, either to the embedded phase or even before within the ISM, or\nelse the silicates ejected from the outflows of evolved stars retain some of\ntheir crystalline identity during their long residence in the ISM. \n\n"}

We show that R_eff is a good measure of the combined\nsize of the dusty starbursting regions (DSBRs) of the host galaxy. In at least\none case where the individual DSBRs are well resolved through strong\ngravitational lensing, R_eff is consistent with the direct size measurement. We\nshow that the observed L_IR-T relation is simply due to the limited R_eff (<~ 2\nkpc). The small R_eff values also agree with the compact sizes of the DSBRs\nseen in the local universe. However, previous interferometric observations to\nresolve high-z dusty starbursting galaxies often quote much larger sizes.

Abstract: We describe a double-arc-like X-ray structure lying ~15-30\" (~0.8-1.7 kpc)\nsouth of the NGC 5195 nucleus visible in the merged exposures of long Chandra\npointings of M51. The curvature and orientation of the arcs argues for a\nnuclear origin. The arcs are radially separated by ~15\" (~1$ kpc), but are\nrotated relative to each other by ~30 deg. From an archival image, we find a\nslender Halpha-emitting region just outside the outer edge of the outer X-ray\narc, suggesting that the X-ray-emitting gas plowed up and displaced the\nHalpha-emitting material from the galaxy core. Star formation may have\ncommenced in that arc. Halpha emission is present at the inner arc, but appears\nmore complex in structure. In contrast to an explosion expected to be\nazimuthally symmetric, the X-ray arcs suggest a focused outflow.

Systems with ongoing gas\naccretion develop metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) that are sharply\npeaked, while \"gas starved\" systems with rapidly declining star formation have\nbroadly peaked MDFs. A burst of star formation that consumes a significant\nfraction of a system's available gas can temporarily boost [$\\alpha$/Fe] by\n0.1-0.3 dex, a possible origin for rare, $\\alpha$-enhanced stars with\nintermediate age or high metallicity. Other sudden transitions in system\nproperties can produce surprising behavior, including backward evolution of a\nstellar population from high metallicity to low metallicity.

From a\nsample of quadruple image lenses we find that this selection function can\nintroduce a 3.5% bias on the inferred time-delay distances if the ensemble of\ndeflector properties is used as a prior for a cosmographical analysis. This\nbias remains at the 2.4% level when high resolution imaging of the quasar host\nis used to precisely infer the density profiles of individual lenses. We also\ninvestigate if the lines-of-sight for monitorable strong lenses are biased.\nAfter adding external convergence, $\\kappa$, and shear to our lens population\nwe find that the expectation value for $\\kappa$ is increased by 0.004 and 0.009\nfor doubles and quads respectively. $\\kappa$ is degenerate with the value of\n$H_0$ inferred from time delays; fortunately the shift in $\\kappa$ only induces\na 0.9 (0.4) percent bias on $H_0$ for quads (doubles). We therefore conclude\nthat whilst the properties of typical quasar lenses and their lines-of-sight do\ndeviate from the global population, the total magnitude of this effect is\nlikely a subdominant effect for current analyses, but has the potential to be a\nmajor systematic for samples of $\\sim$25 or more lenses. \n\n"}

The goal of this study is to aid the interpretation of spectroscopic\nsearches for binaries and help test one of the leading models of binary\naccretion flows in the literature: SBHB in a circumbinary disk. In this work we\npresent the methodology and a comparison of the preliminary model with the\ndata. We model SBHB accretion flows as a set of three accretion disks: two\nmini-disks that are gravitationally bound to the individual black holes and a\ncircumbinary disk. Given a physically motivated parameter space occupied by\nsub-parsec SBHBs, we calculate a synthetic database of nearly 15 million broad\noptical emission line profiles and explore the dependence of the profile shapes\non characteristic properties of SBHBs. We find that the modeled profiles show\ndistinct statistical properties as a function of the semi-major axis, mass\nratio, eccentricity of the binary, and the degree of alignment of the triple\ndisk system. This suggests that the broad emission line profiles from SBHB\nsystems can in principle be used to infer the distribution of these parameters\nand as such merit further investigation. Calculated profiles are more\nmorphologically heterogeneous than the broad emission lines in observed SBHB\ncandidates and we discuss improved treatment of radiative transfer effects\nwhich will allow direct statistical comparison of the two groups. \n\n"}

Dust and\ngas (self-)shielding is followed to compute the chemical state of the gas with\na chemical network. We find that stellar winds can regulate star (cluster)\nformation. Since the winds suppress the accretion of fresh gas soon after the\ncluster has formed, they lead to clusters which have lower average masses\n(10$^2$ - 10$^{4.3}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and form on shorter timescales (10$^{-3}$ -\n10 Myr).

Abstract: Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely considered to be the\nmain driver in regulating the growth of massive galaxies through heating or\ndriving gas out of the galaxy, preventing further increase in stellar mass.\nObservational proof for this scenario has, however, been scarce. We have\nassembled a sample of 132 radio-quiet type-2 and red AGN at 0.1<z<1.

Outflow strength is independent of sSFR for AGN\nselected on their mid-IR luminosity, in agreement with previous work\ndemonstrating that star formation is not sufficient to produce the observed\nionized gas outflows which have to be powered by AGN activity. More\nimportantly, we find a negative correlation between W90 and sSFR in the AGN\nhosts with the highest SFRs, i.e., with the highest gas content, where\npresumably the coupling of the AGN-driven wind to the gas is strongest. This\nimplies that AGN with strong outflow signatures are hosted in galaxies that are\nmore `quenched' than galaxies with weaker outflow signatures. Despite the\ngalaxies' high SFRs, we demonstrate that the outflows are not star-formation\ndriven but indeed due to AGN-powering.

If the efficiency of converting accreted baryons into stars\nvaries with time, halos of the same present-day mass but different formation\nhistories will have different z=0 galaxy stellar mass. This is one of the\nsources of scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$.\nFor massive halos that undergo rapid quenching of star formation at z~2,\ndifferent mechanisms that trigger this quenching yield different values of\n$\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$. We use this framework to test various models in which\nquenching begins after a galaxy crosses a threshold in one of the following\nphysical quantities: redshift, halo mass, stellar mass, and stellar-to-halo\nmass ratio. Our model is highly idealized, with other sources of scatter likely\nto arise as more physics is included. Thus, our test is whether a model can\nproduce scatter lower than observational bounds, leaving room for other\nsources. Recent measurements find $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}=0.16$ dex for 10^11 Msol\ngalaxies. Under the assumption that the threshold is constant with time, such a\nlow value of $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$ rules out all of these models with the\nexception of quenching by a stellar mass treshold. Most physical quantities,\nsuch as metallicity, will increase scatter if they are uncorrelated with halo\nformation history. Thus, to decrease the scatter of a given model, galaxy\nproperties would correlate tightly with formation history, creating testable\npredictions for their clustering. Understanding why $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$ is so\nsmall may be key to understanding the physics of galaxy formation. \n\n"}

This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky\nWay's gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation\nrather than a bound, dark-matter dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference\nin combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a\nvery eccentric orbit (epsilon~0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On\nsuch an orbit, Hercules \"explodes\" as a consequence of the last tidal shock at\npericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating towards apocenter of its\norbit with a velocity of V=157 km/s -- of which 99% is directed radially\noutwards. Due to differential orbital precession caused by the non-spherical\nnature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to\nits orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a\ndistance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is\nsignificantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving\nperpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in\nthe radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that\nformed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic\nsubstructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on\nsuch a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic\npotential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of\nHercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints\non the potential of the Milky Way. \n\n"}

Self-regulation cycle and\n  non-thermal emission Abstract: Self-regulated feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to be\ncritical in balancing radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centres\nof galaxy clusters and in regulating star formation in central galaxies. In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii. Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs). In contrast, the\npredicted non-thermal emission is well below observational data in cooling\ngalaxy clusters without RMHs.

However, unlike\nprevious analyses of the MDAR, McGaugh et al. have chosen to obfuscate the MOND\nroots of their analysis, and its connection with, and implications for, this\nparadigm.

Abstract: Recent spatially resolved observations of galaxies at z=0.6-3 reveal that\nhigh-redshift galaxies show complex kinematics and a broad distribution of\ngas-phase metallicity gradients. To understand these results, we use a suite of\nhigh-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) project, which include physically motivated models of the\nmulti-phase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback. Our simulations\nreproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity\ngradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative\nmetallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all\nrotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed\ngalaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic\nproperties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary\nsignificantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes.\nFeedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and\nflatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a\nsingle galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample,\nindicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies\nreflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and\ngrowth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of\nmetallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR).\nLow-mass galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR tend to have flat gradients,\nlikely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies.

We use the luminosity density field constructed using 8 Mpc/h\nsmoothing to characterize the large-scale environments and the Bisous model to\nextract the filamentary structures in different large-scale environments. We\nfind differences in the properties of central galaxies and their groups in and\noutside of filaments at fixed halo and large-scale environments. In\nhigh-density environments, the group mass function has higher number densities\nin filaments compared to that outside of filaments towards the massive end. The\nrelation is opposite in low-density environments. At fixed group mass and\nlarge-scale luminosity density, groups in filaments are slightly more luminous\nand their central galaxies have redder colors, higher stellar masses, and lower\nspecific star formation rates than those outside of filaments. However, the\ndifferences in central galaxy and group properties in and outside of filaments\nare not clear in some group mass bins.

We use HST/ACS images of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts\nfrom the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to identify clumps within a 20 kpc\nradius.

The fraction of clumpy galaxies is in the range\n$\\sim35-55\\%$ over $2<z<6$, increasing at higher redshifts, indicating that the\nfraction of irregular galaxies remains high up to the highest redshifts. The\nlarge and bright clumps (M$_{\\star}\\sim10^9$ up to $\\sim10^{10}$M$_\\odot$) are\nfound to reside predominantly in galaxies with two clumps.

We apply a recently developed statistical model for the small\nscale behaviour of the SF relation to predict and interpret the observed\nscatter.

While the log-normal form necessarily ignores\nshort-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the\nmajority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85% of the cumulative SFHs are\nfitted to within a maximum error of 5% of the total stellar mass formed, and\n99% to within 10%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the\ncommonly used delayed-tau model, and is superseded only by functions with more\nthan three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were\nrapidly quenched after becoming satellites.

Strikingly, the\ndynamics of SMBHs differs in the SIDM and reference CDM case.

In this\npaper, we critically examine the evidence for plasma lensing in J1415+1320. We\ncompute limits on the lensing strength, and the associated free-free opacity of\nthe putative plasma lenses. We compare the observed and model ESE light curves,\nand also derive a lower limit on the lens distance based on the effects of\nparallax due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. We conclude that plasma\nlensing is not a viable interpretation for J1415+1320's light curves and that\nsymmetric U-shaped features in the radio light curves of extragalactic sources\ndo not present {\\em prima facie} evidence for ESEs. The methodology presented\nhere is generic enough to be applicable to any plasma lensing candidate. \n\n"}

III Abstract: We present gas kinematics based on the [OIII] $\\lambda$5007 line and their\nconnection to galaxy gravitational potential, active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nenergetics, and star formation, using a large sample of ~110,000 AGNs and\nstar-forming (SF) galaxies at z<0.3. Gas and stellar velocity dispersions are\ncomparable to each other in SF galaxies, indicating that the ionized gas\nkinematics can be accounted by the gravitational potential of host galaxies. In\ncontrast, AGNs clearly show non-gravitational kinematics, which is comparable\nto or stronger than the virial motion caused by the gravitational potential.\nThe [OIII] velocity-velocity dispersion (VVD) diagram dramatically expands\ntoward high values as a function of AGN luminosity, implying that the outflows\nare AGN-driven, while SF galaxies do not show such a trend. We find that the\nfraction of AGNs with a signature of outflow kinematics, steeply increases with\nAGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. In particular, the majority of luminous\nAGNs presents strong non-gravitational kinematics in the [OIII] profile.

Since\nArp 55 is an early/intermediate stage merger while NGC 2623 is a merger\nremnant, the difference in physical conditions may be an indicator of merger\nstage.

The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able to show galactic\nconformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models,\nwhen the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in\nreal space, the mean fraction of quenched galaxies around quenched primary\ngalaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same\nstellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove\nsatellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in\nGALFORM models compared with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is\npartially explained by the fact that in GALFORM once a galaxy becomes a\nsatellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later\ntime in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the\nL-GALAXIES model after removing central galaxies that were ejected from their\nhost halo in the past. Galactic conformity is also influenced by primary\ngalaxies at fixed stellar mass that reside in dark matter haloes of different\nmasses. Finally, we explore a proxy of conformity between distinct haloes. In\nthis case the conformity is weak beyond ~ 3 Mpc/h (<3% in L-GALAXIES, <1-2% in\nGALFORM models). Therefore, it seems difficult that conformity is directly\nrelated with a long-range effect. \n\n"}

This survey consists of \"targeted\" and \"serendipitous\"\nCGM subsamples, originally described in Stocke et al. (2013, Paper 1). The\ntargeted subsample probes low-luminosity, late-type galaxies at $z<0.02$ with\nsmall impact parameters ($\\langle\\rho\\rangle = 71$ kpc), and the serendipitous\nsubsample probes higher luminosity galaxies at $z\\lesssim0.2$ with larger\nimpact parameters ($\\langle\\rho\\rangle = 222$ kpc).

Abstract: Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to trace merger shock fronts.

We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed\ngalaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured\nin the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known\nto date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply\nthe same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock\nrelic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,\nsuggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS\nand mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend\nto be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.\nBesides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio\nrelics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest\nlinear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are\nlargely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations.

Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly\ncorrelates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter.

First, we report a very\nlow covering fraction of H I absorption in the CGM of these cluster galaxies,\nf_c = 25% +25%/-15%, to stringent detection limits (log N(H I) < 13 cm^-2). As\nfield galaxies have an H I covering fraction of ~100% at similar radii, the\ndearth of CGM H I in our data indicates that the cluster environment has\neffectively stripped or overionized the gaseous halos of these cluster\ngalaxies. Second, we assess the contribution of warm-hot (10^5 - 10^6 K) gas to\nthe ICM as traced by O VI and broad Ly-alpha (BLA) absorption. Despite the high\nsignal-to-noise of our data, we do not detect O VI in any cluster, and we only\ndetect BLA features in the QSO spectrum probing one cluster. We estimate that\nthe total column density of warm-hot gas along this line of sight totals to ~3%\nof that contained in the hot T > 10^7 K X-ray emitting phase. Residing at high\nrelative velocities, these features may trace pre-shocked material outside the\ncluster. Comparing gaseous galaxy halos from the low-density 'field' to galaxy\ngroups and high-density clusters, we find that the CGM is progressively\ndepleted of H I with increasing environmental density, and the CGM is most\nseverely transformed in galaxy clusters.

From these assumptions we derive the relationship\nbetween galaxies' bulk properties (gas surface density, stellar content, and\nrotation curve) and their star formation rates, gas velocity dispersions, and\nrates of radial inflow. We show that the turbulence in discs can be powered\nprimarily by star formation feedback, radial transport, or a combination of the\ntwo. In contrast to models that omit either radial transport or star formation\nfeedback, the predictions of this model yield excellent agreement with a wide\nrange of observations, including the star formation law measured in both\nspatially resolved and unresolved data, the correlation between galaxies' star\nformation rates and velocity dispersions, and observed rates of radial inflow.\nThe agreement holds across a wide range of galaxy mass and type, from local\ndwarfs to extreme starbursts to high-redshifts discs.

The cluster-to-star\nratio decreases with increasing metallicity by a factor of 100-1000, at all\ngalactocentric radii and with a slope that does not seem to depend on radius.\nIn dwarf galaxies, the GCs are also more metal-poor than the field stars on\naverage.

We aim to explain these trends by considering various effects that\nmay influence the observed cluster-to-star ratio as a function of metallicity,\nenvironment and cosmological history. We show that both the cluster formation\nefficiency and the maximum cluster mass increase with metallicity, so they\ncannot explain the observed trend. Destruction of GCs by tidal stripping and\ndynamical friction destroy clusters over too small a range of galactocentric\nradii. We show that cluster destruction by tidal shocks from giant molecular\nclouds in the high-density formation environments of GCs becomes increasingly\nefficient towards high galaxy masses and, hence, towards high metallicities.\nThe predicted cluster-to-star ratio decreases by a factor 100-1000 towards high\nmetallicities and should only weakly depend on galactocentric radius due to\norbital mixing during hierarchical galaxy merging, consistent with the\nobservations. The observed, strong dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio on\nmetallicity and the independence of its slope on galactocentric radius can be\nexplained by cluster destruction and hierarchical galaxy growth.

{"id": "1709.00423", "contents": "Title: The Delay Time Distribution of Tidal Disruption Flares Abstract: Recent observations suggest that stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) are\nstrongly overrepresented in rare, post-starburst galaxies. Several dynamical\nmechanisms have been proposed to elevate their TDE rates, ranging from central\nstellar overdensities to the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nbinaries. Another such mechanism, introduced here, is a radial velocity\nanisotropy in the nuclear star cluster produced during the starburst. These,\nand other, dynamical hypotheses can be disentangled by comparing observations\nto theoretical predictions for the TDE delay time distribution (DTD). We show\nthat SMBH binaries are a less plausible solution for the post-starburst\npreference, as they can only reproduce the observed DTD with extensive\nfine-tuning. The overdensity hypothesis produces a reasonable match to the\nobserved DTD (based on the limited data currently available), provided that the\ninitial stellar density profile created during the starburst, $\\rho(r)$, is\nexceptional in both steepness and normalization. In particular, explaining the\npost-starburst preference requires $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma\n\\gtrsim 2.5$, i.e. much steeper than the classic Bahcall-Wolf equilibrium\nprofile of $\\gamma = 7/4$. For \"ultrasteep\" density cusps ($\\gamma \\ge 9/4$),\nwe show that the TDE rate decays with time measured since the starburst as\n$\\dot{N} \\propto t^{-(4\\gamma-9)/(2\\gamma-3)} / \\ln t$. Radial anisotropies\nalso represent a promising explanation, provided that initial anisotropy\nparameters of $\\beta_0 \\approx 0.5$ are sustainable against the radial orbit\ninstability.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

The sample's\ndiversity---passive to vigorously starforming; stellar masses $\\log\nM_*/M_\\odot=10.5$ to $11.2$---enables us to draw spatio-temporal inferences\nrelevant to key areas of parameter space (Milky Way- to super-Andromeda-mass\nprogenitors). Specifically, we find signs that bulge mass-fractions ($B/T$) and\nSF history shapes/spatial uniformity are linked, such that higher $B/T$s\ncorrelate with \"inside-out growth\" and central specific SFRs that peaked above\nthe global average for all starforming galaxies at that epoch. Conversely, the\nsystem with the lowest $B/T$ had a flat, spatially uniform SFH with normal peak\nactivity. Both findings are consistent with models positing a feedback-driven\nconnection between bulge formation and the switch from rising to falling SFRs\n(\"quenching\").

The best-fitting halo mass and concentration\nparameters scatter by 25% and 40% around their input values, respectively, when\ndark matter particles are used as tracers. This scatter becomes as large as a\nfactor of 3 when using star particles instead. This is significantly larger\nthan the estimated statistical uncertainty associated with the use of the SJE.\nThe existence of correlated phase-space structures that violate the steady\nstate assumption of the SJE as well as non-spherical geometries are the\nprincipal sources of the scatter. Binary haloes show larger scatter because\nthey are more aspherical in shape and have a more perturbed dynamical state.\nOur results confirm the previous study of Wang et al. (2017) that the number of\nindependent phase-space structures sets an intrinsic limiting precision on\ndynamical inferences based on the steady state assumption. Modelling with a\nradius-independent velocity anisotropy, or using tracers within a limited outer\nradius, result in significantly larger scatter, but the ensemble-averaged\nmeasurement over the whole halo sample is approximately unbiased. \n\n"}

In this\nwork, we correlate our composite SFR determinations with archival HCN, HCO$^+$,\nand CO observations, resulting in a sample of nine reasonably representative\nGMCs. We find that, at the scale of individual clouds, it is important to take\ninto account both obscured and unobscured star formation to determine the SFR.\nWhen correlated against the dense-gas mass from HCN, we find that the SFR is\nlow, in spite of these refinements. We nevertheless retrieve an SFR - dense-gas\nmass correlation, confirming that these SFR tracers are still meaningful on GMC\nscales. The correlation improves markedly when we consider the HCN/CO ratio\ninstead of HCN by itself. This nominally indicates a dependency of the SFR on\nthe dense-gas fraction, in contradiction to local studies. However, we\nhypothesize that this partly reflects the limited dynamic range in dense-gas\nmass, and partly that the ratio of single-pointing HCN and CO measurements may\nbe less prone to systematics like sidelobes.

Here, we\ninvestigate the combined effect of gas angular momentum and radiation feedback\non the accretion flow, by performing 2D axially symmetric radiation\nhydrodynamics simulations that solve the flow structure across the Bondi radius\nand the outer part of the accretion disc simultaneously.

We\ndemonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to\nexplain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at >~100 kpc to\noffset the energy radiated by the cooling gas.

Approximately after half of the\nlight curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nlag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is\naccompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to\nunderstand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby\nincreasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet\ncontinua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet\nvariations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling\ncorona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational\nfacts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and\nionization energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the\nX-ray and the ultraviolet variations change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous\nbehavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the expectation from disk\nreprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the\nanomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk\nreprocessing albeit with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time\nlag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing of the broad line region gas.\nAs NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad line\nregion gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing.

These can be seen as a splitting or spread in the\nsub-giant and red giant branches (SGB and RGB) when certain photometric filter\ncombinations are used. Due to its relative youth, NGC 1978 can be used to place\nstringent limits on whether multiple bursts of star-formation have taken place\nwithin the cluster, as predicted by some models for the origin of multiple\npopulations. We carry out two distinct analyses to test whether multiple\nstar-formation epochs have occurred within NGC 1978. First, we use UV CMDs to\nselect stars from the first and second population along the SGB, and then\ncompare their positions in optical CMDs, where the morphology is dominantly\ncontrolled by age as opposed to multiple population effects.

Due to\ntheir different ages and different positions in phase space, different streams\ntell us different things about the Galaxy. Here we employ a Cramer--Rao (CRLB)\nor Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in\neleven known streams (ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D,\nPS1E, Sangarius and Triangulum). This approach depends on a generative model,\nwhich we have developed previously, and which permits calculation of\nderivatives of predicted stream properties with respect to Galaxy and stream\nparameters. We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on\neccentric orbits contain the most information about the halo shape. For each\nstream, there are near-degeneracies between dark-matter-halo properties and\nparameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor, but simultaneous\nfitting of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level.\nAt this precision, simulated dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic\nparametrizations, so we add an expansion of basis functions to give the\ngravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information\nabout the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current\nposition of the stream. In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream\nappears to measure the local acceleration at its current position; this\nmotivates thinking about future non-parametric approaches. The CRLB formalism\nalso permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar\nvelocities, distances, and proper motions. We show that kinematic measurements\nof stream stars are essential for producing competitive constraints on the\ndistribution of dark matter, which bodes well for stream studies in the age of\nGaia. \n\n"}

In addition to the listed random errors, each\ncomponent has an additional residual systematic error of 16 $\\mu$as yr$^{-1}$.\nThese results are consistent at 0.8$\\sigma$ and 1.0$\\sigma$ with the (2 and 3\ntimes higher-accuracy) measurements already available from Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) optical imaging and VLBA water maser observations,\nrespectively.

We also find that the optimum models have high levels\nof stellar feedback which create large holes similar to those observed in M33,\nwhilst lower levels of feedback tend to produce a large amount of small scale\nstructure, and undisturbed long filaments of high surface density gas, hardly\ndetected in the M33 disc. The gas component appears to have a significant role\nin producing the structure, so if there is little feedback, both the gas and\nstars organise into clear spiral arms, likely due to a lower combined $Q$\n(using gas and stars), and the ready ability of cold gas to undergo spiral\nshocks. By contrast models with higher feedback have weaker spiral structure,\nespecially in the stellar component, compared to grand design galaxies. We did\nnot see a large difference in the behaviour of $Q_{stars}$ with most of these\nmodels, however, because $Q_{stars}$ stayed relatively constant unless the disc\nwas more strongly unstable.

In contrast, the spatial correlation\nbetween the interstellar molecular cloud and the TeV gamma rays is poor in the\nsoutheastern shell of the SNR. We argue that this poor correlation can be\nattributed to the low-energy cosmic rays (~ 1 TeV) not penetrating into the\ndense molecular cloud due to an enhancement of the turbulent magnetic field\naround the dense cloud of ~ 10-100 $\\mu$G.

This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty\nsystems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early\nUniverse was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward\nevolution galaxy model described by Casey et al.

We test the\nperformance of DL models, trained with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, on\nDark Energy survey (DES) using images for a sample of $\\sim$5000 galaxies with\na similar redshift distribution to SDSS. Applying the models directly to DES\ndata provides a reasonable global accuracy ($\\sim$ 90%), but small completeness\nand purity values. A fast domain adaptation step, consisting in a further\ntraining with a small DES sample of galaxies ($\\sim$500-300), is enough for\nobtaining an accuracy > 95% and a significant improvement in the completeness\nand purity values. This demonstrates that, once trained with a particular\ndataset, machines can quickly adapt to new instrument characteristics (e.g.,\nPSF, seeing, depth), reducing by almost one order of magnitude the necessary\ntraining sample for morphological classification. Redshift evolution effects or\nsignificant depth differences are not taken into account in this study. \n\n"}

SNe that are randomly\ndistributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because\nmost supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of\nthe disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These\nenergetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject\nsubstantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star\nformation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by\nthe SNe, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the\nsurroundings.

We compute three-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for every\npossible pair of type II and anomalous Cepheids with classical Cepheids, and RR\nLyr stars. We confirm that BL Her stars are as old as RR Lyr variable stars -\ntheir spatial distributions are similar, and they create a vast halo around\nboth galaxies.

Hence, it\nseems that these similarities are related to the concentration of these stars\nin the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the lack of a vast halo. This\nleads to the conclusion that W Vir variables could be a mixture of old and\nintermediate-age stars. Our analysis of the three-dimensional distributions of\nanomalous Cepheids shows that they differ significantly from classical\nCepheids.

While the binary fraction of\nmassive stars is significant, inferences are often based upon models\nincorporating only single-star evolution.

However, this critical timescale, often referred to as the\nquasar lifetime, is still uncertain by orders of magnitude ($t_{\\rm Q} \\simeq\n0.01\\,{\\rm Myr} - 1\\,{\\rm Gyr}$). Absorption spectra of quasars exhibiting\ntransmission in the He II Ly$\\alpha$ forest provide a unique opportunity to\nmake precise measurements of the quasar lifetime. Indeed, the size of a\nquasar's He II proximity zone, the region near the quasar itself where its own\nradiation dramatically alters the ionization state of the surrounding\nintergalactic medium (IGM), depends sensitively on its lifetime for $t_{\\rm\nQ}\\lesssim 30$ Myr, comparable to the expected $e$-folding time-scale for SMBH\ngrowth $t_{\\rm S}=45$ Myr. In this study we compare the sizes of He II\nproximity zones in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra of 6 z~4 quasars to\ntheoretical models generated by post-processing cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations with $1$D radiative transfer algorithm.

Identifying new factors which correlate with the\nvariation is essential to probe the underlying physical processes. Combining\n~ten years long quasar light curves from SDSS stripe 82 and X-ray data from\nStripe 82X, we build a sample of X-ray detected quasars to investigate the\nrelation between UV/optical variation amplitude ($\\sigma_{rms}$) and X-ray\nloudness. We find that quasars with more intense X-ray radiation (com- pared to\nbolometric luminosity) are more variable in UV/optical. Such correlation\nremains highly significant after excluding the effect of other parameters\nincluding luminosity, black hole mass, Ed- dington ratio, redshift, rest-frame\nwavelength (i.e., through partial correlation analyses).

We derive analytically the\nconnections between the parameters of the observed quasar luminosity functions\nand galaxy mass functions. The $(m_{\\rm bh}/m_{*})_{Qing}$ associated with\nquenching is given by the ratio of the global black hole accretion rate density\n(BHARD) and star-formation rate density (SFRD) at the epoch in question.\nObservational data on the SFRD and BHARD suggests $(m_{\\rm bh}/m_{*})_{Qing}\n\\propto (1+z)^{1.5}$ below redshift 2. This evolution reproduces the observed\nmass-luminosity plane of SDSS quasars, and also reproduces the local $m_{\\rm\nbh}/m_{*}$ relation in passive galaxies.

Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and\ncentrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a\nprolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation.

This study can proceed only with the detailed\ninvestigation of individual targets.\n  We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic optical data analysis of Mkn\n848, a complex system consisting of two merging galaxies at z~0.04 that are\nseparated 7.5 kpc (projected distance). Motivated by the presence of a\nmulti-phase outflow in the north-west system revealed by the SDSS integrated\nspectrum, we analysed the publicly available MaNGA data, which cover almost the\nentire merging system, to study the physical properties of cool and warm gas in\ndetail.\n  Galaxy-wide outflowing gas in multiple phases is revealed for the first time\nin the two merging galaxies. We also detect spatially resolved resonant NaID\nemission associated with the outflows. The derived outflow energetics may be\nconsistent with a scenario in which both winds are accelerated by stellar\nprocesses and AGN activity, although we favour an AGN origin given the high\noutflow velocities and the ionisation conditions observed in the outflow\nregions. Deeper observations are required, however, to better constrain the\nnature of these multi-phase outflows. Outflow energetics in the north-west\nsystem are strongly different between the ionised and atomic gas components,\nthe latter of which is associated with mass outflow rate and kinetic and\nmomentum powers that are 1-2 dex higher; those associated with the south-east\ngalaxy are instead similar.\n  Strong kp-scale outflows are revealed in an ongoing merger system, suggesting\nthat feedback can potentially impact the host galaxy even in the early merger\nphases. The characterisation of the neutral and ionised gas phases has proved\nto be crucial for a comprehensive study of the outflow phenomena. \n\n"}

We measure both the stellar-based quantities used to establish the\n$z=0$ correlations, as well as the gas-based quantities available in $z \\gtrsim\n6$ observations, adopting the same assumptions and techniques used in\nobservational studies. The high-redshift studies argued that MBHs at high\nredshift deviate from the local MBH-galaxy correlations. In our analysis of the\nsingle galaxy we evolve, we find that the high-redshift population sits on the\nsame correlations as the local one, when using the same tracers used at $z=0$.\nWhen using the gas-based tracers, however, MBHs appear to be over-massive. The\ndiscrepancy between local and high-redshift MBHs seems caused by the different\ntracers employed, and necessary assumptions, and not by an intrinsic\ndifference. Better calibration of the tracers, higher resolution data and\navailability of facilities that can probe the stellar population will be\ncrucial to assess precisely and accurately high-redshift quasar hosts. \n\n"}

Our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that of previous\nstudies, and extends to much larger radial distances. These are the first\nresults presented that make use of the newly installed Southern APOGEE\ninstrument on the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Our unbiased\nsample of the LMC spans a large range in metallicity, from [Fe/H]=-0.2 to very\nmetal-poor stars with [Fe/H]=-2.5, the most metal-poor Magellanic Clouds (MCs)\nstars detected to date. The LMC [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution is very flat\nover a large metallicity range, but rises by ~0.1 dex at -1.0<[Fe/H]<-0.5. We\ninterpret this as a sign of the known recent increase in MC star-formation\nactivity, and are able to reproduce the pattern with a chemical evolution model\nthat includes a recent \"starburst\". At the metal-poor end, we capture the\nincrease of [alpha/Fe] with decreasing [Fe/H], and constrain the \"alpha-knee\"\nto [Fe/H]<-2.2 in both MCs, implying a low star-formation efficiency of ~0.01\nGyr^-1. The MC knees are more metal poor than those of less massive Milky Way\n(MW) dwarf galaxies such as Fornax, Sculptor, or Sagittarius.

Within each zone we compute\nthe mean observed galaxy properties including specific star formation rate,\nluminosity-weighted age, stellar metallicity and [alpha/Fe] abundance ratio. By\ncomparing galaxies in different zones, we inspect how shifting the mean infall\ntime from recent infallers (mean T_inf < 3 Gyr) to ancient infallers (mean\nT_inf > 5 Gyr) impacts galaxy properties at fixed stellar and halo mass.\nAncient infallers are more quenched, and the impact of environmental quenching\nis visible down to low host masses (< group masses). Meanwhile, the quenching\nof recent infallers is weakly dependent on host mass, indicating they have yet\nto respond strongly to their current environment. [alpha/Fe] and especially\nmetallicity are less dependent on host mass, but show a dependence on mean\nT_inf. We discuss these results in the context of longer exposure times for\nancient infallers to environmental effects, which grow more efficient in hosts\nwith a deeper potential well and a denser intracluster medium. We also compare\nour satellites with a control field sample, and find that even the most recent\ninfallers (mean T_inf < 2 Gyr) are more quenched than field galaxies, in\nparticular for cluster mass hosts.

In this\ncontext the complex spatial structure evident, e.g., in spiral galaxies is\nunderstood either in terms of instabilities of quasi-stationary states, or a\nresult of dissipative non-gravitational interactions. We illustrate here, using\nnumerical simulations, that purely self-gravitating systems evolving from quite\nsimple initial configurations can in fact give rise easily to structures of\nthis kind of which the lifetime can be large compared to the dynamical\ncharacteristic time, but short compared to the collisional relaxation time\nscale. More specifically, for a broad range of non-spherical and non-uniform\nrotating initial conditions, gravitational relaxation gives rise quite\ngenerically to long-lived non-stationary structures of a rich variety,\ncharacterized by spiral-like arms, bars and even ring-like structures in\nspecial cases. These structures are a feature of the intrinsically\nout-of-equilibrium nature of the system's collapse, associated with a part of\nthe system's mass while the bulk is well virialized. They are characterized by\npredominantly radial motions in their outermost parts, but also incorporate an\nextended flattened region which rotates coherently about a well virialized core\nof triaxial shape with an approximately isotropic velocity dispersion. We\ndiscuss the possible relevance of these simple toy models to the observed\nstructure of real galaxies emphasizing the difference between dissipative and\ndissipationless disc formation. \n\n"}

Discovery of a\n  nearby 120{\\deg} stellar stream in Gaia DR2 Abstract: We report the discovery of a large, dynamically cold, coeval stellar stream\nthat is currently traversing the immediate solar neighborhood at a distance of\nonly 100 pc. The structure was identified in a wavelet decomposition of the 3D\nvelocity space of all stars within 300 pc to the Sun. Its members form a highly\nelongated structure with a length of at least 400 pc, while its vertical extent\nmeasures only about 50 pc. Stars in the stream are not isotropically\ndistributed but instead form two parallel lanes with individual local\noverdensities, that may correspond to a remnant core of a tidally disrupted\ncluster or OB association. Its members follow a very well-defined main sequence\nin the observational Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and also show a remarkably low\n3D velocity dispersion of only 1.3 km s$^{-1}$. These findings strongly suggest\na common origin as a single coeval stellar population. An extrapolation of the\npresent-day mass function indicates a total mass of at least 2000 M$_\\odot$,\nmaking it larger than most currently known clusters or associations in the\nsolar neighborhood.

Here we show that the inclusion of turbulent densities with\ndifferent statistical properties has significant effects on the evolution of\nwind-swept clouds. We investigate how the initial standard deviation of the\nlog-normal density field influences the dynamics of quasi-isothermal clouds\nembedded in supersonic winds. We compare uniform, fractal solenoidal, and\nfractal compressive cloud models in both 3D and 2D hydrodynamical simulations.\nWe find that the processes of cloud disruption and dense gas entrainment are\nfunctions of the initial density distribution in the cloud. Fractal clouds\naccelerate, mix, and are disrupted earlier than uniform clouds. Within the\nfractal cloud sample, compressive clouds retain high-density nuclei, so they\nare more confined, less accelerated, and have lower velocity dispersions than\ntheir solenoidal counterparts. Compressive clouds are also less prone to\nKelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, so they survive longer than\nsolenoidal clouds. By comparing the cloud properties at the destruction time,\nwe find that dense gas entrainment is more effective in uniform clouds than in\neither of the fractal clouds, and it is more effective in solenoidal than in\ncompressive models. In contrast, mass loading into the wind is more efficient\nin compressive cloud models than in uniform or solenoidal models. Overall, wide\ndensity distributions lead to inefficient entrainment, but they facilitate mass\nloading and favour the survival of very dense gas in hot galactic winds. \n\n"}

However, it has recently become clear\nthat the simulations are subject to numerical artefacts, which hampers a proper\ntreatment of the tidal evolution of subhaloes. Unfortunately, no analytical\nmodels that accurately describe subhalo evolution exist either. We therefore\npresent a library of idealized, high resolution $N$-body simulations of the\ntidal evolution of individual subhaloes that can be used to calibrate\nsemi-analytical models and to complement cosmological simulations. The\nsimulations focus on minor mergers, i.e., the mass of the subhalo is much\nsmaller than that of the host halo, such that the impact of dynamical friction\nis negligible. This setup allows the adoption of a fixed analytical potential\nfor modelling the host halo. The dynamical evolution of subhaloes is followed\nwith $N$-body computations. In the library, four parameters, two of which\ncharacterize the subhalo orbit with respect to the host halo, and the two\nconcentrations of the host- and subhalo, are varied over the ranges encountered\nin cosmological simulations.
