Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial\ndimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion\nmodifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring\nof the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the\nouter radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We\nconjecture that torsion produced by spin prevents the formation of\nsingularities from matter composed of quarks and leptons. We expect that the\nCartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces an effective ultraviolet\ncutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS spacetime.

Twin matter is\nhypothetical matter that might couple directly only to the second metric of the\ntheory. Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive\ninteractions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,\nin turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes\nof one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to\nefficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to\nconstrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons\nas a diverging lens.

{"id": "1006.3348", "contents": "Title: Conceptual problems in detecting the evolution of dark energy when using\n  distance measurements Abstract: Dark energy is now one of the most important and topical problems in\ncosmology. The first step to reveal its nature is to detect the evolution of\ndark energy or to prove beyond doubt that the cosmological constant is indeed\nconstant. However, in the standard approach to cosmology, the Universe is\ndescribed by the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann models. Here we show that\nin the perturbed universe (even if perturbations vanish if averaged over\nsufficiently large scales) the distance-redshift relation is not the same as in\nthe unperturbed universe. This has a serious consequence when studying the\nnature of dark energy and, as shown here, can impair the analysis and studies\nof dark energy. The analysis is based on two methods: the linear lensing\napproximation and the non-linear Szekeres Swiss-Cheese model. The inhomogeneity\nscale is ~50 Mpc, and both models have the same density fluctuations along the\nline of sight. The comparison between linear and non-linear methods shows that\nnon-linear corrections are not negligible. When inhomogeneities are present the\ndistance changes by several percent. To show how this change influences the\nmeasurements of dark energy, ten future observations with 2% uncertainties are\ngenerated. It is shown the using the standard methods (i.e. under the\nassumption of homogeneity) the systematics due to inhomogeneities can distort\nour analysis, and may lead to a conclusion that dark energy evolves when in\nfact it is constant (or vice versa). Therefore, if future observations are\nanalysed only within the homogeneous framework then the impact of\ninhomogeneities (such as voids and superclusters) can be mistaken for evolving\ndark energy. Since the robust distinction between the evolution and\nnon-evolution of dark energy is the first step to understanding the nature of\ndark energy a proper handling of inhomogeneities is essential. \n\n"}

Unitarity\nis borne out by the detailed exclusive S-matrix amplitudes. There, the fixing\nof generic out-states, in addition to the in-state, yields in asymptotic\nMinkowski space-time saddle-point contributions which are dominated by\nPlanckian metric fluctuations when approaching the Schwarzschild radius.

If M is linearly ordered by <, we will say that the\nlinear ordering (M,<) characterizes kappa. It is known that if kappa is\ncharacterizable, then kappa plus is characterizable by a linear ordering. Also,\nif kappa is characterizable by a dense linear ordering with an increasing\nsequence of size kappa, then 2^kappa is characterizable. We show that if kappa\nis homogeneously characterizable, then kappa is characterizable by a dense\nlinear ordering, while the converse fails.\n  The main theorems are: 1) If kappa>2^lambda is a characterizable cardinal,\nlambda is characterizable by a dense linear ordering and lambda is the least\ncardinal such that kappa^lambda>kappa, then kappa^lambda is also\ncharacterizable, 2) if aleph_alpha and kappa^(aleph_alpha) are characterizable\ncardinals, then the same is true for kappa^(aleph_(alpha+beta)), for all\ncountable beta.

It has\nbeen shown that gravitational waves have a nonlinear memory, displacing test\nmasses permanently. This is called the Christodoulou memory. We proved that the\nelectromagnetic field contributes at highest order to the nonlinear memory\neffect of gravitational waves, enlarging the permanent displacement of test\nmasses. In experiments like LISA or LIGO which measure distances of test\nmasses, the Christodoulou memory will manifest itself as a permanent\ndisplacement of these objects. It has been suggested to detect the\nChristodoulou memory effect using radio telescopes investigating small changes\nin pulsar's pulse arrival times. The latter experiments are based on\npresent-day technology and measure changes in frequency. In the present paper,\nwe study the electromagnetic Christodoulou memory effect and compute it for\nbinary neutron star mergers. These are typical sources of gravitational\nradiation. During these processes, not only mass and momenta are radiated away\nin form of gravitational waves, but also very strong magnetic fields are\nproduced and radiated away.

The small-scale nature of spacetime can be tested with observations of\ndistant quasars. We comment on a recent paper by Tamburini et al.

If space is foamy on the Planck scale, photons emitted from distant\nobjects will accumulate uncertainties in distance and propagation directions\nthus affecting the expected angular size of a compact object as a function of\nredshift. We discuss the geometry of foamy spacetime, and the appropriate\ndistance measure for calculating the expected angular broadening. We also\naddress the mechanics of carrying out such a test. We draw upon our previously\npublished work on this subject (Christiansen et al. 2011), which carried out\nsimilar tests as Tamburini et al. and also went considerably beyond their work\nin several respects.\n  Results. When calculating the path taken by photons as they travel from a\ndistant source to Earth, one must use the comoving distance rather than the\nluminosity distance. This then also becomes the appropriate distance to use\nwhen calculating the angular broadening expected in a distant source. The use\nof the wrong distance measure causes Tamburini et al. to overstate the\nconstraints that can be placed on models of spacetime foam.

Given the variation of the shape of the point-spread\nfunction (PSF) on the chip, as well as observation-specific factors, it is\nimportant to select carefully -- and document -- the comparison stars used as\nwell as the methods used to compute the Strehl ratio. \n\n"}

A fraction of these are\nlikely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of\nstellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular\nevolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with\nhighly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly\naffected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at\nthe highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission\nbecomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and\ncoalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than\nsimilar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of\nSMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of\nbinaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries\nwould be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation\nof GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging\nbinaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still\nvery eccentric (e>~0.5).

A suitable interaction between dark energy and dark matter\nis taken into account in order to at least alleviate (if not solve) the cosmic\ncoincidence problem.

We explore this theme by\ncomputing the (scalar or electromagnetic) self-force when the body is a\nspherical ball of perfect fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, under the\nassumption that its rest-mass density and pressure are related by a polytropic\nequation of state. The body is strongly self-gravitating, and all computations\nare performed in exact general relativity. The dependence on internal structure\nis best revealed by expanding the self-force in powers of 1/r, with r denoting\nthe radial position of the charge outside the body. To the leading order, the\nself-force scales as 1/r^3 and depends only on the square of the charge and the\nbody's mass; the leading self-force is universal. The dependence on internal\nstructure is seen at the next order, 1/r^5, through a structure factor that\ndepends on the equation of state. We compute this structure factor for\nrelativistic polytropes, and show that for a fixed mass, it increases linearly\nwith the body's radius in the case of the scalar self-force, and quadratically\nwith the body's radius in the case of the electromagnetic self-force.

Motivated by geometric\nquantization, we generalize a previous axiomatic characterization of classical\nlinear bosonic field theory to include the fermionic case. We proceed to\ndescribe the quantization scheme, combining a Fock space quantization for state\nspaces with the Feynman path integral for amplitudes. We show rigorously that\nthe resulting quantum theory satisfies the axioms of the TQFT, in a version\ngeneralized to include fermionic theories. In the bosonic case we show the\nequivalence to a previously developed holomorphic quantization scheme.\nRemarkably, it turns out that consistency in the fermionic case requires state\nspaces to be Krein spaces rather than Hilbert spaces. This is also supported by\narguments from geometric quantization and by the explicit example of the Dirac\nfield theory. Contrary to intuition from the standard formulation of quantum\ntheory, we show that this is compatible with a consistent probability\ninterpretation in the GBF. Another surprise in the fermionic case is the\nemergence of an algebraic notion of time, already in the classical theory, but\ninherited by the quantum theory. As in earlier work we need to impose an\nintegrability condition in the bosonic case for all TQFT axioms to hold, due to\nthe gluing anomaly. In contrast, we are able to renormalize this gluing anomaly\nin the fermionic case. \n\n"}

The theory predicts the existence of a\nlong-range scalar field, which passes the Solar System observational\nconstraints, even if the scalar field is very light, and modifies the\ncosmological and galactic dynamics. Thus, the theory opens new possibilities to\napproach, in the same theoretical framework, the problems of both dark energy\nand dark matter. In this work, we consider the generalized virial theorem in\nthe scalar-tensor representation of the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. More\nspecifically, taking into account the relativistic collisionless Boltzmann\nequation, we show that the supplementary geometric terms in the gravitational\nfield equations provide an effective contribution to the gravitational\npotential energy. We show that the total virial mass is proportional to the\neffective mass associated with the new terms generated by the effective scalar\nfield, and the baryonic mass.

Abstract: Given a solar luminosity L_Ar = 0.75 L_0 at the beginning of the Archean 3.8\nGyr ago, where L_0 is the present-day one, if the heliocentric distance r of\nthe Earth was r_Ar = 0.956 r_0, the solar irradiance would have been as large\nas I_Ar = 0.82 I_0. It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial\nsurface which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical\nevidence. By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently\ndisplaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the\nirradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr\nto 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \\dot r/r \\simeq 3.4 x\n10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required. Although such a figure is roughly of the\nsame order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar =\n1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out\ncosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate.\nInstead, a class of modified theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling\nbetween the matter and the metric naturally predicts a secular variation of the\nrelative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially\nviable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit.\nAnother competing mechanism of classical origin which could, in principle,\nallow for the desired effect is the mass loss which either the Sun or the Earth\nitself may have experienced during the Archean. On the one hand, this implies\nthat our planet should have lost 2% of its present mass in the form of\neroded/evaporated hydrosphere which, thus, should have been two orders of\nmagnitude larger than now. On the other hand, it is widely believed that the\nSun could have lost mass at an enhanced rate due to a stronger solar wind in\nthe past for not more than \\sim 0.2-0.3 Gyr. \n\n"}

We monitor the\ndirection of the jet axis through its inclination and position angles. We\ndecompose the variation of the inclination of the inner 2 milliarcseconds of\nthe jet of S5 1928+738 into a periodic term with amplitude of ~0.89 deg and a\nlinear decreasing trend with rate of ~0.05 deg/yr. We also decompose the\nvariation of the position angle into a periodic term with amplitude of ~3.39\ndeg and a linear increasing trend with rate of ~0.24 deg/yr.

In contrast, MOND provides a unique and\npredictively successful description of galaxy dynamics, but is mute on the\nsubject of cosmology.

Relatively little effort has been devoted\nto the formation of structure in MOND; I review some of what has been done. The\namplitude ratio of the first to second peak in the CMB power spectrum was\ncorrectly predicted a priori, but the third peak is more natural to LCDM.

Here we consider the\ngravitational wave energy flux at infinity from a point particle in a circular\norbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, which is known to 22PN beyond the\nlowest-order Newtonian prediction, at which point each order has over 1000\nterms. We introduce a factorization that considerably simplifies the spherical\nharmonic modes of the energy flux (and thus also the amplitudes of the\nspherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waves); it is likely that much of\nthe complexity this factorization removes is due to curved-space wave\npropagation (e.g., tail effects). For the modes with azimuthal number l of 7 or\ngreater, this factorization reduces the expressions for the modes that enter\nthe 22PN total energy flux to pure integer PN series with rational\ncoefficients, which amounts to a reduction of up to a factor of ~150 in the\ntotal number of terms in a given mode. The reduction in complexity becomes less\ndramatic for smaller l, due to the structure of the expansion, though the\nfactorization is still able to remove all the half-integer PN terms. For the\n22PN l = 2 modes, this factorization still reduces the total number of terms\n(and size) by a factor of ~10 and gives purely rational coefficients through\n8PN. This factorization also improves the convergence of the series, though we\nfind the exponential resummation introduced for the full energy flux by Isoyama\net al. to be even more effective at improving the convergence of the individual\nmodes, producing improvements of over four orders of magnitude over the\noriginal series for some modes. However, the exponential resummation is not as\neffective at simplifying the series, particularly for the higher-order modes. \n\n"}

The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\". We would like to show that practically\nany aspect of the cosmological evolution is tightly bound to the deceleration\nparameter. \n\n"}

It is well-known that applying the\nEinstein's equations and spatial averaging do not commute and lead to the\naveraging problem. For the MG formalism applied to the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, this gives an extra\ndynamical term encapsulated as an averaging density parameter denoted\n$\\Omega_A$. An exact isotropic cosmological solution of MG for the flat FLRW\nmetric is already known in the literature, we derive here an anisotropic exact\nsolution. Using the isotropic solution, we compare the expansion history to\ncurrent data of distances to supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, CMB last\nscattering surface, and Hubble constant measurements, and find $-0.05 \\le\n\\Omega_A \\le 0.07$ (at the 95% CL). For the flat metric case this reduces to\n$-0.03 \\le \\Omega_A \\le 0.05$. We also find that the inclusion of this term in\nthe fits can shift the values of the usual cosmological parameters by a few to\nseveral percents. Next, we derive an equation for the growth rate of large\nscale structure in MG that includes a term due to the averaging and compare it\nto that of the LCDM concordance model. We find that an $\\Omega_A$ of an\namplitude range within the bounds above leads to a relative deviation of the\ngrowth from that of the LCDM of up to 2-4% at late times. Thus, the shift in\nthe growth could be of comparable amplitude to that caused by similar changes\nin cosmological parameters like the dark energy density parameter or its\nequation of state. The effect could also be comparable in amplitude to some\nsystematic effects considered for future surveys. This indicates that the\naveraging term and its possible effect need to be tightly constrained in future\nprecision cosmological studies. (Abridged) \n\n"}

The correction to the\ntensor spectrum is limited to the very long wavelength modes, therefore the\nresulting observable CMB B-mode polarization spectrum remains practically the\nsame as in the standard scenario with flat spatial sections. However, since\nboth the tensor and scalar power spectra are modified, there are scale\ndependent corrections to the tensor-to-scalar ratio that lead to violation of\nthe standard slow-roll consistency relation. \n\n"}

We start by defining the action of a disformal\ntransformation in the tangent space. Then, we take advantage of the great\neconomy of means of the language of differential forms to compute the full\ntransformation of Horndeski's theory under general disformal transformations.\nWe obtain that Horndeski's action maps onto itself modulo a reduced set of\nnon-Horndeski Lagrangians. These new Lagrangians are found to be invariant\nunder disformal transformation that depend only in the first derivatives of the\nscalar. Moreover, these combinations of Lagrangians precisely appear when\nexpressing in our basis the constraints of the recently proposed Extended\nScalar-Tensor (EST) theories. These results allow us to classify the different\norbits of scalar-tensor theories invariant under particular disformal\ntransformations, namely the special disformal, kinetic disformal and disformal\nHorndeski orbits.

We apply the canonical transformation framework to formulate\ngeometrodynamics as a gauge theory. The starting point of our paper is\nconstituted by the general De~Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian of a system of scalar and\nvector fields, which is supposed to be form-invariant under (global) Lorentz\ntransformations. Following the reasoning of gauge theories, the corresponding\nlocally form-invariant system is worked out by means of canonical\ntransformations. The canonical transformation approach ensures by construction\nthat the form of the action functional is maintained. We thus encounter amended\nHamiltonian systems which are form-invariant under arbitrary spacetime\ntransformations. This amended system complies with the general principle of\nrelativity and describes both, the dynamics of the given physical system's\nfields and their coupling to those quantities which describe the dynamics of\nthe spacetime geometry. In this way, it is unambiguously determined how spin-0\nand spin-1 fields couple to the dynamics of spacetime.\n  A term that describes the dynamics of the free gauge fields must finally be\nadded to the amended Hamiltonian, as common to all gauge theories, to allow for\na dynamic spacetime geometry.

The asymptotic symmetries are spanned\nby an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\\hat{u}(1)$\ncurrents of electric and magnetic type.

The entropy of flat cosmological\nspacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state\ncorresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the\ncanonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the\nground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\\hat{u}(1)$ charge.

One possible\nmodification to General Relativity is the gravitational parity violation that\ngives rise to the amplitude birefringence in gravitational waves, where one of\nthe circularly-polarized mode is amplified while the other one is suppressed\nduring their propagation. In this paper, we study how well one can measure\ngravitational parity violation via the amplitude birefringence of gravitational\nwaves from stellar-mass black hole binaries. We choose Chern-Simons gravity as\nan example and work within an effective field theory formalism. We consider\ngravitational waves from both individual sources and stochastic gravitational\nwave backgrounds. Regarding bounds from individual sources, we estimate them\nusing a Fisher analysis and carry out Monte Carlo simulations by randomly\ndistributing sources over their sky location and binary orientation. We find\nthat the bounds on the scalar field evolution in Chern-Simons gravity from\nGW150914 are too weak to satisfy the weak Chern-Simons approximation, while\naLIGO with its design sensitivity can place meaningful bounds. Regarding bounds\nfrom stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, we set the threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio for detection of the parity-violation mode as 5 and\nestimate projected bounds with future detectors assuming that signals are\nconsistent with no parity violation. We find that a network of two\nthird-generation detectors is able to place bounds that are slightly stronger\nthan current binary pulsar bounds. Since gravitational wave observations probe\neither the difference in parity violation between the source and the detector\nor the line-of-sight integration of the scalar field, such bounds are\ncomplementary to local measurements from solar system experiments and binary\npulsar observations. \n\n"}

We consider the light\ndeflection of a point-like lens and impose that the two Schwarzschild-like\nmetrics with and without the lens are identical at infinite distances from the\nlens. The energy conservation law implies that the parameter $\\gamma$ in the\nlinear term of the metric has to vanish, otherwise the two metrics are\nphysically inaccessible from each other. This linear term is responsible to\nmimic the role of dark matter in disk galaxies and gravitational lensing\nsystems. Our analysis shows that removing the need of dark matter with CG thus\nrelies on a fine-tuning condition on $\\gamma$. We also illustrate why the\nresults of previous investigations of gravitational lensing in CG largely\ndisagree. These discrepancies derive from the erroneous use of the deflection\nangle definition adopted in General Relativity, where the vacuum solution is\nasymptotically flat, unlike CG. In addition, the lens mass is identified with\nvarious combinations of the metric parameters.

Here we systematize and extend previous work\nof our group, in which it is assumed that a mass scale $\\Lambda$ is dynamically\ngenerated in the infrared, giving rise to nonlocal terms in the quantum\neffective action of gravity. We give a detailed discussion of conceptual\naspects related to nonlocal gravity and of the cosmological consequences of\nthese models. The requirement of providing a viable cosmological evolution\nseverely restricts the form of the nonlocal terms, and selects a model (the\nso-called RR model) that corresponds to a dynamical mass generation for the\nconformal mode. For such a model: (1) there is a FRW background evolution,\nwhere the nonlocal term acts as an effective dark energy with a phantom\nequation of state, providing accelerated expansion without a cosmological\nconstant.

Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of BHNS undergoing merger we showed that a magnetically--driven jet\ncan be launched by the remnant if the NS is endowed with a dipole B field\nextending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. These\nself-consistent studies considered a BHNS system with mass ratio $q=3:1$, BH\nspin $a/M_{BH}=0.75$ aligned with the total orbital angular momentum (OAM), and\na NS that is irrotational, threaded by an aligned B field, and modeled by an\n$\\Gamma$--law equation of state with $\\Gamma=2$. Here, as a crucial step in\nestablishing BHNS systems as viable progenitors of central engines that power\nshort gamma--ray bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as\nmultimessenger sources, we survey different BHNS configurations that differ in\nBH spin ($a/M_{BH} =-0.5,\\,0,\\,0.5,\\,0.75$), in the mass ratio ($q=3:1$ and\n$q=5:1$), and in the orientation of the B field (aligned and tilted by\n$90^\\circ$ with respect to the OAM). We find that by $\\Delta t\\sim 3500M-4000M\n\\sim 88(M_{NS}/1.4M_\\odot){\\rm ms}-100(M_{NS}/1.4M_\\odot)\\rm ms$ after the peak\ngravitational wave signal a jet is launched in the cases where the initial BH\nspin is $a/M_{BH}= 0.5$ or $0.75$.

The developed method is based on the\nhigher-order Green's functions for wave equations which are defined as\ndistributions that satisfy wave equations with the corresponding order\ncovariant derivatives of the Dirac delta function as the source terms. The\nconstructed solution is applied to the study of various geometric effects on\nthe generation and propagation of electromagnetic wave tails to first order in\nthe Riemann tensor. Generally the received radiation tail occurs after a time\ndelay which represents geometrical backscattering by the central gravitational\nsource. It is shown that the truly nonlocal wave-propagation correction (the\ntail term) takes a universal form which is independent of multipole order. In a\nparticular case, if the radiation pulse is generated by the source during a\nfinite time interval, the tail term after the primary pulse is entirely\ndetermined by the energy-momentum vector of the gravitational field source: the\nform of the tail term is independent of the multipole structure of the\ngravitational source. We apply the results to a compact binary system and\nconclude that under certain conditions the tail energy can be a noticeable\nfraction of the primary pulse energy. We argue that the wave tails should be\ncarefully considered in energy calculations of such systems. \n\n"}

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the total dark energy (DE) of the Universe\nis made out of two dynamical components of different nature: a variable\ncosmological term, Lambda, and a dynamical ``cosmon'', X, possibly interacting\nwith Lambda but not with matter -- which remains conserved. We call this\nscenario the LXCDM model. One possibility for X would be a scalar field, but it\nis not the only one. The overall equation of state (EOS) of the LXCDM model can\neffectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixture\nof the two components. Both the dynamics of Lambda and of X could be linked to\nhigh energy effects near the Planck scale. In the case of Lambda it may be\nrelated to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas X might\nbe identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as a\nlow-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory. We find that the dynamics of the\nLXCDM model can trigger a future stopping of the Universe expansion and can\nkeep the ratio rho_D/rho_m (DE density to matter-radiation density) bounded and\nof order 1. Therefore, the model could explain the so-called ``cosmological\ncoincidence problem''. This is in part related to the possibility that the\npresent value of the cosmological term can be Lambda<0 in this framework (the\ncurrent total DE density nevertheless being positive). However, a cosmic halt\ncould occur even if Lambda>0 because of the peculiar behavior of X as ``Phantom\nMatter''. We describe various cosmological scenarios made possible by the\ncomposite and dynamical nature of LXCDM, and discuss in detail their impact on\nthe cosmological coincidence problem. \n\n"}

We exploit the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime\nand decompose the scalar field in spherical-harmonic modes.

For such a braneworld cosmology, the difficulty of\njustifying some preferred initial conditions inevitably arises. The various\nproposals for inflation restricted to the brane only partially explain the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the resulting braneworld universe because the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the bulk must be assumed. We propose a mechanism by\nwhich a brane surrounded by AdS space arises naturally so that the homogeneity\nand isotropy of both the brane and the bulk are guaranteed. We postulate an\ninitial false vacuum phase of (4+1)-dimensional Minkowski or de Sitter space\nsubsequently decaying to a true vacuum of anti-de Sitter space, assumed\ndiscretely degenerate. This decay takes place through bubble nucleation. When\ntwo bubbles of the true AdS vacuum collide, a brane (or domain wall) inevitably\nforms between the two AdS phases. We live on this brane. The SO(3,1) symmetry\nof the collision geometry ensures the three-dimensional spatial homogeneity and\nisotropy of the universe on the brane as well as of the bulk. In the\nsemi-classical limit, this symmetry is exact. We sketch how the leading quantum\ncorrections translate into cosmological perturbations. \n\n"}

Instead, the operator may\nbe merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable - and as a\nconsequence they describe real degrees of freedom which display a form of\n\"unsharpness\" or \"fuzzyness\".

It is well-known in the physics that the\nCasimir energy is defined by the principal part of the Riemann function\n$\\zeta(z)$ (Blau, Visser, Wipf; Elizalde). Analogously, we consider the\nprincipal parts for functions $\\Gamma(z)$, $K(z)$, $A(z)$ and we also define\nand consider the principal part for arbitrary meromorphic functions. Next, in\nthis paper we consider some differential-algebraic $($d.a.$)$ properties of\nfunctions $\\Gamma(z)$, $\\zeta(z)$, $K(z)$, $A(z)$. As it is well-known (H\\\"\nolder; Ostrowski) $\\Gamma(z)$ is not a solution of any d.a. equation. It\nappears that this property of $\\Gamma(z)$ is universal. Namely, a large class\nof solutions of functional differential equations also has that property.

In other words, at the Riemannian geometry construction one uses the\nneedless information (topology), which disagrees with other original axioms.\nThe crisis manifests in the fact, that the mathematical community cannot see\nand does not want to see the overdetermination of the Riemannian geometry. The\nmost geometers-topologists deny the alternative method of the generalized\ngeometry construction, which does not uses the topology, because it does not\ncontain theorems. Most geometers see the geometry presentation as a set of\ndefinitions and theorems. They cannot imagine the geometry presentation without\ncustomary theorems.

{"id": "quant-ph/0410061", "contents": "Title: Quantum Mechanics Abstract: I consider in this book a formulation of Quantum Mechanics. Usually QM is\nformulated based on the notion of time and space, both of which are thought a\npriori given quantities or notions. However, when we try to define the notion\nof velocity or momentum, we encounter a difficulty as we will see in chapter 1.\nThe problem is that if the notion of time is given a priori, the velocity is\ndefinitely determined when given a position, which contradicts the uncertainty\nprinciple of Heisenberg. We then set the basis of QM on the notion of position\nand momentum operators as in chapter 2. Time of a local system then is defined\napproximately as a ratio $|x|/|v|$ between the space coordinate $x$ and the\nvelocity $v$. In this formulation of QM, we can keep the uncertainty principle,\nand time is a quantity that does not have precise values unlike the usually\nsupposed notion of time has. The feature of local time is that it is a time\nproper to each local system, which is defined as a finite set of quantum\nmechanical particles. We now have an infinite number of local times that are\nunique and proper to each local system. Based on the notion of local time, the\nmotion inside a local system is described by the usual Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nWe investigate such motion in a given local system in part II. This is a usual\nquantum mechanics. After some excursion of the investigation of local motion,\nwe consider in part III the relative relation or motion between plural local\nsystems. In the final part IV, we will prove that there is at least one\nUniverse wave function $\\phi$ in which all local systems have local motions and\nthus local times. This concludes our formulation of Quantum Mechanics. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9810074", "contents": "Title: Insufficient reason and entropy in quantum theory Abstract: The objective of the consistent-amplitude approach to quantum theory has been\nto justify the mathematical formalism on the basis of three main assumptions:\nthe first defines the subject matter, the second introduces amplitudes as the\ntools for quantitative reasoning, and the third is an interpretative rule that\nprovides the link to the prediction of experimental outcomes. In this work we\nintroduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to\nprefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be\n`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique\ninner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the\nprinciple of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.\nArmed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an\nearlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient\nreason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical\nprobabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of\namplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time\nevolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on\nthe conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct\nentropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution\nhas been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables\nand we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information\ntheory. Finally, we discuss how various connections among the postulates of\nquantum theory are made explicit within this approach. \n\n"}
