We consider the more general quasi-co-Frobenius (QcF) coalgebras; in the\nfirst main result we show that these also admit symmetric characterizations: a\ncoalgebra is QcF if it is weakly isomorphic to its (left, or equivalently\nright) rational dual $Rat(C^*)$, in the sense that certain coproduct or product\npowers of these objects are isomorphic.

One of the main virtues of\nT-duality is that h_1-twisted K-theory of E_1 is isomorphic to h_2-twisted\nK-theory of E_2. In this paper, a new, very topological concept of T-duality is\nintroduced. We construct a classifying space for pairs as above with additional\n\"dualizing data\", with a forgetful map to the classifying space for pairs (also\nconstructed in the paper). On the first classifying space, we have an\ninvolution which corresponds to passage to the dual pair, i.e. to each pair\nwith dualizing data exists a well defined dual pair (with dualizing data). We\nshow that a pair (E,h) can be lifted to a pair with dualizing data if an only\nif h belongs to the second step of the Leray-Serre filtration of E (i.e. not\nalways), and that in general many different lifts exist, with topologically\ndifferent dual bundles.

Since the twisting of the commutators\nturns the usual hypertrace constructed out of the Dixmier trace into a twisted\ntrace on the coordinate algebra, one would be tempted to interpret that as a\nmanifestation of twisting at the level of cyclic cohomology, akin to that\nintroduced by the authors in the context of Hopf cyclic cohomology. The main\npoint of this note, besides giving simple natural examples of the general\nnotion and developing the first basic steps of the theory, is to show that\ncontrary to the initial expectations no cohomological twisting is in fact\nrequired. The Chern character of finitely summable spectral triples extends to\nthe twisted case, and lands in fact in ordinary (untwisted) cyclic cohomology.\nThe same holds true for the local Hochschild character. The index pairing with\nordinary (untwisted) K-theory continues to make sense and the index formula is\nstill given by the pairing of the corresponding Chern characters. This opens\nthe road to extending the local index formula, as well as the analogue of the\nhypoelliptic construction on the dual system together with the corresponding\nThom isomorphism, to the context of twisted spectral triples of type III. \n\n"}
