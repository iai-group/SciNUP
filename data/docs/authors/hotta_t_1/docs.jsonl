The classical $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the two dimensional (2D)\nhoneycomb lattice has N\\'eel order for $J_2 < J_1/6$. For $J_2 > J_1/6$, it\nexhibits a one-parameter family of degenerate incommensurate spin spiral ground\nstates where the spiral wave vector can point in any direction. Spin wave\nfluctuations at leading order lift this accidental degeneracy in favor of\nspecific wave vectors, leading to spiral order by disorder. For spin $S=1/2$,\nquantum fluctuations are, however, likely to be strong enough to melt the\nspiral order parameter over a wide range of $J_2/J_1$. Over a part of this\nrange, we argue that the resulting state is a valence bond solid (VBS) with\nstaggered dimer order - this VBS is a nematic which breaks lattice rotational\nsymmetry. Our arguments are supported by comparing the spin wave energy with\nthe energy of the dimer solid obtained using a bond operator formalism. Turning\nto the effect of thermal fluctuations on the spiral ordered state, any nonzero\ntemperature destroys the magnetic order, but the discrete rotational symmetry\nof the lattice remains broken resulting in a thermal analogue of the nematic\nVBS.

In abelian LGTs, thanks to duality, this\nstudy can be performed in a very efficient way, allowing to reach high\nprecision with a reasonable CPU cost. The major advantage of this numerical\nstrategy is that it allows to eliminate the dominant effective string\ncorrection to the inter-quark potential (the Luscher term) thus giving an\nunique opportunity to test higher order corrections. Performing a set of\nsimulations in the 3d gauge Ising model we were thus able to precisely identify\nand measure both the quartic and the sextic effective string corrections to the\ninter-quark potential.

For the chosen\nsample of galaxies we determine first the baryonic parameters by fitting the\nphotometric data to the adopted galaxy model; then we test the hypothesis of\nthe Weyl fluid acting as dark matter on the chosen sample of spiral galaxies by\nfitting the tangential velocity equation of the combined baryonic-Weyl model to\nthe rotation curves.

The model parameter ranges\nfor which the $\\chi^2$ test provides agreement (within 1$\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel) with observations on the velocity fields of the chosen galaxy sample are\nthen determined. There is a good agreement between the theoretical predictions\nand observations, showing that extra-dimensional models can be effectively used\nas a viable alternative to the standard dark matter paradigm. \n\n"}

It has been shown that a large\nclass of interacting bosonic SPT phases can be systematically described by\ngroup cohomology theory. In this paper, we introduce a (special) group\nsupercohomology theory which is a generalization of the standard group\ncohomology theory. We show that a large class of short-range interacting\nfermionic SPT phases can be described by the group supercohomology theory.\nUsing the data of super cocycles, we can obtain the ideal ground state wave\nfunction for the corresponding fermionic SPT phase. We can also obtain the bulk\nHamiltonian that realizes the SPT phase, as well as the anomalous (ie,\nnon-on-site) symmetry for the boundary effective Hamiltonian. The anomalous\nsymmetry on the boundary implies that the symmetric} boundary must be gapless\nfor 1+1D boundary, and must be gapless or topologically ordered beyond 1+1D. As\nan application of this general result, we construct a new SPT phase in 3D, for\ninteracting fermionic superconductors with coplanar spin order (which have\n$T^2=1$ time-reversal $Z_2^T$ and fermion-number parity $Z_2^f$ symmetries\ndescribed by a full symmetry group $Z_2^T\\times Z_2^f$). Such a fermionic SPT\nstate can neither be realized by free fermions nor by interacting bosons\n(formed by fermion-pairs), and thus are not included in the K-theory\nclassification for free fermions or group cohomology description for\ninteracting bosons.

We find a qualitatively\ndifferent behavior for d=3,4 w.r.t. d=2. In particular, considering any\n(sufficiently regular) gluon propagator D(p^2) and the one-loop-corrected ghost\npropagator G(p^2), we prove in the 2d case that sigma(p^2) blows up in the\ninfrared limit p -> 0 as -D(0)\\ln(p^2). Thus, for d=2, the no-pole condition\n\\sigma(p^2) < 1 (for p^2 > 0) can be satisfied only if D(0) = 0. On the\ncontrary, in d=3 and 4, sigma(p^2) is finite also if D(0) > 0. The same results\nare obtained by evaluating G(p^2) explicitly at one loop, using fitting forms\nfor D(p^2) that describe well the numerical data of D(p^2) in d=2,3,4 in the\nSU(2) case. These evaluations also show that, if one considers the coupling\nconstant g^2 as a free parameter, G(p^2) admits a one-parameter family of\nbehaviors (labelled by g^2), in agreement with Boucaud et al. In this case the\ncondition sigma(0) <= 1 implies g^2 <= g^2_c, where g^2_c is a 'critical'\nvalue. Moreover, a free-like G(p^2) in the infrared limit is obtained for any\nvalue of g^2 < g^2_c, while for g^2 = g^2_c one finds an infrared-enhanced\nG(p^2). Finally, we analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for sigma(p^2)\nand show that, for infrared-finite ghost-gluon vertices, one can bound\nsigma(p^2). Using these bounds we find again that only in the d=2 case does one\nneed to impose D(0) = 0 in order to satisfy the no-pole condition. The d=2\nresult is also supported by an analysis of the DSE using a spectral\nrepresentation for G(p^2). Thus, if the no-pole condition is imposed, solving\nthe d=2 DSE cannot lead to a massive behavior for D(p^2). These results apply\nto any Gribov copy inside the so-called first Gribov horizon, i.e. the 2d\nresult D(0) = 0 is not affected by Gribov noise.

The main ingredient of this formalism is the dynamical formation of\nbound-states with vanishing mass, which give rise to effective vertices\ncontaining massless poles; these latter vertices, in turn, trigger the\nSchwinger mechanism, and allow for the gauge-invariant generation of an\neffective gluon mass. This particular approach has the conceptual advantage of\nrelating the gluon mass directly to quantities that are intrinsic to the\nbound-state formation itself, such as the \"transition amplitude\" and the\ncorresponding \"bound-state wave-function\". As a result, the dynamical evolution\nof the gluon mass is largely determined by a Bethe-Salpeter equation that\ncontrols the dynamics of the relevant wave-function, rather than the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator, as happens in the standard\ntreatment. The precise structure and field-theoretic properties of the\ntransition amplitude are scrutinized in a variety of independent ways. In\nparticular, a parallel study within the linear covariant (Landau) gauge and the\nbackground-field method reveals that a powerful identity, known to be valid at\nthe level of conventional Green's functions, relates also the background and\nquantum transition amplitudes. Despite the differences in the ingredients and\nterminology employed, the massless bound-state formalism is absolutely\nequivalent to the standard approach based on Schwinger-Dyson equations.

The nonperturbative evaluation of this diagram\nprovides the key relation that expresses the unquenched gluon propagator as a\ndeviation from its quenched counterpart.

For the hole-doped materials, a\ntrivial Berry phase of 0 mod $2\\pi$ is systematically observed whereas the\nelectron-doped Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ exhibits a significant non-zero Berry\nphase. These observations set constraints on the nature of the high-field\nnormal state of the cuprates and points towards contrasting behaviour between\nhole-doped and electron-doped materials. We discuss this difference in light of\nrecent developments related to charge density-wave and broken time-reversal\nsymmetry states. \n\n"}

The mechanism behind that resides in the\nstructural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical configurations Cu$^{\\rm\nII}$O$_4$ and Cu$^{\\rm III}$O$_4$ which compose the CuO$_2$ planes. It leads to\nspontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local\nFeshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.\nThe coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping\nof the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and\npaired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other.

In fact, we have given a new framework for\nreformulating the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory using new field variables. This\nincludes the preceding works given by Cho, Faddeev and Niemi, as a special case\ncalled the maximal option in our reformulations. The advantage of our\nreformulations is that the original non-Abelian gauge field variables can be\nchanged into the new field variables such that one of them called the\nrestricted field gives the dominant contribution to quark confinement in the\ngauge-independent way. Our reformulations can be combined with the $SU(N)$\nextension of the Diakonov-Petrov version of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for\nthe Wilson loop operator to give a gauge-invariant definition for the magnetic\nmonopole in the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory without the scalar field. In the\nso-called minimal option, especially, the restricted field is non-Abelian and\ninvolves the non-Abelian magnetic monopole with the stability group $U(N-1)$.\nThis suggests the non-Abelian dual superconductivity picture for quark\nconfinement. This should be compared with the maximal option: the restricted\nfield is Abelian and involves only the Abelian magnetic monopoles with the\nstability group $U(1)^{N-1}$, just like the Abelian projection. We give some\napplications of this reformulation, e.g., the stability for the homogeneous\nchromomagnetic condensation of the Savvidy type, the large N treatment for\nderiving the dimensional transmutation and understanding the mass gap, and also\nthe numerical simulations on a lattice which are given by Dr. Shibata in a\nsubsequent talk. \n\n"}

To incorporate charged and dyonic excitations in (doubled)\ntopological phases, an extension of the LW models is proposed in this paper.

Here we show that in the archetypal cuprate\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{y}$ (YBCO) pressure suppresses charge order, but does not\naffect the pseudogap phase. This is based on transport measurements under\npressure, which reveal that the onset of the pseudogap at $T^*$ is independent\nof pressure, while the negative Hall effect, a clear signature of CDW order in\nYBCO, is suppressed by pressure. We also find that pressure and magnetic field\nshift the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ of YBCO in the\nsame way as a function of doping - but in opposite directions - and most\neffectively at $p \\simeq 0.12$.

Based on the observation that a finite\nenergy density state, if localized, can be viewed as the ground state of a\nlocal Hamiltonian, we propose a simple (though possibly incomplete) rule for\nmany-body localization of SPT Hamiltonians: If the ground state and top state\n(highest energy state) belong to the same SPT phase, then it is possible to\nlocalize all the finite energy density states; If the ground and top state\nbelong to different SPT phases, then most likely there are some finite energy\ndensity states which can not be fully localized.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment. The robust s-wave pairing also reveals that the current standard\neffective models with only onsite interactions are not sufficient and a minimum\nmicroscopic model must include strong nearest neighbor repulsive interactions\nresulted from the d-d direct bondings to serves as a s-wave symmetry\nstabilizer. Finally, the sign distribution of the superconducting order\nparameters in the reciprocal space is simply a consequence of the form factors\ngiven by the leading short-range pairings. The sign change of superconducting\norder parameters on Fermi surfaces is not a necessary requirement in\nrepulsive-interaction-driven high T_c mechanism. The results will guide us to\nsearch for new electronic structure that supports high T_c superconductivity. \n\n"}

When the field and the spin-torque concur to favor the P to\nAP transition, the reversal yields monotonic resistance ramps that can be\ninterpreted as a domain wall propagation through the device at velocities of 17\nto 30 nm/ns; smaller cells switch hence faster. When the field hinders the P to\nAP transition, the switching is preceded by repetitive switching attempts,\nduring which the resistance transiently increases until successful reversal\noccurs. At 50 nm, the P to AP switching proceeds reproducibly in 3 ns, with a\nmonotonic increase of the device resistance. In the reverse transition (AP to\nP), several reversal paths are possible even in the smallest junctions.\nBesides, the non uniform nature of the response seems still present at\nnanoscale, with sometimes electrical signatures of strong disorder during the\nreversal.

Values for the scale-dependent decay constants of\nground-state scalar and vector systems are a by-product of this analysis, and\nthey turn out to be roughly equal, viz. $\\simeq 0.2\\,$GeV at an hadronic scale.\nIn addition, it is confirmed that the dilation characterising ground-state PDAs\nis manifest in the PDAs of radial excitations too. The impact of\n$SU(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking is also considered. When compared with\npseudoscalar states, it is a little stronger in scalar systems, but the size is\nnevertheless determined by the flavour-dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking and the PDAs are still skewed toward the heavier valence-quark in\nasymmetric systems. \n\n"}

For example, the topological order in tensor network representations\nof the toric code ground state has been shown to be unstable under certain\nsmall variations of the local tensor, if these small variations do not obey a\nlocal $Z_2$ symmetry of the tensor. In this paper, we ask the questions of\nwhether other types of topological orders suffer from similar kinds of\ninstability and if so, what is the underlying physical mechanism and whether we\ncan protect the order by enforcing certain symmetries on the tensor.

There are a number of surprises: though the equations of motion\nimpose flatness we show that diffeomorphism symmetry is broken for a large\nclass of area Regge geometries.

They show strong correlation effects, like very low Fermi-liquid\ncoherence scales and intriguing incoherent transport regimes, resulting in bad\nmetallic behavior. But to what extent are these strong correlations governed by\nMottness, i.e. the blocking of charge fluctuations close to a Mott insulator\ntransition (MIT) induced by $U$, or by Hundness, a new route towards strong\ncorrelations induced by $J$? To answer this question, we study the full phase\ndiagram of a degenerate three-band Hubbard-Hund model on a Bethe lattice at\nzero temperature using single-site DMFT and the numerical renormalization group\nas efficient real-frequency multi-band impurity solver. Hund metal behavior\noccurs in this minimal model for a filling close to $n_d=2$, moderate $U$ and\nsizeable $J$, the \"Hund-metal regime\", with strong correlations manifest by a\nlow quasiparticle weight, $Z$. We show that \"spin-orbital separation\" (SOS) is\na generic $J$-induced feature in the whole metallic regime of the phase diagram\nfor $1<n_d<3$ and sizeable $J$: orbital screening occurs at much higher\nenergies than spin screening, below which Fermi-liquid behavior sets in. The\nlow $Z$ can then be explained in terms of the $J$-reduced Fermi-liquid scale.\nWe further show that, in the Hund-metal regime, far from any MIT, Hundness --\nthe localization of large spins -- is the key player to induce strong\ncorrelations. There, physical properties are governed by a broad incoherent\nenergy regime of SOS with intriguing Hund metal physics: large, almost\nunscreened spins are coupled to screened orbital degrees of freedom. \n\n"}

The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates.

By increasing the amount of\nmatter to 8 Ising models, we find that the geometry of the combined system has\nundergone a phase transition. The new phase is characterized by an anomalous\nscaling of spatial length relative to proper time at large distances, and as a\nconsequence the Hausdorff dimension is now three. In spite of this qualitative\nchange in the geometric sector, and a very strong interaction between matter\nand geometry, the critical exponents of the Ising model retain their Onsager\nvalues. This provides evidence for the conjecture that the KPZ values of the\ncritical exponents in 2d Euclidean quantum gravity are entirely due to the\npresence of baby universes. Lastly, we summarize the lessons learned so far\nfrom 2d Lorentzian quantum gravity. \n\n"}

Isotopically resolved yield distributions of projectile fragments in\nthe range Z=10-36 from these reaction pairs were measured with the MARS recoil\nseparator in the angular range 2.7-5.3 degrees.

The isoscaling\nis found to occur in the residue Z range corresponding to the maximum observed\nexcitation energies. The corresponding isoscaling parameters are alpha=0.43 and\nbeta=-0.50 for the Kr+Sn system and alpha=0.27 and beta=-0.34 for the Kr+Ni\nsystem.

Differential\ndistributions and total cross sections were obtained after careful studies of\npossible systematic uncertainties in the overall ANKE acceptance. The results\nare compared with the predictions of theoretical models. Combined with data on\nthe phi-meson, a more refined estimate is made of the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule\nviolation in the phi/omega production ratio. \n\n"}

The dependence of the charmonia production\ncross-sections on the size of the target nucleus allows to quantify the\nso-called normal nuclear absorption. In the framework of the Glauber model,\nthis new measurement is combined with results previously obtained with the same\napparatus, under different experimental conditions, and leads to a precise\ndetermination of the J/psi and psi' absorption cross-sections in the\nsurrounding nuclear matter. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, the difference of the nuclear structure functions and the Gottfried\nsum rule for the lightest mirror nuclei, 3He and 3H, are investigated. It is\nfound that such systems can provide significant information on charge symmetry\nbreaking and flavor asymmetry in the nuclear medium. Furthermore, we propose a\nnew method to extract the neutron structure function from radioactive isotopes\nfar from the line of stability. We also discuss the flavor asymmetry in the\nDrell-Yan process with isospin asymmetric nuclei. \n\n"}

Implications for MiniBooNE are\nnoted and an example based on maximal CP violation displays profound\nimplications for the two data sets (muon-neutrino and muon-antineutrino) of\nthat experiment. \n\n"}

The density compression in\ntip-tip UU collisions is found to be about 30% higher and lasts approximately\n50% longer than in body-body or spherical UU reactions. The body-body UU\ncollisions have the unique feature that the nucleon elliptic flow is the\nhighest in the most central collisions and remain a constant throughout the\nreaction. We point out that the tip-tip UU collisions are more probable to\ncreate the QGP at AGS and SPS energies while the body-body UU collisions are\nmore useful for studying properties of the QGP at higher energies. \n\n"}
