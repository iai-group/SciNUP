Degradation of optical transmittance in this region lowers light\nyields in the detector, which can affect energy reconstruction, resolution, and\nexperimental sensitivities.

The addition of an accelerometer on board a spacecraft provides\norbit determination specialists and physicists with an additional observable of\ngreat interest: it measures the value of the non-gravitational acceleration\nacting on the spacecraft, i.e. the departure of the probe from geodesic motion.\nThis technology is now routinely used for geodesy missions in Earth orbits with\nelectrostatic accelerometers. This article proposes a technological evolution\nwhich consists in adding a subsystem to remove the bias of an electrostatic\naccelerometer.

The nominal depletion\nvoltage being 3000V, the detector under investigation shows a peculiar behavior\nfor biases around 2000V: in a narrow range of about 100V the charge collection\nis strongly reduced. The detector seems to be composed by two parts: a small\nvolume around the HV contact where charges are efficiently collected as at\nhigher voltage, and a large volume where charges are poorly collected.

When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,\nradioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order\nto control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique\nthat uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur\nclose to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The\ncomposite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy\nabsorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers\nthat act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the\nanalysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields.

A Bradbury Nielsen gate\nconsists of two interleaved sets of electrodes. If two voltages of the same\namplitude but opposite polarity are applied the gate is closed, and for\nidentical (zero) potential the gate is open. Whereas former realizations of the\ndevice employ actual wires resulting in difficulties with winding, fixing and\ntensioning them, our approach is to use two grids photo-etched from a metallic\nfoil. This design allows for simplified construction of gates covering large\nbeam sizes up to at least 900\\,mm$^2$ with variable wire spacing down to\n250\\,\\textmu m.

The detection of the possible\nlight emitted when particles interact in the bolometer is a promising method to\nlower the background of the experiments.

Even though\nit could accommodate to a sizeable background contamination, electron/recoil\ndiscrimination remains a key and challenging issue as for direction-insensitive\ndetectors. The measurement of the 3D track may be used to discriminate\nelectrons from nuclear recoils.

The Double Chooz trigger system is driven by the basic idea of\ntriggering on multiple thresholds according to the total visible energy and\nadditionally triggering on the number of active photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in\nthe detector. To do so, the trigger system continuously monitors the analogue\nsignals from all PMTs in the detector. The amplitudes of these PMT-signals are\nsummed for groups of certain PMTs (group signals) and for all PMTs (sum\nsignal), respectively. The group signals are discriminated by two thresholds\nfor each input channel and four thresholds for the sum signal.

Quantum Physics at cryogenic temperatures\n  in space Abstract: Although it is often believed that the coldness of space is ideally suited\nfor performing measurements at cryogenic temperatures, this must be regarded\nwith caution for two reasons: Firstly, the sensitive instrument must be\ncompletely shielded from the strong solar radiation and therefore, e.g. either\nbe placed inside a satellite or externally on the satellite's shaded side.\nSecondly, any platform hosting such an experiment in space generally provides\nan environment close to room temperature for the accommodated equipment. To\nobtain cryogenic temperatures without active cooling, one must isolate the\ninstrument from radiative and conductive heat exchange with the platform as\nwell as possible. We investigate the limits of this passive cooling method in\nthe context of a recently proposed experiment to observe the decoherence of\nquantum superpositions of massive objects. The analyses and conclusions are\napplicable to a host of similar experimental designs requiring a cryogenic\nenvironment in space. \n\n"}

The detector consists of a strip of 15\nscintillator cells individually read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs)\nand fast oscilloscopes with a PC-controlled data acquisition system.

We perform\ndetailed Monte Carlo simulations of the expected backgrounds, considering\nrealistic energy resolutions and thresholds in the detector. In a low-energy\nwindow of 2-30 keV, where the sensitivity to solar pp and $^7$Be-neutrinos is\nhighest, an integrated pp-neutrino rate of 5900 events can be reached in a\nfiducial mass of 14 tons of natural xenon, after 5 years of data.

These results represent the strongest demonstration\nthat the Standard Model of electroweak interactions is incomplete and that new\nPhysics beyond it must exist.

The proposal is to install a LHCf-like\ncalorimeter in the ZDC installation slot at one of the RHIC interaction points.\nBy installing a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter at this location we\nmeasure the spectra of photons, neutrons and pi0 at pseudo rapidity eta above\n6.\n  The new measurements at 500 GeV p-p collisions contribute to improve the\nhadronic interaction models used in the cosmic-ray air shower simulations.\nUsing a similar kinematic coverage at RHIC to that of the measurements at LHC,\nwe can test the Feynman scaling with a wide energy range and make the\nextrapolation of models into cosmic-ray energy more reliable. Combination of a\nhigh position resolution of the LHCf detector and a high energy resolution of\nthe ZDC makes it possible to determine pT of forward neutrons with the ever\nbest resolution. This enables us to study the forward neutron spin asymmetry\ndiscovered at RHIC in more detail.\n  Another new experiment expected at RHIC is world-first light-ion collisions.\nCosmic-ray interaction models have been so far tested with accelerator data,\nbut colliders have provided only p-p and heavy-ion collisions. To simulate the\ninteraction between cosmic-ray particles and atmosphere, collision of light\nions like nitrogen is a ultimate goal for the cosmic-ray physics.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

In this paper single crystal sapphire sensors\nare considered as a promising alternative. Industrially grown sapphire wafers\nare available in large sizes, are of low cost and, like diamond sensors, can be\noperated without cooling. Here we present results of an irradiation study done\nwith sapphire sensors in a high intensity low energy electron beam. Then, a\nmultichannel direction-sensitive sapphire detector stack is described. It\ncomprises 8 sapphire plates of 1 cm^2 size and 525 micro m thickness,\nmetallized on both sides, and apposed to form a stack. Each second metal layer\nis supplied with a bias voltage, and the layers in between are connected to\ncharge-sensitive preamplifiers. The performance of the detector was studied in\na 5 GeV electron beam. The charge collection efficiency measured as a function\nof the bias voltage rises with the voltage, reaching about 10 % at 950 V. The\nsignal size obtained from electrons crossing the stack at this voltage is about\n22000 e, where e is the unit charge.\n  The signal size is measured as a function of the hit position, showing\nvariations of up to 20 % in the direction perpendicular to the beam and to the\nelectric field. The measurement of the signal size as a function of the\ncoordinate parallel to the electric field confirms the prediction that mainly\nelectrons contribute to the signal.

The EL gap was optically read out in the Vacuum\nUltraviolet (VUV), near 128 nm (Ar excimer emission), and in the near\nUltraviolet (UV), at 300-450 nm (N2 Second Positive System emission), via\ncryogenic PMTs and a Geiger-mode APD (GAPD).

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and\ntopological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is\npossible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of\nexposure.

The foreseen upgrade of the LHC\nto its high luminosity (HL) phase (HL-LHC scheduled for 2023), will enable the\nuse of maximal physics potential of the facility. After 10 years of operation\nthe expected fluence will expose the tracking systems at HL-LHC to a radiation\nenvironment that is beyond the capacity of the present system design.

In spite of its large cross section, the\nCEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting\nnuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The\nmeasurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of\nultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive\nparticle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted\nin the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test.

In\nthe long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear\nstructure.

In general the absorption in the typical studied materials can be\nneglected and this technique is limited to the measurement of the reflectivity\nonly. In the case of strongly absorbing nuclei the number of neutrons is not\nconserved and the absorption can be directly measured by using the\nneutron-induced fluorescence technique which exploits the prompt particle\nemission of absorbing isotopes. This technique is emerging from soft matter and\nbiology where highly absorbing nuclei, generally in very small quantities, are\nused as a label for buried layers. Nowadays the importance of highly absorbing\nlayers is rapidly increasing, partially because of their application in neutron\ndetection; a field that has become more and more active also due to the\n3He-shortage. In this manuscript we extend the neutron-induced fluorescence\ntechnique to the study of thick layers of highly absorbing materials; in\nparticular 10B4C. The theory of neutron reflectometry is a commonly studied\ntopic, however the subtle relationship between the reflection and the\nabsorption of neutrons is not widely known, in particular when a strong\nabsorption is present. The theory for a general stack of absorbing layers has\nbeen developed and compared to measurements. This new technique has potential\nas a tool for characterization of highly absorbing layers.

This background becomes dominant in a kiloton-scale\nliquid-scintillator detector deep underground and is usually considered as\nirreducible due to an overlap in deposited energy with the signal.

For sub-keV recoil energies, nuclear\nscattering events in liquid helium primarily deposit energy into long-lived\nphonon and roton quasiparticle excitations. If the energy thresholds of the\ndetector can be reduced to the meV scale, then dark matter as light as ~MeV can\nbe reached with ordinary nuclear recoils. If, on the other hand, two or more\nquasiparticle excitations are directly produced in the dark matter interaction,\nthe kinematics of the scattering allows sensitivity to dark matter as light as\n~keV at the same energy resolution. We present in detail the theoretical\nframework for describing excitations in superfluid helium, using it to\ncalculate the rate for the leading dark matter scattering interaction, where an\noff-shell phonon splits into two or more higher-momentum excitations. We\nvalidate our analytic results against the measured and simulated dynamic\nresponse of superfluid helium. Finally, we apply this formalism to the case of\na kinetically mixed hidden photon in the superfluid, both with and without an\nexternal electric field to catalyze the processes. \n\n"}
{"id": "1611.06356", "contents": "Title: Negative Feedback, Linearity and Parameter Invariance in Linear\n  Electronics Abstract: Negative feedback is a powerful approach capable of improving several aspects\nof a system. In linear electronics, it has been critical for allowing\ninvariance to device properties. Negative feedback is also known to enhance\nlinearity in amplification, which is one of the most important foundations of\nlinear electronics. At the same time, thousands of transistors types have been\nmade available, suggesting that these devices, in addition to their known\nvariability of parameters, have distinguishing properties. The current work\nreports a systematic approach to quantifying the potential of negative\nfeedback, with respect to bipolar transistors, as a means to providing device\ninvariance and linearity. Several methods, including concepts from multivariate\nstatistics and complex systems, are applied at the theoretical as well as\nexperimental levels, and a number of interesting results are obtained and\ndiscussed. For instance, it has been verified that the transistors types indeed\nhave well-defined characteristics which clearly segregate them into groups. The\naddition of feedback at moderate and intense levels promoted uniformization of\nthe properties of these transistors when used in a class A common emitter\nconfiguration. However, such effect occurred with different efficiency\nregarding the considered device features, and even intense feedback was unable\nto completely eliminate device dependence. This indicates that it would be\ninteresting to consider the device properties in linear design even when\nnegative feedback is applied. We also verified that the linearization induced\nin the considered experiments is relatively modest, with effects that depend on\ntype of transfer function of the original devices. \n\n"}

For such a goal, it\nis mandatory to reach very low threshold in energy (at or below the keV level),\nvery low radioactive background (at a few counts/keV/kg/day), and high\ndetection mass (at or above the 100 kg scale).

In the frame of the ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators)\ndark matter search project large NaI(Tl) crystals from different providers\ncoupled to two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been tested at the Canfranc\nUnderground Laboratory.

We develop a system using bismuth\ngermanium oxide (BGO) crystals with optical fibers connecting to a multianode\nphotomultiplier tube (MAPMT) and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)\nembedded readout board for monitoring the real-time beam backgrounds in BEAST\nII. The overall radiation sensitivity of this system is estimated to be\n$(2.20\\pm0.26)\\times10^{-12}$ Gy/ADU (analog-to-digital unit) with the standard\n10 m fibers for transmission and the MAPMT operating at 700 V. Our $\\gamma$-ray\nirradiation study of the BGO system shows that the exposure of BGO crystals to\n$^{60}$Co $\\gamma$-ray doses of 1 krad has led to immediate light output\nreductions of 25--40%, and the light outputs further drop by 30--45% after the\ncrystals receive doses of 2--4 krad. Our findings agree with those of the\nprevious studies on the radiation hard (RH) BGO crystals grown by the low\nthermal gradient Czochralski (LTG Cz) technology. The absolute dose from the\nBGO system is also consistent with the simulation, and is estimated to be about\n1.18 times the equivalent dose. These results prove that the BGO system is able\nto monitor the background dose rate in real time under extreme high radiation\nconditions. This study concludes that the BGO system is reliable for the beam\nbackground study in BEAST II. \n\n"}

When a massive star (M $>$ 8 M$_{\\odot}$) ignites its last\nfusion stage where silicon fusion makes iron, its end is then very close.\nBasically, the core of the star falls inwardly and the gravitational energy is\nthen released in a supernova explosion. The basic picture of this explosion was\nconfirmed by the few neutrinos detected from the SN1987a supernova at\nKamiokande, IMB and Baksan detectors. However, there are many details that are\nstill unknown. Since then, a large detector network has grown with better\ncapabilities.

BUGS utilises\nthree types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput\nradioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search\nexperiments. A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to\nlow-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th.

This paper presents the steps used to\ncharacterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample\ngeometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing\neffects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain.

These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$.

When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings.

Substantial increases of\nmomentum resolution respect to standard fit is obtained. The key point is the\nuse of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).\nTwo different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an\neffective variance for each hit, the second method implements the maximum\nlikelihood search. The tracker model is similar to the PAMELA tracker. Each\nside, of the two sided of the PAMELA detectors, is simulated as momentum\nreconstruction device. One of the two is similar to silicon micro-strip\ndetectors of large use in running experiments. Two different position\nreconstructions are used for the standard fits, the $\\eta$-algorithm (the best\none) and the two-strip center of gravity. The gain obtained in momentum\nresolution is measured as the virtual magnetic field and the virtual\nsignal-to-noise ratio required by the two standard fits to reach an overlap\nwith the best of two new methods. For the best side, the virtual magnetic field\nmust be increased 1.5 times respect to the real field to reach the overlap and\n1.8 for the other. For the high noise side, the increases must be 1.8 and 2.0.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio has similar increases but only for the\n$\\eta$-algorithm. The signal-to-noise ratio has no effect on the fits with the\ncenter of gravity. Very important results are obtained if the number N of\ndetecting layers is increased, our methods provide a momentum resolution\ngrowing linearly with N, much higher than standard fits that grow as the\n$\\sqrt{N}$. \n\n"}

Two different methods were implemented: an exact method that\ncan work for arbitrary fields and an adiabatic method that is limited to\nslowly-varying fields but is much faster for large precession frequencies.\nAdditional interactions to simulate reflection of ultracold neutrons from\nmaterial walls and to allow spin-flip pulses were also added. These tools were\nused to simulate neutron precession in the Paul Scherrer Institute's neutron\nelectric dipole moment experiment and predict the values of the longitudinal\nand transverse relaxation times as well as the trapping lifetime. All three\nparameters are found to closely match the experimentally determined values when\nsimulated with both the exact and adiabatic methods, confirming that Kassiopeia\nis able to accurately simulate neutral particles. This opens the door for\nfuture uses of Kassiopeia to prototype the next generation of atomic traps and\nultracold neutron experiments. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/0512082", "contents": "Title: The Measurement of AM noise of Oscillators Abstract: The close-in AM noise is often neglected, under the assumption that it is a\nminor problem as compared to phase noise. With the progress of technology and\nof experimental science, this assumption is no longer true. Yet, information in\nthe literature is scarce or absent. This report describes the measurement of\nthe AM noise of rf/microwave sources in terms of Salpha(f), i.e., the power\nspectrum density of the fractional amplitude fluctuation alpha. The proposed\nschemes make use of commercial power detectors based on Schottky and tunnel\ndiodes, in single-channel and correlation configuration. There follow the\nanalysis of the front-end amplifier at the detector output, the analysis of the\nmethods for the measurement of the power-detector noise, and a digression about\nthe calibration procedures. The measurement methods are extended to the\nrelative intensity noise (RIN) of optical beams, and to the AM noise of the\nrf/microwave modulation in photonic systems. Some rf/microwave synthesizers and\noscillators have been measured, using correlation and moderate averaging. As an\nexample, the flicker noise of a low-noise quartz oscillator (Wenzel 501-04623E)\nis Salpha = 1.15E-13/f, which is equivalent to an Allan deviation of\nsigma_alpha = 4E-7. The measurement systems described exhibit the world-record\nlowest background noise. \n\n"}

The discussion on which is the dominant\neffect, thus on how to improve the stability of the oscillator, has been going\non for years without giving a clear answer. This article tackles the question\nby analyzing the phase noise spectrum of several commercial oscillators and\nlaboratory prototypes, and demonstrates that the fluctuation of the resonator\nnatural frequency is the dominant effect. The investigation method starts from\nreverse engineering the oscillator phase noise in order to show that if the\nLeeson effect was dominant, the resonator merit factor Q would be too low as\ncompared to the available technology. \n\n"}

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}

The control and the power stages of the\ndriver, both based on a push-pull configuration with high-speed transistors,\nare separated, allowing for a protection of the control electronics. Moreover,\nthe coil current can be set by an analog voltage, a feature that makes possible\nboth fast and adiabatic switching of the quadrupole magnetic field. In order to\ncompensate magnetic field transients induced by eddy currents, the driver\nallows a quick reversal of the quadrupole coil current providing in such a way\nthe required magnetic flux compensation. From a fit to the measured magnetic\nfield transients, we have extracted the decay constants which confirm the\nefficiency of the compensation. Furthermore, we measured the influence of eddy\ncurrents on a sample of cold caesium atoms, testing at the same time the\nultimate performance of the driver for our applications.

{"id": "physics/9812027", "contents": "Title: Taber Vibration Isolator for Vacuum and Cryogenic Applications Abstract: We present a procedure for the design and construction of a passive,\nmultipole, mechanical high-stop vibration isolator. The isolator, consisting of\na stack of metal disks connected by thin wires, attenuates frequencies in the\nkilohertz range, and is suited to both vacuum and cryogenic environments. We\nderive an approximate analytical model and compare its predictions for the\nfrequencies of the normal modes to those of a finite element analysis. The\nanalytical model is exact for the modes involving only motion along and\nrotation about the longitudinal axis, and it gives a good approximate\ndescription of the transverse modes. These results show that the high-frequency\nbehavior of a multi-stage isolator is well characterized by the natural\nfrequencies of a single stage. From the single-stage frequency formulae, we\nderive relationships among the various geometrical parameters of the isolator\nto guarantee equal attenuation in all degrees of freedom. We then derive\nexpressions for the attenuation attainable with a given isolator length, and\nfind that the most important limiting factor is the elastic limit of the spring\nwire material. For our application, which requires attenuations of 250 dB at 1\nkHz, our model specifies a six-stage design using brass disks of approximately\n2 cm in both radius and thickness, connected by 3 cm steel wires of diameters\nranging from 25 to 75 microns. We describe the construction of this isolator in\ndetail, and compare measurements of the natural frequencies of a single stage\nwith calculations from the analytical model and the finite element package. For\ntranslations along and rotations about the longitudinal axes, all three results\nare in agreement to within 10% accuracy. \n\n"}
