The scattering is studied in the dual CFT description in the\norbifold limit for finite R, where R is the radius of the circle on which the\nD1 branes are wrapped.

For smaller (\\Delta E),\nthe answer depends on the particular microstate, which we examine for both\ntypical and atypical microstates.

Abstract: This paper explores whether Eguchi-Kawai reduction for gauge theories with\nadjoint fermions is valid. The Eguchi-Kawai reduction relates gauge theories in\ndifferent numbers of dimensions in the large $N$ limit provided that certain\nconditions are met. In principle, this relation opens up the possibility of\nlearning about the dynamics of 4D gauge theories through techniques only\navailable in lower dimensions. Dimensional reduction can be understood as a\nspecial case of large $N$ equivalence between theories related by an orbifold\nprojection. In this work, we focus on the simplest case of dimensional\nreduction, relating a 4D gauge theory to a 3D gauge theory via an orbifold\nprojection. A necessary condition for the large N equivalence between the 4D\nand 3D theories to hold is that certain discrete symmetries in the two theories\nmust not be broken spontaneously. In pure 4D Yang-Mills theory, these\nsymmetries break spontaneously as the size of one of the spacetime dimensions\nshrinks. An analysis of the effect of adjoint fermions on the relevant\nsymmetries of the 4D theory shows that the fermions help stabilize the\nsymmetries. We consider the same problem from the point of view of the lower\ndimensional 3D theory and find that, surprisingly, adjoint fermions are not\ngenerally enough to stabilize the necessary symmetries of the 3D theory.

The potential\nof the models is slowly varying, and the large-$N$ limit is taken with the\nslowly varying limit.\n  First, we explain our formalism, introducing an external field to detect\nspontaneous SUSY breaking, analogously to ordinary (bosonic) symmetry breaking.\nIt is observed that SUSY is possibly broken even in systems in less than\none-dimension, for example, discretized quantum mechanics with a finite number\nof discretized time steps.

For the derivation of the\nequations a computer program (DoDSE) was developed in order to handle the\nplethora of terms. The process of determining possible infrared solutions is\nabstracted to obtain further insight into the structure of the so-called\ninfrared scaling solutions. It is found that a few simple steps suffice to\ndetermine possible infrared scaling relations directly from the action. For the\nmaximally Abelian gauge an infrared enhanced diagonal gluon propagator is\nfound, while the off-diagonal degrees of freedom are infrared suppressed. This\nis in agreement with the idea of Abelian infrared dominance. Furthermore, it is\nproven that SU(2) and higher SU(N) have the same infrared behavior, although\nthe corresponding actions differ.

There are two global\nsymmetries: a $Z(2)_{H}$ symmetry associated with the Higgs field and a\n$Z(2)_{C}$ center symmetry. We analyze the order of the deconfining phase\ntransition when different deformation terms are used. After finding order\nparameters for the global symmetries, we show that there are four distinct\nphases: a deconfined phase, a confined phase, a Higgs phase, and a mixed\nconfined phase. The mixed confined phase occurs where one might expect a phase\nin which there is both confinement and the Higgs mechanism, but the behavior of\nthe order parameters distinguishes the two phases. In the mixed confined phase,\nthe $Z(2)_{C}\\times Z(2)_{H}$ global symmetry breaks spontaneously to a Z(2)\nsubgroup that acts non-trivially on both the scalar field and the Polyakov\nloop.

What we find, in four dimensions and in a rainbow\napproximation, is that stochastic quantization supports both solutions in\nLandau gauge but the scaling solution abruptly disappears when the parameter\ncontrolling the drift force is separated from zero (soft gauge-fixing),\nrecovering only the perturbative propagators; the massive solution seems to\nsurvive the extension outside Landau gauge. These results are consistent with\nthe scaling solution being related to the existence of a Gribov horizon, with\nthe massive one being more general.\n  We also examine the effective action in Faddeev-Popov quantization that\ngenerates the rainbow and we find, for a bare vertex approximation, that the\nthe massive-type solutions minimise the quantum effective action. \n\n"}

All expectations of chirally\nnon-invariant local fermion operators vanish identically, or, equivalently,\ntheir correlations cluster exponentially within the expansion implying absence\nof spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. The resulting phase at low $T$ may be\ndescribed as a \"quarkyonic\" matter phase. Some implications for the phase\ndiagram of $SU(N_c)$ theories are discussed. \n\n"}

The\nprocess of collapse is described by the radial evolution in the dual\nholographic theory. If the theory is in the same phase as the assumed IR fixed\npoint, the initial state is smoothly projected to the final state. If in a\ndifferent phase, the initial state undergoes a phase transition which in turn\ngives rise to a horizon in the bulk geometry. We demonstrate the connection\nbetween critical behavior and horizon in an example, by deriving the bulk\nmetrics that emerge in various phases of the U(N) vector model in the large N\nlimit based on the holographic dual constructed from quantum RG. The gapped\nphase exhibits a geometry that smoothly ends at a finite proper distance in the\nradial direction. The geometric distance in the radial direction measures a\ncomplexity : the depth of RG transformation that is needed to project the\ngenerally entangled UV state to a direct product state in the IR. For gapless\nstates, entanglement persistently spreads out to larger length scales, and the\ninitial state can not be projected to the direct product state. The obstruction\nto smooth projection at charge neutral point manifests itself as the long\nthroat in the anti-de Sitter space. The Poincare horizon at infinity marks the\ncritical point which exhibits a divergent length scale in the spread of\nentanglement. For the gapless states with non-zero chemical potential, the bulk\nspace becomes the Lifshitz geometry with the dynamical critical exponent two.\nThe identification of horizon as critical point may provide an explanation for\nthe universality of horizon.

We show that kink\nconfigurations employing Higgs fields in the 45 (the adjoint representation) of\nO(10) break up into three classes: those that at finite distances from the wall\nrespect a U(5) subgroup of SO(10), and two others that respect the smaller\nsubgroups U(3) x U(2) and U(4) x U(1). These smaller subgroups arise from the\nclash of symmetries mechanism: they are the intersections of two differently\nembedded U(5) subgroups of SO(10), the latter being the symmetries respected in\nasymptotia on opposite sides of the domain wall. The existence of the SO(10) ->\nU(3) x U(2) = SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)' = G_{SM} x U(1)' class advances the\nsearch for a realistic brane world model wherein some of the required symmetry\nbreaking is achieved via the clash of symmetries rather than the conventional\nmechanism.

Verch have proposed a method for implementing in\nalgebraic quantum field theory ideas from renormalization group analysis of\nshort-distance (high energy) behavior by passing to certain scaling limit\ntheories. Buchholz and Verch distinguish between different types of theories\nwhere the limit is unique, degenerate, or classical, and the method allows in\nprinciple to extract the `ultraparticle' content of a given model, i.e. to\nidentify particles (like quarks and gluons) that are not visible at finite\ndistances due to `confinement'. It is therefore of great importance for the\nphysical interpretation of the theory. The method has been illustrated in a\nsimple model in with some rather surprising results.\n  This paper will focus on the question how the short distance behavior of\nmodels defined by euclidean means is reflected in the corresponding behavior of\ntheir Minkowski counterparts. More specifically, we shall prove that if a\neuclidean theory has some short distance limit, then it is possible to pass\nfrom this limit theory to a theory on Minkowski space, which is a short\ndistance limit of the Minkowski space theory corresponding to the original\neuclidean theory. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/9908156", "contents": "Title: New Regularization Using Domain Wall Abstract: We present a new regularization method, for d dim (Euclidean) quantum field\ntheories in the continuum formalism, based on the domain wall configuration in\n(1+d) dim space-time. It is inspired by the recent progress in the chiral\nfermions on the lattice. The wall \"height\" is given by 1/M, where M is a\nregularization mass parameter and appears as a 1+d dim Dirac fermion mass. The\npresent approach gives a thermodynamic view to the domain wall or the overlap\nformalism in the lattice field theory. We will show qualitative correspondence\nbetween the present continuum results and those of the lattice. The extra\ndimension is regarded as the (inverse) temperature t. The domains are defined\nby the directions of the \"system movement\", not by the sign of M as in the\noriginal overlap formalism. Physically the parameter M controls both the\nchirality selection and the dimensional reduction to d dimension. From the\npoint of regularization, the limit $Mt\\ra 0$ regularize the infra-red behaviour\nwhereas the condition on the momentum ($k^\\m$) integral, $|k^\\m|\\leq M$,\nregularize the ultra-violet behaviour.\n  To check the new regularization works correctly, we take the 4 dim QED and 2\ndim chiral gauge theory as examples. Especially the consistent and covariant\nanomalies are correctly obtained. The choice of solutions of the higher dim\nDirac equation characterize the two anomalies. The projective properties of the\npositive and negative energy free solutions are exploited in calculation. Some\nintegral functions, the incomplete gamma functions and the generalized\nhypergeometric functions characteristically appear in the regularization\nprocedure. \n\n"}
