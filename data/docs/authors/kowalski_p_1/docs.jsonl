Using the accurate X-ray position allowed by\nSwift/XRT data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a M2 III star. Besides,\nthe combined use of the spectral information afforded by XRT and INTEGRAL/IBIS\nshows that the 0.5-200 keV spectrum of this source can be described with an\nabsorbed Comptonization model, usually found in LMXBs and, in particular, in\nSyXBs. No long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the IBIS\ndata. The time coverage afforded by XRT reveals shot-noise variability typical\nof accreting Galactic X-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore the\npresence of X-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. By\nusing the above information, we infer important parameters for this source such\nas its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and X-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the\n0.5-200 keV band), and we give a description for this system (typical of SyXBs)\nin which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind of\nits M-type giant companion.

Similarly, we find that the exponents of the third\norder structure functions for $u$ stay equal to unity for the all the Mach\nnumbers studied. The scaling of higher order correlations obeys the She-Leveque\n(1994) scalings corresponding to the two-dimensional dissipative structures,\nand this result does not change with the Mach number either. In contrast to $v$\nwhich exhibits different scaling parallel and perpendicular to the local\nmagnetic field, the scaling of $u$ is similar in both directions.

We investigate such an\nenvironmental impact on both real-space and redshift-space galaxy clustering\nstatistics using a semi-analytic model derived from the Millennium Simulation.\nWe compare clustering statistics from original SAM galaxy samples and shuffled\nones with environmental influence on galaxy properties eliminated.

We seek to understand this\ndiversity of outer edge profiles under the ``natural'' collisional evolution of\nthe system, without invoking external agents such as planets or gas. We use a\nstatistical code to follow the evolution of a collisional population, ranging\nfrom dust grains (submitted to radiation pressure) to planetesimals and\ninitially confined within a belt (the 'birth ring'). The system typically\nevolves toward a \"standard\" steady state, with no sharp edge and SB \\propto\nr**-3.5 outside the birth ring. Deviations from this standard profile, in the\nform of a sharp outer edge and a steeper fall-off, occur only when two\nparameters take their extreme values: 1) When the birth ring is so massive that\nit becomes radially optically thick for the smallest grains. However, the\nrequired disc mass is here probably too high to be realistic. 2) When the\ndynamical excitation of the dust-producing planetesimals is so low (<e> <0.01)\nthat the smallest grains, which otherwise dominate the total optical depth, are\npreferentially depleted.

M1-78 is a high-density nebula with\nsubstantial physical differences between its two main morphological zones: a\nbright arc to the SW and a blob of emission in the NE. Specifically, the blob\nin the NE has a higher electron temperature and visual extinction than the SW\narc. The most important result, however, is the confirmation of a nitrogen\nenrichment in M1-78. This enrichment is stronger at the location of the NE blob\nand is correlated with a defficiency in the O abundance and a (dubious) He\nenrichment. Such an abundance pattern is typical of ejecta nebulae around\nevolved massive stars such as Wolf-Rayet and Luminous Blue Variable stars. The\nspatial variations in the physical conditions and chemical abundances and the\npresence of more than one possible ionizing source indicates, however, that\nM1-78 is better described as a combination of a compact HII region + ejecta.\nFinally, we detect H2 emission that extends over a large (~30 arcsec) area\naround the ionized nebula.

{"id": "0802.3387", "contents": "Title: An alternative method to study star cluster disruption Abstract: Many embedded star clusters do not evolve into long-lived bound clusters. The\nmost popular explanation for this \"infant mortality\" of young clusters is the\nexpulsion of natal gas by stellar winds and supernovae, which leaves up to 90%\nof them unbound. A cluster disruption model has recently been proposed in which\nthis mass- independent disruption of clusters proceeds for another Gyr after\ngas expulsion. In this scenario, the survival chances of massive clusters are\nmuch smaller than in the traditional mass-dependent disruption models. The most\ncommon way to study cluster disruption is to use the cluster age distribution,\nwhich, however, can be heavily affected by incompleteness. To avoid this, we\nintroduce a new method, based on size-of-sample effects, namely the relation\nbetween the most massive cluster, M_max, and the age range sampled. Assuming\nthat clusters are sampled from a power-law initial mass function, with index -2\nand that the cluster formation rate is constant, M_max scales with the age\nrange sampled, such that the slope in a log(M_max) vs. log(age) plot is equal\nto unity. This slope decreases if mass-independent disruption is included. For\n90% mass-independent cluster disruption per age dex, the predicted slope is\nzero. For the solar neighbourhood, SMC, LMC, M33, and M83, based on ages and\nmasses taken from the literature, we find slopes consistent with the expected\nsize-of-sample correlations for the first 100 Myr, hence ruling out the 90%\nmass-independent cluster disruption scenario. For M51, however, the increase of\nlog(M_max) with log(age) is slightly shallower and for the Antennae galaxies it\nis flat. This simple method shows that the formation and/or disruption of\nclusters in the Antennae must have been very different from that of the other\ngalaxies studied here, so it should not be taken as a representative case. \n\n"}

In particular, one can this way\nobtain afterglow light curves with steep decays followed by the more\nconventional flatter afterglow slopes, while at the same time preserving the\ndesirable features of the model, i.e. the well defined relativistic electron\nsource and radiative processes that produce the proper peak in the $\\nu\nF_{\\nu}$ spectra.

I estimate a planet-to-star radii ratio of\n0.1433 +/- 0.0010, a ratio of the planet's orbital semimajor axis to the host\nstar radius of 4.751 +/- 0.045, and an orbital inclination for the planet of\n83.88 +/- 0.29 deg. The observed transit times are consistent with CoRoT-1b\nhaving a constant period and there is no evidence of an additional planet in\nthe system. I use the observed constancy of the transit times to set limits on\nthe mass of a hypothetical additional planet in a nearby, stable orbit. I\nascertain that the most stringent limits (4 M_earth at 3 sigma confidence) can\nbe placed on planets residing in a 1:2 mean motion resonance with the\ntransiting planet. In contrast, the data yield less stringent limits on planets\nnear a 1:3 mean motion resonance (5 M_jup at 3 sigma confidence) than in the\nsurrounding parameter space. In addition, I use a simulation to investigate\nwhat sensitivity to additional planets could be obtained from the analysis of\ndata measured for a similar system during a CoRoT long run (100 sequential\ntransit times). I find that for such a scenario, planets with masses greater\nthan twice that of Mars (0.2 M_earth) in the 1:2 mean motion resonance would\ncause high-significance transit time deviations. Therefore, such planets could\nbe detected or ruled out using CoRoT long run data.

Abstract: Many competing linear instabilities are likely to occur in astrophysical\nsettings, and it is important to assess which one grows faster for a given\nsituation. An analytical model including the main beam plasma instabilities is\ndeveloped. The full 3D dielectric tensor is thus explained for a cold\nrelativistic electron beam passing through a cold plasma, accounting for a\nguiding magnetic field, a return electronic current and moving protons.\nConsidering any orientations of the wave vector allows to retrieve the most\nunstable mode for any parameters set. An unified description of the\nFilamentation (Weibel), Two-Stream, Buneman, Bell instabilities (and more) is\nthus provided, allowing for the exact determination of their hierarchy in terms\nof the system parameters. For relevance to both real situations and PIC\nsimulations, the electron-to-proton mass ratio is treated as a parameter, and\nnumerical calculations are conducted with two different values, namely 1/1836\nand 1/100. In the system parameters phase space, the shape of the domains\ngoverned by each kind of instability is far from being trivial. For low density\nbeams, the ultra-magnetized regime tends to be governed by either the\nTwo-Stream or the Buneman instabilities. For beam densities equalling the\nplasma one, up to four kinds of modes are likely to play a role, depending of\nthe beam Lorentz factor. In some regions of the system parameters phase space,\nthe dominant mode may vary with the electron-to-proton mass ratio.

Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion.

The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution\nchemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which\nwell reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of\nmodel galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also\ncollisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical\nenrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size\ndistributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction\nreduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a\nfactor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks\nincreases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2.

These results\nare well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at\n1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs.

In this\nreview we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric\ncomposition.

Among the 28 sBzKs observed, Ha\nemission was detected in 14 objects, and for 11 of them the [NII]6583 was also\nmeasured. Multiwavelength photometry was also used to derive stellar masses and\nextinction parameters, whereas Ha and [NII] have allowed us to estimate SFR,\nmetallicities, ionization mechanisms, and dynamical masses. In order to enforce\nagreement between SFRs from Ha with those derived from rest-frame UV and MIR,\nadditional obscuration for the emission lines (that originate in HII regions)\nwas required compared to the extinction derived from the slope of the UV\ncontinuum. We have also derived the stellar mass-metallicity relation, as well\nas the relation between stellar mass and specific SFR, and compared them to the\nresults in other studies. At a given stellar mass, the sBzKs appear to have\nbeen already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star-forming\ngalaxies of similar mass.

The dominant lensing-only contribution beyond the zero-order\napproximation is the reduced shear, which takes into account not only\nlensing-induced distortions but also isotropic magnification of galaxy images.\nThis involves an integral over the matter bispectrum. We provide a fast and\ngeneral way to calculate this correction term.\n  Methods. Using a model for the matter bispectrum, we fit elementary functions\nto the reduced-shear contribution and its derivatives with respect to\ncosmological parameters.

To recover these observations we apply an\nempirical star formation efficiency in galaxies that scales with the host halo\nvelocity dispersion as $\\propto 1/\\sigma^3$ during galaxy mergers. We find that\nthis modification needs to be of stochastic nature to reproduce the\nobservations, i.e. only applied during mergers and not during accretion driven\nstar formation phases.

Basic products are the dust temperature map, the dust\noptical depth map, and the colour-colour diagram. The main features are as\nfollows. (i) The dust temperature derived from the total fluxes at 90 {\\mu}m\nand 140 {\\mu}m reflects the relatively low temperatures seen in the interarm\nand spiral arms excluding the warm spots, rather than the high temperatures in\nwarm spots and the centre. This indicates that the total FIR luminosity is\ndominated by the dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field.

Owing to its lower background level, Suzaku has\nbetter sensitivity to Fe K-alpha lines than other satellites. Using precise Fe\nline measurements, we studied the temperature structure, possible bulk motions,\nand iron abundance distributions in the intracluster medium (ICM). The observed\nspectra were well-represented by a single-temperature model, and two- or three-\ntemperature model did not improve chi-square substantially. The temperature,\nderived from K-alpha line ratios of H-like and He-like Fe, agree with those\nderived from the single-temperature model. Because the line ratio is a steep\nfunction of temperature, the consistency supports the accuracy of temperature\nmeasurements conducted with Suzaku. Within the 34'region, the redshift derived\nfrom the central energy of the He-like Fe line is consistent with that from\noptical observations, within a calibration error of 18 eV or 818 km/s in the\nline of sight. This value is smaller than the sound velocity of ICM, which is\n1500 km/s. The central energy of Fe lines at the 44'offset region around the\nNGC 4839 subcluster is also consistent with those within the 34'region.

We find that the\nmajority of objects (~60-70%) is better fit with SEDs accounting for nebular\nemission; the remaining galaxies are found to show relatively weak or no\nemission lines. Our modeling, and supporting empirical evidence, suggests the\nexistence of two categories of galaxies, \"starbursts\" and \"post-starbursts\"\n(lower SFR and older galaxies) among the LBG population, and relatively short\nstar-formation timescales. \n\n"}

We utilize merger trees to isolate the last merger for each\ncluster in our sample and follow the time evolution of the hydrostatic mass\nbias as the systems relax. We find that during a merger, a shock propagates\noutward from the parent cluster, resulting in an overestimate in the\nhydrostatic mass bias. After the merger, as a cluster relaxes, the bias in\nhydrostatic mass estimate decreases but remains at a level of -5-10% with\n15-20% scatter within r500. We also investigate the post-merger evolution of\nthe pressure support from bulk motions, a dominant cause of this residual mass\nbias. At r500, the contribution from random motions peaks at 30% of the total\npressure during the merger and quickly decays to \\sim 10-15% as a cluster\nrelaxes.

We start from the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation and integrate out short modes of a dark\nmatter/dark energy dominated universe (LambdaCDM) whose matter is comprised of\nmassive particles as used in cosmological simulations. This establishes a long\ndistance effective fluid, valid for length scales larger than the non-linear\nscale ~ 10 Mpc, and provides the complete description of large scale structure\nformation. Extracting the time dependence, we derive recursion relations that\nencode the perturbative solution. This is exact for the matter dominated era\nand quite accurate in LambdaCDM also. The effective fluid is characterized by\nphysical parameters, including sound speed and viscosity. These two fluid\nparameters play a degenerate role with each other and lead to a relative\ncorrection from standard perturbation theory of the form ~ 10^{-6}c^2k^2/H^2.\nStarting from the linear theory, we calculate corrections to cosmological\nobservables, such as the baryon-acoustic-oscillation peak, which we compute\nsemi-analytically at one-loop order.

Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions achieve high\nlocal star formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound clusters.\nStar-forming regions of lower density remain substructured and gas-rich, ending\nup unbound when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the tidal\nperturbation of star-forming regions by nearby, dense giant molecular clouds\nimposes a minimum density contrast required for the collapse to a bound\ncluster. The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar\nclusters (the cluster formation efficiency or CFE) follows by integration of\nthese local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum\nof the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a\nfunction of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the\ngas surface density, from ~1% in low-density galaxies to a peak value of ~70%\nat densities of ~10^3 Msun pc^-2. This explains the observation that the CFE\nincreases with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf, spiral, and\nstarburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our model results with observed galaxies\nyields excellent agreement. The model is applied further by calculating the\nspatial variation of the CFE within single galaxies.

We suggest that\nthis apparent discrepancy reflects the situation that the low energy electrons\nbefore accelerated by the DSA-like mechanism are responsible for the radio\nsynchrotron emission from young SNe, and that studying young SNe sheds light on\nthe still-unresolved electron injection problem in the acceleration theory of\ncosmic rays. We suggest that electron's energy distribution could be flattened\ntoward the high energy, most likely around 100 MeV, which marks a transition\nfrom inefficient to efficient acceleration. Identifying this feature will be a\nmajor advance in understanding the electron acceleration mechanism. We suggest\ntwo further probes: (1) mm/sub-mm observations in the first year after the\nexplosion, and (2) X-ray observations at about 1 year and thereafter.

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates.

The wakes, which are excited by the planets, are damped by\nshocks similar to the wake damping in inviscid hydrodynamic (HD) disks. Angular\nmomentum deposition by shock damping opens gaps in both MHD turbulent disks and\ninviscid HD disks even for low mass planets, in contradiction to the \"thermal\ncriterion\" for gap opening. To test the \"viscous criterion\", we compared gap\nproperties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same\nstress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and\nwider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This\ndifference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap\nregion in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective \\alpha within the gap. Thus,\nacross the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density\nprofile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance\nthe planetary torque density. We also confirmed the large excess torque close\nto the planet in MHD disks, and found that long-lived density features (termed\nzonal flows) produced by the MRI can affect planet migration.

In Phase I of the experiment eight semi-coaxial and five BEGe type\ndetectors have been deployed. The latter type is used in this field of research\nfor the first time. All detectors are made from material with enriched ^{76}Ge\nfraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse\nshape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events.

We extend further\nthe formalism of the gSR in the self-similar model for X-ray galaxy clusters,\nshowing that for a generic relation M_tot ~ L^a M_g^b T^c, where L, M_g and T\nare the gas luminosity, mass and temperature, respectively, the values of the\nslopes lay in the plane 4*a+3*b+2*c=3. Using published dataset, we show that\nsome projections of the gSR are the most efficient relations, holding among\nobserved physical X-ray quantities, to recover the cluster mass. This\nconclusion is based on the evidence that they provide the lowest chi^2, the\nlowest total scatter and the lowest intrinsic scatter among the studied scaling\nlaws on both galaxy group and cluster mass scales. By the application of the\ngSR, the intrinsic scatter is reduced in all the cases down to a relative error\non M_tot below 16 per cent. The best-fit relations are: M_tot ~ M_g^a\nT^{1.5-1.5a}, with a~0.4, and M_tot ~ L^a T^{1.5-2a}, with a~0.15. As a by\nproduct of this study, we provide the estimates of the gravitating mass at\nDelta=500 for 120 objects (50 from the Mahdavi et al. 2013 sample, 16 from\nMaughan 2012; 31 from Pratt et al. 2009; 23 from Sun et al. 2009), 114 of which\nare unique entries.

Finally, we demonstrate some potential applications of the code;\nfirst, using results of surveys at different observing frequencies, we find\npulsar spectral indices are best fit by a normal distribution with mean $-1.4$\nand standard deviation $1.0$. Second, we model pulsar spin evolution to\ncalculate the best-fit for a relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and\nspin parameters.

It appears possible that some of them originate from stellar\nexplosions induced by the pair instability mechanism. Recent stellar evolution\nmodels also predict pair instability supernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars\nat fairly high metallicities (i.e. Z~0.004). We provide supernova (SN) models\nand synthetic light curves for two progenitor models, a 150 Msun red-supergiant\nand a 250 Msun yellow-supergiant at a metallicity of Z=0.001, for which the\nevolution from the main sequence to collapse, and the initiation of the PISN\nitself, has been previously computed in a realistic and self-consistent way. We\nare using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA to describe the SN evolution\nof both models over a time frame of about 500 days. We describe the\nshock-breakout phases of both SNe which are characterized by a higher\nluminosity, a longer duration and a lower effective temperature than those of\nordinary SNeIIP. We derive the bolometric as well as the U, B, V, R and I light\ncurves of our PISN models, which show a long-lasting plateau phase with maxima\nat Mbol=-19.3 mag and -21.3 mag for our lower and higher mass model,\nrespectively. We also describe the photospheric composition and velocity as\nfunction of time. We conclude that the light curve of the explosion of our\ninitially 150 Msun star resembles those of relatively bright SNeIIP, whereas\nits photospheric velocity at early times is smaller. Its 56Ni mass of 0.04 Msun\nalso falls well into the range found in ordinary core collapse SNe. The light\ncurve and photospheric velocity of our 250 Msun models has a striking\nresemblance with that of the superluminous SN2007bi, strengthening its\ninterpretation as PISN.

The retardation\nspectrometer aSPECT consists, inter alia, of a superconducting magnet system\nthat produces a strong longitudinal magnetic field of up to 6.2T. In order not\nto disturb other experiments in the vicinity of aSPECT, we had to develop a\nmagnetic field return yoke for the magnet system.

HD 142527 is a\nyoung star that offers a scaled-up view of this process. It has a broad,\nasymmetric ring of gas and dust beyond \\about 100 AU and a wide inner gap.\nWithin the gap, a low-mass stellar companion orbits the primary star at just\n\\about 12 AU, and both the primary and secondary are accreting gas. In an\nattempt to directly detect the dusty counterpart to this accreted gas, we have\nobserved HD 142527 with the Gemini Planet Imager in polarized light at $Y$ band\n(0.95-1.14 \\microns). We clearly detect the companion in total intensity and\nshow that its position and photometry are generally consistent with the\nexpected values. We also detect a point-source in polarized light that may be\nspatially separated by \\about a few AU from the location of the companion in\ntotal intensity. This suggests that dust is likely falling onto or orbiting the\ncompanion. Given the possible contribution of scattered light from this dust to\npreviously reported photometry of the companion, the current mass limits should\nbe viewed as upper limits only. If the dust near the companion is eventually\nconfirmed to be spatially separated, this system would resemble a scaled-up\nversion of the young planetary system inside the gap of the transition disk\naround LkCa 15. \n\n"}

The important wavelength scales of turbulence,\nboth those that stimulate neutrino transformations and those that suppress\nthem, are presented and discussed.

At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points.

The halo is due to charged secondaries,\nmany of them protons, from elastic interactions with H, elastic and inelastic\ninteractions with O, and nonelastic interactions with O. We show that the halo\nradius is roughly one third of the beam range. The aura is due to neutral\nsecondaries (neutrons and gamma rays). Spray denotes dose, avoidable in\nprinciple, coming in from the beam line.\n  We have measured the absolute dose at 177 MeV using a test beam in a water\ntank. The beam monitor was a PPIC 'proton counter' and the field IC a dose\ncalibrated Exradin T1. We took depth-dose scans at ten displacements from the\nbeam axis ranging from 0 to 10 cm. The dose spans five orders of magnitude, and\nthe transition from halo to aura is obvious.\n  We present model-dependent (MD) and model-independent (MI) fits to these\ndata.

The electromagnetic\n(Bethe-Bloch) mass stopping power should be used instead. In consequence,\n'Bragg peak chamber' measurements and associated corrections are, in our view,\nirrelevant.

Interstellar turbulence is non-universal, with a wide range of\nMach numbers, magnetic fields strengths, and driving mechanisms. Although some\nof these parameters were explored, most previous works assumed that the gas is\nisothermal. However, we know that cold molecular clouds form out of the warm\natomic medium, with the gas passing through chemical and thermodynamic phases\nthat are not isothermal. Here we determine the role of temperature variations\nby modelling non-isothermal turbulence with a polytropic equation of state\n(EOS), where pressure and temperature are functions of gas density,\nP~rho^Gamma, T~rho^(Gamma-1). We use grid resolutions of 2048^3 cells and\ncompare polytropic exponents Gamma=0.7 (soft EOS), Gamma=1 (isothermal EOS),\nand Gamma=5/3 (stiff EOS). We find a complex network of non-isothermal\nfilaments with more small-scale fragmentation occurring for Gamma<1, while\nGamma>1 smoothes out density contrasts. The density probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) is significantly affected by temperature variations, with a\npower-law tail developing at low densities for Gamma>1. In contrast, the PDF\nbecomes closer to a lognormal distribution for Gamma<=1. We derive and test a\nnew density variance - Mach number relation that takes Gamma into account. This\nnew relation is relevant for theoretical models of the SFR and IMF, because it\ndetermines the dense gas mass fraction of a cloud, from which stars form. We\nderive the SFR as a function of Gamma and find that it decreases by a factor of\n~5 from Gamma=0.7 to Gamma=5/3. \n\n"}

These jets are deflected into the tail region by the motion\nof the Sun through the ISM similar to bent galactic jets moving through the\nintergalactic medium. The interstellar wind blows the two jets into the tail\nbut is not strong enough to force the lobes into a single comet-like tail, as\nhappens to some astrophysical jets (Morsony et al. 2013).

The dynamics of such perturbations are governed\nby a scalar wave equation on an effective curved background geometry determined\nby the acoustic metric, which is constructed from the spacetime metric and the\nparticle density and four-velocity of the fluid. For the problem under\nconsideration in this article the acoustic metric has the same qualitative\nfeatures as an asymptotically flat, static and spherically symmetric black\nhole, and thus it represents a natural astrophysical analogue black hole.\n  As for the case of a scalar field propagating on a Schwarzschild background,\nwe show that acoustic perturbations of the Michel flow exhibit quasi-normal\noscillations.

Our results for the fundamental frequencies are compared to\nthose obtained from an independent numerical Cauchy evolution, finding good\nagreement between the two approaches.

The ratio of primordial to enriched\nstars thus has a U-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near the\nhalf-light radius. N-body simulations show that mass segregation might produce\na trend resembling the observed one, but only if the N-enhanced giants are\n~0.25 Mo less massive than the primordial giants, which requires extreme He\nenhancement (Y~0.40).

Thus the commercialization of GEMs has been established by Tech-Etch\nof Plymouth, MA, USA using single-mask techniques.\n  We report on the electrical and geometrical properties, along with the inner\nand outer hole diameter size uniformity of 10 $\\times$ 10 cm$^2$ and\n40$\\times$40 cm$^2$ GEM foils. The Tech-Etch foils were found to have excellent\nelectrical properties. The measured mean optical properties were found to\nreflect the desired parameters and are consistent with those measured in\ndouble-mask GEM foils, and show good hole diameter uniformity over the active\narea. These foils are well suited for future applications in nuclear and\nparticle physics where tracking devices are needed. \n\n"}

Earlier\nworks on this method has so far gained some promising results derived from the\napproximating expressions for the power spectra among others, up to second\norder with respect to the Hubble and sound flow parameters, when compared to\nother semi-analytical approaches (e.g., Green's function and WKB methods).\nHowever, a closer inspection is suggestive that there is a problem when\nhigher-order parts of the power spectra are considered; residual logarithmic\ndivergences may come out that can render the prediction physically\ninconsistent. Looking at this possibility, we map out up to what order with\nrespect to the mentioned parameters several physical quantities can be\ncalculated before hitting a logarithmically divergent result. It turns out that\nthe power spectra are limited up to second order, the tensor-to-scalar ratio up\nto third order, and the spectral indices and running converge to all orders.\nThis indicates that the expansion scheme is incompatible with the working\nequations derived from UA for the power spectra but compatible with that of the\nspectral indices. For those quantities that involve logarithmically divergent\nterms in the higher-order parts, existing results in the literature for the\nconvergent lower-order parts calculated in the equivalent fashion should be\nviewed with some caution; they do not rest on solid mathematical ground. \n\n"}

Since the photodissociation rate of H_2^+ depends on its level\npopulation, we take full account of the vibrationally-resolved H_2^+ kinetics.\nWe find that in clouds under soft but intense radiation fields with spectral\ntemperature T_rad < 7000 K, the H_2^+ channel is the dominant H_2 formation\nprocess. On the other hand, for harder spectra with T_rad > 7000 K, the H^-\nchannel takes over H_2^+ in the production of molecular hydrogen. We calculate\nthe critical radiation intensity needed for supermassive star formation by\ndirect collapse and examine its dependence on the H_2^+ level population.

Dust concentration Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of large dust grains in massive lopsided\ntransition discs via 2D hydrodynamical simulations including both gas and dust.\nOur simulations adopt a ring-like gas density profile that becomes unstable\nagainst the Rossby-wave instability and forms a large crescent-shaped vortex.\nWhen gas self-gravity is discarded, but the indirect force from the\ndisplacement of the star by the vortex is included, we confirm that dust grains\nwith stopping times of order the orbital time, which should be typically a few\ncentimetres in size, are trapped ahead of the vortex in the azimuthal\ndirection, while the smallest and largest grains concentrate towards the vortex\ncentre. We obtain maximum shift angles of about 25 degrees. Gas self-gravity\naccentuates the concentration differences between small and large grains. At\nlow to moderate disc masses, the larger the grains, the farther they are\ntrapped ahead of the vortex. Shift angles up to 90 degrees are reached for 10\ncm-sized grains, and we show that such large offsets can produce a\ndouble-peaked continuum emission observable at mm/cm wavelengths. This\nbehaviour comes about because the large grains undergo horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex due to the vortex's gravity. At large disc masses, since\nthe vortex's pattern frequency becomes increasingly slower than Keplerian,\nsmall grains concentrate slightly beyond the vortex and large grains form\ngenerally non-axisymmetric ring-like structures around the vortex's radial\nlocation. Gas self-gravity therefore imparts distinct trapping locations for\nsmall and large dust grains which may be probed by current and future\nobservations, and which suggest that the formation of planetesimals in vortices\nmight be more difficult than previously thought. \n\n"}

However, the inevitable momentum spread of secondary ions\nlimits the precision of nuclear masses determined by using IMS.

Brown dwarfs are observed to\nemit cyclotron radio emission. We show that signatures of strong transient\natmospheric ionisation events (flash ionisation) can be imprinted on a\npre-existing radiation. Detection of such flash ionisation events will open\ninvestigations into the ionisation state and atmospheric dynamics. Such\nionisation events can also result from explosion shock waves, bursts or\neruptions. We present an analytical model that describes the modulation of a\npre-existing electromagnetic radiation by a time-dependent (flash) conductivity\nthat is characteristic for flash ionisation events like lightning. Our\nconductivity model reproduces the conductivity function derived from\nobservations of Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes, and is applicable to\nastrophysical objects with strong temporal variations in the local ionization,\nas in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks. We show that the field\nresponds with a characteristic flash-shaped pulse to a conductivity flash of\nintermediate intensity. More powerful ionisation events result in smaller\nvariations of the initial radiation, or in its damping. We show that the\ncharacteristic damping of the response field for high-power initial radiation\ncarries information about the ionisation flash magnitude and duration. The\nduration of the pulse amplification or the damping is consistently shorter for\nlarger conductivity variations and can be used to evaluate the intensity of the\nflash ionisation.

A recombination model is\ndeveloped to explain the recombination probability as a function of recoil\nenergy at zero field and non-zero field. The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that\nthe volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma\neffect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the\nionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the\ninterior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the\nplasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero\nfield is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear\nrecoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We\nshow a weak field-dependence of the plasma time for nuclear recoils and a\nstronger field-dependence of the plasma time for electronic recoils. As a\nresult, the time-dependent recombination is implemented in the determination of\ncharge and light yield with a generic model.

Gravitational wave bursts\nfrom high redshifts ($z \\gtrsim 1$) can be strongly magnified by gravitational\nlensing due to intervening galaxies along the line of sight. In the absence of\nelectromagnetic counterparts, the mergers' intrinsic mass scale and redshift\nare degenerate with the unknown magnification factor $\\mu$.

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important.

The most advanced of these proposals have very similar\nsetups, in which a proton beam strikes a target yielding neutrons which are\nabsorbed by a high isotopic purity 7Li converter, yielding 8Li whose resulting\ndecay yields the antineutrinos. In this note, we use FLUKA and GEANT4\nsimulations to investigate three proposed modifications of this standard\nproposal. In the first, the 7Li is replaced with 7Li compounds including a\ndeuterium moderator. In the second, a gap is placed between the target and the\nconverter to reduce the neutron bounce-back. Finally, we consider cooling the\nconverter with liquid nitrogen. We find that these modifications can increase\nthe antineutrino yield by as much as 50 percent.

The physical difference\nbetween the two cases is that in the former case the generated waves are\nemitted in respect to the local direction of magnetic field, in the latter in\nrespect to the mean field.

The experiment is being designed with an\ninitial sensitivity to nuclear recoil cross sections ~ 1 x 10$^{-43}$ cm$^2$\nfor a dark matter particle mass of 1 GeV/c$^2$, and with capacity to continue\nexploration to both smaller masses and better sensitivities. The phonon\nsensitivity of the HV detectors will be sufficient to detect nuclear recoils\nfrom sub-GeV dark matter. A detailed calibration of the detector response to\nlow energy recoils will be needed to optimize running conditions of the HV\ndetectors and to interpret their data for dark matter searches. Low-activity\nshielding, and the depth of SNOLAB, will reduce most backgrounds, but\ncosmogenically produced $^{3}$H and naturally occurring $^{32}$Si will be\npresent in the detectors at some level. Even if these backgrounds are x10\nhigher than expected, the science reach of the HV detectors would be over three\norders of magnitude beyond current results for a dark matter mass of 1\nGeV/c$^2$.

This enables us\nto investigate how the population of these objects was built up over cosmic\ntime. We find that the evolution of the number density depends on the galaxy\nmean surface stellar mass density, Sigma. In particular, dense (Sigma > 2000\nM_sun pc^-2) MPGs show a constant comoving number density over this redshift\nrange, whilst this increases by a factor ~ 4 for the least dense objects,\ndefined as having Sigma < 1000 M_sun pc^-2. We estimate stellar ages for the\nMPG population both fitting the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and through\nthe D4000_n index, obtaining results in good agreement. Our findings are\nconsistent with passive ageing of the stellar content of dense MPGs. We show\nthat at any redshift the less dense MPGs are younger than dense ones and that\ntheir stellar populations evolve at a slower rate than predicted by passive\nevolution. This points to a scenario in which the overall population of MPGs\nwas built up over the cosmic time by continuous addition of less dense\ngalaxies: on top of an initial population of dense objects that passively\nevolves, new, larger, and younger MPGs continuously join the population at\nlater epochs.

We conclude that both DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius\nrelation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs.

{"id": "1701.03418", "contents": "Title: Direct Probe of Dark Energy through Gravitational Lensing Effect Abstract: We show that gravitational lensing can provide a direct method to probe the\nnature of dark energy at astrophysical scales. For lensing system as an\nisolated astrophysical object, we derive the dark energy contribution to\ngravitational potential as a repulsive power-law term, containing a generic\nequation of state parameter $w$. We find that it generates $w$-dependent and\nposition-dependent modification to the conventional light orbital equation of\n$w=-1$. With post-Newtonian approximation, we compute its direct effect for an\nisolated lensing system at astrophysical scales and find that the dark energy\nforce can deflect the path of incident light rays. We demonstrate that the\ndark-energy-induced deflection angle $\\Delta\\alpha_{DE}^{}\\propto\nM^{(1+\\frac{1}{3w})}$ (with $1+\\frac{1}{3w}>0$), which increases with the\nlensing mass $M$ and consistently approaches zero in the limit $M \\to 0$.

This is in contrast to the conventional\nconvex lensing effect caused by both visible and dark matter. Measuring such\nconcave lensing effect can directly probe the existence and nature of dark\nenergy. We estimate this effect and show that the current gravitational lensing\nexperiments are sensitive to the direct probe of dark energy at astrophysical\nscales.

Therefore,\nmulti-wavelength resolved images of nearby debris systems provide an essential\nfoundation to understand the intricate interplay between collisional,\ngravitational, and radiative forces that govern debris disk structures. We\npresent the SOFIA 35 um resolved disk image of epsilon Eri, the closest debris\ndisk around a star similar to the early Sun. Combining with the Spitzer\nresolved image at 24 um and 15-38 um excess spectrum, we examine two proposed\norigins of the inner debris in epsilon Eri: (1) in-situ planetesimal belt(s)\nand (2) dragged-in grains from the cold outer belt.

The approach is based on the \\emph{entangled state\nansatz}, representing a coarse-grained definition of primordial \\emph{dark\ntemperature} associated to an \\emph{effective entangled energy density}. The\ndark temperature definition comes from assuming either Von Neumann or linear\nentropy as sources of cosmological thermodynamics.

We employ dust radiative\ntransfer calculations in which the SEDs of the stars in galaxies propagate\nthrough the dusty interstellar medium. Our main goals are to understand the\norigin of, and scatter in the IRX-beta relation; to assess the efficacy of\nsimplified stellar population synthesis screen models in capturing the\nessential physics in the IRX-beta relation; and to understand systematic\ndeviations from the canonical local IRX-beta relations in particular\npopulations of high-redshift galaxies. Our main results follow. Galaxies that\nhave young stellar populations with relatively cospatial UV and IR emitting\nregions and a Milky Way-like extinction curve fall on or near the standard\nMeurer relation. This behaviour is well captured by simplified screen models.\nScatter in the IRX-beta relation is dominated by three major effects: (i) older\nstellar populations drive galaxies below the relations defined for local\nstarbursts due to a reddening of their intrinsic UV SEDs; (ii) complex\ngeometries in high-z heavily star forming galaxies drive galaxies toward blue\nUV slopes owing to optically thin UV sightlines; (iii) shallow extinction\ncurves drive galaxies downward in the IRX-beta plane due to lowered NUV/FUV\nextinction ratios. We use these features of the UV slopes of galaxies to derive\na fitting relation that reasonably collapses the scatter back toward the\ncanonical local relation.

We investigate\nthe star formation histories of forming GCs. The principal results are as\nfollows. About 30 Myr after the formation of the first generation (1G) of stars\nwithin a particular GC, new stars can be formed from ejecta from asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars of 1G. However, the formation of this second\ngeneration (2G) of stars can last only for [10-20] Myr, because the most\nmassive SNe of 2G expel all of the remaining gas. The third generation (3G) of\nstars are then formed from AGB ejecta ~ 30$ Myr after the truncation of 2G star\nformation. This cycle of star formation followed by its truncation by SNe can\ncontinue until all AGB ejecta is removed from the GC by some physical process.\nThus, it is inevitable that GCs have discrete multiple stellar populations in\nthe [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] diagram.

Starspot activity produces quasi-sinusoidal light curves whose phase and\namplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We\nused a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of\nthe light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of\nstarspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the\ntemperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in\nparticular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with\ncurrent theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay.

The conversion of a parallax measurement into a distance, or\ndistance probability distribution, has led to a debate quite similar to the one\ninvolving Cepheids, centering on the question whether priors can be used when\ndiscussing a single system. With the example of PSRJ0218+4232 we show that a\nprior is necessary to determine the probability distribution for the distance.\nThe distance of this pulsar implies a gamma-ray luminosity larger than 10% of\nits spindown luminosity.

We\npropose that merging two neutron stars into a hyper-massive quark star (QS) and\nthen collapsing into a black hole (BH), with a delay time around $10^4$~s,\ncould be responsible for those X-ray components. The hyper-massive QS is\ninitially in a fluid state, being turbulent and differentially rotating, but\nwould be solidified and release its latent heat injected into the GRB fireball\n(lasting about $10^3$~s during the liquid-solid phase transition).

While models have long predicted that a BNS merger could produce a\nkilonova (KN), we have not been able to definitively test these models until\nnow. From one day to four days after the merger, we took five spectra of AT\n2017gfo before it faded away, which was possible because it was at a distance\nof only 39.5 Mpc in the galaxy NGC 4993. The spectra evolve from blue\n($\\sim6400$K) to red ($\\sim3500$K) over the three days we observed. The spectra\nare relatively featureless --- some weak features exist in our latest spectrum,\nbut they are likely due to the host galaxy. However, a simple blackbody is not\nsufficient to explain our data: another source of luminosity or opacity is\nnecessary. Predictions from simulations of KNe qualitatively match the observed\nspectroscopic evolution after two days past the merger, but underpredict the\nblue flux in our earliest spectrum.

Delay-and-Sum (DAS) is the most\nprevalent algorithm due to its simple implementation, but it leads to low\nquality images. Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS) provides a higher image quality\nin comparison with DAS while it imposes a computational burden of O(M^2).

A\nsurprisingly high fraction of disks that have been well-studied in scattered\nlight have spiral arms of some kind (8/29), as do a high fraction (6/11) of\nwell-studied Herbig intermediate mass stars (i.e., Herbig stars $>\n1.5M_\\odot$).

If two-arm spirals are produced by such giant planets,\nthis discrepancy suggests that giant planets are much fainter than predicted by\nhot start models.

To these\ndata we added near- and mid-infrared photometry, collected H$\\alpha$ equivalent\nwidths and line profiles, and their binarity status. In addition, we developed\na photometric variability indicator from Gaia's DR2 information.

We find that high mass stars have a much smaller infrared excess and have\nmuch lower optical variabilities compared to lower mass stars, with the break\nat around 7M$_{\\odot}$. H$\\alpha$ emission is generally correlated with\ninfrared excess, with the correlation being stronger for infrared emission at\nwavelengths tracing the hot dust closest to the star. The variability indicator\nas developed by us shows that $\\sim$25% of all Herbig Ae/Be stars are strongly\nvariable.

The fraction of strongly\nvariable Herbig Ae stars is close to that found for A-type UX Ori stars.

They are nearly coplanar to each other; the\ninner one has a large eccentricity (~0.82); and the apses of the two orbits\nlibrate around anti-alignment. Such a state defies available proposals for\nlarge eccentricities. We argue that it is instead uniquely produced by a\ndecaying protoplanetary disk. When the disk was massive, its precessional\neffect on the planets forced the two apses to center around an anti-aligned\nstate. And as the disk is gradually eroded, the pair of planets are\nadiabatically transported to a new state where most of the eccentricity (or\nrather, the angular momentum deficit) is transferred to the inner planet, and\nthe two apses are largely anti-aligned. During this transport, any initial\nmutual inclination may be reduced or enhanced; either may be compatible with\nthe current constraints. So a primordial disk can drive up planet\neccentricities both in resonant planet pairs (as has been shown for GJ 876) and\nin secularly interacting, non-resonant pairs. The mechanism discussed here may\nbe relevant for forming hot Jupiters and for explaining the observed\neccentricities of warm and cold giant planets. \n\n"}

The model was designed to match the local MZRs for both gas and stars\nsimultaneously. This is achieved by invoking a time-dependent metal enrichment\nprocess which assumes either a time-dependent metal outflow with larger metal\nloading factors in galactic winds at early times, or a time-dependent Initial\nMass Function (IMF) with steeper slopes at early times. We compare the\npredictions from this model with data sets covering redshifts 0<z<3.5. The data\nsuggests a two-phase evolution with a transition point around z ~ 1.5. Before\nthat epoch the MZRgas has been evolving parallel with no evolution in the\nslope. After z ~ 1.5 the MZRgas started flattening until today.

Ivanova (2006) put forward the possibility that\nsome of the BHLMXBs may harbour pre-main-sequence (MS) donor stars, in order to\nexplain the Li-overabundances in three BHLMXBs.

We\ncalculate the evolution of the spin and orbital periods, the stellar radius and\nthe Roche-lobe radius during the pre-MS stage with the stellar evolution code\nMESA. We find that, because of the relatively slow rotation of the pre-MS star\nafter the common envelope evolution and the long turnover time in the pre-MS\nstars, tidal torque is not always able to synchronize the pre-MS star, so the\nspin periods are generally longer than the orbital periods.

If the population of\nlocal accreted stars is correlated with the dark matter sourced by the same\nmergers, one can then map the dark matter distribution directly. Using two\ncosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from\nthe Latte suite of Fire-2 simulations, we find a strong correlation between the\nvelocity distribution of stars and dark matter at the solar circle that were\naccreted from luminous satellites. This correspondence holds for dark matter\nthat is either relaxed or in kinematic substructure called debris flow, and is\nconsistent between two simulated hosts with different merger histories. The\ncorrespondence is more problematic for streams because of possible spatial\noffsets between the dark matter and stars. We demonstrate how to reconstruct\nthe dark matter velocity distribution from the observed properties of the\naccreted stellar population by properly accounting for the ratio of stars to\ndark matter contributed by individual mergers. After demonstrating this method\nusing the Fire-2 simulations, we apply it to the Milky Way and use it to\nrecover the dark matter velocity distribution associated with the recently\ndiscovered stellar debris field in the Solar neighborhood.

We\nidentify and analyse HII regions in the Sino-German 6cm polarisation survey of\nthe Galactic plane.

The H-alpha profiles consist of (1) a P\nCygni component associated with the wind of the supergiant, (2) emission\ncomponents that attain high velocity at the conjunctions and that probably form\nin enhanced outflows both towards and away from the black hole, and (3) an\nemission component that moves in anti-phase with the supergiant's motion. We\nargue that the third component forms in accreted gas near the black hole, and\nthe radial velocity curve of the emission is consistent with a mass ratio of\nM_X / M_opt = 0.36 +/- 0.05.

By hadronic interactions with the thermal gas of the intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM), the CRp produce gamma-rays for which we develop an analytic\nformalism to deduce their spectral distribution. Assuming the CRp-to-thermal\nenergy density ratio X_CRp and the CRp spectral index to be spatially constant,\nwe derive an analytic relation between the gamma-ray and bolometric X-ray\nfluxes, F_gamma and F_X. Based on our relation, we compile a sample of suitable\nclusters which are promising candidates for future detection of gamma-rays\nresulting from hadronic CRp interactions. Comparing to EGRET upper limits, we\nconstrain the CRp population in the cooling flow clusters Perseus and Virgo to\nX_CRp < 20%. Assuming a plausible value for the CRp diffusion coefficient\nkappa, we find the central CRp injection luminosity of M 87 to be limited to\n10^43 erg s^-1 kappa/(10^29 cm^2 s^-1). The synchrotron emission from secondary\nelectrons generated in CRp hadronic interactions allows even tighter limits to\nbe placed on the CRp population using radio observations. We obtain excellent\nagreement between the observed and theoretical radio brightness profiles for\nPerseus, but not for Coma without a radially increasing CRp-to-thermal energy\ndensity profile.

All gas parameters (density, angular\nvelocity, temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux) except for the radial\nvelocity are independent of the mass accretion rate. The radiative efficiency\nmay be arbitrarily large as M-dot -> 0. The gas angular momentum is transported\noutward under most conditions, hence the central star is nearly always\nspun-down. The flow is convectively stable. We also find that themal conduction\nin the flow is strong enough to make the flow thermally stable. The very fact\nthat the density, temperature and angular velocity of the gas at any radius in\nthe hot brake flow are completely independent of the outer and inner (except\nfor the star spin) boundary conditions implies that the flow cannot be smoothly\nmatched to a general external medium as well as to general conditions on the\nstar surface. We demonstrate that there are two extra self-similar solutions:\none bridges the gap between the original solution and the external medium, and\nanother represents a boundary layer between the bulk of the flow and the star\nsurface, in which the gas temperature rapidly drops while the density builds\nup. Finally, we briefly discuss that a hot brake flow may form around other\nrapidly spinning compact objects: white dwarfs and black holes. \n\n"}

Because\nthey are not accompanied by significant changes in the radio wavelengths, the\nflares make Sgr A* unusual in the context of black holes accreting at slightly\nhigher rates. Those sources display a radio/X-ray luminosity correlation whose\nnormalization scales with central mass, and that holds over orders of magnitude\nin accretion power.

In this paper, we test this hypothesis in\nmodels of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type:\nellipticals, spirals and irregulars.

When the new\nrate is introduced in the two-infall model for the Milky Way, the derived Type\nIa SN rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at very\nearly epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo more\nthan in the previous widely adopted formulations for the SNIa rate. As a\nconsequence of this, the [O/Fe] ratio decreases faster for [Fe/H] > -2.0 dex,\nrelative to the old models.

From the mock catalogues,\nwe measure the redshift-space projected two-point correlation function, the\npower spectrum, and the pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) in Fourier space and\nin configuration space, for galaxies in different luminosity intervals. We then\ncompare these theoretical predictions with the measurements derived from the\nSDSS DR4. On large scales and for galaxies brighter than L*, both sets of mock\ncatalogues agree well with the data. For fainter galaxies, however, both models\npredict stronger clustering and higher pairwise velocities than observed. We\ndemonstrate that this problem can be resolved if the fraction of faint\nsatellite galaxies in massive haloes is reduced by ~30% compared to the model\npredictions. A direct look into the model galaxy catalogues reveals that a\nsignifcant fraction (15%) of faint galaxies ($-18<M_{^{0.1}r}<-17$) reside in\nhaloes with $M_{vir}>10^{13}\\msun$, and this population is predominantly red in\ncolour. These faint red galaxies are responsible for the high PVD values of\nlow-luminosity galaxies on small scales. \n\n"}

This represents a shift of at\nleast two orders of magnitude with respect to previous observations of Mkn 501,\na behavior never seen before in this or any other blazar. The overall X-ray\nspectrum hardens with increasing intensity and, at each epoch, it is softer at\nlarger energies.

These moving groups are\nresponsible for the vertex deviation measured even for samples of late-type\nstars; they appear more frequently for ever redder samples; and as a whole they\nfollow an asymmetric-drift relation, in the sense that those only present in\nred samples predominantly have large |v_R| and lag in v_phi w.r.t. the local\nstandard of rest (LSR). The question arise, how these old moving groups got on\ntheir eccentric orbits.

III: Braneworld gravity Abstract: Braneworld gravity is a model that endows physical space with an extra\ndimension. In the type II Randall-Sundrum braneworld gravity model, the extra\ndimension modifies the spacetime geometry around black holes, and changes\npredictions for the formation and survival of primordial black holes. We\ndevelop a comprehensive analytical formalism for far-field black hole lensing\nin this model, using invariant quantities to compute all geometric optics\nlensing observables. We then make the first analysis of wave optics in\nbraneworld lensing, working in the semi-classical limit. We show that wave\noptics offers the only realistic way to observe braneworld effects in black\nhole lensing. We point out that if primordial braneworld black holes exist,\nhave mass M, and contribute a fraction f of the dark matter, then roughly 3e5 x\nf (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) of them lie within our Solar System. These objects, which\nwe call \"attolenses,\" would produce interference fringes in the energy spectra\nof gamma-ray bursts at energies ~100 (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) MeV (which will soon\nbe accessible with the GLAST satellite). Primordial braneworld black holes\nspread throughout the universe could produce similar interference effects; the\nprobability for \"attolensing\" may be non-negligible. If interference fringes\nwere observed, the fringe spacing would yield a simple upper limit on M.\nDetection of a primordial black hole with M <~ 1e-19 Msun would challenge\ngeneral relativity and favor the braneworld model. Further work on lensing\ntests of braneworld gravity must proceed into the physical optics regime, which\nawaits a description of the full spacetime geometry around braneworld black\nholes. \n\n"}

Because Leptogenesis depends in detail on properties of the\nneutrino spectrum, we review briefly existing experimental information on\nneutrinos as well as the seesaw mechanism, which offers a theoretical\nunderstanding of why neutrinos are so light. The bulk of the review is devoted\nto a discussion of thermal Leptogenesis and we show that for the neutrino\nspectrum suggested by oscillation experiments one obtains the observed value\nfor the baryon to photon density ratio in the Universe, independently of any\ninitial boundary conditions. In the latter part of the review we consider how\nwell Leptogenesis fits with particle physics models of dark matter.
