Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

We demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron\nstar surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the\nreflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,\nwhere the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass\naccretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.\nAssuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv\\'en radius, we constrain the\nstellar magnetic moment to \\mu=(9\\pm5) 10^{25} G cm^3, which corresponds to the\nsurface field of 10^8 G. On the other hand, using the magnetic moment recently\nobtained from the observed pulsar spin-down rate we show that the disc edge has\nto be within factor of two of the Alfv\\'en radius, putting interesting\nconstraints on the models of the disc-magnetosphere interaction. We also\ndemonstrate that the sharp changes in the phase of the fundamental are\nintimately related to the variations of the pulse profile, which we associate\nwith the varying obscuration of the antipodal spot.

Systematics and uncertainties of the\n  mid-infrared spectral analysis methods Abstract: The spectral region around 10 micrometer, showing prominent dust emission\nbands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary\ndust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the\ninfluence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral\ndecomposition methods.

In\nparticular, we calculate the dependence of maximum black hole mass on\nmetallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates (e.g., Hurley et al. and\nVink et al.). Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed\nin the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)\ncan be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.\nTo reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at\nthe level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent\nWolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass\nmeasurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity\n(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun. This is a rather striking finding as\nthe mass of the most massive known stellar black hole is M_bh = 23-34 Msun and,\nin fact, it is located in a small star forming galaxy with moderate\nmetallicity.

This great\nachievement raises questions on the formation and dynamical stability of the HR\n8799 system, because Keplerian fits to astrometric data are strongly unstable\nduring ~0.2Myr. We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so\ncalled GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the\noptimization algorithm. Our searches reveal only small regions of stable\nmotions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations. Most\nlikely, if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range, they may be\nstable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion\nresonances (MMRs). We found that 80% systems found by GAMP that survived 30Myr\nbackwards integrations, eventually become unstable after 100Myr.

This scenario was developed to replace and extend the\nso-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the\nCooper pair breaking and formation processes that occur near the critical\ntemperature for superfluid/superconductor pairing.\n  Recently, it has been found that Cooper-pair neutrino emission from the\nvector channel is suppressed by a large factor compared to the original\nestimates that violated vector current conservation. We show that Cooper-pair\nneutrino emission remains, nevertheless, an efficient cooling mechanism through\nthe axial channel. As a result, the elimination of neutrino emission from\nCooper-paired nucleons through the vector channel has only minor effects on the\nlong-term cooling of neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm. We\nfurther quantify precisely the effect of the size of the neutron 3P2 gap and\ndemonstrate that consistency between observations and the minimal cooling\nparadigm requires that the critical temperature T_c for this gap covers a range\nof values between T_c^min < 0.2 x 10^9 K up to T_c^max > 0.5 \\times 10^9 K in\nthe core of the star.

For 45\ntransiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths\nforward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semi-major axes\nand eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the\nnumber of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many\nas 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to\nbe viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation.\nThis is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism\nto explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have\nto be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on\nthe eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario we match the\nextremely large radius of WASP-12b. (Abridged) \n\n"}

To do so, we assume that they\nretain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with\na third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is\nthen required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this\nadditional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass\nof a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass\n$M_{\\rm core}$ and the heating $\\dot{E}_{\\rm heating}$.

For comparing and classifying the GW signals, we use a number of\ncharacteristic quantities like the maximum frequency during inspiral or the\ndominant frequency of oscillations of the postmerger remnant.

We investigate possible explanations that could\naccount for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has\nsuggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense\ninterstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column\ndensity from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this\npossibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,\nlow-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.\nThis mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a\ntypical cloud crossing time.

Several formation scenarios have\nbeen proposed, where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core\naccretion with type I migration (e.g. Terquem & Papaloizou 2007) and planetary\natmosphere physics (e.g. Alibert et al. 2006).

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating.

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves.

We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc. We find this to be in principle\npossible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1.d-3 but then\nwe find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible\nonly if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal\ndissipation is very effective.

When applied to Venus, assuming that planet lacks plate tectonics and has\na dehydrated mantle with an elevated viscosity, the model shows that the dynamo\nshuts down or never operated. Our model predicts that at a fixed planet mass,\ndynamo history is sensitive to core size, but not to the initial inventory of\nlong-lived, heat-producing radionuclides. It predicts that rocky planets larger\nthan 2.5 Earth masses will not develop inner cores because the\ntemperature-pressure slope of the iron solidus becomes flatter than that of the\ncore adiabat. Instead, iron \"snow\" will condense near or at the top of these\ncores, and the net transfer of latent heat upwards will suppress convection and\na dynamo. More massive planets can have anemic dynamos due to core cooling, but\nonly if they have mobile lids (plate tectonics). The lifetime of these dynamos\nis shorter with increasing planet mass but longer with higher surface\ntemperature. Massive Venus-like planets with stagnant lids and more viscous\nmantles will lack dynamos altogether.

Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping.

Using two\nindependently-developed methods, we have derived detection limits from nearly\nfour years of the highest-precision data on 24 bright, stable stars from the\nAnglo-Australian Planet Search. Both methods are more conservative than a human\nanalysing an individual observed data set, as is demonstrated by the fact that\nboth techniques would detect the radial velocity signals announced as\nexoplanets for the 61 Vir system in 50% of trials. There are modest differences\nbetween the methods which can be recognised as arising from particular criteria\nthat they adopt. What both processes deliver is a quantitative selection\nprocess such that one can use them to draw quantitative conclusions about\nplanetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution from a given data set.\nAveraging over all 24 stars, in the period range P<300 days and the\neccentricity range 0.0<e<0.6, we could have detected 99% of planets with\nvelocity amplitudes K>7.1 m/s. For the best stars in the sample, we are able to\ndetect or exclude planets with K>3 m/s, corresponding to minimum masses of 8\nM_earth (P=5 days) or 17 M_earth (P=50 days). Our results indicate that the\nobserved \"period valley,\" a lack of giant planets (M>100 M_earth) with periods\nbetween 10-100 days, is indeed real. However, for planets in the mass range\n10-100 M_earth, our results suggest that the deficit of such planets may be a\nresult of selection effects. \n\n"}

The\ndeviations from the Keplerian motion, caused by mutual gravitational\ninteractions between planets, are expected to generate transit timing\nvariations of transiting exoplanets. In 2009 we collected 9 light curves of 8\ntransits of the exoplanet WASP-10b. Combining these data with published ones,\nwe found that transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by a\nperiodic variation. Simplified three-body models which reproduce the observed\nvariations of timing residuals were identified by numerical simulations. We\nfound that the configuration with an additional planet of mass of $\\sim$0.1\n$M_{\\rm{J}}$ and orbital period of $\\sim$5.23 d, located close to the outer 5:3\nmean motion resonance, is the most likely scenario.

It has been found that massive stars can\nproduce p-nuclei through photodisintegration of pre-existing intermediate and\nheavy nuclei. This so-called gamma-process requires sufficiently high\ntemperatures and occurs in pre-explosive or explosive O/Ne burning, depending\non the mass of the star. Although the gamma-process has been successful in\nproducing a large range of p-nuclei, two mass regions remain problematic, A<110\nand 150<A<165, where a number of p-nuclei are severely underproduced. The\norigin of the problems is yet to be identified. A large number of unstable\nnuclei with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the\nreaction network and thus the nuclear input may involve uncertainties.\nDeficiencies in charged-particle optical potentials at gamma-process\ntemperatures have been found for nuclei at stability. On the other hand, the\ngamma-process conditions (temperature profiles, entropy of the O shell, seed\ncomposition) also sensitively depend on details of the stellar structure and\nevolution, as well as on the initial metallicity. Nevertheless, especially the\ndeficient low-mass p-nuclei may call for an additional production process or\nsite, such as production in (subChandrasekhar) type Ia supernovae. Also the\n(im)possibility of a synthesis in the rp- and nu-p-processes is discussed. Were\nthis the case, the production of p-nuclei would be realized as a superposition\nof several different processes, not necessarily in the same site. \n\n"}

The wavelength dependence\nof polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in\nthe blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower\nsignal in the V band. The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence, detected also in\nthe transmitted light during transits, implies a rapid decrease of the\npolarization signal toward longer wavelengths. Therefore, the nondetection by\nWiktorowicz (2009), based on a measurement integrated within a broad passband\ncovering the V band and partly B and R bands, is inconclusive and consistent\nwith our detection in B. We discuss possible sources of the polarization and\ndemonstrate that effects of incomplete cancellation of stellar limb\npolarization due to starspots or tidal perturbations are negligible as compared\nto scattering polarization in the planetary atmosphere.

Several attempts have\nbeen made at creating techniques that can pare down candidate lists without the\nneed of additional observations.

The\nfixed point is characterized by a lack of oscillations in the eccentricities\nand apsidal alignment among the orbits. Quantitatively, the nature of the fixed\npoint is dictated by mutual interactions among the planets as well as\nnon-Keplerian effects. We show that if a roughly coplanar system hosts a hot,\nsub-Saturn mass planet, and is tidally relaxed, separation of planet-planet\ninteractions and non-Keplerian effects in the equations of motion leads to a\ndirect determination of the true masses of the planets.

Statistical Analysis of the\n  First Four Months Abstract: The architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints\non models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation of\norbital eccentricities and inclinations. NASA's Kepler mission has identified\n1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary\nsystems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit\ntiming analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of\nplanet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive\nof TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span\nof observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet\nmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple\ntransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We\nfind that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does\nnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per\nstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a\nsingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We\nanticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with\nmultiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a\npowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital\ndynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least\nsix years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the\ndynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive\nto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type\nstars. \n\n"}

This\nnumerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features PCA\ncan robustly identify. We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar\nbroadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent\nalbedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to\nmid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes\nemphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the\nmid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at\nshort wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor\nin the south polar observation.

By construction, our model has a higher Bond albedo than the\nmodern Earth; its surface albedo is so high that Rayleigh scattering does not\nnoticeably affect its spectrum. The rotational color variations occur at short\nwavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land in\nthose wavebands.

{"id": "1106.4179", "contents": "Title: Formation of stars and planets: the role of magnetic fields Abstract: Star formation is thought to be triggered by gravitational collapse of the\ndense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc. Both processes are powered by the\naction of magnetic fields and are, in turn, likely to strongly affect the\nstructure, dynamics, evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their\nhost discs.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being\nof order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits.

To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find\nits median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained\nduring the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar\ndependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar\nencounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of\nmagnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that\nassumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material\ntrapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits can be extremely low and may present\ndifficulties for models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet\nproduction. \n\n"}

Here we\ndevelop a means of tracking the paths that dust grains would have taken through\na diffusive protoplanetary disk and examine the types and ranges of\nenvironments that particles would have seen over a 10$^{6}$ year time period in\nthe dynamic disk. We then combine this model with three annealing laws to\nexamine how the dynamic evolution of amorphous grains would have led to their\nphysical restructuring and their delivery to various regions of the disk. It is\nfound that \"sibling particles\"-- those particles that reside at the same\nlocation at a given period of time--take a wide range of unique and independent\npaths through the disk to arrive there.

With the assumption of Saha equilibrium, the variation in\ntemperature is the main driver of the variations in the electrical\nconductivity, induced current and Ohmic power dissipated. Atmospheres\npossessing temperature inversions tend to dissipate most of the Ohmic power\nsuperficially, at high altitudes, whereas those without temperature inversions\nare capable of greater dissipation deeper down. Scattering in the optical range\nof wavelengths tends to cool the lower atmosphere, thus reducing the degree of\ndissipation at depth. Purely absorbing cloud decks (in the infrared), of a\nfinite extent in height, allow for localized reductions in dissipation and may\nreverse a temperature inversion if they are dense and thick enough, thus\ngreatly enhancing the dissipation at depth. If Ohmic dissipation is the\nmechanism for inflating hot Jupiters, then variations in the atmospheric\nopacity (which may be interpreted as arising from variations in metallicity and\ncloud/haze properties) and magnetic field strength naturally produce a scatter\nin the measured radii at a given strength of irradiation.

We find a solution with a central cavity and a\nmigration rate similar to those previously obtained for Type-II migration,\napplicable for large masses and binary separations, and near-equal mass ratios.\nHowever, we identify a distinct new regime, applicable at smaller separations\nand masses, and mass ratio in the range 0.001< q < 0.1. For these systems, gas\npiles up outside the binary's orbit, but rather than creating a cavity, it\ncontinuously overflows as in a porous dam. The disk profile is intermediate\nbetween a weakly perturbed disk (producing Type-I migration) and a disk with a\ngap (with Type-II migration). However, the migration rate of the secondary is\ntypically slower than both Type-I and Type-II rates. We term this new regime\n\"Type-1.5\" migration. \n\n"}

In this paper, we explore the implications of the minimal hypothesis\nthat brown dwarfs in binary systems originate via the same fundamental\nfragmentation mechanism as stars, within isolated, turbulent giant molecular\ncloud cores. We demonstrate analytically that the scaling of specific angular\nmomentum with turbulent core mass naturally gives rise to the brown dwarf\ndesert, as well as wide brown-dwarf binary systems. Further, we show that the\nturbulent core fragmentation model also naturally predicts that very low-mass\n(VLM) binary and BD/BD systems are more tightly-bound than stellar systems.

Abstract: The radio pulsar models based on the existence of an inner accelerating gap\nlocated above the polar cap rely on the existence of a small scale, strong\nsurface magnetic field $B_s$. This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars. While the former are too weak to create $B_s \\gtrsim 5\\times\n10^{13}$G$\\;\\gg B_d$, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than\n$10^6$ years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a\ntoroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where\nthe ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created\nby various processes acting early in a neutron star's life.

In this prompt merger scenario the common envelope (CE) phase is\nterminated by a merger of a WD companion with the hot core of a massive\nasymptotic giant (AGB) star. In most cases the WD is disrupted and accreted\nonto the more massive core. However, in the rare cases where the merger takes\nplace when the WD is denser than the core, the core will be disrupted and\naccreted onto the cooler WD. In such cases the explosion might occur with no\nappreciable delay, i.e., months to years after the termination of the CE phase.\nThis, we propose, might be the evolutionary route that could lead to the\nexplosion of PTF 11kx. This scenario can account for the very massive CSM\nwithin ~1000 AU of the exploding PTF 11kx star, for the presence of hydrogen,\nand for the presence of shells in the CSM. \n\n"}

The\nplanet light-curve is reanalysed using long and short cadence Kepler\nobservations from the first 14 quarters. Orbital period of the planet was\nimproved. We prove that the peculiar light-curve of this objects is in\nagreement with the idea of a planet with a comet like tail. There is an\nevidence of a quasi periodic long term evolution of the tail. Light-curve has a\nprominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit\nbrightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong\nfunction of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical\nparticle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there\nis an indication that the particle size changes along the tail. Larger\nparticles better reproduce the pre-transit brightening and transit core while\nsmaller particles are more compatible with the egress and post-transit\nbrightening. Dust density in the tail is a steep decreasing function of the\ndistance from the planet which indicates a significant tail destruction caused\nby the star. We also argue that the 'planet' does not show uniform behaviour\nbut may have at least two constituents. This light-curve with pre-transit\nbrightening is analogous to the light-curve of $\\epsilon$ Aur with mid-eclipse\nbrightening and forward scattering plays a significant role in such eclipsing\nsystems. \n\n"}

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs.

In these systems, the\ndominant tidal effects involve the excitation of gravity waves and their\ndissipation in the outer envelope of the star. We calculate the amplitude of\ntidally excited gravity waves in low-mass (0.3M_\\odot) helium-core (He) WDs as\na function of the tidal forcing frequency \\omega.

On average, F(\\omega) scales approximately as\n\\omega^6, and is several orders of magnitude smaller for He WDs than for CO\nWDs. We find that tidal torques can begin to synchronize the WD rotation when\nthe orbital period is less than about a hour, although a nearly constant\nasynchronization is maintained even at small periods. We examine where the\ntidally excited gravity waves experience non-linear breaking or resonant\nabsorption at a critical layer, allowing us to estimate the location and\nmagnitude of tidal heating in the WD envelope.

We first study how this\neffect is modified by incorporating perturbations from the planetary\noblateness. Tremaine et al. (2009) found that, for planets with obliquities >\n68.875 degrees, orbits in the equilibrium local Laplace plane are unstable to\neccentricity perturbations over a finite radial range, and execute\nlarge-amplitude chaotic oscillations in eccentricity and inclination. In the\nhope of making that treatment more easily understandable, we analyze the\nproblem using orbital elements, confirming this threshold obliquity.\nFurthermore, we find that orbits inclined to the Laplace plane will be unstable\nover a broader radial range, and that such orbits can go unstable for\nobliquities less than 68.875 degrees. Finally, we analyze the added effects of\nradiation pressure, which are important for dust grains and provide a natural\nmechanism for particle semimajor axes to sweep via Poynting-Robertson drag\nthrough any unstable range. We find that generally the effect persists;\nhowever, the unstable radial range is shifted and small retrograde particles\ncan avoid the instability altogether.

In this work we demonstrate that acoustic waves excited by supersonic\nshear in the boundary layer serve as an efficient mechanism of mass, momentum\nand energy transport at the interface between the disk and the accreting\nobject. We develop the theory of angular momentum transport by acoustic modes\nin the boundary layer, and support our findings with 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations, using an isothermal equation of state. Our first major result is\nthe identification of three types of global modes in the boundary layer. We\nderive dispersion relations for each of these modes that accurately capture the\npattern speeds observed in simulations to within a few percent.

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio. In particular, we show\nthat an increase of the upper mass cut-off with decreasing metallicity could\ncontribute to the observed anti-correlation between the mass-to-light ratio and\nthe metallicity of GCs. \n\n"}

The properties of the warm excess in Vega are further characterized\nwith ancillary photometry in the mid infrared and resolved images in the\nfar-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. The Vega warm excess shares many\nsimilar properties with the one found around Fomalhaut. The emission shortward\nof ~30 um from both warm components is well described as a blackbody emission\nof ~170 K. Interestingly, two other systems, eps Eri and HR 8799, also show\nsuch an unresolved warm dust using the same approach. These warm components may\nbe analogous to the solar system's zodiacal dust cloud, but of far greater.

We then used collisional models and N-body\norbital simulations to gain insight into the long-term dynamical evolution of\nsynthetic LHB families over 4 Gyr. We account for the mutual collisions, the\nphysical disruptions of comets, the Yarkovsky/YORP drift, chaotic diffusion, or\npossible perturbations by the giant-planet migration.\n  Assuming a \"standard\" size-frequency distribution of primordial comets, we\npredict the number of families with parent-body sizes D_PB >= 200 km which\nseems consistent with observations.

We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes. Considering the existence of the ultracompact binary white dwarf of\norbital period of 5.4 minute, HM Cancri, such orbital periods to pulsar\nbinaries are not strange.

It was shown in our previous work that at 1\nAU, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is completely suppressed when both\nOhmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (AD) are taken into account,\nresulting in a laminar flow with accretion driven by magnetocentrifugal wind.\nIn this work, we study the radial dependence of the laminar wind solution using\nlocal shearing-box simulations.

The model combines a calculation\nfor the behavior of a group of grains encountering a single turbulent eddy,\nwith a hierarchical approximation of the eddy statistics. This makes analytic\npredictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain\ndensities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum\ngrain densities reached. We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag\ntime t_stop, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio, strength of turbulence\n(alpha), and detailed disk properties. We test these against numerical\nsimulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. The simulations agree\nwell with the predictions, spanning t_stop*Omega ~ 1e-4 - 10, alpha ~ 1e-10 -\n1e-2, and grain-to-gas mass ratio ~0-3. Results from 'turbulent concentration'\nsimulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case.\nVortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grains\nhierarchically. For small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnover\ntime comparable to the stopping time, but fluctuations are also damped by local\ngas-grain drift. For large grains, shear and gravity lead to a much broader\nrange of eddy scales driving fluctuations, with most power on the largest\nscales. The grain density distribution has a log-Poisson shape, with\nfluctuations for large grains up to factors >1000.

These outflows are often modelled to be isotropic, but this\nassumption is not realistic for fast rotators, bipolar jets and supernovae.\nHere we derive the general equations of motion for the time evolution of a\nsingle planet, brown dwarf, comet or asteroid perturbed by anisotropic mass\nloss in terms of a complete set of planetary orbital elements, the ejecta\nvelocity, and the parent star's co-latitude and longitude. We restrict our\napplication of these equations to 1) rapidly rotating giant stars, and 2)\narbitrarily-directed jet outflows. We conclude that the isotropic mass-loss\nassumption can safely be used to model planetary motion during giant branch\nphases of stellar evolution within distances of hundreds of au. In fact,\nlatitudinal mass loss variations anisotropically affect planetary motion only\nif the mass loss is asymmetric about the stellar equator.

We are interested\nin answering the following question: Will the low-mass planets form the same\nresonant structures with each other in the vicinity of the gas giant as in the\ncase when the gas giant is absent? When there is no gas giant in the system, it\nhas been already shown that if the two low-mass planets undergo a convergent\ndifferential migration, they will capture each other in a mean-motion\nresonance.

We employ stellar atmosphere, stratified accretion-column, and widely used\nX-ray spectral models.

Our XMM-Newton data of RS Cae are clearly dominated by soft X-ray\nemission. The X-ray light curves are shaped by emission from the main accretion\nregion, which is visible over the whole orbital cycle, interrupted only by a\nstream eclipse. The optical light curves are formed by cyclotron and stream\nemission. The XMM-Newton X-ray spectra comprise a black-body-like and a plasma\ncomponent at mean temperatures of 36eV and 7keV. The spectral fits give\nevidence of a partially absorbing and a reflection component.

The accretion rates expected from\nplanetesimals that are all the same mass (ie, a mono-mass distribution) are\nexplored both analytically and using a Monte Carlo model, quantifying how\nmeasured accretion rates inevitably depend on sinking time, since different\nsinking times probe different times since the last accretion event. However,\nthat dependence is so dramatic that a mono-mass distribution can be excluded.\nConsideration of accretion from a broad distribution of planetesimal masses\nuncovers an important conceptual difference: accretion is continuous (rather\nthan stochastic) for planetesimals below a certain mass, and the accretion of\nsuch planetesimals determines the rate typically inferred from observations;\nsmaller planetesimals dominate the rates for shorter sinking times. A\nreasonable fit to the observationally inferred accretion rate distributions is\nfound with model parameters consistent with a collisionally evolved mass\ndistribution up to Pluto-mass, and an underlying accretion rate distribution\nconsistent with that expected from descendants of debris discs of main sequence\nA stars. With these parameters, while both DA and non-DA white dwarfs accrete\nfrom the same broad planetesimal distribution, this model predicts that the\npollution seen in DAs is dominated by the continuous accretion of <35km\nobjects, and that in non-DAs by >35km objects (though the dominant size varies\nbetween stars by around an order of magnitude from this value)... \n\n"}

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes.

Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate.

Recent work on the transmission spectrum has shown\nclear evidence for the presence of clouds in its atmosphere, which\nsignificantly increases the model atmosphere parameter space that must be\nexplored in order to fully characterise this planet. In this work, we apply the\nNEMESIS atmospheric retrieval code to the recently published HST/STIS\nreflection spectrum, and also to the dayside thermal emission spectrum in the\nlight of new Spitzer/IRAC measurements, as well as our own re-analysis of the\nHST/NICMOS data. We first use the STIS data to place some constraints on the\nnature of the cloud on HD189733b, and explore solution degeneracy between\ndifferent cloud properties and the abundance of Na in the atmosphere; as\nalready noted in previous work, absorption due to Na plays a significant role\nin determining the shape of the reflection spectrum. We then perform a new\nretrieval of the temperature profile and abundances of H2O, CO2, CO and CH4\nfrom the dayside thermal emission spectrum.

We find that the\ncurrent quality of data does not warrant the extra complexity introduced by\nincluding cloud in the model; however, future data are likely to be of\nsufficient resolution and signal-to-noise that a more complete model, including\nscattering particles, will be required. \n\n"}

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these\nresults, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state\ntransitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y.

Secular dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital\ncommensurability having negligible effect. Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD. This explains why Mode p overwhelms Mode a, and\nalso why the inner binary's orbit is far more eccentric than other WD-pulsar\nbinaries with similar orbit periods.

The standard solar model fails to predict the very low lithium\nabundance in the Sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. This Li\nproblem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planet\nformation or to secular stellar depletion. In order to test the evolution of\nLi, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of\nstars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of\nterrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired\nhigh-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several\nsolar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among\nthe solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a\ndifferential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.\n[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =\n4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03\nkm/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision.

Very few\nstudies explored the stellar evolution of triple systems, and in particular the\nmass loss phase of the evolving stellar components. Here we study the dynamical\nsecular evolution of hierarchical triple systems undergoing mass loss.

We present various\nevolutionary channels taking place in such evolving triples, and discuss both\nthe effects of mass-loss and mass-transfer in the inner binary system, as well\nas the effects of mass-loss/transfer from an outer third companion. We discuss\nseveral distinct types/regimes of triple secular evolution, where the specific\nbehavior of a triple system can sensitively depend on its hierarchy and the\nrelative importance of classical and general relativistic effects. We show that\nthe orbital changes due to mass-loss and/or mass-transfer processes can\neffectively transfer a triple system from one dynamical regime to another.

Turbulence can bring ice-coated\ndust grains from the midplane to the warm irradiated disk surface, and the ice\nmantles are reprocessed by photoreactions, thermal desorption, and surface\nreactions. The upward transport decreases the abundance of methanol and ammonia\nices at r < 30 AU, because warm dust temperature prohibits their reformation on\ngrain surfaces. This reprocessing could explain the smaller abundances of\ncarbon and nitrogen bearing molecules in cometary coma than those in low-mass\nprotostellar envelopes. We also show the effect of mixing on the synthesis of\ncomplex organic molecules (COMs) are two ways: (1) transport of ices from the\nmidplane to the disk surface and (2) transport of atomic hydrogen from the\nsurface to the midplane. The former enhances the COMs formation in the disk\nsurface, while the latter suppresses it in the midplane. Then, when mixing is\nstrong, COMs are predominantly formed in the disk surface, while their parent\nmolecules are (re)formed in the midplane.

The goal of this study is to derive an analytical\nmodel for k_gr. Methods.

In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically\nmuch lower than in the ISM. The equations also show that a higher dust input in\nthe top layer does not strongly increase k_gr with two important implications.\nFirst, for a formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the\nissue that pebbles increase the grain input high in the atmosphere due to\nablation. This could potentially increase k_gr hindering giant planet\nformation. Our study shows that this adverse effect should not occur.

Two competing hypotheses suggest that the\nplanets migrated either through interaction with the protoplanetary disk during\ntheir formation, or by disk-free mechanisms such as gravitational interactions\nwith a third body.

Strong dynamical excitation of planetesimals\nby the eccentric companion can result in collisional destruction (rather than\ngrowth) of 1-100 km objects, giving rise to the \"fragmentation barrier\" for\nplanet formation. We revise this issue using a novel description of secular\ndynamics of planetesimals in binaries, which accounts for the gravity of the\neccentric, coplanar protoplanetary disk, as well as gas drag. By studying\nplanetesimal collision outcomes we show, in contrast to many previous studies,\nthat planetesimal growth and subsequent formation of planets (including gas\ngiants) in AU-scale orbits within ~20 AU separation binaries may be possible,\nprovided that the protoplanetary disks are massive (>10^{-2}M_\\odot) and only\nweakly eccentric (disk eccentricity <0.01).

To clarify the systematics of the observed X-ray\nproperties, we have analyzed a large series of Chandra and XMM observations,\ncorresponding to all available exposures of known massive magnetic stars (over\n100 exposures covering ~60% of stars compiled in the catalog of Petit et al.\n2013). We show that the X-ray luminosity is strongly correlated with the\nstellar wind mass-loss-rate, with a power-law form that is slightly steeper\nthan linear for the majority of the less luminous, lower-Mdot B stars and\nflattens for the more luminous, higher-Mdot O stars. As the winds are\nradiatively driven, these scalings can be equivalently written as relations\nwith the bolometric luminosity. The observed X-ray luminosities, and their\ntrend with mass-loss rates, are well reproduced by new MHD models, although a\nfew overluminous stars (mostly rapidly rotating objects) exist. No relation is\nfound between other X-ray properties (plasma temperature, absorption) and\nstellar or magnetic parameters, contrary to expectations (e.g. higher\ntemperature for stronger mass-loss rate).

The present work is concerned with the gravitational collapse\nof such clumps, idealized as being spherically symmetric. Calculations using\nthe two-fluid model are performed (almost) up to the time when a central\ndensity singularity forms. The end result of the study is a parametrization for\nthis time, in order that it may be compared with timescales for various\ndisruptive effects to which clumps may be subject. An important effect is that\nas the clump compresses, it also compresses the gas due to drag. This increases\ngas pressure which retards particle collapse and leads to oscillation in the\nsize and density of the clump. The ratio of gravitational force to gas pressure\ngives a two-phase Jeans parameter, $J_t$, which is the classical Jeans\nparameter with the sound speed replaced by an the wave speed in a coupled\ntwo-fluid medium. Its use makes the results insensitive to the initial density\nratio of particles to gas as a separate parameter. An ordinary differential\nequation model is developed which takes the form of two coupled non-linear\noscillators and reproduces key features of the simulations. Finally, a\nparametric study of the time to collapse is performed and a formula (fit to the\nsimulations) is developed.

Because\ncooling by neutrinos can be very efficient, NSs have been predicted to\naccumulate significant mass during CE events, perhaps enough to lead them to\ncollapse to black holes. We revisit this conclusion with the additional\nconsideration of CE structure, particularly density gradients across the\nembedded NS's accretion radius. This work is informed by our recent numerical\nsimulations that find that the presence of a density gradient strongly limits\naccretion by imposing a net angular momentum to the flow around the NS.

The planet\nitself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a high\nmetallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of\nthe 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel\ndetector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional\ndecorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically\ndifferent method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which\nwe call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect\nvery effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the\nfluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and\nvalidate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to\nprevious analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in\nSpitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be\nintractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b\neclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating\ninefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong\nmolecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5\nmicron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by\nSpitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All\nfour eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a\nslightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with\nextant RV data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), and\nestablishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence.\nGiven the existence of a bound stellar companion, HAT-P-20b is another\nexcellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other\nthree-body mechanism. \n\n"}

Their result was deduced from the statistical distribution of\ndurations of gravitational microlensing events observed by the MOA\ncollaboration during 2006 and 2007. Here we study the feasibility of measuring\nthe mass of an individual PMO through microlensing by examining a particular\nevent, MOA-2011-BLG-274.

Also, it was intensively monitored from widely separated\nlocations under clear skies at low air masses. Choi et al. (2012) concluded\nthat the lens of the event may have been a PMO but they did not attempt a\nmeasurement of its mass. We report here a re-analysis of the event using\nre-reduced data.

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core.

In this first paper, we present the complete exact\nsolutions of particles trajectories, which are not conics, under the influence\nof the solar radiation pressure. This problem was recently partly solved by\nLantoine and Russell (2011) and completely by Biscani and Izzo (2014). We give\nhere the full set of solutions, including solutions not previously derived, as\nwell as simpler formulations for previously known cases and comparisons with\nrecent works. The solutions given may also be applied to the classical Stark\nproblem (Stark,1914): we thus provide here for the first time the complete set\nof solutions for this well-known effect in term of Jacobi elliptic functions. \n\n"}

The aggregate\ndayside emission spectrum of these planets exhibits no molecular features, nor\nis brightness temperature greater in the near-infrared. We combine brightness\ntemperatures at various infrared wavelengths to estimate the dayside effective\ntemperature of each planet. We find that dayside temperatures are proportional\nto irradiation temperatures, indicating modest Bond albedo and no internal\nenergy sources, plus weak evidence that dayside temperatures of the hottest\nplanets are disproportionately high. We place joint constraints on Bond albedo,\n$A_{B}$, and day-to-night transport efficiency, $\\varepsilon$, for six planets\nby combining thermal eclipse and phase variation measurements (HD 149026b, HD\n189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-18b, and WASP-43b). We confirm that planets\nwith high irradiation temperatures have low heat transport efficiency, and that\nWASP-43b has inexplicably poor transport; these results are statistically\nsignificant even if the precision of single-eclipse measurements has been\noverstated by a factor of three.

The formation of the new WD\nplanetary system starts with a tidal break-up of the parent planet to\nplanetesimals near the tidal radius of about 1Rsun. Internal stress forces keep\nthe planetesimal from further tidal break-up when their radius is less than\nabout 100km. We speculate that the planetesimals then bind together to form new\nsub-Earth - daughter-planets at a few solar radii around the WD.

In this\nwork, we explore two much larger observational consequences of exorings: (1)\nthe significant increase in transit depth that may lead to the\nmisclassification of ringed planetary candidates as false-positives and/or the\nunderestimation of planetary density; and (2) the so-called \"photo-ring\"\neffect, a new asterodensity profiling effect, revealed by a comparison of the\nlight curve derived stellar density to that measured with independent methods\n(e.g., asteroseismology).

These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star.

Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution\nleading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the\nbinary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron\ncore-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium\nejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or\nType Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star\ndonors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital\nperiods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also\ndiscuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -\nas well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the\nevolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN\nexplosion. We find that ultra-stripped SNe are possible for both EC SNe and Fe\nCCSNe, and that the amount of helium ejected is correlated with P_orb - the\ntightest systems even having donors being stripped down to envelopes of less\nthan 0.01 M_sun. We estimate the rise time of ultra-stripped SNe to be in the\nrange 12 hr - 8 days, and light curve decay times between 1 and 50 days.\nUltra-stripped SNe may produce NSs in the mass range 1.10 - 1.80 M_sun and are\nhighly relevant for LIGO/VIRGO since most (possibly all) merging double NS\nsystems have evolved through this phase. Finally, we discuss the low-velocity\nkicks which might be imparted on these resulting NSs at birth. [Abridged] \n\n"}

The\nVSI is driven by a weak vertical gradient in the disk's orbital motion, but\nmust overcome vertical buoyancy, a strongly stabilizing influence in cold\ndisks, where heating is dominated by external irradiation. Rapid radiative\ncooling reduces the effective buoyancy and allows the VSI to operate. We\nquantify the cooling timescale $t_c$ needed for efficient VSI growth, through a\nlinear analysis of the VSI with cooling in vertically global, radially local\ndisk models. We find the VSI is most vigorous for rapid cooling with\n$t_c<\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}^{-1}h|q|/(\\gamma -1)$ in terms of the Keplerian orbital\nfrequency, $\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}$; the disk's aspect-ratio, $h\\ll1$; the radial\npower-law temperature gradient, $q$; and the adiabatic index, $\\gamma$. For\nlonger $t_c$, the VSI is much less effective because growth slows and shifts to\nsmaller length scales, which are more prone to viscous or turbulent decay.

We find that the VSI is most effective at intermediate radii, from\n$\\sim5$AU to $\\sim50$AU with a characteristic growth time of $\\sim30$ local\norbital periods.

We demonstrate that\nthe underproduction of elements above and below the $r$-process peaks\ncharacteristic in the main or weak $r$-process events (like magnetohydrodynamic\njets or neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae) can be supplemented\nvia fission fragment distributions from the recycling of material in a\nneutron-rich environment such as that encountered in neutron star mergers.

Assuming a single source altitude of 15\nkm, a comparison of simulations to data is performed for a range of empirically\nchosen source electron variation time scales. The data exhibit a clear\nsoftening with increased source distance, in qualitative agreement with\ntheoretical predictions.

The solutions show two extreme cases: close-in\ngiant gaseous planets, with fast relaxation (low viscosity) and satellites and\nEarth-like planets, with slow relaxation (high viscosity). The rotation of\nclose-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally\ndriven towards a stationary solution which is synchronized, but, if the orbit\nis elliptical, with a frequency larger than the orbital mean-motion. The\nrotation of rocky bodies, however, may be driven to several attractors whose\nfrequencies are 1/2,1,3/2,2,5/2 ... times the mean-motion. The number of\nattractors increases with the viscosity of the body and with the orbital\neccentricity. The classical example is Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3\nof the orbital period (3/2 attractor). The planet behaves as a molten body with\na relaxation that allowed it to cross the 2/1 attractor without being trapped,\nbut not to escape being trapped in the 3/2 one. In that case, the relaxation is\nestimated to lie in the interval 4.6 -- 27 x 10^{-9} s^{-1} (equivalent to a\nquality factor roughly constrained to the interval 5<Q<50). The stars have\nrelaxation similar to the hot Jupiters and their rotation is also driven to the\nonly stationary solution existing in these cases. However, solar-type stars may\nlose angular momentum due to stellar wind, braking the rotation and displacing\nthe attractor towards larger periods. Old active host stars with big close-in\ncompanions generally have rotational periods larger than the orbital periods of\nthe companions.

We present the results of more than 400\nmillion gravitational scattering experiments of binary-binary, triple-single,\nand triple-binary scattering.

For the production of new triple systems by scattering we find that\ncompact triples are preferred, with ratios of outer to inner semi-major axes of\n~few--100, flat or quasi-thermal eccentricity distributions, and flat\ndistributions in cosine of the mutual inclination. Dynamically formed triples\nare thus subject to strong KL oscillations, the \"eccentric Kozai mechanism,\"\nand non-secular effects.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions.

We have used two different\nSPH codes, vine and phantom, to model the evolution of a system\nstar+disk+planet and companion star with time. After an initial coupled\nevolution, the inclination of the disk and that of the planet begin to differ\nsignificantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, respect to\nthe initial plane, is shorter than that of the planet which evolves\nindependently after about 10^4 yr following a perturbed N-body behavior.\nHowever, the planet keeps migrating towards the star because during its orbital\nmotion it crosses the disk plane and the friction with the gas causes angular\nmomentum loss.

In primarily neutral regions, dust grains move as aerodynamic particles,\nnot necessarily with the gas. We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case.

In this paper, we present the analysis of \\object{HD175607}, an old G6\nstar with metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.62. We gathered 119 radial velocity\nmeasurements in 110 nights over a time span of more than nine years. Methods.\nThe radial velocities were analysed using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, a genetic\nalgorithm, a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, and a Gaussian processes\nanalysis. The spectra were also used to derive stellar properties. Several\nactivity indicators were analysed to study the effect of stellar activity on\nthe radial velocities. Results. We find evidence for the presence of a small\nNeptune-mass planet (M$_{p}\\sin i = 8.98\\pm1.10$\\,M$_{\\oplus}$) orbiting this\nstar with an orbital period $P = 29.01\\pm0.02$\\, days in a slightly eccentric\norbit ($e=0.11\\pm0.08$). The period of this Neptune is close to the estimated\nrotational period of the star.

For the former, the\nmeasured gap widths are used for calibrating the mass of the bodies, while for\nthe latter, the measured gap depths are utilized. We show that their masses are\nlikely comparable to or less than the mass of Jovian planets, and then discuss\nan origin of the observed gap structure.

Previous studies using simulated\nphotometry of Earth show that continuous observations over most of a planet's\norbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general\nplanets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a\nsimple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity\nfrom light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the\nproduct of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the\nvisibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of\nillumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved\nphotometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which\nsweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's\nmovement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with\nnon-zero obliquity on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's\nlongitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct functions of obliquity and\naxial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects the\nkernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is\nEast-West uniform or spinning rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find\nthat perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital phases is usually\nsufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis.

The planet manifested itself during the\nmicrolensing event MOA 2011-BLG-028/OGLE-2011-BLG-0203 as a low-mass companion\nto the lens star. The analysis of the light curve provides the measurement of\nthe mass ratio: (1.2 +- 0.2) x 10^-4, which indicates the mass of the planet to\nbe 12-60 Earth masses. The lensing system is located at 7.3 +- 0.7 kpc away\nfrom the Earth near the direction to Baade's Window.

We\nidentify mixture models with different primordial planetesimal disk properties\nthat self-consistently recover the multiplicity, period ratio and duration\nratio distributions of the Kepler planets. We draw three main conclusions: (1)\nWe favor a \"frozen-in\" narrative for systems of short period planets, in which\nthey are stable over long timescales, as opposed to metastable. (2) The \"Kepler\ndichotomy\", an observed phenomenon of the Kepler sample wherein the\narchitectures of planetary systems appear to either vary significantly or have\nmultiple modes, can naturally be explained by formation within planetesimal\ndisks with varying surface density profiles.

However,\nat the moment there remain key gaps in our theoretical understanding. The vast\nmajority of transition discs are accreting onto their central stars, indicating\nthat - at least close to the star - dust has been depleted from the gas by a\nvery large amount. In this review, we discuss evidence for two distinct\npopulations of transition discs: mm-faint - those with low mm-fluxes, small\nholes ($\\lesssim$10AU) and low accretion rates (~1e-10-1e-9 Msun/yr) and\nmm-bright - discs with large mm-fluxes, large holes ($\\gtrsim$20 AU) and high\naccretion rates ~1e-8 Msun/yr. MM-faint transition discs are consistent with\nwhat would naively be expected from a disc undergoing dispersal; however,\nmm-bright discs are not, and are likely to be rare and long-lived objects. We\ndiscuss the two commonly proposed mechanisms for creating transition discs:\nphotoevaporation and planet-disc interactions, with a particular emphasis on\nhow they would evolve in these models, comparing these predictions to the\nobserved population. More theoretical work on explaining the lack of optically\nthick, non-accreting transition discs is required in both the photoevaporation\nand planetary hypothesis, before we can start to use transition discs to\nconstrain models of planet formation.

These models predict the formation of\ncounter-rotating disks with a deep gap in the gas surface density separating\nthe inner disk (corotating with the star) and the outer counter-rotating disk.\nThe properties of these gaps are compared to those of planet-bearing gaps that\nform in disks hosting giant planets. We employ numerical hydrodynamics\nsimulations of collapsing cores that are replenished from the local\ncounter-rotating environment, as well as numerical hydrodynamic simulations of\nisolated disks hosting giant planets, to derive the properties of the gaps that\nform in both cases. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that counter-rotating\ndisks can form for a wide range of mass and angular momentum available in the\nlocal environment. The gap that separates both disks has a depletion factor\nsmaller than 1%, can be located at a distance from ten to over a hundred AU\nfrom the star, and can propagate inward with velocity ranging from 1 AU/Myr to\n>100 AU/Myr.

A key factor governing the\nconditions near the star is the silicate sublimation front, which largely\ndetermines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner\nrim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the sublimation\nfront in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae\nstars. The models are axisymmetric, and include starlight heating, silicate\ngrains sublimating and condensing to equilibrium at the local, time-dependent\ntemperature and density, and accretion stresses parametrizing the results of\nMHD magneto-rotational turbulence models. The results compare well with\nradiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable.

Previously, we showed that for binary mass ratios 0.06 < q < 0.8,\nsynchronous L2 mass loss results in a radiatively inefficient, dust-forming\nunbound equatorial outflow. A similar outflow exists irrespective of q if the\nratio of the sound speed to the orbital speed at the injection point is\nsufficiently large, \\epsilon = c_T/v_orb > 0.15. By contrast, for cold L2\nmass-loss (\\epsilon < 0.15) from binaries with q < 0.06 or q > 0.8, the\nequatorial outflow instead remains marginally-bound and falls back to the\nbinary over tens to hundreds of binary orbits, where it experiences additional\ntidal torqueing and shocking. As the bound gas becomes virialized with the\nbinary, the luminosity of the system increases slowly at approximately constant\nphotosphere radius, causing the temperature to rise. Subsequent evolution\ndepends on the efficiency of radiative cooling. If the bound atmosphere is able\nto cool efficiently, as quantified by radiative diffusion time being shorter\nthan the advection time (t_diff/t_adv < 1), then the virialized gas collapses\nto an excretion disk, while for t_diff/t_adv > 1 an isotropic wind is formed.\nBetween these two extremes, an inflated envelope transports the heat generated\nnear the binary to the surface by meridional flows.

Abstract: Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities.

A finite element\nmethod is used to simulate heat conductivity inside a boulder, to find the\nrecoil force experienced by it. Then an ellipsoidal asteroid uniformly covered\nby such boulders is considered and the torque is numerically integrated over\nits surface. Results. Tangential YORP is found to operate on non-zero\nobliquities and decreases by a factor of 2 for increasing obliquity. \n\n"}

This is possible by detecting the effects of the\ngravitational pull of the companion (ellipsoidal modulations) and in some\ncases, the photometric imprints of the Doppler effect when observing in a broad\nband (Doppler beaming). We aim to photometrically unveil the nature of some\ntransiting objects showing clear modulations in the phase-folded Kepler light\ncurve.

We modeled their phase-folded light curves with consistent\nequations for the three effects, namely, reflection, ellipsoidal and beaming\n(known as REB modulations). We provide detailed general equations for the fit\nof the REB modulations for the case of eccentric orbits.

In this work, we explore an alternative evolutionary route\ntoward UCXBs where the companions evolve from intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars\nwith an anomalously strong magnetic field ($100 - 10000$\\,G). Including the\nmagnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an\nirradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accreting component,\nwe show that intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) can evolve into UCXBs.\nUsing the \\emph{MESA} code, we have calculated evolutionary sequences for a\nlarge number of IMXBs. The simulated results indicate that, for a small\nwind-driving efficiency $f=10^{-5}$, the anomalous magnetic braking can drive\nIMXBs to an ultra-short period of 11 min.

The planet has 20, 100, or 1000~M$_\\oplus$,\nranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a\ndeep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model disk's\nappearance. The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under starlight\nheating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in\nscattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by\nanother more distant planet.

Here, I estimate\nbounds for the mass and orbit of a distant extra planet that would incite\nfuture instability in systems with a Sun-like star and giant planets with\nmasses and orbits equivalent to those of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. I\nfind that this boundary is diffuse and strongly dependent on each of the\ndistant planet's orbital parameters. Nevertheless, I claim that instability\noccurs more often than not when the planet is as massive as Jupiter and\nharbours a semimajor axis exceeding about 300 au, or has a mass of a\nsuper-Earth and a semimajor axis exceeding about 3000 au. These results hold\nfor orbital pericentres ranging from 100 to at least 400 au. This instability\nscenario might represent a common occurrence, as potentially evidenced by the\nubiquity of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres throughout the Galaxy. \n\n"}

The temperate Earth-mass planet Proxima b is the closest exoplanet\nto Earth and represents what may be our best ever opportunity to search for\nlife outside the Solar System. Aims. We aim at directly detecting Proxima b and\ncharacterizing its atmosphere by spatially resolving the planet and obtaining\nhigh-resolution reflected-light spectra. Methods. We propose to develop a\ncoupling interface between the SPHERE high-contrast imager and the new ESPRESSO\nspectrograph, both installed at ESO VLT. The angular separation of 37 mas\nbetween Proxima b and its host star requires the use of visible wavelengths to\nspatially resolve the planet on a 8.2-m telescope. At an estimated\nplanet-to-star contrast of ~10^-7 in reflected light, Proxima b is extremely\nchallenging to detect with SPHERE alone. However, the combination of a\n~10^3-10^4 contrast enhancement from SPHERE to the high spectral resolution of\nESPRESSO can reveal the planetary spectral features and disentangle them from\nthe stellar ones. Results. We find that significant but realistic upgrades to\nSPHERE and ESPRESSO would enable a 5-sigma detection of the planet and yield a\nmeasurement of its true mass and albedo in 20-40 nights of telescope time,\nassuming an Earth-like atmospheric composition. Moreover, it will be possible\nto probe the O2 bands at 627, 686 and 760 nm, the water vapour band at 717 nm,\nand the methane band at 715 nm. In particular, a 3.6-sigma detection of O2\ncould be made in about 60 nights of telescope time. Those would need to be\nspread over 3 years considering optimal observability conditions for the\nplanet. Conclusions. The very existence of Proxima b and the SPHERE-ESPRESSO\nsynergy represent a unique opportunity to detect biosignatures on an exoplanet\nin the near future. It is also a crucial pathfinder experiment for the\ndevelopment of Extremely Large Telescopes and their instruments (abridged). \n\n"}

Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates.

At\nz=0.1018, it is one of the closest and the UV brightest such events, with 17.4\n(AB) magnitude in Swift UV band (1928A) at -11days pre-maximum. Assuming an\nexponential form, we derived the rise time of 33days and the peak bolometric\nluminosity of 3x10^{44}ergs^-1. At maximum light, the estimated photospheric\ntemperature and velocity are 17,000K and 14,000kms^-1 respectively. The\ninferred radiative and kinetic energy are roughly 1x10^{51} and 2x10^{52}erg.\nGaia16apd is extremely UV luminous, emitting 50% of its total luminosity at\n1000 - 2500A. Compared to the UV spectra (normalized at 3100A) of well studied\nSN1992A (Ia), SN2011fe(Ia), SN1999em (IIP) and SN1993J (IIb), it has orders of\nmagnitude more far-UV emission. This excess is interpreted primarily as a\nresult of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of\niron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate\neither from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our\nobservation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized\nmaterial, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor\nmetallicity is likely sub-solar. This disfavors Pair-Instability Supernova\n(PISN) models with Helium core masses >=90Msun, where substantial 56Ni material\nis produced. Higher photospheric temperature of Gaia16apd than that of normal\nSNe may also contribute to the observed far-UV excess.

The goal of this work is to verify which of\nthese two scenarios is more compatible with pebble accretion, and whether we\ncan distinguish observationally between them via the resulting planetary C/O\nratios and core masses. Our results show that, for solar system composition,\nthe C/O ratios will vary but moderately between the two populations, since a\nsignificant amount of carbon and oxygen are locked up in refractories. In this\ncase, we find a strong correlation between the carbon and oxygen abundances and\ncore mass. The C/O ratio variations are more pronounced in the case where we\nassume that all carbon and oxygen are in volatiles. On average, Hot-Jupiters\nforming \"in-situ\" inside the snowline will have higher C/O ratios because they\naccrete less water ice. However, only Hot-Jupiters forming in-situ around stars\nwith C/O=0.8 can have a C/O ratio higher than unity.

Using the SOFI\nspectrograph on the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope,\nwe obtained R ~ 1000 J-, H-, and K-band (0.95 - 2.52 microns) spectra of 34\nlate-type K2 planet and candidate planet host systems and 12 bright K4-M5\ndwarfs with interferometrically measured radii and effective temperatures. Out\nof our 34 late-type K2 targets, we identify 27 of these stars as M dwarfs. We\nmeasure equivalent widths of spectral features, derive calibration relations\nusing stars with interferometric measurements, and estimate stellar radii,\neffective temperatures, masses, and luminosities for the K2 planet hosts. Our\ncalibrations provide radii and temperatures with median uncertainties of 0.059\nR_sun (16.09%) and 160 K (4.33%), respectively. We then reassess the radii and\nequilibrium temperatures of known and candidate planets based on our\nspectroscopically derived stellar parameters. Since a planet's radius and\nequilibrium temperature depends on the parameters of its host star, our study\nprovides more precise planetary parameters for planets and candidates orbiting\nlate-type stars observed with K2. We find a median planet radius and an\nequilibrium temperature of approximately 3R_earth and 500 K, with several\nsystems (K2-18b and K2-72e) receiving near-Earth like levels of incident\nirradiation. \n\n"}

Null\n  results for 19 planets Abstract: Short-period super-Earths and Neptunes are now known to be very frequent\naround solar-type stars. Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our\nSpitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted\nplanets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them. Our\nlight curves demonstrate for Warm Spitzer excellent photometric precisions: for\n14 targets out of 19, we were able to reach standard deviations that were\nbetter than 50ppm per 30 min intervals. Combined with its Earth-trailing orbit,\nwhich makes it capable of pointing any star in the sky and to monitor it\ncontinuously for days, this work confirms Spitzer as an optimal instrument to\ndetect sub-mmag-deep transits on the bright nearby stars targeted by Doppler\nsurveys. \n\n"}

Here we study the dynamics of\na system by taking the tertiary mass to zero and solve the hierarchical three\nbody system up to the octupole level of approximation. We find a rich dynamics\nthat the outer orbit undergoes due to gravitational perturbations from the\ninner binary. The nominal result of the precession of the nodes is mostly\nlimited for the lowest order of approximation, however, when the octupole-level\nof approximation is introduced the system becomes chaotic, as expected, and the\ntertiary oscillates below and above 90deg, similarly to the non-test particle\nflip behavior (e.g., Naoz 2016).

This paper motivates\nfinding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical\nprobabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual\ninclination and orbital precession. The precession and relative three-body\nmotion can increase the transit probability to as high as tens of per cent, and\nmake it inherently time-dependent over a precession period as short as 5-10 yr.\nCircumstellar planets in such tight binaries present a tempting observational\nchallenge: enhanced transit probabilities but with a quasi-periodic signature\nthat may be difficult to identify.

The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If\nplanets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large\nmass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner\norbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper\nconsiders the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more\nplanets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually\ntransiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have\nperiastron $p>10$ AU.

In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution.

In the\npresent work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large\nprogram with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical\nsample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including 3 stars with sub-stellar\ncompanions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming linear flat\ndistributions for the mass and semi-major axis of planets, we estimate the\nsub-stellar companion frequency to be within 0.75-5.7% at the 68% confidence\nlevel (CL) within 20-300 AU and 0.5-75 $M_{Jup}$, which is compatible with\npreviously published results. We also compare our results with the predictions\nof state-of-the-art population synthesis models based on the gravitational\ninstability (GI) formation scenario by Forgan & Rice (2013), with and without\nscattering. We estimate that in both the scattered and non-scattered\npopulations, we would be able to detect more than 30% of companions in the 1-75\n$M_{Jup}$ range (95% CL). With the 3 sub-stellar detections in our sample, we\nestimate the fraction of stars that host a planetary system formed by GI to be\nwithin 1.0-8.6% (95% CL).

We present a novel idea for detecting planets bound to such mass\ntransfer binaries: we propose that the X-ray light curves of these binaries be\ninspected for signatures of transiting planets. X-ray transits may be the only\nway to detect planets around some systems, while providing a complementary\napproach to optical and/or radio observations in others. Any planets associated\nwith X-ray binaries must be in stable orbits. We consider the range of\nallowable separations and find that orbital periods can be hours or longer,\nwhile transit durations extend upward from about a minute for Earth-radius\nplanets in very close orbits, to hours for Jupiter-radius planets in wider\norbits. The search for planets around mass transfer binaries could begin at\nonce with existing X-ray observations of these systems. If and when a planet is\ndetected around an X-ray binary, the size and mass of the planet may be readily\nmeasured, and it may also be possible to study the transmission and absorption\nof X-rays through its atmosphere.

A planet cools down from\na hot initial state to the present state by losing energy through radiative\nemission from its atmosphere. Thus, the atmospheric properties affect the\nplanetary cooling rate. Previous theories of giant planet cooling assume that\nthe atmospheric composition is unchanged throughout evolution. Planet formation\ntheories, however, suggest that the atmospheres especially of ice giants are\nrich in heavy elements in the early stages. Those heavy elements include\ncondensable species such as water, ammonia, and methane, which are expected to\nhave a great impact on atmospheric temperature and, thus, radiative emission\nthrough latent heat release. In this study we investigate the effect of such\ncondensation on the planetary emission flux and quantify the impact on the\ncooling timescale. We then demonstrate that the latent heat of those species\nkeeps the atmosphere hot and thus the emission flux high for billions of years,\nresulting in acceleration of the cooling of ice giants. This sheds light on the\nlong-standing problem that Uranus is much less bright than theoretically\npredicted and is different in brightness from Neptune in spite of similarity in\nmass and radius. Also, we find that young ice giants with highly enriched\natmospheres are much brighter in mid-infrared than those with unenriched\natmospheres. This provides important implication for future direct imaging of\nextrasolar ice giants. \n\n"}

A\nsimilar precision can be obtained in modelling only if other astrophysical\neffects, including the stellar limb-darkening, are accounted for properly. In\nthis paper, we explore the limits on precision due to the mathematical formulas\ncurrently adopted to approximate the stellar limb-darkening, and to the use of\nlimb-darkening coefficients obtained either from stellar-atmosphere models or\nempirically. We propose a new limb-darkening law with two coefficients,\n`power-2', which outperforms other two-coefficient laws adopted in the\nliterature in most cases, and particularly for cool stars.

Consistent\nwith recent studies, the dynamo action is found to be sensitive to the aspect\nratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the\ndirection normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial\ndirection). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To\nexplain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a\nlong box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most\nefficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a\nresult, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal\n(stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux\nspreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are\npermeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the\ninstability. In agreement with this picture, the cases when the dynamo is\nefficient are characterized by a strong intermittency of the local azimuthal\nmagnetic fluxes. \n\n"}

The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is\nshown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6\nRearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the\nphotoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ~30-60 days, if\nthese planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for\nplanet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets. \n\n"}

By using frequency analysis we\ndetermined the stability of the small moons and characterize, through diffusion\nmaps, the dynamical behavior of a wide region of geometric phase space, $a$ vs\n$e$, surrounding them. Those maps could shed light on the possible initial\nnumber of small bodies close to Mimas, and help to better understand the\ndynamical origin of the small satellites.

Dust grains radially\ndrift due to gas--dust friction, and the gas is affected by the feedback from\ndust grains. We investigate the effects of the feedback from dust grains on the\nviscous evolution of the gas, taking into account the vertical dust settling.\nThe feedback from the grains pushes the gas outward. When the grains are small\nand the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much smaller than unity, the radial drift\nvelocity is reduced by the feedback effect but the gas still drifts inward.\nWhen the grains are sufficiently large or piled-up, the feedback is so\neffective that forces the gas flows outward. Although the dust feedback is\naffected by dust settling, we found that the 2D approximation reasonably\nreproduces the vertical averaged flux of gas and dust. We also performed the 2D\ntwo-fluid hydrodynamic simulations to examine the effect of the feedback from\nthe grains on the evolution of the gas disk.

Previous\nobservations however suggest a high disk accretion rate onto the central star.\nThis configuration is not necessarily intuitive in the framework of the\nconventional viscous disk model, since efficient accretion generally requires a\nhigh level of turbulence, which can suppress dust settling considerably. We\ndevelop a simplified, semi-analytical disk model to examine under what\ncondition these two properties can be realized in a single model.

In this article, I present an analytical model of\nresonant chains of any number of planets. Using this model, I show that a\nsystem captured in a resonant chain can librate around several possible\nequilibrium configurations. The probability of capture around each equilibrium\ndepends on how the chain formed, and especially on the order in which the\nplanets have been captured in the chain. Therefore, for an observed resonant\nchain, knowing around which equilibrium the chain is librating allows for\nconstraints to be put on the formation and migration scenario of the system.

This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to\nsystematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of\nSNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We\nperformed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties\nof SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley\nrapid binary evolution code. We also considered the influence of different\nmetallicities on the final results. Results: From our simulations, we found\nthat no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a CO WD\nand a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time.\nThis scenario mainly contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long\ndelay times. The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and\na He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and\ncover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from\nthis scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities. \n\n"}

Starspot activity produces quasi-sinusoidal light curves whose phase and\namplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We\nused a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of\nthe light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of\nstarspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the\ntemperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in\nparticular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with\ncurrent theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay. We also find\nthat the Sun is not unusually quiet for its spectral type - stars with\nsolar-type rotation periods and temperatures tend to have (comparatively)\nsmaller starspots than stars with mid-G or later spectral types. \n\n"}

Abstract: The first direct detection of the asteroidal YORP effect, a phenomenon that\nchanges the spin states of small bodies due to thermal reemission of sunlight\nfrom their surfaces, was obtained for (54509) YORP 2000 PH5. Such an alteration\ncan slowly increase the rotation rate of asteroids, driving them to reach their\nfission limit and causing their disruption. This process can produce binaries\nand unbound asteroid pairs. Secondary fission opens the door to the eventual\nformation of transient but genetically-related groupings. Here, we show that\nthe small near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 2017 FZ2 was a co-orbital of our planet of\nthe quasi-satellite type prior to their close encounter on 2017 March 23.\nBecause of this flyby with the Earth, 2017 FZ2 has become a non-resonant NEA.\nOur N-body simulations indicate that this object may have experienced\nquasi-satellite engagements with our planet in the past and it may return as a\nco-orbital in the future. We identify a number of NEAs that follow similar\npaths, the largest named being YORP, which is also an Earth's co-orbital. An\napparent excess of NEAs moving in these peculiar orbits is studied within the\nframework of two orbit population models. A possibility that emerges from this\nanalysis is that such an excess, if real, could be the result of mass shedding\nfrom YORP itself or a putative larger object that produced YORP. Future\nspectroscopic observations of 2017 FZ2 during its next visit in 2018 (and of\nrelated objects when feasible) may be able to confirm or reject this\ninterpretation. \n\n"}

Several\nrecent studies have shown that a planet with a mass of about 10 Earth masses on\na distant eccentric orbit with perihelion far beyond the Kuiper belt could\ncreate and maintain this clustering.

The study is based on the recognition that dust-gas mixtures are\ngenerically unstable to a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI), whenever the gas,\nabsent dust, supports undamped linear modes. We show that the \"streaming\ninstability\" is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides\nsimple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for\nits growth rates and fastest-growing wavelengths. We extend this analysis to\nmore general dust streaming motions and other waves, including buoyancy and\nmagnetohydrodynamic oscillations, finding various new instabilities. Most\nimportantly, we identify the disk \"settling instability,\" which occurs as dust\nsettles vertically into the midplane of a rotating disk. For small grains, this\ninstability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming\ninstability, with a growth rate that is independent of grain size. Growth\ntimescales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disk orbital\nperiod, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude\nlarger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate\nlarger masses).

Our aim is to model the gaseous CO$_2$ abundance in the inner disk and\nuse this to probe the efficiency of icy dust transport in a viscous disk.\nFeatures in the simulated CO$_2$ spectra are investigated for their dust flux\ntracing potential.

The thermo-chemical code DALI was used\nto model the mid-infrared spectrum of CO$_2$, as can be observed with\nJWST-MIRI.

There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such\ndisks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the\nreconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows.

However, recent observations have confirmed the presence of a\nnon-negligible amount of cold gas in the circumstellar (CS) debris discs around\nyoung main-sequence stars.This cold gas has been suggested to be related to the\noutgassing of planetesimals and cometary-like objects. The aim of the paper is\nto investigate the presence of hot gas in the surroundings of stars bearing\ncold-gas debris discs. High-resolution optical spectra of all currently known\ncold-gas-bearing debris-disc systems, with the exception of $\\beta$ Pic and\nFomalhaut, have been obtained from different observatories.We have analysed the\nCa II H & K and the Na I D lines searching for non-photospheric absorptions of\nCS origin, usually attributed to cometary-like activity. Narrow, stable Ca II\nand/or Na I absorption features have been detected superimposed to the\nphotospheric lines in 10 out of the 15 observed cold-gas-bearing debris\ndisc.Features are found at the radial velocity of the stars, or slightly blue-\nor red-shifted, and/or at the velocity of the local interstellar medium (ISM).\nSome stars also present transient variable events or absorptions extended\ntowards red wavelengths. These are the first detections of such Ca II features\nin 7 out of the 15 observed stars. In some of these stars, results suggest that\nthe stable and variable absorptions arise from relatively hot gas located in\nthe CS close-in environment. This hot gas is detected in at least ~80%, of\nedge-on cold-gas-bearing debris discs, while in only ~10% of the discs seen\nclose to face-on. We interpret this as a geometrical effect, and suggest that\nthe non-detection of hot gas absorptions is due to the disc inclination rather\nthan to the absence of the hot-gas component. \n\n"}

In this paper, we carry out a systematic study\nemploying long-term numerical simulations aimed at characterizing the critical\nparticle-size for retention outside a gap as a function of particle size and\nfor various key parameters defining the protoplanetary disk model. To this end,\nwe perform multifluid hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions, including\ndifferent dust species, which we treat as pressureless fluids. We initialize\nthe dust outside of the planet's orbit and study under which conditions dust\ngrains are able to cross the gap carved by the planet. In agreement with\nprevious work, we find that the permeability of the gap depends both on dust\ndynamical properties and the gas disk structure: while small dust follows the\nviscously accreting gas through the gap, dust grains approaching a critical\nsize are progressively filtered out. Moreover, we introduce and compute a\ndepletion factor that enables us to quantify the way in which higher viscosity,\nsmaller planet mass, or a more massive disk can shift this critical size to\nlarger values.

After few days, the HeI\n5876 A transition appears with a P-Cygni profile and an expansion velocity of\nabout 8700 km/s. Fifty days after maximum, the spectrum shows signs typically\nseen in interacting supernovae.

At these phases Halpha starts to show an intermediate component, which\ntogether with the blue pseudo-continuum are clues that the ejecta begin to\ninteract with the CSM.

This is important for planetary habitability\nbecause snowball events may trigger rises in the complexity of life, but could\nalso endanger complex life that already exists. Recent work has shown that\nplanets tidally locked in synchronous rotation states will transition smoothly\ninto the snowball state rather than experiencing bifurcations. Here we\ninvestigate the structure of snowball bifurcations on planets that are tidally\ninfluenced, but not synchronously rotating, so that they experience long solar\ndays. We use PlaSIM, an intermediate-complexity global climate model, with a\nthermodynamic mixed layer ocean and the Sun's spectrum. We find that the amount\nof hysteresis (range in stellar flux for which there is bistability in climate)\nis significantly reduced for solar days with lengths of tens of Earth days, and\ndisappears for solar days of hundreds of Earth days. These results suggest that\ntidally influenced planets orbiting M and K-stars that are not synchronously\nrotating could have much less hysteresis associated with the snowball\nbifurcations than they would if they were rapidly rotating. This implies that\nthe amount of time it takes them to escape a snowball state via CO$_2$\noutgassing would be greatly reduced, as would the period of cycling between the\nwarm and snowball state if they have a low CO$_2$ outgassing rate. \n\n"}

Nonlinear particle clumping from the SI can trigger\ngravitational collapse into planetesimals. To better understand the numerical\nrobustness of the SI, we perform a suite of vertically-stratified 3D\nsimulations with fixed physical parameters known to produce strong clumping. We\nvary the numerical implementation, namely the computational domain size and the\nvertical boundary conditions (vBCs), comparing newly-implemented outflow vBCs\nto the previously-used periodic and reflecting vBCs. We find strong particle\nclumping by the SI is mostly independent of the vBCs. However, peak particle\ndensities are higher in larger simulation domains due to a larger particle mass\nreservoir. We report SI-triggered zonal flows, i.e., azimuthally-banded radial\nvariations of gas pressure. These structures have low amplitudes, insufficient\nto halt particle radial drift, confirming that particle trapping in gas\npressure maxima is not the mechanism of the SI. We find that outflow vBCs\nproduce artificially large gas outflow rates at vertical boundaries. However,\nthe outflow vBCs reduce artificial reflections at vertical boundaries, allowing\nmore particle sedimentation, and showing less temporal variation and better\nconvergence with box size.

However, each of\nthe two main theories (core accretion, gravitational instability) is unable to\nexplain some key aspects. In many planet formation calculations, it is usual to\ntreat the initial properties of the planet forming disc (mass, radius, etc.) as\nfree parameters. In this paper, we stress the importance of setting the\nformation of planet forming discs within the context of the formation of the\ncentral stars. By exploring the early stages of disc formation, we introduce\nthe concept of the Maximum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN), as opposed to the oft-used\nMinimum Mass Solar Nebula (here mmsn). It is evident that almost all\nprotoplanetary discs start their evolution in a strongly self-gravitating\nstate. In agreement with almost all previous work in this area, we conclude\nthat on the scales relevant to planet formation these discs are not\ngravitationally unstable to gas fragmentation, but instead form strong,\ntransient spiral arms. These spiral arms can act as efficient dust traps\nallowing the accumulation and subsequent fragmentation of the dust (but not the\ngas). This phase is likely to populate the disc with relatively large\nplanetesimals on short timescales while the disc is still veiled by a dusty-gas\nenvelope. Crucially, the early formation of large planetesimals overcomes the\nmain barriers remaining within the core accretion model.

Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such\nstars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying\nlocal environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar\ndensity ($n_{c} > 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant\nrole in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\\sim 3$ Myr. By\ncombining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in\na PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely\ndestroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local\nclusters we find that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD\npopulation then photoevaporation is always the dominating influence. \n\n"}

During their journey to perihelion, comets may appear in the\nfield-of-view of space-borne optical instruments, showing in some cases a\nnicely developed plasma tail extending from their coma and exhibiting an\noscillatory behaviour. Aims. The oscillations of cometary tails may be\nexplained in terms of vortex shedding because of the interaction of the comet\nwith the solar wind streams. Therefore, it is possible to exploit these\noscillations in order to infer the value of the Strouhal number $St$, which\nquantifies the vortex shedding phenomenon, and the physical properties of the\nlocal medium. Methods. We used the Heliospheric Imager (HI) data of the Solar\nTErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission to study the oscillations of\nthe tails of the comets 2P/Encke and C/2012 S1 (ISON) during their perihelion\nin Nov 2013, determining the Strouhal numbers from the estimates of the halo\nsize, the relative speed of the solar wind flow and the period of the\noscillations.

We reduce our model\nparameter set to two physical parameters: the opacity of the accreting\nplanetary atmospheres ($\\kappa_{\\rm{env}}$) and a measure of the efficiency of\nplanetary accretion after gap opening ($f_{\\rm{max}}$). We perform planet\npopulation synthesis calculations based on the initial observed distributions\nof host star and disk properties - their disk masses, lifetimes, and stellar\nmetallicities. We find the frequency of giant planet formation scales with disk\nmetallicity, in agreement with the observed Jovian planet frequency-metallicity\nrelation. We consider both X-ray and cosmic ray disk ionization models, whose\ndiffering ionization rates lead to different dead zone trap locations.

These planets,\nknown as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have attained their\norbits in situ. Instead, they must have migrated in. Here we propose that these\nplanets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a\nscaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their\nhigh mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via\nchaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo\norbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This\nproposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed\nby Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities\nand inclinations, and possibly extending beyond AU distances; while only a\nsmall fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none\nclosely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of\n~10-50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove\nangular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of ~5-10\ndays. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally\ncaptured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally\nexplains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant\ntransiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods\n(1-3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model\nalso predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and\ninclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of ~10-50 degrees; (ii)\nseveral outer planetary companions extending to beyond AU distances, both of\nwhich may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations. \n\n"}

In this study, we\ninvestigate the vertical distributions of particle size and mass density of\nmineral clouds in super-Earths using a microphysical model that takes into\naccount the vertical transport and growth of cloud particles in a\nself-consistent manner. We demonstrate that the vertical profiles of mineral\nclouds significantly vary with the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei\nand atmospheric metallicity. We find that the height of the cloud top increases\nwith increasing metallicity as long as the metallicity is lower than a\nthreshold. If the metallicity is larger than the threshold, the cloud-top\nheight no longer increases appreciably with metallicity because coalescence\nyields larger particles of higher settling velocities.

Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors\nin planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and mistakes in\ncompleteness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs,\nmaking it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates.\nHere we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try\nand clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate\ndensity measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The\nformula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary\nstars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and\nsingle stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries\nare over-represented in flux-limited samples.

In particular, unrecognized binaries\nare unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot\nJupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys.

In addition\nto delivering the crucial ingredients for life, NEOs can pose a serious hazard\nto humanity since they can impact the Earth.

One of the main aims of the NEOShield-2\nproject (2015--2017), financed by the European Community in the framework of\nthe Horizon 2020 program, is therefore to retrieve physical properties of a\nwide number of NEOs in order to design impact mitigation missions and assess\nthe consequences of an impact on Earth.

Here, we evaluate\nthis compositional difference in more detail by comparing output from two\n$N$-body planet formation models. The first of these planet formation models\nsimulates what is termed the \"Classical\" case wherein Jupiter and Saturn are\nkept in their current orbits.

Results of these analyses show that both models tend to yield\nEarth and Mars analogues whose accretion zones overlap. The Classical case\nfares better in forming Mars with its documented composition (29% to 68%\nenstatite chondrite plus 32% to 67% ordinary chondrite) though the Mars\nanalogues are generally too massive.

A low-mass companion, HD 142527 B,\nwas also found orbiting the primary star at $\\sim$14 au. This study aims to\nbetter characterize this companion, which could help explain its impact on the\npeculiar geometry of the disk. We observed the source with VLT/SINFONI in\n$H$+$K$ band in pupil-tracking mode. Data were post-processed with several\nalgorithms based on angular differential imaging (ADI). HD 142527 B is\nconspicuously re-detected in most spectral channels, which enables us to\nextract the first medium-resolution spectrum of a low-mass companion within\n0.1'' from its central star.

The belts get dynamically excited, either by planets\n('planet stirring') or by embedded big planetesimals ('self-stirring').\nCollisions between planetesimals become destructive and start to produce dust,\ncreating an observable debris disc. Following Kenyon & Bromley (2008), it is\noften assumed that self-stirring starts to operate as soon as the first ~1000\nkm-sized embedded 'Plutos' have formed. However, state-of-the-art pebble\nconcentration models robustly predict planetesimals between a few km and ~200\nkm in size to form in protoplanetary discs rapidly, before then slowly growing\ninto Pluto-sized bodies. We show that the timescale, on which these\nplanetesimals excite the disc sufficiently for fragmentation, is shorter than\nthe formation timescale of Plutos. Using an analytic model based on the Ida &\nMakino (1993) theory, backed up by numerical integrations, we find the\nexcitation timescale to be $T_{\\rm excite} \\approx 100 x_{\\rm m}^{-1}\nM_*^{-3/2} a^3$ Myr, where $x_{\\rm m}$ is the total mass of a protoplanetary\ndisc progenitor in the units of the Minimum-Mass Solar Nebula, $a$ its radius\nin the units of 100 AU, and $M_*$ is the stellar mass in solar masses.

A necessary\ncondition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical\nstability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler\nCBPs using numerical $N$-body integrations. We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,\nthe evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons\nin dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering\nstrong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct\ncollisions.

The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

We compute steady-state solutions, and\nshow that the radial motion of both the gas and the dust can deviate\nsubstantially from those for a single-size dust population. Although the\naerodynamic drag from the dust on the gas is weaker than in the case where all\ngrains are optimally coupled to the gas, the cumulative \"back-reaction\" of the\ndust particles can still alter the gas dynamics significantly. In typical\nprotoplanetary discs, the net effect of the dust back-reaction decreases the\ngas accretion flow compared to the dust-free (viscous) case, even for\ndust-to-gas ratios of order $1\\%$. In the outer disc, where dust grains are\ntypically less strongly coupled to the gas and settle towards the midplane, the\ndust back-reaction can even drive outward gas flow. Moreover, the radial inward\ndrift of large grains is reduced below the gas motion in the inner disc\nregions, while small dust grains follow the gas dynamics over all the disc\nextent. The resulting dust and gas dynamics can give rise to observable\nstructures, such as gas and dust cavities.

For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, we construct approximate models for the evolution of the librating\nargument over the period of 100 years, focusing on its principal amplitude and\nfrequency, and on the observed mean motion combinations associated with the\nquasi-resonant interactions. First, we numerically propagated the Cartesian\nequations of motion of the Jovian system for the period under examination, and\nby comparing the results with a suitable set of ephemerides, we derived the\nmain dynamical effects on the target quantities. Using these effects, we built\nan alternative Hamiltonian formulation and used the normal forms theory to\nlocate the resonance and to compute its main amplitude and frequency. From the\nCartesian model we observe that on the timescale considered and with\nephemerides as initial conditions, both the librating argument and the\ndiagnostics are well approximated by considering the mutual gravitational\ninteractions of Jupiter and the Galilean moons (including Callisto), and the\neffect of Jupiter's J2 harmonic. Under the same initial conditions, the\nHamiltonian formulation in which Callisto and J2 are reduced to their secular\ncontributions achieves larger errors for the quantities above, particularly for\nthe librating argument.

In addition to being a good starting point for a deeper\nunderstanding of the Laplace resonance, the models and methods described are\neasily generalizable to different types of multi-body mean motion resonances.\nThey are also prime tools for studying the dynamics of extrasolar systems. \n\n"}

The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be\noptically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult.\nWe find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc\nsurface is important for the line formation.

An atmosphere reaches chemical equilibrium if\nthe rates of the forward and backward chemical reactions converge to the same\nvalue. However, there are atmospheric processes, such as atmospheric transport,\nthat destabilize this equilibrium. In this work we study the changes in\ncomposition driven by a 3D wind field in WASP-43b using our Global Circulation\nModel, THOR. Our model uses validated temperature- and pressure-dependent\nchemical timescales that allow us to explore the disequilibrium chemistry of\nCO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O and CH$_4$. In WASP-43b the formation of the equatorial jet\nhas an important impact in the chemical distribution of the different species\nacross the atmosphere. At low latitudes the chemistry is longitudinally\nquenched, except for CO$_2$ at solar abundances. The polar vortexes have a\ndistinct chemical distribution since these are regions with lower temperature\nand atmospheric mixing. Vertical and latitudinal mixing have a secondary impact\nin the chemical transport. We determine graphically the effect of\ndisequilibrium on observed emission spectra. Our results do not show any\nsignificant differences in the emission spectra between the equilibrium and\ndisequilibrium solutions for C/O = 0.5. However, if C/O is increased to 2.0,\ndifferences in the spectra due to the disequilibrium chemistry of CH$_4$ become\nnon-negligible.

The line\nprofile shape is inconsistent with electron scattering wings, indicating\nhigh-velocity outflowing material. These are the fastest outflow speeds ever\nseen in a non-terminal massive star eruption. The broad wings are absent in\nearly phases of the eruption, but strengthen in the 1850s. These speeds are two\norders of magnitude faster than the escape speed from a warm supergiant, and\n5-10 times faster than winds from O-type or Wolf-Rayet stars. Instead, they are\nreminiscent of fast supernova ejecta or outflows from accreting compact\nobjects, profoundly impacting our understanding of eta Car and related\ntransients.

Previous models\nthat explain Xe fractionation by hydrodynamic hydrogen escape cannot gracefully\nexplain how Xe escaped when Ar and Kr did not, nor allow Xe to escape in the\nArchean. Here we show that Xe is the only noble gas that can escape as an ion\nin a photo-ionized hydrogen wind, possible in the absence of a geomagnetic\nfield or along polar magnetic field lines that open into interplanetary space.\nTo quantify the hypothesis we construct new 1-D models of hydrodynamic\ndiffusion-limited hydrogen escape from highly-irradiated CO$_2$-H$_2$-H\natmospheres. The models reveal three minimum requirements for Xe escape: solar\nEUV irradiation needs to exceed $10\\times$ that of the modern Sun; the total\nhydrogen mixing ratio in the atmosphere needs to exceed 1% (equiv. to 0.5%\nCH$_4$); and transport amongst the ions in the lower ionosphere needs to lift\nthe Xe ions to the base of the outflowing hydrogen corona. The long duration of\nXe escape implies that, if a constant process, Earth lost the hydrogen from at\nleast one ocean of water, roughly evenly split between the Hadean and the\nArchean. However, to account for both Xe's fractionation and also its depletion\nwith respect to Kr and primordial $^{244}$Pu, Xe escape must have been limited\nto small apertures or short episodes, which suggests that Xe escape was\nrestricted to polar windows by a geomagnetic field, or dominated by outbursts\nof high solar activity, or limited to transient episodes of abundant hydrogen,\nor a combination of these. Xenon escape stopped when the hydrogen (or methane)\nmixing ratio became too small, or EUV radiation from the aging Sun became too\nweak, or charge exchange between Xe$^+$ and O$_2$ rendered Xe neutral. \n\n"}

We use the radiative transfer code CMFGEN to\nbuild an extensive library of spectra simulating the interaction of supernovae\nand their progenitor's winds/circumstellar medium (CSM). We consider a range of\nprogenitor mass-loss rates (Mdot = 5e-4 to 1e-2 Msun/yr), abundances (solar,\nCNO-processed, and He-rich), and SN luminosities (L = 1.9e8 to 2.5e10 Lsun).\nThe models simulate events ~1 day after explosion, and we assume a fixed\nlocation of the shock front as Rin=8.6e13 cm. We show that the large range of\nmassive star properties at the pre-SN stage causes a diversity of early-time\ninteracting SN and impostors. We identify three main classes of early-time\nspectra consisting of relatively high-ionisation (e.g. Ovi), medium-ionisation\n(e.g. Ciii), and low-ionisation lines (e.g. Feii/iii).

This study presents non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of\nvarious single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars\nof diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after\nexplosion. Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition\nprofile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main\ninfluence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta\non week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,\nshifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted\nsolar metallicity), creating blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and\nmagnetar properties introduces various stretches and shifts to the light curve\n(rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum, all\nmodels show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely\nOIII and CIII lines. Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the\nhigh-brightness phase. After maximum, higher energy explosions are hotter and\nmore ionized, and produce spectra that are optically bluer. Clumping is a\nsource of spectral diversity after maximum. Clumping is essential to trigger\nejecta recombination and yield the presence of OI, CaII, and FeII lines from a\nfew weeks after maximum until nebular times.

A recent model has proposed that the giant planet\ninstability happened during terrestrial planet formation. This scenario has\nbeen shown to match the inner solar system by stunting Mars' growth and\npreventing planet formation in the asteroid belt. Here we present a large\nsample of new simulations of the \"Early Instability\" scenario. We use an N-body\nintegration scheme that accounts for collisional fragmentation, and also\nperform a large set of control simulations that do not include an early giant\nplanet instability. Since the total particle number decreases slower when\ncollisional fragmentation is accounted for, the growing planets' orbits are\ndamped more strongly via dynamical friction and encounters with small bodies\nthat dissipate angular momentum (eg: hit-and-run impacts). Compared with\nsimulations without collisional fragmentation, our fully evolved systems\nprovide better matches to the solar system's terrestrial planets in terms of\ntheir compact mass distribution and dynamically cold orbits. Collisional\nprocesses also tend to lengthen the dynamical accretion timescales of Earth\nanalogs, and shorten those of Mars analogs. This yields systems with relative\ngrowth timescales more consistent with those inferred from isotopic dating.\nAccounting for fragmentation is thus supremely important for any successful\nevolutionary model of the inner solar system. \n\n"}

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength. We show that the composite\ngrain model cannot be ruled out if constituent particles are very small with\nradius $a_{p}\\le$ 25 nm, but large composite grains would be destroyed if the\nparticles are large with $a_{p}\\ge 50$ nm. We suggest that grain internal\nstructures can be constrained with observations using the dynamical RATD\nconstraint for strong radiation fields such as supernova, nova, or star-forming\nregions. Finally, our obtained results suggest that micron-sized grains perhaps\nhave compact/core-mantle structures or have composite structures but located in\nregions with slightly higher gas density and weaker radiation intensity than\nthe average ISM. \n\n"}

The satellite orbits Daphne on an equatorial, quasi-circular, prograde\norbit, like the satellites of many other large main-belt asteroids. The shape\nmodel of Daphne reveals several large flat areas that could be large impact\ncraters.

{"id": "1901.08719", "contents": "Title: Searching for Super-Fast Rotators Using the Pan-STARRS 1 Abstract: A class of asteroids, called large super-fast rotators (large SFRs), have\nrotation periods shorter than 2 hours and diameters larger than ~ 0.3 km. They\npose challenges to the usual interior rubble-pile structure unless a relatively\nhigh bulk density is assumed. So far, only six large SFRs have been found.\nTherefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1\ntelescopes during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study\ntheir properties. A total of 876 reliable rotation periods are measured, among\nwhich seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory of known large\nSFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations\nin the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the\nlocation preference in the inner main belt of the six perviously known large\nSFRs could be a bias due to various observational limits. Interestingly, five\nout of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.\nConsidering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar\nsurveys (Chang et al., 2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the\nchance of detecting a large SFR in the inner main belt seems to be relatively\nlow. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less large SFRs\nthan the mid main belt. From our survey, we also found the drop in number\nappearing at f > 5 rev/day on the spin-rate distribution for the outer\nmain-belt asteroids of D < 3 km, which was reported for the inner and mid main\nbelt by (Chang et al., 2015, 2016). \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.10642", "contents": "Title: Theoretical models of the protostellar disks of AS 209 and HL Tau\n  presently forming in-situ planets Abstract: We fit an isothermal oscillatory density model to two ALMA/DSHARP-observed\ndisks, AS 209 and HL Tau, in which planets have presumably already formed and\nthey are orbiting within the observed seven dark gaps in each system. These\nlarge disks are roughly similar to our solar nebula, albeit they exhibit milder\nradial density profiles and they enjoy lower centrifugal support. We find\npower-law density profiles with index $k=0.0$ (radial densities $\\rho(R)\n\\propto R^{-1}$) and centrifugal support against self-gravity so small that it\nguarantees dynamical stability for millions of years of evolution. The scale\nlengths of the models differ only by a factor of 1.9, but the inner cores of\nthe disks are very different: HL Tau's core is 8.0 times larger and 3.6 times\ndenser than the core of AS 209. This results in four dark gaps having formed\nwithin the core of HL Tau, whereas no dark gap is found in the core of AS 209.\nOn the other hand, the Jeans frequencies and the angular velocities of the\ncores are comparable to within factors of 1.9 and 1.6, respectively. \n\n"}
