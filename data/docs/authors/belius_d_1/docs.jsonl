The limit is called the\ntail process or the spectral process depending on the way of rescaling. These\nprocesses provide convenient starting points to study, for instance, joint\nsurvival functions, tail dependence coefficients, extremograms, extremal\nindices, and point processes of extremes. The theory applies to linear\nprocesses composed of infinite sums of linearly transformed independent random\nelements whose common distribution is regularly varying. \n\n"}

The number variance problem consists in\ninvestigating if the variance of the number of \"particles\" N_n(L) lying in the\nball of radius L at a given time n remains bounded, or even better, converges\nto a finite limit, as $L\\to \\infty$. We give a necessary and sufficient\ncondition and discuss its relationship to transience/recurrence property of the\nwalk. Next we consider normalized fluctuations of N_n(L) around the mean as\n$n\\to \\infty$ and L is increased in an appropriate way.

We call it the\nintermediate disorder regime. It is accessed by scaling the inverse temperature\nparameter $\\beta$ to zero as the polymer length $n$ tends to infinity. The\nnatural choice of scaling is $\\beta_n:=\\beta n^{-1/4}$. We show that the\npolymer measure under this scaling has previously unseen behavior. While the\nfluctuation exponents of the polymer endpoint and the log partition function\nare identical to those for simple random walk ($\\zeta=1/2,\\chi=0$), the\nfluctuations themselves are different. These fluctuations are still influenced\nby the random environment, and there is no self-averaging of the polymer\nmeasure. In particular, the random distribution of the polymer endpoint\nconverges in law (under a diffusive scaling of space) to a random absolutely\ncontinuous measure on the real line. The randomness of the measure is inherited\nfrom a stationary process $A_{\\beta}$ that has the recently discovered\ncrossover distributions as its one-point marginals, which for large $\\beta$\nbecome the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution.

[In Applied Stochastic Analysis\n(1991) 121-156 Gordon & Breach] diffusion (BKR diffusion), neither of which\nstarts at the origin, and whose natural filtrations agree. The paper commences\nby surveying probabilistic coupling, introducing the formal definition of an\nimmersed coupling (the natural filtration of each component is immersed in a\ncommon underlying filtration; such couplings have been described as co-adapted\nor Markovian in older terminologies) and of an equi-filtration coupling (the\nnatural filtration of each component is immersed in the filtration of the\nother; consequently the underlying filtration is simultaneously the natural\nfiltration for each of the two coupled processes). This survey is followed by a\ndetailed case-study of the simpler but potentially thematic problem of coupling\nBrownian motion together with its local time at $0$. This problem possesses its\nown intrinsic interest as well as being closely related to the BKR coupling\nconstruction. Attention focusses on a simple immersed (co-adapted) coupling,\nnamely the reflection/synchronized coupling. It is shown that this coupling is\noptimal amongst all immersed couplings of Brownian motion together with its\nlocal time at $0$, in the sense of maximizing the coupling probability at all\npossible times, at least when not started at pairs of initial points lying in a\ncertain singular set. However numerical evidence indicates that the coupling is\nnot a maximal coupling, and is a simple but non-trivial instance for which this\ndistinction occurs. It is shown how the reflection/synchronized coupling can be\nconverted into a successful equi-filtration coupling, by modifying the coupling\nusing a deterministic time-delay and then by concatenating an infinite sequence\nof such modified couplings. The construction of an explicit equi-filtration\ncoupling of two copies of the BKR diffusion follows by a direct generalization,\nalthough the proof of success for the BKR coupling requires somewhat more\nanalysis than in the local time case. \n\n"}

This paper introduces a\nfinancial network model that combines the default and liquidity stress\nmechanisms into a \"double cascade mapping\". The progress and eventual result of\nthe crisis is obtained by iterating this mapping to its fixed point. Unlike\nsimpler models, this model can therefore quantify how illiquidity or default of\none bank influences the overall level of liquidity stress and default in the\nsystem. Large-network asymptotic cascade mapping formulas are derived that can\nbe used for efficient network computations of the double cascade. Numerical\nexperiments then demonstrate that these asymptotic formulas agree qualitatively\nwith Monte Carlo results for large finite networks, and quantitatively except\nwhen the initial system is placed in an exceptional \"knife-edge\" configuration.\nThe experiments clearly support the main conclusion that when banks respond to\nliquidity stress by hoarding liquidity, then in the absence of asset fire\nsales, the level of defaults in a financial network is negatively related to\nthe strength of bank liquidity hoarding and the eventual level of stress in the\nnetwork. \n\n"}

This is done via the\nPoisson Process Calculus as it now relates to latent feature models. The IBP\nwas ingeniously devised by Griffiths and Ghahramani in (2005) and its\ngenerative scheme is cast in terms of customers entering sequentially an Indian\nBuffet restaurant and selecting previously sampled dishes as well as new\ndishes. In this metaphor dishes corresponds to latent features, attributes,\npreferences shared by individuals. The IBP, and its generalizations, represent\nan exciting class of models well suited to handle high dimensional statistical\nproblems now common in this information age. The IBP is based on the usage of\nconditionally independent Bernoulli random variables, coupled with completely\nrandom measures acting as Bayesian priors, that are used to create sparse\nbinary matrices. This Bayesian non-parametric view was a key insight due to\nThibaux and Jordan (2007). One way to think of generalizations is to to use\nmore general random variables. Of note in the current literature are models\nemploying Poisson and Negative-Binomial random variables. However, unlike their\nclosely related counterparts, generalized Chinese restaurant processes, the\nability to analyze IBP models in a systematic and general manner is not yet\navailable. The limitations are both in terms of knowledge about the effects of\ndifferent priors and in terms of models based on a wider choice of random\nvariables.

A first step towards that larger goal is to\ndevelop information measures for individual output processes, including\ninformation generation (entropy rate), stored information (statistical\ncomplexity), predictable information (excess entropy), and active information\naccumulation (bound information rate). We calculate these for spike trains\ngenerated by a variety of noise-driven integrate-and-fire neurons as a function\nof time resolution and for alternating renewal processes. We show that their\ntime-resolution dependence reveals coarse-grained structural properties of\ninterspike interval statistics; e.g., $\\tau$-entropy rates that diverge less\nquickly than the firing rate indicate interspike interval correlations.

Under reasonable assumptions the\ntransformation from emitted pulses to the received echoes can approximately be\nregarded as linear. For the considered model, and many radar tasks in general,\nsparsity of targets within the considered angle-range-Doppler domain is a\nnatural assumption.

Assuming Gaussian random pulses\nthe resulting measurement matrix becomes a highly structured random matrix. Our\nfirst main result provides an estimate for the well-known restricted isometry\nproperty (RIP) ensuring stable and robust recovery.

Here Hurwitz introduced and developed the notion of an invariant\nmeasure for the matrix groups $SO(N)$ and $U(N)$.

Moreover, in practice, the\ndistribution of the data is commonly unknown, therefore bootstrap\napproximations can be used to approximate the distribution of the estimator.\nHence qualitative robustness of the statistical estimator under the bootstrap\napproximation is a desirable property. Currently most theoretical\ninvestigations on qualitative robustness assume independent and identically\ndistributed pairs of random variables. However, in practice this assumption is\nnot fulfilled. Therefore, we examine the qualitative robustness of bootstrap\napproximations for non-i.i.d. random variables, for example $\\alpha$-mixing and\nweakly dependent processes. In the i.i.d. case qualitative robustness is\nensured via the continuity of the statistical operator, representing the\nestimator, see Hampel (1971) and Cuevas and Romo (1993).

However, standard particle\nfilters with importance weights have been shown to require a sample size that\nincreases exponentially with the dimension D of the state space in order to\nachieve a certain performance, which precludes their use in very\nhigh-dimensional filtering problems.

In order to\nsoften the effects of weight degeneracy, most particle filters use particle\nresampling and improved proposal functions for the particle motion. We explain\nwhy neither of the two can prevent the COD in general. In order to address this\nfundamental problem, we investigate an existing filtering algorithm based on\noptimal feedback control that sidesteps the use of importance weights.

Such situations arise in a variety of\nmodern statistical problems. We first consider Gaussian approximations, namely,\napproximate the $U$-process supremum by the supremum of a Gaussian process, and\nderive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds. Such Gaussian approximations\nare, however, not often directly applicable in statistical problems since the\ncovariance function of the approximating Gaussian process is unknown.

Our regularity condition is\nweaker than the Lipschitz Hessian property and allows us to show faster\nconvergence bounds for a much larger class of distributions than would be\npossible with the usual Lipschitz Hessian constant alone. Important\ndistributions that satisfy our regularity condition include posterior\ndistributions used in Bayesian logistic regression for which the data satisfies\nan \"incoherence\" property. Our result compares favorably with the best\navailable bounds for the class of strongly log-concave distributions, which\ngrow like $d^{{1}/{2}}$ gradient evaluations with the dimension. Moreover, our\nsimulations on synthetic data suggest that, when our regularity condition is\nsatisfied, leapfrog HMC performs better than its competitors -- both in terms\nof accuracy and in terms of the number of gradient evaluations it requires. \n\n"}

It is partially\nasymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is q times the\nprobability of hopping right. Additionally, particles may enter from the left\nwith probability alpha and exit from the right with probability beta.\n  It has been observed that the (unique) stationary distribution of the PASEP\nhas remarkable connections to combinatorics -- see for example the papers of\nDerrida, Duchi and Schaeffer, and Corteel. Most recently we proved that in fact\nthe (normalized) probability of being in a particular state of the PASEP can be\nviewed as a certain weight generating function for permutation tableaux of a\nfixed shape. (This result implies the previous combinatorial results.) However,\nour proof relied on the matrix ansatz of Derrida et al, and hence did not give\nan intuitive explanation of why one should expect the steady state distribution\nof the PASEP to involve such nice combinatorics.\n  In this paper we define a Markov chain -- which we call the PT chain -- on\nthe set of permutation tableaux which projects to the PASEP in a very strong\nsense. This gives a new proof of our previous result which bypasses the matrix\nansatz altogether. Furthermore, via the bijection from permutation tableaux to\npermutations, the PT chain can also be viewed as a Markov chain on the\nsymmetric group. Another nice feature of the PT chain is that it possesses a\ncertain symmetry which extends the \"particle-hole symmetry\" of the PASEP.
