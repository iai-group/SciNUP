This result is consistent with\nthe extended TQFT hypotheses of Baez and Dolan, since it establishes that the\ncategory assigned to the circle can be obtained as the `higher trace of the\nidentity' of the 2-category assigned to the point.\n  The second result is about 2-characters of 2-representations, a concept which\nhas been introduced independently by Ganter and Kapranov. It is shown that the\n2-character of a unitary 2-representation can be made functorial with respect\nto morphisms of 2-representations, and that in fact the 2-character is a\nunitarily fully faithful functor from the complexified Grothendieck category of\nunitary 2-representations to the category of unitary equivariant vector bundles\nover the group.\n  The final result is about pivotal structures on fusion categories, with a\nview towards a conjecture made by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik.

A similar lecture\nseries was given in Hamburg in January 2013. The lecture notes are divided into\ntwo parts.\n  The first part, consisting of the bulk of these notes, provides an expository\naccount of the author's joint work with Christopher Douglas and Noah Snyder on\ndualizability in low-dimensional higher categories and the connection to\nlow-dimensional topology. The cobordism hypothesis provides bridge between\ntopology and algebra, establishing important connections between these two\nfields. One example of this is the prediction that the $n$-groupoid of\nso-called `fully-dualizable' objects in any symmetric monoidal $n$-category\ninherits an O(n)-action. However the proof of the cobordism hypothesis outlined\nby Lurie is elaborate and inductive. Many consequences of the cobordism\nhypothesis, such as the precise form of this O(n)-action, remain mysterious.\nThe aim of these lectures is to explain how this O(n)-action emerges in a range\nof low category numbers ($n \\leq 3$).\n  The second part of these lecture notes focuses on the author's joint work\nwith Clark Barwick on the Unicity Theorem, as presented in arXiv:1112.0040.\nThis theorem and the accompanying machinery provide an axiomatization of the\ntheory of $(\\infty,n)$-categories and several tools for verifying these axioms.\nThe aim of this portion of the lectures is to provide an introduction to this\nmaterial. \n\n"}

In the most interesting examples, the functor along\nwhich we left Kan extend goes between categories that enjoy universal\nproperties which express the meaning of the calculation we are trying to\nunderstand.

{"id": "1609.01394", "contents": "Title: On the homotopy theory for Lie $\\infty$-groupoids, with an application\n  to integrating $L_\\infty$-algebras Abstract: Lie $\\infty$-groupoids are simplicial Banach manifolds that satisfy an analog\nof the Kan condition for simplicial sets. An explicit construction of Henriques\nproduces certain Lie $\\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\\infty$-groups' by\nintegrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility\nbetween this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras\nintroduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy\ntheory for Lie $\\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher\ngeometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\\infty$-groupoids do not form\na category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks\npullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete\ncategory of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to\n`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure\nenjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of\nfunctorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial\nlocalization. We further prove that the acyclic fibrations are precisely the\nhypercovers, which implies that many of Behrend and Getzler's results also hold\nin this more general context. As an application, we show that Henriques'\nintegration functor is an exact functor with respect to a class of\ndistinguished fibrations which we call `quasi-split fibrations'. Such\nfibrations include acyclic fibrations as well as fibrations that arise in\nstring-like extensions. In particular, integration sends $L_\\infty$\nquasi-isomorphisms to weak equivalences, quasi-split fibrations to Kan\nfibrations, and preserves acyclic fibrations, as well as pullbacks of\nacyclic/quasi-split fibrations. \n\n"}

Our\nselected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B\nis the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the\nsemi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for\nabelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the\nconceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with\nthe natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,\nhomological category in the sense of M. Grandis.

For example, we prove that modules over the semiring\ncategory Fin of finite sets are cocartesian monoidal $\\infty$-categories, and\nmodules over Burn (the Burnside $\\infty$-category) are additive\n$\\infty$-categories.\n  As a consequence, we can regard Lawvere theories as cyclic\n$\\text{Fin}^\\text{op}$-modules, leading to algebraic foundations for the higher\ncategorical study of Lawvere theories.

The fact that this network yields oscillations\nwas shown recently by Suwanmajo and Krishnan. Our results, which significantly\nextend their analyses, are as follows. First, in the three-dimensional space of\ntotal amounts, the border between systems with a stable versus unstable steady\nstate is a surface defined by the vanishing of a single Hurwitz determinant.\nSecond, this surface consists generically of simple Hopf bifurcations. Next,\nsimulations suggest that when the steady state is unstable, oscillations are\nthe norm. Finally, the emergence of oscillations via a Hopf bifurcation is\nenabled by the catalytic and association constants of the distributive part of\nthe mechanism: if these rate constants satisfy two inequalities, then the\nsystem generically admits a Hopf bifurcation. Our proofs are enabled by the\nRouth-Hurwitz criterion, a Hopf-bifurcation criterion due to Yang, and a\nmonomial parametrization of steady states. \n\n"}

The results of the\npresent paper strengthen up to a point this previous result, and show that\ntwo-fold loop spaces arise in the manner envisaged by these authors out of\ncategories of a more general kind, which are not two-fold monoidal in their\nsense.
