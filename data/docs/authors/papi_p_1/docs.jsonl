We give an explicit solution of the theory, in terms of a\none-parameter refinement of the S and T matrices of Chern-Simons theory,\nrelated to the theory of Macdonald polynomials. The ordinary and refined\nChern-Simons theory are similar in many ways; for example, the Verlinde formula\nholds in both. We obtain new topological invariants of Seifert three-manifolds\nand torus knots inside them. We conjecture that the knot invariants we compute\nare the Poincare polynomials of the sl(n) knot homology theory. The latter\nincludes the Khovanov-Rozansky knot homology, as a special case.

For\nexample, $\\Gamma$ could act on $\\tilde{G}$, and $G$ could be the connected part\nof the group of $\\Gamma$-fixed points in $\\tilde{G}$. Or $G$ could be an\nendoscopic group, a pseudo-Levi subgroup, or an isogenous image of $\\tilde{G}$.\nIf $G$ is such a group, and both $\\tilde{G}$ and $G$ are $k$-quasisplit, then\nwe constructed a map $\\hat{\\mathcal{N}}^{\\text{st}}$ from the set of stable\nsemisimple conjugacy classes in the dual $G^\\wedge(k)$ to the set of such\nclasses in $\\tilde{G}^\\wedge(k)$.

A pair (e_1,e_2) of commuting\nnilpotent elements is called a pn-pair, if the dimension of their simultaneous\ncentralizer is equal to the rank of {\\frak g} and some bi-homogeneity condition\nis satisfied. Ginzburg proved that many familiar results of the `ordinary'\ntheory have analogues for pn-pairs. The aim of this article is to develop the\ntheory of nilpotent pairs a bit further and to present some applications of it\nto dual pairs and sheets. It is shown that a large portion of Ginzburg's theory\ncan be extended to the pairs whose simultaneous centraliser is of dimension\nrk{\\frak g}+1. Such pairs are called almost pn-pairs.
