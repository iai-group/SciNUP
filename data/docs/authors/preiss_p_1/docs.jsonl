Nevertheless, the density-averaged\nresponse remains a non-analytic function of q and omega at Lieb-1 mode in the\nlimit of weak trap confinement.

The condensate wave function psi(x,y) is a Gaussian\nexp(-r^2/2), multiplied by an analytic function f(z) of the complex variable z=\nx+ i y. The criterion for a quantum phase transition to a non-superfluid\ncorrelated many-body state is usually expressed in terms of the ratio of the\nnumber of particles to the number of vortices. Here, a similar description\napplies to a rapidly rotating non-symmetric two-dimensional trap with arbitrary\nquadratic anisotropy (omega_x^2 < omega_y^2). The corresponding condensate wave\nfunction psi(x,y) is a complex anisotropic Gaussian with a phase proportional\nto xy, multiplied by an analytic function f(z), where z = x + i \\beta_- y is a\nstretched complex variable and 0< \\beta_- <1 is a real parameter that depends\non the trap anisotropy and the rotation frequency. Both in the mean-field\nThomas-Fermi approximation and in the mean-field lowest Landau level\napproximation with many visible vortices, an anisotropic parabolic density\nprofile minimizes the energy. An elongated condensate grows along the soft trap\ndirection yet ultimately shrinks along the tight trap direction.

It has been found that, as the temperature lowers,\nthe NRs expand in the bulk superconducting state consisted of inhomogeneities.\nThe fact that the size of the inhomogeneity [2] is close to the minimal size of\nthe NR [1] leads to a conclusion that the superconducting phase is a result of\nthese overlapped NRs. In the present paper we perform the charge and\npercolation regime analysis of NRs and show that at the first critical doping\nx_{c1}, when the superconductivity starts on, each NR carries the positive\nelectric charge one in units of electron charge, thus we attribute the NR to a\nsingle hole boson, and the percolation lines connecting these bosons emerge. At\nthe second critical doping x_{c2}, when the superconductivity disappears, our\nanalysis demonstrates that the charge of each NR equals two. The origin of\nx_{c2} can be understood by introducing additional normal phase hole fermions\nin NRs, whose concentration appearing above x_{c1} increases smoothly with the\ndoping and breaks the percolation lines of bosons at x_{c2}. The last one\nresults in disappearing the bulk bosonic property of the pseudogap (PG) region,\nwhich explains the upper bound for existence of vortices in Nernst effect [3].\nSince [1] has demonstrated the absence of NRs at the PG boundary one can\nconclude that along this boundary, as well as in x_{c2}, all bosons disappear.\nAs justification of appearance of single bosons, the bosonization of 2D\nfermions is rigorously proven using the concept of anyons.

Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this\napplication largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.\nSpecifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the\ninteraction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for\nexperimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood\nbecause interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important,\nmean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps\ndoes not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where $a$ is\ninfinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they\ndepend only on the particle density and quantum statistics. While the unitary\nFermi gas has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical\ninvestigation, the degenerate unitary Bose gas has generally been deemed\nexperimentally inaccessible because of three-body loss rates that increase\ndramatically with increasing $a$.

The circulation, experimentally imparted\nto the condensate by stirring, was simulated theoretically by imprinting a\nlinear azimuthal phase on the initial condensate wave function. The theoretical\nTOF images were in good agreement with the experimental data. We find that upon\nrelease the dynamics of the ring--shaped condensate proceeds in two distinct\nphases. First, the condensate expands rapidly inward, filling in the initial\nhole until it reaches a minimum radius that depends on the initial circulation.\nIn the second phase, the density at the inner radius increases to a maximum\nafter which the hole radius begins slowly to expand. During this second phase a\nseries of concentric rings appears due to the interference of ingoing and\noutgoing matter waves from the inner radius.

The net\nparticle current always vanishes in the ground state, but generically there is\na finite \"chiral current\", corresponding to equal and opposite flow on the two\nlegs. We vary the strength of the hopping across the rungs of the ladder and\nthe interaction between the bosons. We find three phases: (1) A \"saturated\nchiral current phase\" (SCCP), where the density is uniform and the chiral\ncurrent is simply related to the strength of the magnetic field. In this state\nthe only broken symmetry is the $U(1)$ condensate phase. (2) A \"biased ladder\nphase\" (BLP), where the density is higher on one leg than the other. The fluid\nvelocity is higher on the lower density leg, so the net current is zero. In\naddition to the $U(1)$ condensate phase, this has a broken $Z_2$ reflection\nsymmetry.

In atomic\nnuclei the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi momentum ($k>k_F\n\\approx 250$ Mev/c) is also dominated by short rangecorrelated\ndifferent-fermion (neutron-proton) pairs.\n  Purpose: Compare high-momentum unlike-fermion momentum distributions in\natomic and nuclear systems.\n  Methods: We show that, for $k>k_F$ MeV/c, nuclear momentum distributions are\nproportional to that of the deuteron. We then examine the deuteron momentum\ndistributions derived from a wide variety of modern nucleon-nucleon potentials\nthat are consistent with $NN$-scattering data.\n  Results: The high momentum tail of the deuteron momentum distribution, and\nhence of the nuclear momentum distributions appears to decrease as $k^{-4}$.\nThis behavior is shown to arise from the effects of the tensor part of the\nnucleon-nucleon potential. In addition, when the dimensionless interaction\nstrength for the atomic system is chosen to be similar to that of atomic\nnuclei, the probability for finding a short range different-fermion pair in\nboth systems is the same.\n  Conclusions: Although nuclei do not satisfy all of the conditions for Tan's\ncontact, the observed similarity of the magnitude and $k^{-4}$ shape of nuclear\nand atomic momentum distributions is remarkable because these systems differ by\nabout $20$ orders of magnitude in density. This similarity may lead to a\ngreater understanding of nuclei and the density dependence of nuclear systems. \n\n"}

However,\nprogress towards the development of a comparable understanding in long-range\ninteracting models, in particular out-of-equilibrium, remains limited. In a\nrecent work, we proposed a semiclassical numerical method to study spin models,\nthe discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA), and demonstrated its\ncapability to correctly capture the dynamics of one- and two-point correlations\nin one dimensional (1D) systems. Here we go one step forward and use the DTWA\nmethod to study the dynamics of correlations in 2D systems with many spins and\ndifferent types of long-range couplings, in regimes where other numerical\nmethods are generally unreliable.

We also show that the time\nevolution of the quantum correlations can be detected via bipartite von Neumann\nentropies, thus demonstrating that the Schwinger mechanism is tightly linked to\nentanglement spreading. To present the variety of possible applications of this\nsimulation platform, we show how one could follow the real-time scattering\nprocesses between mesons and the creation of entanglement during scattering\nprocesses. Finally, we test the quality of quantum simulations of these\ndynamics, quantifying the role of possible imperfections in cold atoms, trapped\nions, and superconducting circuit systems. Our results demonstrate how\nentanglement properties can be used to deepen our understanding of basic\nphenomena in the real-time dynamics of gauge theories such as string breaking\nand collisions. \n\n"}

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance.

For example, exposing materials to intense laser pulses enables to\nprovoke metal-insulator transitions, control the magnetic order and induce\ntransient superconducting behaviour well above the static transition\ntemperature. However, pinning down the responsible mechanisms is often\ndifficult, since the response to irradiation is governed by complex many-body\ndynamics. In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations have been\nperformed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity,\ntheoretical analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and\nnew theoretical approaches have been inspired by the recent observations. Here,\nwe perform an experimental quantum simulation in a periodically modulated\nhexagonal lattice and show that anti-ferromagnetic correlations in a fermionic\nmany-body system can be reduced or enhanced or even switched to ferromagnetic\ncorrelations. We first demonstrate that in the high frequency regime, the\ndescription of the many-body system by an effective Floquet-Hamiltonian with a\nrenormalized tunnelling energy remains valid, by comparing the results to\nmeasurements in an equivalent static lattice.
