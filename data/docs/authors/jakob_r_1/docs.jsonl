These models interpolate between\nstandard gauge mediation and split SUSY models. We provide benchmark points for\nthe two scenarios.

The recent\ndevelopments were triggered by the presentation of a simple and calculable\nmodel of metastable SUSY breaking by Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih (ISS),\nwhich we will briefly review. One of the main questions raised by metastability\nis, why did the universe end up in this vacuum. Using the ISS model as an\nexample we will argue that in a large class of models the universe is\nautomatically driven into the metastable state during the early hot phase and\ngets trapped there. This makes metastability a natural option from the\ncosmological point of view. However, it may be more than that. The\nphenomenologically required gaugino masses require the breaking of R-symmetry.\nHowever, in scenarios with a low supersymmetry breaking scale, e.g., gauge\nmediation a powerful theorem due to Nelson and Seiberg places this at odds with\nsupersymmetry breaking in a truely stable state and metstability becomes\n(nearly) inevitable.

This can be modeled by a\nsemiclassical expansion about a constant field for the vector potential, A_0,\nwhich is diagonal in color. We compute the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP by\nusing the Boltzmann equation in the presence of this background field. To\nleading, logarithmic order in weak coupling, the dominant diagrams are given by\nthe usual scattering processes of 2 -> 2 particles. For simplicity we also\nassume that both the number of colors and flavors are large. Near the critical\ntemperature T_c, where the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is small, the\noverall density of colored fields decreases according to their color\nrepresentation, with the density of quarks vanishes linearly with the loop, and\nthat of gluons, quadratically.

As a result, relative to that in the\nperturbative QGP, near T_c the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP is suppressed by\ntwo powers of the Polyakov loop.

Non-thermal production of gravitinos is not generated from\nthe inflaton (dilaton), since the inflaton mass is lighter than gravitino, but\nthey are produced by the decay of modular field $T$ and scalar field $Y$.\nBecause the reheating temperature $T_R$ is about order $\\sim O(10^{10})$ GeV\nand the mass of gravitino is $3.16 \\times 10^{12}$ GeV, it is not reproduced\nafter the reheating of the universe.

Garnier's approach is more\ngeometrical and constructive than the variational one, and it provides minimal\ndisks without branch point. However, it is sometimes really complicated, and\neven obscure or incomplete. Following Garnier's initial ideas, we propose a new\nproof, which intends not only to be complete, but also simpler and moderner\nthan his one. This work mainly relies on a systematic use of Fuchsian systems\nand on the relation that we establish between the reality of such systems and\ntheir monodromy.

The monodromy of the equation is\ndetermined by the oriented directions of the edges of the boundary. To solve\nthe Plateau problem, we are thus led to solve a Riemann-Hilbert problem.

In this paper we show that nearly scale-invariant primordial\ntensor perturbations can be generated during a contracting phase before the\nradiation dominated epoch if the theory of gravity is modified by the\nscalar-tensor theory at that time. The scale-invariance protects the tensor\nperturbations from suppressing at large scales and they may have significant\namplitudes to fit BICEP2's result.

While it is possible to predict its position\nby using effective models specifically built to reproduce some of the features\nof the underlying theory (QCD), the quality of the predictions (\\textit{e.g.},\nthe CEP position) obtained by such effective models, depends on whether solving\nthe model equations constitute a well- or ill-posed inverse problem.\n  Considering these predictions as being inverse problems provides tools to\nevaluate if the problem is ill-conditioned, meaning that infinitesimal\nvariations of the inputs of the model can cause comparatively large variations\nof the predictions. If it is ill-conditioned, it has major consequences because\nof finite variations that could come from experimental and/or theoretical\nerrors.\n  In the following, we shall apply such a reasoning on the predictions of a\nparticular Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model within the mean field + ring\napproximations, with special attention to the prediction of the chiral CEP\nposition in the $(T-\\mu)$ plane.

I begin to consider the secular changes induced in galactic\nsystems by such presumed variations, assumed adiabatic. It is important to\nunderstand these effects, in isolation from other evolutionary influences, in\norder to identify or constrain a0 variations by detection of induced effects,\nor lack thereof. I find that as long as the system is fully in the deep-MOND\nregime -- as applies to many galactic systems -- the adiabatic response of the\nsystem obeys simple scaling laws. For example, in a system that would be\nstationary for fixed a0, the system expands homologously as a0^{-1/4}, while\ninternal velocities decrease uniformly as a0^{1/4}. If a0 is proportional to cH\nat all relevant times, this change amounts to a factor of ~ 2.5 since redshift\n10. For a system stationary in a rotating frame, the angular frequency\ndecreases as a0^{1/2}. The accelerations increase relative to a0 as a0^{-1/4},\npushing the system towards the Newtonian regime. All this follows from the\nappearance of a0 in MOND and the scale invariance of the deep-MOND limit -- two\nbasic tenets of MOND. More complicated evolution ensues when parts of the\nsystem become Newtonian, or are so from inception. For example, these parts may\nbecome unstable, not being protected by MOND's stabilizing effects.

In this talk we will present new tests of NRQCD\ninvolving the distribution of quarkonia within jets. The distribution of\nhadrons within jets is determined by nonperturbative functions called\nfragmenting jet functions (FJFs). FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation\nfunctions, evolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable\nmatching coefficients. I show how the FJFs for quarkonia can be calculated in\nNRQCD in terms of a few NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDME), so the\ndependence of the cross section on the energy fraction of the heavy quarkonium,\nz, is sensitive to the underlying production mechanism, and therefore provides\na new test of NRQCD.

A composite\nparticle in a new strong dynamics is a promising candidate for ADM as the\nstrong dynamics naturally explains the ADM mass in the GeV range. Its large\nannihilation cross section due to the strong dynamics leaves the asymmetric\ncomponent to be dominant over the symmetric component. In such composite ADM\nscenarios, the dark sector has a relatively large entropy density in the early\nUniverse. The large dark sector entropy results in the overclosure of the\nUniverse or at best contradicts with the observations of the cosmic microwave\nbackground and the successful Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis.

We consider the states of flavor neutrinos\nnu_e, nu_mu and nu_tau and we discuss the evolution of these states in space\nand time in the case of non-conservation of family lepton numbers due to the\nmixing of light neutrinos. We discuss and compare different flavor neutrino\ndiscovery experiments. We stress that experiments on the search for\nnu_mu->nu_tau and nu_e->nu_tau oscillations demonstrated that the flavor\nneutrino nu_tau is a new type of neutrino, different from nu_e and nu_mu. In\nthe case of neutrino mixing, the lepton number (only one) is connected with the\nnature of massive neutrinos. Such conserved lepton number exist if massive\nneutrinos are Dirac particles.

This model admits `embedded defects' (topological defect\nconfigurations of a simpler - in this case O(2) symmetric - model obtained by\nimposing an embedding constraint) that are unstable in the full model at zero\ntemperature, but that can be stabilised (by electromagnetic coupling to\nphotons) in a thermal gas at moderately high termperatures.

The gluon bremsstrahlung induced\nby multiple scattering depends not only on direct parton matrix elements but\nalso on momentum-crossed ones, due to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal\ninterference effect. We show that both types of twist-four nuclear parton\nmatrix elements can be factorized approximately into the product of twist-two\nnucleon matrix elements in the limit of extremely large nuclei, $A\\to \\infty$,\nas assumed in previous studies. Due to the correlative nature of the twist-four\nmatrix elements under consideration, it is actually the off-forward parton\ndistributions that appear naturally in this decomposition, rather than the\nordinary diagonal distributions probed in deeply-inelastic scattering. However,\nwe argue that the difference between these two distribution classes is small in\ncertain kinematic regimes. In these regions, the twist-four nuclear parton\nmatrix elements are evaluated numerically and compared to the factorized form\nfor different nuclear sizes within a schematic model of the two-nucleon\ncorrelation function.

This conjecture\nsuggests that the observable gauge group just below the string scale should be\nSU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y and that the SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y-charged\nspectrum of the observable sector should consist solely of the MSSM spectrum.\nWe demonstrate that string models can actually be constructed that possess\nthese observable features. Two aspects generic to many classes of three family\nSU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y string models are both an extra local anomalous\nU(1)_A and numerous (often fractionally charged) exotic particles beyond the\nMSSM. Thus, for these classes, the key to obtaining an M_S = M_U ~ 2.5 x\n10^{16} GeV string model is the existence of F- and D-flat directions that near\nthe string scale can simultaneously break the anomalous U(1) and give mass to\nall exotic SM-charged observable particles, decoupling them from the low energy\nspectrum.

This class includes the\nHeterotic M-theory brane-world of Refs. \\cite{ovrut,ekpy} and the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model as a limiting case. In general, there are two moduli\nfields $y_{\\pm}$, corresponding to the \"positions\" of two branes (which live at\nthe fixed points of an orbifold compactification). Classically, the moduli are\nmassless, due to a scaling symmetry of the action. However, in the absence of\nsupersymmetry, they develop an effective potential at one loop. Local terms\nproportional to $K_\\pm^4$, where $K_\\pm=q/y_\\pm$ is the local curvature scale\nat the location of the corresponding brane, are needed in order to remove the\ndivergences in the effective potential. Such terms break the scaling symmetry\nand hence they may act as stabilizers for the moduli. When the branes are very\nclose to each other, the effective potential induced by massless bulk fields\nbehaves like $V\\sim d^{-4}$, where $d$ is the separation between branes.

Alongside with two baryon-rich fluids, the new model considers\ntime-delayed evolution of a third, baryon-free (i.e. with zero net baryonic\ncharge) fluid of newly produced particles. Its evolution is delayed due to a\nformation time, during which the baryon-free fluid neither thermalizes nor\ninteracts with the baryon-rich fluids. After the formation it starts to\ninteract with the baryon-rich fluids and quickly gets thermalized. Within this\nmodel with pure hadronic equation of state, a systematic analysis of various\nobservables at incident energies between few and about 160A GeV has been done\nas well as comparison with results of transport models. We have succeeded to\nreasonably reproduce a great body of experimental data in the incident energy\nrange of E_{lab} = (1-160)A GeV. The list includes proton and pion rapidity\ndistributions, proton transverse-mass spectra, rapidity distributions of Lambda\nand antiLambda hyperons, elliptic flow of protons and pions (with the exception\nof proton v2 at 40A GeV), multiplicities of pions, positive kaons, phi-mesons,\nhyperons and antihyperons, including multi-strange particles.
