We use large N-body simulations to\nstudy the statistical properties of massive halo mergers, specifically\ninvestigating the utility of close halo pairs as proxies for mergers. We\nexamine the relationship between pairs and mergers for a wide range of merger\ntimescales, halo masses, and redshifts (0<z<1). We also quantify the utility of\npairs in measuring merger bias. While pairs at very small separations will\nreliably merge, these constitute a small fraction of the total merger\npopulation.

We focus this study on the question of self-excited spiral\nstructure in the stellar disk and investigate the dynamical coupling between\nthe cold, dissipative gaseous component and the stellar component. We find that\nangular momentum transport from the gas to the stars inside of corotation leads\nto a roughly time-steady spiral structure in the stellar disk. To make this\npoint clear, we contrast these results with otherwise identical simulations\nthat do not include a cold gaseous component that is able to cool radiatively\nand dissipate energy, and find that spiral structure, when it is incipient,\ndies out more rapidly in simulations that do not include gas. We also employ a\nstandard star formation prescription to convert gas into stars and find that\nour results hold for typical gas consumption time scales that are in accord\nwith the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We therefore attribute the long-lived\nroughly time steady spiral structure in the stellar disk to the dynamical\ncoupling between the gas and the stars and the resultant torques that the\nself-gravitating gaseous disk is able to exert on the stars due to an azimuthal\nphase shift between the collisionless and dissipative components. \n\n"}

We also\nshow that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal\nstar cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory\nof the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk.

Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are\ngenerally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive to\ncool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.\nterrestrial) planets.

As a\nreference model, we consider an anti-Copernican inhomogeneous model that\nconsists of two inner negatively curved underdense regions and an outer flat\nEinstein-de Sitter region. We assume that these regions are connected by two\nthin-walls at redshifts z = 0.067 and z=0.45. In the inner two regions, the\nfirst-order ISW effect is dominant and comparable to that in the concordant\nflat-Lambda models.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

Here, we present a nonadiabatic pulsation\nanalysis of the recently discovered carbon-rich hot DQ white dwarf stars. One\nof our main aims is to test the convective-mixing picture for the origin of hot\nDQs through the pulsational properties. Our study relies on the full\nevolutionary models of hot DQ white dwarfs recently developed by Althaus et al.\n(2009), that consistently cover the whole evolution from the born-again stage\nto the white dwarf cooling track. Specifically, we present a stability analysis\nof white dwarf models from stages before the blue edge of the DBV instability\nstrip until the domain of the hot DQ white dwarfs, including the transition DB\n--> hot DQ white dwarf. We found that at evolutionary phases in which the\nmodels are characterized by He-dominated atmospheres, they exhibit unstable\n$g$-mode pulsations typical of DBV stars, and when the models become DQ white\ndwarfs with carbon-dominated atmospheres, they continue being pulsationally\nunstable with similar characteristics than DB models, and in agreement with the\nperiods detected in variable hot DQ white dwarfs. Our calculations provide\nstrong support to the convective-mixing picture for the formation of hot DQs.\nIn particular, our results point to the existence of pulsating DB white dwarfs\nwith very thin He-rich envelopes, which after passing the DBV instability strip\nbecome variable hot DQ stars. The existence of these DB stars with very thin\nenvelopes could be investigated through asteroseismology. \n\n"}

However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column\ndensity from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this\npossibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,\nlow-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.\nThis mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a\ntypical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow\ndirection--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generated\nby these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology.\nFuture observational studies constraining the direction of the relative\ninterstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future\nmodeling.

The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane.

Recently, Tiscareno et al.(2009) got observational informations on the\nshapes and the rotational states of these satellites. In particular, they\ndetected an offset in the expected equilibrium position of Janus, and a large\nlibration of Epimetheus. We here propose to give a 3-dimensional theory of the\nrotation of these satellites in using these observed data, and to compare it to\nthe observed rotations. We consider the two satellites as triaxial rigid\nbodies, and we perform numerical integrations of the system in assuming the\nfree librations as damped.

Observations of the silicate\nfeatures at micron wavelengths are consistent with growth to micron sizes\nwhereas the slope of the SED at longer wavelengths traces growth up to mm\nsizes. We here look for a correlation between these two grain growth\nindicators. A large sample of T-Tauri and Herbig-Ae/Be stars was observed with\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope at 5-13 micron; a subsample was observed at mm\nwavelengths. We complement this subsample with data from the literature to\nmaximise the overlap between micron and mm observations and search for\ncorrelations. Synthetic spectra are produced to determine which processes may\nproduce the dust evolution. Dust disc masses in the range <1 to 7 x 10^-4 MSun\nare obtained. Most sources have a mm spectral slope consistent with grain\ngrowth. There is a tentative correlation between the 10-micron silicate feature\nand the mm slope of the SED. The observed sources seem to be grouped per\nstar-forming region in the micron-vs-mm diagram. The modelling results show\nthat the 10-micron feature becomes flatter and subsequently the mm slope\nbecomes shallower. Grain size distributions shallower than that of the ISM\nand/or bright central stars are required to explain specific features. Settling\nof larger grains towards the disc midplane affects the 10-micron feature, but\nhardly the mm slope. The tentative correlation between the strength of the\n10-micron feature and the mm slope suggests that the inner and outer disc\nevolve simultaneously.

A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature\nprofiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is that\nfour vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. In particular, two of the\nzones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small\nparticles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale\nnear and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles\ngrow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks. Older discs prefer to\ncapture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time,\na phenomenon we term \"vortex aging\". More viscous, more dust-opaque and/or less\nmassive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of\nparticle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc. Thus, how efficiently a\ndisc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales between\ncoagulation and vortex aging. If vortices form in protoplanetary discs, they\nare important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to\ncondense out of the protostellar nebula. Particle capture also occurs at\ndistances relevant to planet formation.

A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk\nthan that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk\nfragmentation.

In this method we\nare able to divide the photometric galaxies into subsamples in luminosity\nintervals when redshift information is unavailable, enabling us to measure\nw_p(r_p)n and w_p(r_p) as a function of not only the luminosity of the\nspectroscopic galaxy, but also that of the photometric galaxy.

The approach employs a\ndirect discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with\nadjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the\noptically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of\nthe scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of\ndirectional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere.

Analysing RV data to determine the\nparameters of the extrasolar planets is a significant statistical challenge\nowing to the presence of multiple planets and various degeneracies between\norbital parameters. Determining the number of planets favoured by the observed\ndata is an even more difficult task. Bayesian model selection provides a\nmathematically rigorous solution to this problem by calculating marginal\nposterior probabilities of models with different number of planets, but the use\nof this method in extrasolar planetary searches has been hampered by the\ncomputational cost of the evaluating Bayesian evidence. Nonetheless, Bayesian\nmodel selection has the potential to improve the interpretation of existing\nobservational data and possibly detect yet undiscovered planets. We present a\nnew and efficient Bayesian method for determining the number of extrasolar\nplanets, as well as for inferring their orbital parameters, without having to\ncalculate directly the Bayesian evidence for models containing a large number\nof planets. Instead, we work iteratively and at each iteration obtain a\nconservative lower limit on the odds ratio for the inclusion of an additional\nplanet into the model. We apply this method to simulated data-sets containing\none and two planets and successfully recover the correct number of planets and\nreliable constraints on the orbital parameters. We also apply our method to RV\nmeasurements of HD 37124, 47 Ursae Majoris and HD 10180. For HD 37124, we\nconfirm that the current data strongly favour a three-planet system. We find\nstrong evidence for the presence of a fourth planet in 47 Ursae Majoris, but\nits orbital period is suspiciously close to one year, casting doubt on its\nvalidity.

After\nintroducing a number of observational constraints from the solar system, from\nobserved protoplanetary disks, and from the extrasolar planets, we simplify the\nproblem by dividing it into a number of discrete stages which are assumed to\noccur in a sequential way. In the first stage - the growth from dust to\nkilometer sized planetesimals - the aerodynamics of the bodies are of central\nimportance. We discuss both a purely coagulative growth mode, as well as a\ngravoturbulent mode involving a gravitational instability of the dust. In the\nnext stage, planetesimals grow to protoplanets of roughly 1000 km in size.\nGravity is now the dominant force. The mass accretion can be strongly\nnon-linear, leading to the detachment of a few big bodies from the remaining\nplanetesimals. In the outer planetary system (outside a few AU), some of these\nbodies can become so massive that they eventually accrete a large gaseous\nenvelope. This is the stage of giant planet formation, as understood within the\ncore accretion-gas capture paradigm. We also discuss the direct gravitational\ncollapse model where giant planets are thought to form directly via a\ngravitational fragmentation of the gas disk. In the inner system, protoplanets\ncollide in the last stage - probably after the dispersal of the gaseous disk -\nin giant impacts until the separations between the remaining terrestrial\nplanets become large enough to allow long term stability.

The wavelength dependence\nof polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in\nthe blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower\nsignal in the V band. The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence, detected also in\nthe transmitted light during transits, implies a rapid decrease of the\npolarization signal toward longer wavelengths. Therefore, the nondetection by\nWiktorowicz (2009), based on a measurement integrated within a broad passband\ncovering the V band and partly B and R bands, is inconclusive and consistent\nwith our detection in B.

However, several issues are yet to be clarified: SNe~Ia show\ncolor variations after the standardization. Also, individual SNe~Ia can show\nresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\\sim\n0.15$ mag. In this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual are\nrelated to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\\gsim\n150$ days after maximum light. A sample of 11 SNe Ia which likely suffer from\nlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\\sigma$) between the peak\n$B-V$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. Furthermore, a nearly\nidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three SNe with\n$B-V \\gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. Following the interpretation that the\nlate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from which\nan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is a\ndominant factor controlling the SN color and that a large part of the color\nvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction.

Then, using a 2.5-D electromagnetic particle-in-cell\nmodel with free boundary conditions, these processes were modelled on the\nkinetic level of plasma description. We recognized the plasmoids which mutually\ninteracted and finally merged into one large plasmoid.

During interactions (merging - coalescences) of the plasmoids the\nelectrons were very efficiently accelerated and heated.

{"id": "1105.3936", "contents": "Title: Tidal dissipation compared to seismic dissipation: in small bodies, in\n  earths, and in superearths Abstract: While the seismic quality factor and phase lag are defined solely by the bulk\nproperties of the mantle, their tidal counterparts are determined both by the\nbulk properties and self-gravitation of a body as a whole. For a qualitative\nestimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal\nphase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our\nmodel is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The\ndifference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low\nfrequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in\nlarger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and\nrheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the\nsame rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being\nnegligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the\nseismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)\nbecomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what\none might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate\ndeviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,\nand this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in\nmagnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the\nprimary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses\nthe synchronous orbit. We describe the mantle rheology with the Andrade model,\nallowing it to lean towards the Maxwell model at the lowest frequencies. To\nimplement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by\nendowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale\nto the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle. Some uncertainty in this\nparameter's frequency-dependence does not influence our principal conclusions. \n\n"}

The method known as\n\"the MacDonald torque\" is often combined with an assumption that the quality\nfactor Q is frequency-independent. This makes the method inconsistent, because\nthe MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the\ninverse tidal frequency.\n  Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called \"the Darwin\ntorque\". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit\ninteraction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme\nfor the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances. We derive the\nfrequency-dependence of the tidal torque from the first principles, i.e., from\nthe expression for the mantle's compliance in the time domain. We also explain\nthat the tidal torque includes not only the secular part, but also an\noscillating part.\n  We demonstrate that the lmpq term of the Darwin-Kaula expansion for the tidal\ntorque smoothly goes through zero, when the secondary traverses the lmpq\nresonance (e.g., the principal tidal torque smoothly goes through nil as the\nsecondary crosses the synchronous orbit).\n  We also offer a possible explanation for the unexpected frequency-dependence\nof the tidal dissipation rate in the Moon, discovered by LLR. \n\n"}

Accretion of high-Z material\nfrom these disks may account for the metal contamination of these WDs. It was\npreviously shown using local calculations that the Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag\nacting on the dense, optically thick disk naturally drives metal accretion onto\nthe WD at the typical rate \\dot M_{PR} \\approx 10^8 g/s. Here we extend this\nlocal analysis by exploring global evolution of the debris disk under the\naction of the PR drag for a variety of assumptions about the disk properties.\nWe find that massive disks (mass > 10^{20} g), which are optically thick to\nincident stellar radiation inevitably give rise to metal accretion at rates\n\\dot M > 0.2\\dot M_{PR}.

Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited and\nstrong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical\nbehaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause\nsignificant asymmetries in dusty disks around solar type stars which might be\ndetected by observations. However, the amount of orbital changes due to this\nnon--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime\nof dust particles. We show that for large values of the disk's optical depth\nthe influence of ISM flow on the disk shape is almost negligible because the\ngrains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital\nchanges due to the ISM perturbations. On the other hand, for values smaller\nthan $10^{-3}$, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of\nthe disk when we consider 1-10 mum grains, just above the blow-out threshold.\nThe extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the\noptical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which may prevent the formation of\nlarge clumps and warping in the disks is related to the fast inward migration\ndue to the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is\npumped up by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson and in\nparticular ISM drag) drive the disk particles on fast migrating tracks leading\nthem into the star on a short timescale. It is then expected that disks with\nsmall optical depth expand inside the parent body ring all the way towards the\nstar while disks with large optical depth would not significantly extend\ninside. \n\n"}

Using theoretical\nmodels of planet formation, evolution and structure, we explore the range of\nminimum plausible masses for low-density exo-Neptunes. We focus on highly\nirradiated planets with T_eq>=500K.

We show that\nNeptune-size planets at T_eq=500K with masses as small as a few times that of\nEarth can plausibly be formed core nucleated accretion coupled with subsequent\ninward migration. We also derive a limiting low-density mass-radius relation\nfor rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes but no surface water. Rocky\nplanets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes typically have computed radii well\nbelow 3 R_Earth. For both planets with H/He envelopes from core nucleated\naccretion and planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes, we employ planet\ninterior models to map the range of planet mass--envelope mass--equilibrium\ntemperature parameter space that is consistent with Neptune-size planet radii.\nAtmospheric mass loss mediates which corners of this parameter space are\npopulated by actual planets and ultimately governs the minimum plausible mass\nat a specified transit radius.

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We\nderive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,\ntaking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different\ntidal forcing components. \n\n"}

The technique for using jets as extended\ngravitational lensing probes was firstly explored by Kronberg. We use the\n\"alignment-breaking parameter\" $ \\eta_G $ as a sensitive indicator of\ngravitational distortion by a wiggly cosmic string. Then, we applied the\nnon-constant deflection angle to jets, and $ \\eta_G $ of a specific jet is just\nrelated to the projected slope of the jet. At least three jets in the sample of\nSquare Kilometer Array (SKA) would have significant signals ($ \\eta_G >10^\\circ\n$) if the wiggly infinite cosmic string existed. The distortion of elliptical\nobject is also studied and used to do a statistical research on directions of\naxes and ellipticities of galaxies. In the direction of the string, we find\nthat galaxies appear to be more elliptical for an observer and the distribution\nof apparent ellipticity changes correspondingly.

This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet\npopulation synthesis calculations.\n  Aims. Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of\nimportant disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime on\nfundamental planetary properties.\n  Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population\nof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration\nand disk evolution.\n  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary\ninitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different\nroles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,\ngiant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both\nmore frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets\ncannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.\nIn contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot\nfor giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher\nplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be\ncompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low\nmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high\nmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of\nmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with\nmetallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of\ngiant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,\nbut migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate\nless. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than Hot\nJupiters.\n  Conclusions. The properties of protoplanetary disks are decisive for the\nproperties of planets, and leave many imprints. \n\n"}

We apply a\nporosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,\nwhich allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of\nimpact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and\ninstead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation\nhas been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of\na high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can\nevolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than\n0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account.

We consider here the simplest case where the considered\nstar or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is\nreduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This\ngenerates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide\nwhich is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is\ndissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an\neddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a\nsecond velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature\nwith the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the\ndisturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,\nfrom which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the\nsystem evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and\nspecifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the\nthickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low\nfrequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a\nconstant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate. \n\n"}

Observed differences in\ntemperatures, outflow speeds, and velocity distribution anisotropies are useful\nconstraints on proposed explanations for how the plasma is heated and\naccelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of collisionless\nheating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come\nfrom magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical\ndescription of the radial evolution of Alfven, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD\nwaves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of\ndistance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next we\nsolved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady\nwavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling\nbetween the Alfven and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable\nchoices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the\nfast mode to the Alfven mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron\nresonance.

With enhanced mixing, our synthetic LCs start their post-breakout\nre-brightening phase earlier, follow a more gradual rise to peak, appear\nredder, and fade faster after peak due to enhanced gamma-ray escape.\nNon-thermal electrons, crucial for the production of HeI lines, deposit a\ndominant fraction of their energy as heat. Because energy deposition is\ngenerally local well after the LC peak, the broad HeI lines characteristic of\nmaximum-light SN IIb/Ib spectra require mixing that places 56Ni and helium\nnuclei to within a gamma-ray mean-free-path.

We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five.

In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs.

This problem may be regarded as a simplified\nmodel of astrophysical tides in convective regions of stars and giant planets.\nThe response can be separated into non-wavelike and wavelike parts, where the\nformer is related instantaneously to the tidal potential and the latter may\ninvolve resonances or other singularities. The imaginary part of the potential\nLove number of the body, which is directly related to the rates of energy and\nangular momentum exchange in the tidal interaction and to the rate of\ndissipation of energy, may have a complicated dependence on the tidal\nfrequency. However, a certain frequency-average of this quantity is independent\nof the dissipative properties of the fluid and can be determined by means of an\nimpulse calculation.

The\nhigh-energy prompt emission shows no sign of a strong black body component, as\nexpected if the event was caused by a tidal disruption event or a supernova\nshock breakout.

Their orbits are significantly non-Keplerian because of the\nlarge secondary-to-primary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity of the binaries,\nas well as the proximity of the planets to the binaries. We present an analytic\ntheory, with the planet treated as a test particle, which shows that the\nplanetary motion can be represented by the superposition of the circular motion\nof a guiding center, the forced oscillations due to the non-axisymmetric\ncomponents of the binary's potential, the epicyclic motion, and the vertical\nmotion. In this analytic theory, the periapse and ascending node of the planet\nprecess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The largest forced\noscillation term corresponds to a forced eccentricity (which is an explicit\nfunction of the parameters of the binary and of the guiding center radius of\nthe planet), and the amplitude of the epicyclic motion (which is a free\nparameter of the theory) is the free eccentricity. Comparisons with direct\nnumerical orbit integrations show that this analytic theory gives an accurate\ndescription of the planetary motion for all three Kepler systems.

This instability has so far only been studied for an\nimposed magnetic field. We want to know how NEMPI works when the mean magnetic\nfield is generated self-consistently by an $\\alpha^2$ dynamo, whether it is\naffected by global spherical geometry, and whether it can influence the\nproperties of the dynamo itself. We adopt the mean-field approach which has\npreviously been shown to provide a realistic description of NEMPI in direct\nnumerical simulations. We assume axisymmetry and solve the mean-field equations\nwith the Pencil-Code for an adiabatic stratification at a total density\ncontrast in the radial direction of approximately 4 orders of magnitude.

Excitation temperatures were determined from FeI line\nabundances in high-resolution optical spectra in the wavelength range of ~3700\nto ~7000A, although shorter wavelength ranges, up to 4750 to 6800A, can also be\nemployed, and compared with photometric literature temperatures. Our adjustment\nscheme increases the temperatures up to several hundred degrees for cool red\ngiants, while leaving the near-main-sequence stars mostly unchanged. Hence, it\nbrings the excitation temperatures in good agreement with photometrically\nderived values. The modified temperature also influences other stellar\nparameters, as the FeI-FeII ionization balance is simultaneously used to\ndetermine the surface gravity, while also forcing no abundance trend on the\nabsorption line strengths to obtain the microturbulent velocity.

The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing.

In\nthis paper, we present low-resolution red optical spectra that allow us to\nidentify 18 very low-mass stars that have Kepler light curves available in the\npublic archive. Spectral types of these targets are found to lie in the range\ndM4.5--dM8.5, implying spectrophotometric distances from 17 pc to 80 pc. Limits\nto the presence of transiting planets are placed from modelling of the Kepler\nlight curves. We find that the size of the planets detectable by Kepler around\nthese small stars typically lie in the range 1 to 5 Earth radii within the\nhabitable regions (P$\\le$10 days). We identify one candidate transit with a\nperiod of 1.26 days that resembles the signal produced by a planet slightly\nsmaller than the Moon. However, our pixel by pixel analysis of the Kepler data\nshows that the signal most likely arises from a background contaminating\neclipsing binary. For 11 of these objects reliable photometric periods shorter\nthan 7 days are derived, and are interpreted as rotational modulation of\nmagnetic cool spots. For 3 objects we find possible photometric periods longer\nthan 50 days that require confirmation. H$_\\alpha$ emission measurements and\nflare rates are used as a proxies for chromospheric activity and transversal\nvelocities are used as an indicator of dynamical ages. These data allow us to\ndiscuss the relationship between magnetic activity and detectability of\nplanetary transits around very low-mass stars.

We compare the synthetic Ca filter imaging\ndata with intensity maps of Ca spectra at different wavelengths and temperature\nmaps at different optical depths. We determine the intensity response function\nfor the wavelengths covered by the filters of different FWHM.\n  The intensity emitted off the solar limb is about 5% of the intensity at disc\ncentre. For a 0.3 nm-wide Ca II H filter, up to about 1/3 of the off-limb\nintensity comes from emission in Hepsilon. On the disc, only about 15% of the\nintensity transmitted through a broad-band filter comes from the line-core\nregion.

Including the new and previously known\nmembers, we confirm that a substantial fraction (~2/5) of disks show signs of\nevolution, either as radial dust evolution (transition/pre-transition disks) or\nas a more global evolution (low small-dust masses, dust settling, and\nweak/absent accretion signatures). Accretion is strongly dependent on the SED\ntype. About half of the transition objects are consistent with no accretion,\nand dust-depleted disks have weak (or undetectable) accretion signatures,\nespecially among M-type stars. The analysis of accretion and disk structure\nsuggests a parallel evolution of dust and gas. We find several distinct classes\nof evolved disks, based on SED type and accretion, pointing to different disk\ndispersal mechanisms and probably different evolutionary paths. Dust depletion\nand opening of inner holes appear to be independent processes: most transition\ndisks are not dust-depleted, and most dust-depleted disks do not require inner\nholes. The differences in disk structure between M-type and solar-type stars in\nTr37 (4 Myr) are not as remarkable as in the young, sparse, Coronet cluster\n(1-2 Myr), suggesting that other factors, like the environment/interactions,\nare likely to play a role in the disk evolution and dispersal.

These\nmodels allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will\ntake over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as\na function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find\nthat this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nincreases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop\nan analytic model that reproduces these results.\n  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary\nstate of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to\ndestruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach\n20-40 AU, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion\n(which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours\nof photoevaporation model) will not form.\n  We emphasise that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply\nto all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin\nto X-rays.

Using very deep, wide area (20x20 Mpc)\nimaging by Spitzer/MIPS at 24um, in conjunction with Herschel 5-band imaging\nfrom 100-500um, we investigate the dust-obscured, star-formation properties in\nthe cluster and its associated large scale environment.

Obtaining longer timescales for gas\naccretion may require using realistic equations of states, or accounting for\nthe dynamics of the circumplanetary disk (CPD) in low-viscosity regime, or\nboth. Here we explore the second way using global, three-dimensional isothermal\nhydrodynamical simulations with 8 levels of nested grids around the planet. In\nour simulations the vertical inflow from the circumstellar disk (CSD) to the\nCPD determines the shape of the CPD and its accretion rate.

By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence.

Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking.

Comparisons between the\nnon-accreting TTS photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models are\nused to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature. Differences\nbetween spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially when\naccounting for accretion and extinction.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario.

(2013). Although surface\ngravity is crucial for stellar classification, it is the mean stellar density\nwhich is most useful when studying transiting exoplanets, due to its direct\nimpact on the transit light curve shape. Indeed, an accurate and independent\nmeasure of the stellar density can be leveraged to infer subtle properties of a\ntransiting system, such as the companion's orbital eccentricity via\nasterodensity profiling. We here calibrate flicker to the mean stellar density\nof 439 Kepler targets with asteroseismology, allowing us to derive a new\nempirical relation given by\n$\\log_{10}(\\rho_{\\star}\\,[\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}]) = 5.413 - 1.850\n\\log_{10}(F_8\\,[\\mathrm{ppm}])$.

In the $n$-dimensional\nsetting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \\times n$ covariance\nmatrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\\det(C)$. In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters).

Because many of these old field stars also have\nindependently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and\nactivity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity\nrelations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good\ncalibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars\nis uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric\nmagnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence and\nthe subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The\nrotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different\nanalysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the\ntime-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the light\ncurves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the\nresults from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two\ncomplementary analyses.

The standard solar model fails to predict the very low lithium\nabundance in the Sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. This Li\nproblem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planet\nformation or to secular stellar depletion. In order to test the evolution of\nLi, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of\nstars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of\nterrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired\nhigh-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several\nsolar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among\nthe solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a\ndifferential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.\n[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =\n4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03\nkm/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision. It has a\nLi abundance of A(Li)NLTE <= 0.46, which is about 4 times lower than in the Sun\n(A(Li)NLTE = 1.07 dex), but close to the oldest solar twin known, HIP 102152.\n[Conclusions]. Based on the lower abundances of refractory elements when\ncompared to other solar twins, HIP 114328 seems an excellent candidate to host\nrocky planets. The low Li abundance of this star is consistent with its old age\nand fits very well the emerging Li-age relation among solar twins of different\nages. \n\n"}

These\ncooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone,\nyet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK\nstars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of\ndifferent spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the\nstar, and show that they are significantly different from each other. We\nfurther identify two trends: First, the occurrence of Earth to Neptune-sized\nplanets is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital\nperiods probed by Kepler; Planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as\naround G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in\nplanet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a 10 day orbital\nperiod, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median\nstellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is\nstellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of\nstellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping\nand destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the\npre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of\nmigrating planets or planetary building blocks. These results demonstrate the\nstellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence\nrate and of orbital distribution.

We have improved this algorithm by using the relative gas\nvelocities, to weight the individual matter contributions with the relative\nspectral line overlaps, in order to properly account for the Doppler effect. We\ncompare our new method to the widely used Sobolev approximation, which yields\nan estimate for the column density based on the local velocity gradient and the\nthermal velocity.

Migration can be inward or outward depending on the local\ndisk properties but, in general, only planets more massive than several\n$M_\\oplus$ can migrate outward. Here we propose that an embryo's migration\nhistory determines whether it becomes a hot super-Earth or the core of a giant\nplanet. Systems of hot super-Earths (or mini-Neptunes) form when embryos\nmigrate inward and pile up at the inner edge of the disk. Giant planet cores\nform when inward-migrating embryos become massive enough to switch direction\nand migrate outward. We present simulations of this process using a modified\nN-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. Systems of hot\nsuper-Earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interior\nto the disk inner edge. Resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamical\ninstabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. Giant planet\ncores migrate outward toward zero-torque zones, which move inward and\neventually disappear as the disk disperses. Giant planet cores migrate inward\nwith these zones and are stranded at ~1-5 AU. Our model reproduces several\nproperties of the observed extra-solar planet populations. The frequency of\ngiant planet cores increases strongly when the mass in solids is increased,\nconsistent with the observed giant exoplanet - stellar metallicity correlation.\nThe frequency of hot super-Earths is not a function of stellar metallicity,\nalso in agreement with observations. Our simulations can reproduce the broad\ncharacteristics of the observed super-Earth population. \n\n"}

The bright and\nwell studied HAT-P-7 system is intriguing as several Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\nmeasurements found a large projected obliquity in this system, but it was so\nfar not possible to determine if the orbit is polar and/or retrograde. The goal\nof this study is to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D\nobliquity of the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured\nby the RM effect. In addition we provide an updated set of stellar parameters\nfor the star. We use the full set of available observations from Kepler\nspanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum of HAT-P-7. We extract\noscillation mode frequencies via an MCMC peak-bagging routine, and use the\nresults from this to estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this\nwith the projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane\nallows us to determine the stellar obliquity. We use asteroseismology to model\nthe star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the\nmodelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are\nadopted. Using our updated asteroseismic modelling we find, i.a., the following\nstellar parameters for HAT-P-7: M=1.51{+0.04}{-0.05}Msun,\n$R=2.00{+0.01}{-0.02}Rsun, and age = 2.07{+0.28}{-0.23} Gyr. Our asteroseismic\nmodelling offers a high precision on the stellar parameters, for instance is\nthe uncertainty on age of the order ~11%. For the stellar inclination we\nestimate i_star<36.5 deg., which translates to an obliquity between 83 and 111\ndeg. We find that the planet HAT-P-7b is likely retrograde in its orbit, and\nthat the orbit is close to being polar. The new parameters for the star gives\nan updated planetary density of 0.65+-0.03 g cm^{-3}, which is lower than\nprevious estimates. \n\n"}

Our three directions are as follows. (i) Taking the variable\nsodium absorption lines in some SN Ia to originate in a massive circumstellar\nmatter (CSM), as has been claimed recently, we use the results of Sternberg et\nal.

(ii) We next use results that show\nthat whenever there are hydrogen lines in SN Ia the hydrogen mass in the CSM is\nlarge (> 1 M_Sun), hence the explosion is a SNIP. We make the simplest\nassumption that the probability for explosion is constant in time for up to\nabout 10^5 yrs after the merger of the core with the white dwarf (WD) in the\nframe of the core-degenerate scenario. This results with at least few x10 of\nSNe Ia that may have a SNIP origin.

Such a disk\nis subject to both the tidal torques due to a time-dependent binary potential\nand the radiative torques due to radiation emitted from each star. The tilt\nangle between the circumbinary disk plane and the binary orbital plane is\nassumed to be very small. We find that there is a radius within/beyond which\nthe circumbinary disk is unstable to radiation-driven warping, depending on the\ndisk density and temperature gradient indices. This marginally stable warping\nradius is very sensitive to viscosity parameters, a fiducial disk radius and\nthe temperature measured there, the stellar luminosity, and the disk surface\ndensity at a radius where the disk changes from the optically thick to thin for\nthe irradiation from the central stars. On the other hand, it is insensitive to\nthe orbital eccentricity and binary irradiation parameter, which is a function\nof the binary mass ratio and luminosity of each star. Since the tidal torques\ncan suppress the warping in the inner part of the circumbinary disk, the disk\nstarts to be warped in the outer part. While the circumbinary disks are most\nlikely to be subject to the radiation-driven warping on a AU to kilo-AU scale\nfor binaries with young massive stars more luminous than 10^4Lsun, the\nradiation driven warping does not work for those around young binaries with the\nluminosity comparable to the solar luminosity. \n\n"}

Light curves and images of hot spots orbiting a black\nhole are affected by a number of special and general relativistic effects, and\nthey can be potentially used to check whether the object is a Kerr black hole\nof general relativity. However, in a previous study we have shown that the\nrelativistic features are usually subdominant with respect to the background\nnoise and the model-dependent properties of the hot spot, and eventually it is\nat most possible to estimate the frequency of the innermost stable circular\norbit. In this case, tests of the Kerr metric are only possible in combination\nwith other measurements. In the present work, we consider a class of non-Kerr\nspacetimes in which the hot spot orbit may be outside the equatorial plane.\nThese metrics are difficult to constrain from the study of accretion disks and\nindeed current X-ray observations of stellar-mass and supermassive black hole\ncandidates cannot put interesting bounds.

Abstract: The recent discovery of dense rings around the Centaur Chariklo (and possibly\nChiron) reveals that complete dense planetary rings are not only found around\nSaturn and Uranus, but also around small bodies orbiting in the vicinity of\nthose giant planets. This report examines whether there could be a physical\nprocess that would make rings more likely to form or persist in this particular\npart of the outer Solar System. Specifically, the ring material orbiting Saturn\nand Uranus appears to be much weaker than the material forming the innermost\nmoons of Jupiter and Neptune. Also, the mean surface temperatures of Saturn's,\nUranus' and Chariklo's rings are all close to 70 K. Thus the restricted\ndistribution of dense rings in our Solar System may arise because icy materials\nare particularly weak around that temperature. \n\n"}

Here we use a simple model of thermal\nemission from cold silicate/carbon dust at a range of dust grain temperatures\nand fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Crab Nebula as a test.\nThis can lower the derived dust mass for the Crab by ~50% and 30-40% for\nastronomical silicates and amorphous carbon grains compared to recently\npublished values (0.25M_sun -> 0.12M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.072M_sun,\nrespectively), but the implied dust mass can also increase by as much as almost\na factor of six (0.25M_sun -> 1.14M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.71M_sun) depending\non assumptions regarding the sizes/temperatures of the coldest grains.

Constraining exoplanet\n  blend scenarios using spectroscopic diagnoses Abstract: The statistical validation of transiting exoplanets proved to be an efficient\ntechnique to secure the nature of small exoplanet signals which cannot be\nestablished by purely spectroscopic means. However, the spectroscopic diagnoses\nare providing us with useful constraints on the presence of blended stellar\ncontaminants. In this paper, we present how a contaminating star affects the\nmeasurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as function of the\nparameters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implemented\ninto the PASTIS planet-validation software. We find particular cases for which\na blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation.\nIt might also produce a bisector variation anti-correlated with the radial\nvelocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. In those cases, the full width\nhalf maximum variation provides complementary constraints.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution. \n\n"}

An inner pressure bump must have been present since early in the\ndisk lifetime to have good agreement between the dust evolution models and the\ncontinuum observations of HD 100546. This pressure bump may have resulted from\nthe presence of a very massive planet ($\\sim20 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$), which formed\nearly in the inner disk ($r\\sim$10 AU). If only this single planet exists, the\ndisk is likely to be old, comparable to the stellar age ($\\sim$5-10 Myr).\nAnother possible explanation is an additional massive planet in the outer disk\n($r\\sim70$ AU): either a low-mass outer planet ($\\lesssim5 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$)\ninjected at early times, or a higher mass outer planet ($\\gtrsim15\nM_{\\rm{Jup}}$) formed very recently, traps the right amount of dust in pressure\nbumps to reproduce the observations.

This would explain observed exoplanets with significant inclination\nrespect to the equatorial plane of their host star. We have used two different\nSPH codes, vine and phantom, to model the evolution of a system\nstar+disk+planet and companion star with time. After an initial coupled\nevolution, the inclination of the disk and that of the planet begin to differ\nsignificantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, respect to\nthe initial plane, is shorter than that of the planet which evolves\nindependently after about 10^4 yr following a perturbed N-body behavior.\nHowever, the planet keeps migrating towards the star because during its orbital\nmotion it crosses the disk plane and the friction with the gas causes angular\nmomentum loss. Disk and planet in a significantly inclined binary system are\nnot dynamically coupled for small binary separations but evolve almost\nindependently. The planet abandons the disk and, due to the onset of a\nsignificant mutual inclination, it interacts with the gas only when its orbit\nintersects the disk plane. The drift of the planet towards the star is not due\nto type I/II with the planet embedded in the disk but to the friction with the\ngas during the disk crossing. \n\n"}

We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case.

The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of\ngiant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth\nrates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk\naccretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with\nthe rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the\noutside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.\nOur model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole\nfor a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of\nour solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a\nfew or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture\nbecause of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient\nsolid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially\n$\\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition.

A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path\nwhere type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly.

In this paper, we present preliminary results of a solar\ntelescope built to feed full-disk sunlight into the HARPS-N spectrograph, which\nis in turn calibrated with an astro-comb. This setup enables long-term\nobservation of the Sun as a star with state-of-the-art sensitivity to radial\nvelocity changes. Over seven days of observing in 2014, we show an average\n50\\cms radial velocity rms over a few hours of observation. After correcting\nobserved radial velocities for spot and plage perturbations using full-disk\nphotometry of the Sun, we lower by a factor of two the weekly radial velocity\nrms to 60\\cms. The solar telescope is now entering routine operation, and will\nobserve the Sun every clear day for several hours. We will use these radial\nvelocities combined with data from solar satellites to improve our\nunderstanding of stellar noise and develop optimal correction methods. If\nsuccessful, these new methods should enable the detection of Venus over the\nnext two to three years, thus demonstrating the possibility of detecting\nEarth-twins around other solar-like stars using the radial velocity technique. \n\n"}

We propose new standard dust opacities for disk\nmodels, we present a simplified treatment of PAHs sufficient to reproduce the\nPAH emission features, and we suggest using a simple treatment of dust\nsettling. We roughly adjust parameters to obtain a model that predicts typical\nClass II T Tauri star continuum and line observations. We systematically study\nthe impact of each model parameter (disk mass, disk extension and shape, dust\nsettling, dust size and opacity, gas/dust ratio, etc.) on all continuum and\nline observables, in particular on the SED, mm-slope, continuum visibilities,\nand emission lines including [OI] 63um, high-J CO lines, (sub-)mm CO\nisotopologue lines, and CO fundamental ro-vibrational lines. We find that\nevolved dust properties (large grains) often needed to fit the SED, have\nimportant consequences for disk chemistry and heating/cooling balance, leading\nto stronger emission lines in general. Strong dust settling and missing disk\nflaring have similar effects on continuum observations, but opposite effects on\nfar-IR gas emission lines. PAH molecules can shield the gas from stellar UV\nradiation because of their strong absorption and negligible scattering\nopacities. The observable millimetre-slope of the SED can become significantly\nmore gentle in the case of cold disk midplanes, which we find regularly in our\nT Tauri models.

Dust concentration Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of large dust grains in massive lopsided\ntransition discs via 2D hydrodynamical simulations including both gas and dust.\nOur simulations adopt a ring-like gas density profile that becomes unstable\nagainst the Rossby-wave instability and forms a large crescent-shaped vortex.\nWhen gas self-gravity is discarded, but the indirect force from the\ndisplacement of the star by the vortex is included, we confirm that dust grains\nwith stopping times of order the orbital time, which should be typically a few\ncentimetres in size, are trapped ahead of the vortex in the azimuthal\ndirection, while the smallest and largest grains concentrate towards the vortex\ncentre. We obtain maximum shift angles of about 25 degrees. Gas self-gravity\naccentuates the concentration differences between small and large grains. At\nlow to moderate disc masses, the larger the grains, the farther they are\ntrapped ahead of the vortex. Shift angles up to 90 degrees are reached for 10\ncm-sized grains, and we show that such large offsets can produce a\ndouble-peaked continuum emission observable at mm/cm wavelengths. This\nbehaviour comes about because the large grains undergo horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex due to the vortex's gravity. At large disc masses, since\nthe vortex's pattern frequency becomes increasingly slower than Keplerian,\nsmall grains concentrate slightly beyond the vortex and large grains form\ngenerally non-axisymmetric ring-like structures around the vortex's radial\nlocation. Gas self-gravity therefore imparts distinct trapping locations for\nsmall and large dust grains which may be probed by current and future\nobservations, and which suggest that the formation of planetesimals in vortices\nmight be more difficult than previously thought. \n\n"}

The algorithm applies theorems of elementary differential\ngeometry to compute the areas bounded by circular curves on the surface of a\nsphere (see Ragozzine & Holman 2010). The implemented algorithm is more\naccurate and orders of magnitude faster than previous algorithms, based on\ncomparisons with Monte Carlo simulations.

However, this barrier\nis weakened in presence of viscosity, more so, if there are explicit energy\ndissipations at the boundary layer itself. We study effects of viscosity and\nenergy dissipation theoretically on the outflow rate and show that as the\nviscosity or energy dissipation (or both) rises, the prospect of formation of\noutflows is greatly reduced, thereby verifying results obtained through\nobservations and numerical simulations. Indeed, we find that in a dissipative\nviscous flow, shocks in presence of outflows can be produced only if the\nShakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter {\\alpha} is less than 0.2. This is a direct\nconsequence of modification of the Rankine-Hugoniot relation across the shock\nin a viscous flow, when the energy dissipation and mass loss in the form of\noutflows from the post-shock region are included.

The results show that the\nvolatile prestellar fingerprint is modified by the chemistry en route into the\ndisc. This holds relatively independent of initial abundances and chemical\nparameters: physical conditions are more important. The amount of CO2 increases\nvia the grain-surface reaction of OH with CO, which is enhanced by\nphotodissociation of H2O ice. Complex organic molecules are produced during\ntransport through the envelope at the expense of CH3OH ice. Their abundances\ncan be comparable to that of methanol ice (few % of water ice) at large disc\nradii (R > 30 AU). Current Class II disc models may be underestimating the\ncomplex organic content.

The model implies that bodies scattered\noutward by Neptune to semimajor axes a>50 au often evolve into resonances which\nsubsequently act to raise the perihelion distances of orbits to q>40 au. The\nimplication of the model is that the orbits with 50<a<100 au and q>40 au should\ncluster near (but not in) the resonances with Neptune (3:1 at a=62.6 au, 4:1 at\na=75.9 au, 5:1 at a=88.0 au, etc.).

We find in two cases that a self-gravitating disc\nmodel compares well with observations. If these discs are self-gravitating,\nthey satisfy the conditions for disc fragmentation in their outer regions.\nThese systems may hence have as-yet-unresolved low mass stellar companions, and\nare thus promising targets for future high angular resolution observations. \n\n"}

Previous studies have\nshown that a large portion of exoplanets detected by the Kepler mission have\nbeen significantly eroded by photo-evaporation. In this paper, we numerically\nstudy the effects of photo-evaporation on the orbital evolution of a\nhypothesized moon system around a planet. We find that photo-evaporation is\ncrucial to the stability of the moon system. Photo-evaporation can erode the\natmosphere of the planet thus leading to significant mass loss. As the planet\nloses mass, its Hill radius shrinks and its moons increase their orbital\nsemi-major axes and eccentricities. When some moons approach their critical\nsemi-major axes, global instability of the moon system would be triggered,\nwhich usually ends up with two, one or even zero surviving moons. Some lost\nmoons could escape from the moon system to become a new planet orbiting the\nstar or run away further to become a free-floating object in the Galaxy.

This stands in contrast to the overall distribution of\nplanets out to ~100 days, which is dominated by low-density sub-Neptunes above\n2 Earth radii, which must have gaseous envelopes to explain their size.\nHowever, on ultra-short-period orbits, planets are bombarded by intense levels\nof photo-ionizing radiation and consequently gaseous sub-Neptunes are extremely\nvulnerable to losing their envelopes to atmospheric photo-evaporation. Using\nmodels of planet evolution, I show that the rocky USP planets can easily be\nproduced as the evaporated remnants of sub-Neptunes with H/He envelopes and\nthat we can therefore understand the observed dearth of USP sub-Neptunes as a\nnatural consequence of photo-evaporation.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk.

We also study the effect of\nclouds and photochemical hazes on the spectra, but do not find strong evidence\nfor either. The self-consistent and retrieval modeling combine to suggest that\nGJ 436b has a high atmospheric metallicity, with best fits at or above several\nhundred times solar metallicity, tidal heating warming its interior with\nbest-fit intrinsic effective effective temperatures around 300--350 K, and\ndisequilibrium chemistry. High metal-enrichments (>600x solar) can only occur\nfrom the accretion of rocky, rather than icy, material. Assuming Tint~300--350\nK, we find that Q'~2x10^5--10^6, larger than Neptune's Q', and implying a long\ntidal circularization timescale for the planet's orbit. We suggest that\nNeptune-mass planets may be a more diverse class than previously imagined, with\nmetal-enhancements potentially spanning several orders of magnitude, to perhaps\nover 1000x solar metallicity.

However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic\nmagnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood. Here I start by reviewing\nrecent advances in the numerical and theoretical modelling of the 'turbulent\ndynamo', which may explain the origin of galactic and inter-galactic magnetic\nfields. While dynamo action was previously investigated in great detail for\nincompressible plasmas, I here place particular emphasis on highly compressible\nastrophysical plasmas, which are characterised by strong density fluctuations\nand shocks, such as the interstellar medium. I find that dynamo action works\nnot only in subsonic plasmas, but also in highly supersonic, compressible\nplasmas, as well as for low and high magnetic Prandtl numbers. I further\npresent new numerical simulations from which I determine the growth of the\nturbulent (un-ordered) magnetic field component ($B_\\mathrm{turb}$) in the\npresence of weak and strong guide fields ($B_0$).

The\naim of this work has been a revision of the entire CoRoT data-set for the\npresence of circumbinary planets, and the derivation of limits to the\nabundances of such planets. We developed a code which removes the light curve\nof the eclipsing binaries and searches for quasi-periodic transit-like features\nin a light curve after removal of binary eclipses and instrumental features.\nThe code needs little information on the sample systems and can be used for\nother space missions as well, like Kepler, K2, TESS and PLATO.

Subsequent analysis showed that at ~1.5\nEarth radii there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky\nsuper-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile\nenvelopes. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will\nbe critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency\nof potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky\nsuper-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have\nlost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes,\nor they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets,\nwhich never had significant envelopes. Using models of atmospheric\nphoto-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated\ncores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys\npush to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller\nless massive cores can be stripped. On the other hand, if most rocky planets\nformed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without\ninitial gaseous envelopes.

We construct a radiative transfer model that accounts for\nthe main characteristics of the features with an inner and outer disk\nmisaligned by ~72 degrees.

We add simulated signals with four different\nmorphologies (sine-Gaussians, Gaussians, white-noise bursts, and binary black\nhole signals) to simulated noise samples representing noise of the two Advanced\nLIGO detectors during their first observing run. We recover them with the\nBayesWave (BW) pipeline to study its accuracy in sky localization, waveform\nreconstruction, and estimation of model-independent waveform parameters. BW\nlocalizes sources with a level of accuracy comparable for all four\nmorphologies, with the median separation of actual and estimated sky locations\nranging from 25.1$^{\\circ}$ to 30.3$^{\\circ}$. This is a reasonable accuracy in\nthe two-detector case, and is comparable to accuracies of other localization\nmethods studied previously. As BW reconstructs generic transient signals with\nsine-Gaussian wavelets, it is unsurprising that BW performs the best in\nreconstructing sine-Gaussian and Gaussian waveforms. BW's accuracy in waveform\nreconstruction increases steeply with network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$_{\\rm\nnet}$), reaching a $85\\%$ and $95\\%$ match between the reconstructed and actual\nwaveform below SNR$_{\\rm net} \\approx 20$ and SNR$_{\\rm net} \\approx 50$,\nrespectively, for all morphologies.

However, no simple way to estimate the potential\nprecision of such timing measures has been presented yet, nor are guidelines\navailable regarding the relation between timing errors and sampling rate.\n  Aims: A `timing error estimator' (TEE) equation is presented that requires\nonly basic transit parameters as input. With the TEE, it is straightforward to\nestimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future\ninstruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.\n  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit\nshape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using\nMonte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in\nparticular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.\n  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to\nthe correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit\ningress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.\n  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing\nerrors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to\nestimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of\nlong-coverage observations are possible as well. The tests for the TEE's\nvalidity-range led also to implications for instrumental design: Temporal\nsampling has to be faster than transit in- or egress durations, or a loss in\ntiming-precision will occur. An application to the TESS mission shows that\ntransits close to its detection limit will have timing uncertainties that\nexceed 1 hour within a few months after their acquisition.

Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines. In particular, for a Sun-like star lying\nat a distance greater than 100 pc, we expect a depression (bias) in the\nlogR'$_{\\rm HK}$ value larger than 0.05-0.1 dex, about the same size as the\ntypical measurement and calibration uncertainties on this parameter.

We also estimate the thermal radio emission from the stellar wind. By\ncomparing our results with VLA and VLBA observations of the system, we\nconstrain the stellar mass-loss rate to be <3e-9 Msun/yr, with likely values\nbetween ~1e-12 and 1e-10 Msun/yr. The frequency-dependent extension of the\nradio-emitting wind is around ~ 3 to 30 Rstar for frequencies in the range of\n275 to 50MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 Rstar,\ncould be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically\nthick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so.

CO\nphotodissociates rapidly into C and O that then evolve by viscous spreading.\nThis model provides a good qualitative explanation of all current observations,\nwith a few exceptional systems that likely have primordial gas. The radial\nlocation of the debris and stellar luminosity explain some non-detections, e.g.\nclose-in debris (like HD 172555) is too warm to retain CO, while high stellar\nluminosities (like $\\eta$ Tel) result in short CO lifetimes.

As a consequence, for clusters in\nwhich star formation occurs on a similar timescale as the transition from a\nconvective to a radiative interior, discrepancies in ages will arise when ages\nare calculated as a function of temperature instead of mass. Simple simulations\nof a cluster with constant star formation over several Myr may explain about\nhalf of the difference in inferred ages versus photospheric temperature;\nspeculative constructions that consist of a constant star formation followed by\na large supernova-driven burst could fully explain the differences, including\nthose between F and G stars where evolutionary tracks may be more accurate. The\nage spreads of low-mass stars predicted from these prescriptions for star\nformation are consistent with the observed luminosity spread of Upper Sco. The\nconclusion that a lengthy star formation history will yield a temperature\ndependence in ages is expected from the basic physics of pre-main sequence\nevolution and is qualitatively robust to the large uncertainties in pre-main\nsequence evolutionary models. \n\n"}

On Earth, periods of global glaciation\n(snowballs) may have been essential for habitability and remote signs of life\n(biosignatures) because they are correlated with increases in the complexity of\nlife and in the atmospheric oxygen concentration. In this paper we investigate\nthe snowball bifurcation (sudden onset of global glaciation) on tidally locked\nplanets using both an energy balance model and an intermediate-complexity\nglobal climate model. We show that tidally locked planets are unlikely to\nexhibit a snowball bifurcation as a direct result of the spatial pattern of\ninsolation they receive. Instead they will smoothly transition from partial to\ncomplete ice coverage and back. A major implication of this work is that\ntidally locked planets with an active carbon cycle should not be found in a\nsnowball state. Moreover, this work implies that tidally locked planets near\nthe outer edge of the habitable zone with low CO2 outgassing fluxes will\nequilibrate with a small unglaciated substellar region rather than cycling\nbetween warm and snowball states.

To address this\nissue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering\nbetween a free-floating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound\nplanet. We distinguish between three different possible scattering outcomes,\nwhere the free-floating planet may get captured after the interaction with the\nbinary, remain unbound, or \"kick-out\" the bound planet and replace it.

The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is\nshown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6\nRearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the\nphotoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ~30-60 days, if\nthese planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for\nplanet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets. \n\n"}

Jupiter's\nlarge internal dynamo magnetic field generates a gigantic magnetosphere, which\nis strongly rotational driven and possesses large plasma sources located deeply\nwithin the magnetosphere. The combination of the latter two effects is the\nprimary reason for Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the\nonly known moon with an intrinsic dynamo magnetic field, which generates a\nmini-magnetosphere located within Jupiter's larger magnetosphere including two\nauroral ovals. Ganymede's magnetosphere is qualitatively different compared to\nthe one from Jupiter. It possesses no bow shock but develops Alfv\\'en wings\nsimilar to most of the extrasolar planets which orbit their host stars within\n0.1 AU. New numerical models of Jupiter's and Ganymede's magnetospheres\npresented here provide quantitative insight into the processes that maintain\nthese magnetospheres. Jupiter's magnetospheric field is approximately\ntime-periodic at the locations of Jupiter's moons and induces secondary\nmagnetic fields in electrically conductive layers such as subsurface oceans. In\nthe case of Ganymede, these secondary magnetic fields influence the oscillation\nof the location of its auroral ovals. Based on dedicated Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations, an analysis of the amplitudes of the auroral oscillations\nprovides evidence that Ganymede harbors a subsurface ocean.

We find that\nthe population-wide imprints like the location of the \"evaporation valley\" in\nthe distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution\nclearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with\nthe observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in\nlow-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition.\nCombined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that\nlow-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still\nundergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets\nlosing all primordial H/He. For planets in this \"triangle of evaporation\" in\nthe distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced. In the\nobserved diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with\nincreasing radius (R/R_Earth<1.6 rocky; 1.6-3.0 ices and/or H/He; >3: H/He).\nThe mass-density diagram contains important information about formation and\nevolution.

The inconsistency suggests that the free escape boundary adopted\nin the escaping model is not a good approximation, which challenges our\nunderstanding of cosmic ray (CR) escaping in SNRs. In addition, we show that\nambient CRs is potentially important for the $\\gamma$-ray emission of\nilluminated MCs external to W28 and W44. In direct interaction scenario, the\nmodel involving re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs and adiabatic compression\nis able to explain the emission from most SNRs. The dispersion shown in the TeV\ndata is naturally explained by different acceleration time of CR particles in\nSNRs. Re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs suggests a transition of seed\nparticles, which is from thermal injected seed particle in young SNRs to\nambient CRs in old SNRs.

Many empirical studies of hot Jupiters have\nimplicitly assumed that the dayside is the hottest hemisphere and the nightside\nis the coldest hemisphere.

X-ray observations of these systems reveal an\noptically thin boundary layer (BL) expected to appear as an inner hole in the\ndisk. Consequently, we truncate the inner disk. However, instead of removing\nthe inner disk, we impose the no-shear boundary condition at the truncation\nradius, thereby lowering the disk temperature and generating a spectrum that\nbetter fits the UV data. With our modified disk, we analyze the archival UV\nspectra of three novalikes that cannot be fitted with standard disks. For the\nVY Scl systems MV Lyr and BZ Cam, we fit a hot inflated white dwarf WD with a\ncold modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim $ a few $10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr). For V592 Cas,\nthe slightly modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr)\ncompletely dominates the UV. These results are consistent with Swift X-ray\nobservations of these systems [Balman et al 2014], revealing BLs merged with\nADAF-like flows and/or hot coronae, where the advection of energy is likely\nlaunching an outflow and heating the WD, thereby explaining the high WD\ntemperature in VY Scl systems. This is further supported by the fact that the\nX-ray hardness ratio increases with the shallowness of the UV slope in a small\nCV sample we examine. Furthermore, for 105 disk-dominated systems, the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra UV slope decreases in the same\norder as the ratio of the X-ray flux to optical/UV flux: from SU UMa's, to U\nGem's, Z Cam's, UX UMa's, and VY Scl's. \n\n"}

We investigate whether such structures are due to the\nmorphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN\nemission. With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts\nfor the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk. CN rings are produced\nnaturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk\nstructure such as a dust cavity or gap. The strong link between FUV flux and CN\nemission can provide critical information regarding the vertical structure of\nthe disk and the distribution of dust grains which affects the UV penetration,\nand could help to break some degeneracies in the SED fitting. In contrast with\nC2H or c-C3H2, the CN flux is not very sensitive to carbon and oxygen\ndepletion. \n\n"}

The tidal interactions at every periastron passage exchange energy\nbetween the orbit and the planet's degree-2 fundamental-mode. Starting from\nzero energy, the f-mode can diffusively grow to large amplitudes if its\none-kick energy gain > 10^-5 of the orbital energy. This requires a pericentre\ndistance of < 4 tidal radii (or 1.6 Roche radii). If the f-mode has a\nnon-negligible initial energy, diffusive evolution can occur at a lower\nthreshold. The first effect can stall the secular migration as the f-mode can\nabsorb orbital energy and decouple the planet from its secular perturbers,\nparking all migrating jupiters safely outside the zone of tidal disruption. The\nsecond effect leads to rapid orbit circularization as it allows an excited\nf-mode to continuously absorb orbital energy as the orbit eccentricity\ndecreases. So without any explicit dissipation, other than the fact that the\nf-mode will damp nonlinearly when its amplitude reaches unity, the planet can\nbe transported from a few AU to ~ 0.2 AU in ~ 10^4 yrs. Such a rapid\ncircularization is equivalent to a dissipation factor Q ~ 1, and it explains\nthe observed deficit of super-eccentric Jovian planets. Lastly, the repeated\nf-mode breaking likely deposit energy and angular momentum in the outer\nenvelope, and avoid thermally ablating the planet.\n  Overall, this work boosts the case for forming hot Jupiters through\nhigh-eccentricity secular migration. \n\n"}

The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by\nthermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot.

The phase curve thus favors the\nscenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat\nredistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar.

We employ this completeness function, together with a dual-population\nplanet occurrence model that includes compact multiple planetary systems, to\ninfer anew the planet yield. We predict both the number of M dwarf planets\nlikely from TESS and their system architectures.

Around stars with spectral types between M1V--M4V, we\npredict TESS will find 990$\\pm$350 planets orbiting 715$\\pm$255 stars, a\n1.5-fold increase over previous predictions. Secondly, TESS will find two or\nmore transiting planets around 20% of these host stars, a number similar to the\nmultiplicity yield of NASA's Kepler mission. Thirdly, TESS light curves in\nwhich one or more planets are detected will often contain transits of\nadditional planets below the detection threshold of TESS. Among a typical set\nof 200 TESS hosts to one or more detected planets, 116$\\pm$28 transiting\nplanets will be missed. Transit follow-up efforts with the photometric\nsensitivity to detect an Earth or larger around a mid-M dwarf, even with very\nmodest period completeness, will readily result in additional planet\ndiscoveries.

The rates of tidal dissipation and tidal\nevolution of orbits are estimated, assuming an Earth-like rheology for the\nplanets. We find that under this assumption the planets b, d, e were captured\nin the 3:2 or higher spin-orbit resonances during the initial spin-down but\nslipped further down into the 1:1 resonance. Dependent on its rheology, the\ninnermost planet b may be captured in a stable pseudosynchronous rotation.\nNon-synchronous rotation ensures higher levels of tidal dissipation and\ninternal heating. The positive feedback between the viscosity and the\ndissipation rate -- and the ensuing runaway heating -- are terminated by a few\nself-regulation processes. When the temperature is high and the viscosity is\nlow enough, the planet spontaneously leaves the 3:2 resonance. Further heating\nis stopped either by passing the peak dissipation or by the emergence of\npartial melt in the mantle.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc. Thereafter, it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer\ntimescale or starts migrating outwards. Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time).

Abstract: When a planet becomes massive enough, it gradually carves a partial gap\naround its orbit in the protoplanetary disk. A pressure maximum can be formed\noutside the gap where solids that are loosely coupled to the gas, typically in\nthe pebble size range, can be trapped. The minimum planet mass for building\nsuch a trap, which is called the pebble isolation mass (PIM), is important for\ntwo reasons: it marks the end of planetary growth by pebble accretion, and the\ntrapped dust forms a ring that may be observed with millimetre observations. We\nstudy the effect of disk turbulence on the pebble isolation mass and find its\ndependence on the gas turbulent viscosity, aspect ratio, and particles Stokes\nnumber. By means of 2D gas hydrodynamical simulations, we found the minimum\nplanet mass to form a radial pressure maximum beyond the orbit of the planet,\nwhich is the necessary condition to trap pebbles. We then carried out 2D gas\nplus dust hydrodynamical simulations to examine how dust turbulent diffusion\nimpacts particles trapping at the pressure maximum. We finally provide a\nsemi-analytical calculation of the PIM based on comparing the radial drift\nvelocity of solids and the root mean square turbulent velocity fluctuations\naround the pressure maximum. From our results of gas simulations, we provide an\nexpression for the PIM versus disk aspect ratio and turbulent viscosity. Our\ngas plus dust simulations show that the effective PIM can be nearly an order of\nmagnitude larger in high-viscosity disks because turbulence diffuse particles\nout of the pressure maximum. This is quantified by our semi-analytical\ncalculation, which gives an explicit dependence of the PIM with Stokes number\nof particles. We conclude than disk turbulence can significantly alter the PIM,\ndepending on the level of turbulence in regions of planet formation. \n\n"}

To date, simulation softwares have been\ndeveloped by individual researchers or research groups in each field, with a\nhuge amount of time and effort, even though numerical algorithms used are very\nsimilar. To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran. In order to support arbitrary\ndata types of particle in Fortran, we design the Fortran interface layer as\nfollows. Based on a given derived data type in Fortran representing particle, a\nPython script provided by us automatically generates a library that manipulates\nthe C++ core part of FDPS. This library is seen as a Fortran module providing\nAPI of FDPS from the Fortran side and uses C programs internally to\ninteroperate Fortran with C++. In this way, we have overcome several technical\nissues when emulating `template' in Fortran. By using the Fortran interface,\nusers can develop all parts of their codes in Fortran. We show that the\noverhead of the Fortran interface part is sufficiently small and a code written\nin Fortran shows a performance practically identical to the one written in C++. \n\n"}

We attempt to\ndefinitively discriminate the nature of the RV variations for the young active\nK5 star BD+20 1790, for which visible (VIS) RV measurements show divergent\nresults on the existence of a substellar companion. Methods. We compare VIS\ndata with high precision RVs in the near infrared (NIR) range by using the\nGIANO - B and IGRINS spectrographs. In addition, we present for the first time\nsimultaneous VIS-NIR observations obtained with GIARPS (GIANO - B and HARPS -\nN) at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). Orbital RVs are achromatic, so the RV\namplitude does not change at different wavelengths, while stellar activity\ninduces wavelength-dependent RV variations, which are significantly reduced in\nthe NIR range with respect to the VIS. Results. The NIR radial velocity\nmeasurements from GIANO - B and IGRINS show an average amplitude of about one\nquarter with respect to previously published VIS data, as expected when the RV\njitter is due to stellar activity.

We employ the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether a single planet or a\nplanet-moon system is a more likely interpretation of the light curve\nvariations. We carry out a blind hare-and-hounds exercise using many noise\nrealizations by injecting simulated transits into different out-of-transit\nparts of the original Kepler-1625 data: 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits\nof a Kepler-1625b-like planet and 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits of\nthis planet with a Neptune-sized moon. The statistical significance and\ncharacteristics of the exomoon-like signal strongly depend on the detrending\nmethod, and the data chosen for detrending, and on the treatment of gaps in the\nlight curve.

These observations raise critical\nquestions about the fundamental nature of the circulation, its time\nvariability, and the overall relationship to the circulation on Jupiter and\nSaturn. Jupiter and Saturn themselves exhibit numerous robust zonal (east-west)\njet streams at the cloud level; moreover, both planets exhibit long-term\nstratospheric oscillations involving perturbations of zonal wind and\ntemperature that propagate downward over time on timescales of ~4 years\n(Jupiter) and ~15 years (Saturn). These oscillations, dubbed the Quasi\nQuadrennial Oscillation (QQO) for Jupiter and the Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO)\non Saturn, are thought to be analogous to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)\non Earth, which is driven by upward propagation of equatorial waves from the\ntroposphere.

Giant planets open gaps in their protoplanetary and subsequently\nsuffer so-called type II migration. Schematically, planets are thought to be\ntightly locked within their surrounding disks, and forced to follow the viscous\nadvection of gas onto the central star. This fundamental principle however has\nrecently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the\ngas' radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the\ntraditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the\ndisk's viscosity still holds.

We have\nperformed 2D (r, {\\theta}) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded\nin locally isothermal {\\alpha}-disks in steady-state accretion, with various\nvalues of {\\alpha}.

Despite initial understandings of\natmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous\nstudies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to\nseek a natural, self-consistent mechanism.

In this work, we investigate the effect of a\nplanet's own cooling luminosity on its thermal evolution and atmospheric\nmass-loss (core-powered mass-loss) and determine its observational consequences\nfor the radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets. Using simple\nanalytical descriptions and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that\nplanetary evolution based on the core-powered mass-loss mechanism alone (i.e.,\nwithout any photoevaporation) can produce the observed valley in the radius\ndistribution. Our results match the valley's location, shape and slope in\nplanet radius-orbital period parameter space, and the relative magnitudes of\nthe planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We find that the slope\nof the valley is, to first order, dictated by the atmospheric mass-loss\ntimescale at the Bondi radius and given by $\\text{d log} R_p/ \\text{d log} P\n\\simeq 1/(3(1-\\beta))$ which evaluates to $ -0.11$ for $ \\beta \\simeq 4$, where\n$M_c/M_\\oplus = (R_c/R_{\\oplus})^{\\beta} (\\rho_{c*}/\\rho_{\\oplus})^{\\beta/3}$\nis the mass-radius relation of the core.

This\nsystem is known to host two massive planets, with both projected close to the\nEinstein ring at the time of the detection. Assuming an isotropic distribution\nfor the orbital orientation, we find that the two planets should also be\nclosely spaced in three-dimensional space and that the ratio of their orbital\nperiods is almost certainly less than two. With N-body numerical integrations,\nwe then identify two types of stable configurations: the two planets can be in\nfirst-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) and have significant ($\\gtrsim0.1$)\neccentricities, or they stay out of MMRs and have nearly circular orbits. The\nlatter is disfavored, given the absence of similar planet pairs in radial\nvelocity (RV) observations as well as the theoretical difficulties in forming\nsuch a configuration. Therefore, the two massive planets in OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L\nare likely in a resonance configuration. Our work shows that the microlensing\ntechnique, which usually only measures the projected configurations, can also\nprobe the detailed dynamical state of multi-planet systems.

However, the\nsystem is poorly characterized and needs more observations to be confirmed,\nwith the next potential transit in 2019 May. In this Letter, we aid\nobservational follow up by analyzing the transit signature of exomoons. We\nderive a simple analytic equation for the transit probability and use it to\ndemonstrate how exomoons may frequently avoid transit if their orbit is larger\nthan the stellar radius and sufficiently misaligned. The nominal orbit for the\nmoon in Kepler-1625 has both of these characteristics, and we calculate that it\nmay only transit roughly 40% of the time. This means that approximately six\nnon-transits would be required to rule out the moon's existence at 95%\nconfidence. When an exomoon's impact parameter is displaced off the star, the\nplanet's impact parameter is displaced the other way, so larger planet transit\ndurations are typically positively correlated with missed exomoon transits. On\nthe other hand, strong correlations do not exist between missed exomoon\ntransits and transit timing variations of the planet. We also show that nodal\nprecession does not change an exomoon's transit probability and that it can\nbreak a prograde-retrograde degeneracy. \n\n"}

Recent CCD observations revealed, however, that also surviving could be a\nsizable fragment, resembling a devolatilized aggregate of loosely-bound dust\ngrains that may have exotic shape, peculiar rotational properties, and\nextremely high porosity, all acquired in the course of the disintegration\nevent. Given that the brightness of 1I/`Oumuamua's parent could not possibly\nequal or exceed the Bortle survival limit, there are reasons to believe that it\nsuffered the same fate as do the frail comets.

The most\nadvanced spectrometers are approaching a precision of $\\sim 10$ cm/s that\nimplies the need to identify and correct for all possible sources of RV\noscillations intrinsic to the star down to this level and possibly beyond. The\nrecent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also\ncalled r modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar\nRV measurements. R modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring\nforce is the Coriolis force and propagate in the retrograde direction in a\nframe that corotates with the star. The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3\n\\leq m \\lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion\nrelation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days. Here we\nsimulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \\leq m \\leq\n5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of\nthe surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of\nthe solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been\nobserved. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$.

We use images and videos collected by observers in 7 countries to\nestimate the location, impact parameters (speed and incoming direction) and\nenergy of the meteoroid.

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts. \n\n"}

I review this progress. Stellar atmospheres can be probed whenever\nthe source in a microlensing event passes over the caustic (contour of infinite\nmagnification) induced by the lens because the caustic effectively resolves the\nsource. Broad-band observations of four events have yielded limb-darkening\nmeasurements, which in essence map the atmospheric temperature as a function of\ndepth. And now, for the first time, spectroscopic observations of one event\npromise much richer diagnostics of the source atmosphere. In the past two\nyears, a practical method has finally been developed to systematically measure\nthe lens masses in microlensing events. This will permit a census of all\nmassive objects, both dark and luminous, in the Galactic bulge, including\nlow-mass stars, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.

We measure\nisotropic luminosities of L_X = 2.0 * 10^(40) erg/s and L_X = 6.6 * 10^(39)\nerg/s for NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2 (0.2-10.0 keV, assuming a distance of 3.7 Mpc).\nThe spectra statistically require soft and hard spectral components to describe\nthe continuum emission; some prior studies of ULXs have claimed cool soft\ncomponents with lower statistics. The improvement over several single-component\nmodels exceeds the 8 sigma level of confidence for X-1; the improvement for X-2\nis significant at the 3 sigma level. The soft components in these ULX spectra\nare well-fit by multi-color disk blackbody models with color temperatures of kT\n= 150 eV. This temperature differs markedly from those commonly measured in the\nspectra of stellar-mass (10 M_sun) black holes in their brightest states (kT ~\n1 keV). It is expected that the temperature of an accretion disk orbiting a\nblack hole should decrease with increasing black hole mass. If the soft\ncomponents we measure are due to emission from the inner region of an accretion\ndisk, and disks extend close to the innermost stable circular orbit at the\naccretion rates being probed, the low color temperatures may be interpreted as\nspectroscopic evidence of black holes with intermediate masses: M_BH ~ 10^(3)\nM_sun. Simple Eddington scaling arguments suggest a mimum mass of M_BH ~ 10^(2)\nM_sun. NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2 are found in optical nebulae (Pakull and Mirioni\n2002), which may indicate that anisotropic emission geometries are unlikely to\naccount for the fluxes observed. \n\n"}

The J,H, and K band data were taken using the European Southern\nObservatory New Technology Telescope. The best fit simple spherical power law\nmodel has index p=2.6 +/- 0.2, over the 0.036--0.1 pc range in radius sampled\nin extinction. This power law slope is steeper than the value of p=2 for a\nsingular isothermal sphere, the initial condition of the inside-out model for\nprotostellar collapse. Including an additional extinction component along the\nline of sight further steepens the inferred profile. Fitting a Bonnor-Ebert\nsphere results in a super-critical value of the dimensionless radius xi_max=25\n+/- 3. The unstable configuration of material may be related to the observed\ninward motions. The Bonnor-Ebert model matches the shape of the observed\nprofile, but significantly underestimates the amount of extinction (by a factor\nof ~4).

The model takes into account the emission produced by the diffuse\ndust and the star forming HII complexes. The dust mass is constrained by\nradiative transfer simulations in the optical (Xilouris et al. 1999). We find\nthat the submm emission predicted by our model cannot account for the observed\nfluxes. Two scenarios may account for the \"missing\" submm flux. In the first\nscenario (Popescu et al. 2000), additional dust (to that derived from the\noptical, and associated with young stars) is embedded in the galaxy in the form\nof a thin disk and gives rise to additional submm emission. The other scenario\ninvestigates whether the average submm emissivity of the dust grains is higher\nthan the values widely used in Galactic environments. In this case, the dust\nmass is equal to that derived from the optical observations, and the submm\nemissivity is treated as a free parameter calculated by fitting our model to\nthe observed SED. We find the submm emissivity value to be ~3 times that often\nused for our Galaxy. While both scenarios reproduce the observed 850 micron\nsurface brightness, the extra embedded dust model is not supported by the near\ninfrared observations. We, thus, find that the enhanced dust submm emissivity\nscenario is the most plausible. [abridged] \n\n"}

Departures from\nLTE significantly affect the profiles of Ca I lines over the whole range of\nstellar parameters considered. However, at [Ca/H] >= -2, NLTE abundance\ncorrection of individual lines may be small in absolute value due to the\ndifferent influence of NLTE effects on line wings and the line core. At lower\nCa abundances, NLTE leads to systematically depleted total absorption in the\nline and positive abundance corrections, exceeding +0.5 dex for Ca I 4226 at\n[Ca/H] = -4.9. In contrast, NLTE effects strengthen the Ca II lines and lead to\nnegative abundance corrections. NLTE corrections are small, <= 0.02 dex, for\nthe Ca II resonance lines. For the IR lines of multiplet 3d - 4p, they grow in\nabsolute value with decreasing Ca abundance exceeding 0.4 dex in metal-poor\nstars with [Fe/H] <= -3. Ca abundances are determined for the Sun, Procyon, and\nseven metal-poor stars, using high S/N and high-resolution spectra at visual\nand near-IR wavelengths.

Parametric models are used for the power spectrum\nand the errors, and the free parameters are determined by assuming Gaussian\nvelocity fields and errors and maximizing the probability of the data given the\nmodel. It has been applied to generalized CDM models with and without COBE\nnormalization. The method has been carefully tested using artificial SFI\ncatalogs. The most likely distance errors are found to be similar to the\noriginal error estimates in the SFI data. The general result that is not very\nsensitive to the prior model used is a relatively high amplitude of the power\nspectrum. For example, at k=0.1 h/Mpc we find P(k)\\Omega^{1.2}=(4.4+/-1.7)X10^3\n(Mpc/h)^3. An integral over the power spectrum yields\n\\sigma_8\\Omega^{0.6}=0.82+/-0.12.

Such research is of direct\nrelevance to gravitational-wave sources for space-based detectors (such as\nLISA). We present here a study of the radiative evolution of circular (i.e.,\nconstant Boyer-Lindquist coordinate radius), non-equatorial Kerr black hole\norbits. Recent theorems have shown that, at least in an adiabatic evolution,\nsuch orbits evolve from one circular configuration into another, changing only\ntheir radius and inclination angle. This constrains the system's evolution in\nsuch a way that the change in its Carter constant can be deduced from knowledge\nof gravitational wave fluxes propagating to infinity and down the black hole's\nhorizon. Thus, in this particular case, a local radiation reaction force is not\nneeded.
