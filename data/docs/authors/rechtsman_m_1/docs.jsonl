The STZ formulation incorporates recent simulation\nresults [Haxton and Liu, PRL 99 195701 (2007)] showing that the steady state\neffective temperature is rate dependent. The resulting model predicts a wide\nrange of deformation behavior as a function of the initial conditions,\nincluding homogeneous deformation, broad shear bands, extremely thin shear\nbands, and the onset of material failure. In particular, the STZ model predicts\nhomogeneous deformation for shorter quench times and lower strain rates, and\ninhomogeneous deformation for longer quench times and higher strain rates. The\nlocation of the transition between homogeneous and inhomogeneous flow on the\ndeformation map is determined in part by the steady state effective\ntemperature, which is likely material dependent. This model also suggests that\nmaterial failure occurs due to a runaway feedback between shear heating and the\nlocal disorder, and provides an explanation for the thickness of shear bands\nnear the onset of material failure. We find that this model, which resolves\ndynamics within a sheared material interface, predicts that the stress weakens\nwith strain much more rapidly than a similar model which uses a single state\nvariable to specify internal dynamics on the interface. \n\n"}

For waves,\nhowever, diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of\ninterference. Anderson localization, which manifests itself through a vanishing\ndiffusion coefficient in an infinite system, originates from constructive\ninterference of waves traveling in loop trajectories -- pairs of time-reversed\npaths returning to the same point. In an open system of finite size, the return\nprobability through such paths is reduced, particularly near the boundary where\nwaves may escape. Based on this argument, the self-consistent theory of\nlocalization and the supersymmetric field theory predict that the diffusion\ncoefficient varies spatially inside the system. A direct experimental\nobservation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave\ntransport inside the system. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional photonic random\nmedia and probe position-dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third\ndimension.

Adding chiral\nfunctionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling\nintegrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel\ntopological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates\nphotons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are\nreverse processes.

By incorporating refraction, this method\nyields improved contrast compared to purely absorption-based radiography but\ninvolves a phase retrieval problem which, in general, allows for ambiguous\nreconstructions. In this paper, we show uniqueness of propagation-based phase\ncontrast imaging for compactly supported objects in the near field regime,\nbased on a description by the projection- and paraxial approximations. In this\nsetting, propagation is governed by the Fresnel propagator and the unscattered\npart of the illumination function provides a known reference wave at the\ndetector which facilitates phase reconstruction. The uniqueness theorem is\nderived using the theory of entire functions. Unlike previous results based on\nexact solution formulae, it is valid for arbitrary complex objects and requires\nintensity measurements only at a single detector distance and illumination wave\nlength. We also deduce a uniqueness criterion for phase contrast tomography,\nwhich may be applied to resolve the three-dimensional structure of micro- and\nnano-scale samples.

The SLH model is a general\nframework for open quantum systems that interact through bosonic fields, and is\nthe basis for the quantum circuit theory developed in the text. Coherent LQG\ncontrol is discussed in Chapters 3-4, where I demonstrate that coherent\nfeedback outperforms measurement-based feedback for certain linear\nquadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problems, and explain the discrepancy by the former's\nsimultaneous utilization of both light quadratures.

The\nspectral behavior of COTS, observed as reflection resonances, is described by\nthe temporal coupled-mode theory.

The critical distinction is the\nnature of magnetic monopole charges, which are integer valued for photons but\nhalf-integer for electrons. This inherent difference is directly tied to the\nspin and ultimately connects to the bosonic or fermionic behavior. We also show\nthe presence of photonic Dirac strings, which are line singularities in the\nunderlying Berry gauge potential. While the results in vacuum are intuitively\nexpected, our central result is the application of this topological\nDirac-Maxwell correspondence to 2D photonic (bosonic) materials, as opposed to\nconventional electronic (fermionic) materials.

We consider the three-dimensional binary mixture, which\nwas initially cooled with a computationally slow rate from the liquid state to\nthe solid phase at a temperature well below the glass transition. It was found\nthat a cycle of heating and cooling can relocate the glass to either\nrejuvenated or relaxed states, depending on the maximum temperature and the\nloading period. Thus, the lowest potential energy is attained after a cycle\nwith the maximum temperature slightly below the glass transition temperature\nand the effective cooling rate slower than the initial annealing rate.

The redissolution occurs when there is a high degree of screening of the\nelectrostatic interactions between monomers, thus reducing the energy of the\nexpanded state. The transition is determined by the chemical potential of the\nmultivalent ions in the solution $\\mu$ and the inverse screening length\n$\\kappa$.

Explicit analytic expressions for light deflection and\nintegrated time delay (Shapiro effect) are obtained accounting for all possible\nretardation effects and arbitrary relative locations of the source of\ngravitational waves, that of light rays, and the observer. It is shown that the\nADM and harmonic gauge conditions can both be satisfied simultaneously outside\nthe source of gravitational waves. Their use drastically simplifies the\nintegration of light propagation equations and those for the motion of light\nsource and observer in the field of the source of gravitational waves, leading\nto the unique interpretation of observable effects. The two limiting cases of\nsmall and large values of impact parameter are elaborated in more detail.\nExplicit expressions for Shapiro effect and deflection angle are obtained in\nterms of the transverse-traceless part of the space-space components of the\nmetric tensor. We also discuss the relevance of the developed formalism for\ninterpretation of radio interferometric and timing observations, as well as for\ndata processing algorithms for future gravitational wave detectors. \n\n"}

Contrary to what is\nwidely assumed, the density of excited emitters and the intensity in an\nemission decay curve are not proportional, but the density is a time-integral\nof the intensity. The integral relation is crucial to correctly interpret\nnon-single-exponential decay. We derive the proper normalization for both a\ndiscrete, and a continuous distribution of rates, where every decay component\nis multiplied with its radiative decay rate. A central result of our paper is\nthe derivation of the emission decay curve in case that both radiative and\nnon-radiative decays are independently distributed. In this case, the\nwell-known emission quantum efficiency can not be expressed by a single number\nanymore, but it is also distributed. We derive a practical description of\nnon-single-exponential emission decay curves in terms of a single distribution\nof decay rates; the resulting distribution is identified as the distribution of\ntotal decay rates weighted with the radiative rates. We apply our analysis to\nrecent examples of colloidal quantum dot emission in suspensions and in\nphotonic crystals, and we find that this important class of emitters is well\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution of decay rates with a narrow and a broad\ndistribution, respectively. Finally, we briefly discuss the Kohlrausch\nstretched-exponential model, and find that its normalization is ill-defined for\nemitters with a realistic quantum efficiency of less than 100 %. \n\n"}

In this paper we try to understand things as if the\nvisible universe were a reading of a low-dimensional hologram generated in\nhyperspace. We performed the whole process of creating and reading the hologram\nof a point in virtual space by using computer simulations. We claim that the\nfuzzieness in quantum mechanics, in statistical physics and thermodynamics is\ndue to the fact that we do not see the real image of the object, but a\nholographic projection of it. We found that the projection of a point particle\nis a de Broglie-type wave. This indicates that holography could be the origin\nof the wave nature of a particle. We have also noted that one cannot stabilize\nthe noise (or fuzzieness) in terms of the integration grid-points of the\nhologram, it means that one needs to give the grid-points a physical\nsignificance.

This\noption is included now in conceptual design reports of the NLC, JLC and\nTESLA/SBLC projects. All the designs foresee two interaction regions: one for\ne+e- and the second for gamma-gamma, gamma-e and e^-e^- collisions. This paper\nis focused on three aspects: 1) arguments for photon colliders; 2) parameters\nof current projects; 3) ultimate luminosities and energies, new ideas. Recent\nstudies have shown that the main collision effect - coherent pair creation - is\nsuppressed at photon colliders with the energy (2E < 2 TeV) due to the beam\nrepulsion, and one can achieve, in principle, the gamma-gamma luminosity\nexceeding 10^{35} cm^-2s^-1. The required electron beams with very small\nemittances can be obtained, for example, using a laser cooling of electron\nbeams. This new method requires a laser with a power by one order of magnitude\nhigher than that required for the ``conversion'' of electrons to photons. Such\nlasers are not available today, but hopefully they will appear by the time when\nlinear colliders will be built. High energy gamma-gamma, gamma-e colliders with\nthe luminosity comparable to that in e^+e^- collisions are beyond the\ncompetition in study of many phenomena of particle physics. \n\n"}
