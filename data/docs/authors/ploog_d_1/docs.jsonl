Pauksztello has independently introduced them as\nco-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of\ncomplexes in $K(B)$. We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's\ncategories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure\n$w$ defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and\nfunctorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For $Hw$ being the\nheart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical\nconservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category\nof complexes $K_w(Hw)$. For any (co)homological functor $H:C\\to A$ for an\nabelian $A$ we construct a weight spectral sequence $T:H(X^i[j])\\implies\nH(X[i+j])$ where $(X^i)=t(X)$; it is canonical and functorial starting from\n$E_2$. This spectral sequences specializes to the 'usual' (Deligne's) weight\nspectral sequences for 'classical' realizations of motives and to\nAtiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences for spectra. Under certain restrictions,\nwe prove that $K_0(C)\\cong K_0(Hw)$ and $K_0(End C)\\cong K_0(End Hw)$.\n  The definition of a weight structure is almost dual to those of a\nt-structure; yet several properties differ. One can often construct a certain\n$t$-structure which is 'adjacent' to $w$ and vice versa. This is the case for\nthe Voevodsky's $DM^{eff}_-$ (one obtains certain new Chow weight and\nt-structures for it; the heart of the latter is 'dual' to $Chow^{eff}$) and for\nthe stable homotopy category. The Chow t-structure is closely related to\nunramified cohomology. \n\n"}

We adapt the classical border basis algorithm to allow\nfor calculating border bases for arbitrary degree-compatible order ideals,\nwhich is \\emph{independent} from term orderings.

The adaptation is based on our polyhedral\ncharacterization: order ideals that support a border basis correspond\none-to-one to integral points of the order ideal polytope.

We\nobtain results for smooth complex projective surfaces X on the number of\nreduced, irreducible curves C of negative self-intersection C^2. The only known\nexamples of surfaces for which C^2 is not bounded below are in positive\ncharacteristic, and the general expectation is that no examples can arise over\nthe complex numbers. Indeed, we show that the idea underlying the examples in\npositive characteristic cannot produce examples over the complex number field.\nThe previous version of this paper claimed to give a counterexample to the\nBounded Negativity Conjecture. The idea of the counterexample was to use Hecke\ntranslates of a smooth Shimura curve in order to create an infinite sequence of\ncurves violating the Bounded Negativity Conjecture. To this end we applied\nHirzebruch Proportionality to all Hecke translates, simultaneously\ndesingularized by a version of Jaffee's Lemma which exists in the literature\nbut which turns out to be false. Indeed, in the new version of the paper, we\nshow that only finitely many Hecke translates of a special subvariety of a\nHilbert modular surface remain smooth. This new result is based on work done\njointly with Xavier Roulleau, who has been added as an author. The other\nresults in the original posting of this paper remain unchanged. \n\n"}

In this paper, we begin the study of how to exploit chordal\nstructure in computational algebraic geometry, and in particular, for solving\npolynomial systems. The structure of a system of polynomial equations can be\ndescribed in terms of a graph. By carefully exploiting the properties of this\ngraph (in particular, its chordal completions), more efficient algorithms can\nbe developed.

After recalling the basic properties of such classifying spaces, an\nimportant class of such varieties is introduced, the one of Bagnera-de Franchis\nvarieties, the quotients of an Abelian variety by the free action of a cyclic\ngroup. Moduli spaces of Abelian varieties and of algebraic curves enter into\nthe picture as examples of rational K(H,1)'s, through Teichmueller theory. The\nmain thrust of the paper is to show how in the case of K(H,1)'s the study of\nmoduli spaces and deformation classes can be achieved through by now classical\nresults concerning regularity of classifying maps.

It is well known\nthat this correspondence fails in non-Calabi-Yau cases.

The types of singularities that occur in this context have been\nstudied by Mori, Koll\\'ar, Reid, and others, beginning in the 1980s with the\nintroduction of the minimal model program. Normal singularities that are\nterminal, canonical, log terminal, and log canonical, and their non-normal\ncounterparts, are typically studied using a resolution of singularities (or a\nsemiresolution) and finding numerical conditions that relate the canonical\nclass of the variety to that of its resolution. In order to do this, it has\nbeen assumed that a variety $X$ has a $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class:\nsome multiple $mK_X$ of the canonical class is Cartier. In particular, this\ndivisor can be pulled back under a resolution $f: Y \\rightarrow X$ by pulling\nback its local sections. Then one has a relation $K_Y \\sim \\frac{1}{m}f^*(mK_X)\n+ \\sum a_iE_i$. It is then the coefficients of the exceptional divisors $E_i$\nthat determine the type of singularities that belong to $X$. It might be asked\nwhether this $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier hypothesis is necessary in studying\nsingularities in birational classification. In \\cite{dFH09}, de Fernex and\nHacon construct a boundary divisor $\\Delta$ for arbitrary normal varieties, the\nresulting divisor $K_X + \\Delta$ being $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier even though $K_X$\nitself is not.

On the other hand, the metric is not renormalized due to the higher\namount of supersymmetry of the underlying superconformal field theory. Thus one\ncan define a natural mapping from the classical K3 moduli space to the moduli\nspace of conformal field theories. Apart from the generalization of mirror\nconstructions for Calabi-Yau threefolds, there is a formulation of mirror\nsymmetry in terms of orthogonal lattices and global moduli space arguments. In\nmany cases both approaches agree perfectly - with a long outstanding exception:\nBatyrev's mirror construction for K3 hypersurfaces in toric varieties does not\nfit into the lattice picture whenever the Picard group of the K3 surface is not\ngenerated by the pullbacks of the equivariant divisors of the ambient toric\nvariety. In this case, not even the ranks of the corresponding Picard lattices\nadd up as expected. In this paper the connection is clarified by refining the\nlattice picture.

This paper defines local-global intersection homology groups, that\nrecord global information about the singularities of $X$.

We extend\nsome results and definitions from both theories to a common setting. We\nintroduce a functional generalising Yang-Mills-Higgs functional, whose minima\ncoincide with the solutions to our equations. We prove a Hitchin-Kobayashi\ncorrespondence allowing to study the solutions of the equations in the Kaehler\ncase. We give a structure of smooth manifold to the set of (gauge equivalence\nclasses of) solutions to (a perturbation of) the equations (the so-called\nmoduli space). We give a compactification of the moduli space, generalising\nGromov's compactification of the moduli of holomorphic curves.
