To understand the effect of a particle having a complex energy, the\nbehavior of a classical particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential\n$V(x)=-\\cos(x)$ is studied.

Since both pure\ngravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially\nsymmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum\ndescriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is\nsuccessfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin\nand Nicolai, Nucl.Phys.B475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum\ngravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S)\n-type models are obtained.

The homogeneous elements of the universal\ndifferential algebra are naturally identified with operators living in tensor\npowers of Quantum Spacetime; this allows us to compute their spectra. In\nparticular, we consider operators that can be interpreted as distances, areas,\n3- and 4-volumes. The Minkowski distance operator between two independent\nevents is shown to have pure Lebesgue spectrum with infinite multiplicity. The\nEuclidean distance operator is shown to have spectrum bounded below by a\nconstant of the order of the Planck length. The corresponding statement is\nproved also for both the space-space and space-time area operators, as well as\nfor the Euclidean length of the vector representing the 3-volume operators.\nHowever, the space 3-volume operator (the time component of that vector) is\nshown to have spectrum equal to the whole complex plane.

In this paper, we consider the Berry phase\ncontribution in the absence of superflow, which results in branch cuts between\nneighboring vortices across which the quasiparticle wave function changes sign.\nHere, the simplest problem that captures the physics is that of scattering from\na single finite branch cut that stretches between two vortices.

These latter objects are\ntriples (x, r, beta), where x is a point in the Bruhat-Tits building of the\nreductive group G, r is a nonnegative real number, and beta is a semistable\nfunctional on the degree r associated graded piece of the Moy-Prasad filtration\ncorresponding to x.\n  Recent work on the wild ramification case of the geometric Langlands\nconjectures suggests that fundamental strata also play a role in the geometric\nsetting. In this paper, we develop a theory of minimal K-types for formal flat\nG-bundles. We show that any formal flat G-bundle contains a fundamental\nstratum; moreover, all such strata have the same rational depth.

Its advantage compared to\nstandard eikonal formulas is that the integrals contain no rapidly oscillating\nBessel functions. Two theorems which allow one to relate large-b behavior of\nchi(b) with analytical properties of the Born amplitude are proved. Several\nexamples of these theorems are given. To check the efficiency of the main\nformula, it is applied for numerical calculations of the total cross section\nfor a number of particular expressions of A_B. Only those Born amplitudes are\nchosen which result in moderately small eikonal functions and lead to the\ncorrect asymptotics of chi(b). The numerical calculations show that our formula\napproximates the total cross section with the relative error of O(10^(-5)),\nprovided that the first three non-zero terms in it are taken into account. \n\n"}

Our goal in this paper is to\nexplore the possibility of having an equivalent relationship in the context of\nlattice models. We focus on models based on the Temperley-Lieb algebra, and use\nthe concept of braid translation, which is a natural way to close an open spin\nchain by adding an interaction between the first and last spins using braiding\nto bring them next to each other. The interaction thus obtained is in general\nnon-local, but has the key feature that it is expressed solely in terms of the\nalgebra for the open spin chain - the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebra and its\nblob algebra generalization. This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin\nchains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic\nTL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are\nknown to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid\ntranslation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the\nopen model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip. This\nstatement has a precise mathematical formulation, which is a pull-back map\nbetween irreducible modules of, respectively, the blob algebra and the affine\nTL algebra. We then turn to the same kind of analysis for two models whose\ncontinuum limits are Logarithmic CFTs - the alternating gl(1|1) and sl(2|1)\nspin chains. We find that the result for minimal models does not hold any\nlonger: braid translation of the relevant TL modules does not give rise to the\nmodules known to be present in the periodic chains. In the gl(1|1) case, the\ncontent in terms of the irreducibles is the same, as well as the spectrum, but\nthe detailed structure (like logarithmic coupling) is profoundly different.\nThis carries over to the continuum limit. \n\n"}

In three\ndimensions, colored building blocks are labeled by some 2D triangulations and\nthose homeomorphic to the 3-ball are labeled by the subset of planar ones.\nSimilarly to Euler's formula in 2D which provides an upper bound to the number\nof vertices at fixed number of polygons with given lengths, we look in three\ndimensions for an upper bound on the number of edges at fixed number of given\ncolored building blocks. In this article we solve this problem when all colored\nbuilding blocks, except possibly one, are homeomorphic to the 3-ball. To do\nthis, we find a characterization of the way a colored building block\nhomeomorphic to the ball has to be glued to other blocks of arbitrary topology\nin a colored triangulation which maximizes the number of edges. This local\ncharacterization can be extended to the whole triangulation as long as there is\nat most one colored building block which is not a 3-ball. The triangulations\nobtained this way are in bijection with trees. The number of edges is given as\nan independent sum over the building blocks of such a triangulation. In the\ncase of all colored building blocks being homeomorphic to the 3-ball, we show\nthat these triangulations are homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Those results were\nonly known for the octahedron and for melonic building blocks before. This\narticle is self-contained and can be used as an introduction to colored\ntriangulations and their bubbles from a purely combinatorial point of view. \n\n"}

It is given the white\nnoise formulation of this theory. The white noise analysis and the Hida\noperators as the creation and annihilation operators for free fields are used.\nThe whole Bogoliubov method is unchanged. Causal axioms of such QFT make sense\non any globally causal space-times. Perturbative QFT with Hida operators is\nanalysed on the flat Minkowski space-time and on the static Einstein Universe\n(EU). On the flat Minkowski space-time this allowed us to go a step further in\nthe analysis of the adiabatic limit problem, the existence of which has a much\nwider scope than in the theory based on Wightman's operator valued\ndistributions. The natural condition of existence of the adiabatic limit (as\ngeneralized integral kernel operators of white noise calculus) for higher-order\ncontributions to the interacting fields, together with the remaining\nassumptions of causal QFT (including the natural invariance conditions, e.g.\ngauge invariance), allowed us to reduce the freedom in choice of\nrenormalization and imposed nontrivial conditions on the masses of elementary\nparticles.

But, is this connection always an evidence of `quantum-thermodynamic\nsupremacy'? By force of example, we show that this is not the case. In\nparticular, we compare a power-driven three-level continuous quantum\nrefrigerator with a four-level combined cycle, partly driven by power and\npartly by heat. We focus on the weak driving regime and find the four-level\nmodel to be superior since it can operate in parameter regimes in which the\nthree-level model cannot, it may exhibit a larger cooling rate, and,\nsimultaneously, a better coefficient of performance. Furthermore, we find that\nthe improvement in the cooling rate matches the increase in the stationary\nquantum coherences exactly. Crucially, though, we also show that the\nthermodynamic variables for both models follow from a classical representation\nbased on graph theory. This implies that we can build incoherent\nstochastic-thermodynamic models with the same steady-state operation or,\nequivalently, that both coherent refrigerators can be emulated classically.\nMore generally, we prove this for any N-level weakly driven device with a\n`cyclic' pattern of transitions.

This correlator is essentially\nthe probability of formation of a ferromagnetic string of length $n$ in the\nantiferromagnetic ground state of the chain and plays an important role in the\ntheory of integrable models. For the XY Spin Chain, the correlator can be\nexpressed as the determinant of a Toeplitz matrix and its asymptotical\nbehaviors for $n \\to \\infty$ throughout the phase diagram are obtained using\nknown theorems and conjectures on Toeplitz determinants.

The order of phase\ntransition is determined by the cutoff of renormalization group transformation.\nThis definition unified Ehrenfest's definition of phase transition in\nthermodynamic physics.

In\nthe state space of these two possibly entangled qudits an analogue to the well\nknown tetrahedron with the four qubit Bell states at the vertices is presented.\nThe simplex analogue to this magic tetrahedron includes mixed states. Each of\nthese states appears to each of the two parties as the maximally mixed state.\nSome studies on these states are performed, and special elements of this set\nare identified. A large number of them is included in the chosen simplex which\nfits exactly into conditions needed for teleportation and other applications.\nIts rich symmetry - related to that of a classical phase space - helps to study\nentanglement, to construct witnesses and perform partial transpositions. This\nsimplex has been explored in details for d=3. In this paper the mathematical\nbackground and extensions to arbitrary dimensions are analysed. \n\n"}
