Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string\ntheory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,\nwe study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be\ncentral to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge\nsymmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these\ntwo kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string\nvacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the\ndegree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities\nof realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string\nscale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank.

For\ngravitational waves, the dominant contribution is characterized by an effective\nstress-energy tensor at future null infinity. We employ perturbation theory and\nthe short-wavelength approximation to compute this stress-energy tensor in a\nwide class of alternative theories. We find that this tensor is generally a\nmodification of that first computed by Isaacson, where the corrections can\ndominate over the general relativistic term. In a wide class of theories,\nhowever, these corrections identically vanish at asymptotically flat, future,\nnull infinity, reducing the stress-energy tensor to Isaacson's. We exemplify\nthis phenomenon by first considering dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity,\nwhich corrects the action via a scalar field and the contraction of the Riemann\ntensor and its dual. We then consider a wide class of theories with dynamical\nscalar fields coupled to higher-order curvature invariants, and show that the\ngravitational wave stress-energy tensor still reduces to Isaacson's.

How does this accord with the use of single\nparticle distribution functions in the kinetic equations? When can these\neffects be parametrised in an effective description in terms of quasiparticles?\nAnd what is the kinematic role of their thermal masses? We address these\nquestions in the framework of nonequilibrium quantum field theory and develop\nan intuitive picture in which contributions from higher order processes are\nparametrised by the widths of resonances in the plasma. In the narrow width\nlimit we recover the quasiparticle picture, with the additional processes\ngiving rise to off-shell parts of quasiparticle propagators that appear to\nviolate energy conservation.

For practical purposes, the chiral\nfermionic sector of Lee-wick theories requires two Lee-Wick partners per\nfermion which opens up the possibility for a negative energy density of the\nearly universe. A toy Lee-Wick model with one fermionic partner relaxes such\noddities and hence easy to deal with.

The dynamics of the gauge fields significantly\nmodifies the equations of motion for the axion, providing an additional damping\nterm that supports slow-roll inflation, without the need to fine tune the axion\ndecay constant. We demonstrate that in an appropriate slow-roll limit it is\npossible to integrate out the massive gauge field fluctuations whilst still\nmaintaining the nontrivial modifications of the gauge field to the axion. In\nthis slow-roll limit, chromo-natural inflation is exactly equivalent to a\nsingle scalar field effective theory with a non-minimal kinetic term, i.e. a\nP(X,\\chi) model. This occurs through a precise analogue of the gelaton\nmechanism, whereby heavy fields can have unsuppressed effects on the light\nfield dynamics without contradicting decoupling.

The\npresence of these objects typically induces complicated dynamics in the compact\ndimensions such that a full solution to the 10d equations of motion is often\nout of reach. In order to still be able to make statements about the 4d\neffective theory arising in the low-energy limit, the equations of motion are\nusually only solved in an integrated sense, while the backreaction of the\nlocalised sources on the internal fields is neglected. This simplification is\noften referred to as smearing. In this work, we investigate to what extent\nsmearing may affect observables in the effective low-energy theory and whether\nit may lead to fake solutions that would cease to exist once the backreaction\nis properly taken into account. We analyse explicit examples for which smeared\nsolutions exist and find that the reliability of the smeared approximation\nappears to depend on whether or not these solutions saturate a BPS bound. We\nalso address the proposal of placing anti-D3-branes at the tip of a warped\nthroat geometry like the Klebanov-Strassler solution in order to construct\nmeta-stable de Sitter vacua in string theory. We show that, under a few general\nassumptions, the backreaction of the fully localised anti-branes yields a\nsingularity in fields that do not directly couple to them, and we give an\nargument suggesting that the singularity is not resolved by brane polarisation.\nWe furthermore demonstrate that, in many string compactifications involving\nnon-trivial background fluxes, the effective lower-dimensional cosmological\nconstant is determined by the on-shell action of the localised sources present\nin the solution. This often allows to compute the cosmological constant without\nresorting to potentially unreliable approximations like smearing. \n\n"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\ngeometric understanding of amplitudes for a large class of theories. The key is\nto think of amplitudes as differential forms directly on kinematic space. We\nexplore this picture for a wide range of massless theories in general spacetime\ndimensions. For the bi-adjoint cubic scalar, we establish a direct connection\nbetween its \"scattering form\" and a classic polytope--the associahedron--known\nto mathematicians since the 1960's. We find an associahedron living naturally\nin kinematic space, and the tree amplitude is simply the \"canonical form\"\nassociated with this \"positive geometry\". Basic physical properties such as\nlocality, unitarity and novel \"soft\" limits are fully determined by the\ngeometry. Furthermore, the moduli space for the open string worldsheet has also\nlong been recognized as an associahedron. We show that the scattering equations\nact as a diffeomorphism between this old \"worldsheet associahedron\" and the new\n\"kinematic associahedron\", providing a geometric interpretation and novel\nderivation of the bi-adjoint CHY formula. We also find \"scattering forms\" on\nkinematic space for Yang-Mills and the Non-linear Sigma Model, which are dual\nto the color-dressed amplitudes despite having no explicit color factors. This\nis possible due to a remarkable fact--\"Color is Kinematics\"--whereby kinematic\nwedge products in the scattering forms satisfy the same Jacobi relations as\ncolor factors.

In this framework, the\ngravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which we\ntake as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature. The observed\nweakness of gravity on distances $\\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n\n\\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The\nPlanck scale $M_{Pl} \\sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity\nis simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While\ngravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the\nStandard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of\nweak scale \"thickness\" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number\nof striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments. For the case of\n$n=2$ new dimensions, planned sub-millimeter measurements of gravity may\nobserve the transition from $1/r^2 \\to 1/r^4$ Newtonian gravitation. For any\nnumber of new dimensions, the LHC and NLC could observe strong quantum\ngravitational interactions. Furthermore, SM particles can be kicked off our 4\ndimensional manifold into the new dimensions, carrying away energy, and leading\nto an abrupt decrease in events with high transverse momentum $p_T \\gsim$ TeV.\nFor certain compact manifolds, such particles will keep circling in the extra\ndimensions, periodically returning, colliding with and depositing energy to our\nfour dimensional vacuum with frequencies of $ \\sim 10^{12}$ Hz or larger.

In the present article we apply a similar approach to the problem of\nquantizing the massive 2+1 Dirac particle. However, we stress that such a\nproblem differs in a nontrivial way from the one in 3+1 dimensions. The point\nis that in 2+1 dimensions each spin polarization describes different fermion\nspecies.

An example -- supported by Weinberg's successful prediction of the\ncosmological constant -- is the potentially vast landscape of vacua in string\ntheory, where the existence of galaxies and atoms is promoted to a vacuum\nselection criterion. Then, low energy SUSY becomes unnecessary, and\nsupersymmetry -- if present in the fundamental theory -- can be broken near the\nunification scale. All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become\nultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the\nsupersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,\nand account for the successful unification of gauge couplings. This framework\nremoves all the difficulties of the SSM: the absence of a light Higgs and\nsparticles, dimension five proton decay, SUSY flavor and CP problems, and the\ncosmological gravitino and moduli problems. High-scale SUSY breaking raises the\nmass of the light Higgs to about 120-150 GeV. The gluino is strikingly long\nlived, and a measurement of its lifetime can determine the ultraheavy scalar\nmass scale. Measuring the four Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to the gauginos\nand higgsinos precisely tests for high-scale SUSY.

In previous\nwork, the precise meaning of gauge theories obtained by monodromies that do not\ncorrespond to Seiberg duality was unclear.

Though not\nunified into a simple group, these theories preserve the successful\nsupersymmetric relation of gauge couplings, as they start out with equal SU(3)\nand SU(2) couplings and the correct initial sin^2\\theta_W at the\ncompactification scale of M_{GUT}\\simeq 2x10^{16} GeV, and they have the\nminimal low-energy particle content of split supersymmetry. We also propose a\nmechanism in which the gauginos and higgsinos are further protected by a\ndiscrete R-symmetry against gravitational corrections, as the gravitino gets an\ninvariant Dirac mass by pairing with a member of a Kaluza-Klein tower of\nspin-3/2 particles. In addition to the models proposed here, split\nsupersymmetry offers novel strategies for realistic model-building. So,\nTeV-scale string models previously dismissed because of rapid proton decay, or\nincorrect sin^2\\theta_W, or because there were no unused dimensions into which\nto dilute the strength of gravity, can now be reconsidered as candidates for\nrealistic split theories with string scale near M_{GUT}, as long as the\ngauginos and higgsinos remain light. \n\n"}

The evidence for this assertion\narises from two independent considerations. The first is the phenomenological\nsuccess of the free fermionic heterotic-string models, which are constructed in\nthe vicinity of the self-dual point under T-duality. The relation between the\nfree fermionic models and the underlying Z2 X Z2 toroidal orbifolds is\ndiscussed. Recent analysis revealed that the Z2 X Z2 free fermionic orbifolds\nutilize an asymmetric shift in the reduction to three generations, which\nindicates that the untwisted geometrical moduli are fixed near the self-dual\npoint. The second consideration arises from the recent formulation of quantum\nmechanics from an equivalence postulate and its relation to phase-space\nduality. In this context it is demonstrated that the trivial state, with\nV(q)=E=0, is identified with the self-dual state under phase-space duality.\nThese observations suggest a more general mathematical principle in operation.\nIn physical systems that exhibit a duality structure, the self-dual states\nunder the given duality transformations correspond to critical points. \n\n"}

In a previous paper (Invent. math. 123 (1996), 507-552) the author\nconstructed the first examples of compact 8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7), by\nresolving orbifolds T^8/G, where T^8 is the 8-torus and G a finite group of\nautomorphisms of T^8.\n  This paper describes a different construction of compact 8-manifolds with\nholonomy Spin(7). We start with a Calabi-Yau 4-orbifold Y with isolated\nsingularities, and an isometric, antiholomorphic involution \\sigma of Y fixing\nonly the singular points. Let Z=Y/<\\sigma>. Then Z is an orbifold with isolated\nsingularities, and a natural Spin(7)-structure. We resolve the singular points\nof Z to get a compact 8-manifold M, and show that M has holonomy Spin(7).\n  Taking Y to be a hypersurface in a complex weighted projective space, we\nconstruct new examples of compact 8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7), and\ncalculate their Betti numbers b^k. The fourth Betti number b^4 tends to be\nrather large, as high as 11,662 in one example. \n\n"}

In the chiral limit, the\nlocation of the tricritical point which is linked to a Gaussian fixed point, is\ndetermined. For quark chemical potentials smaller than the tricritical one the\nsecond-order phase transition belongs to the O(4) universality class. For\ntemperatures below the tricritical one we find initially a weak first-order\nphase transition which is commonly seen in model studies and also in recent\nlattice simulations. In addition, below temperatures of T <~ 17 MeV we find two\nphase transitions. The chiral restoration transition is initially also of\nfirst-order but turns into a second-order transition again. This leads to the\npossibility that there may be a \"second tricritical\" point in the QCD phase\ndiagram in the chiral limit. \n\n"}

In\nfollowing up this thought, we formulate Maxwell's theory in a diffeomorphism\ninvariant and metric-independent way. The electromagnetic field is then given\nin terms of the excitation $H=(H,D)$ and the field strength $F=(E,B)$.\nAdditionally, a local and linear ``spacetime relation'' is assumed between $H$\nand $F$, namely $H \\sim \\kappa F$, with the constitutive tensor $\\kappa$. The\npropagation is studied of electromagnetic wave fronts (surfaces of\ndiscontinuity) with a method of Hadamard. We find a generalized Fresnel\nequation that is quartic in the wave covector of the wave front. We discuss\nunder which conditions the waves propagate along the light cone. Thereby we\nderive the metric of spacetime, up to a conformal factor, by purely\nelectromagnetic methods. \n\n"}

Significant\nvariation of the data demonstrates genuine sample dependence of the dielectric\nfunction. We demonstrate that the Casimir force is largely determined by the\nmaterial properties in the low frequency domain and argue that therefore the\nprecise values of the Drude parameters are crucial for an accurate evaluation\nof the force. These parameters can be estimated by two different methods,\neither by fitting real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function at low\nfrequencies, or via a Kramers-Kronig analysis based on the imaginary part of\nthe dielectric function in the extended frequency range. Both methods lead to\nvery similar results. We show that the variation of the Casimir force\ncalculated with the use of different optical data can be as large as 5% and at\nany rate cannot be ignored. To have a reliable prediction of the force with a\nprecision of 1%, one has to measure the optical properties of metallic films\nused for the force measurement. \n\n"}
