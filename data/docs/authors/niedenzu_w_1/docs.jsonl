An ultracold\nmolecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime\nfor chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external\nelectric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is\nstrictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules.

Here we show that the\nquantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress\nthe bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We\nuse an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along\nthe tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight\nconfinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can\napproach each other only in a \"side-by-side\" collision, where the chemical\nreaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction.

A qubit induces an effective coupling between two externally\npumped cavity modes. Without cavity losses and in the dispersive regime,\nintrinsic Josephson oscillations of photons between the two modes occurs. In\nthis case, contrary to regular Markovian decoherence, the qubit purity shows a\nGaussian decay and recurrence of its coherence. Due to intrinsic\nnon-linearities, both the Josephson oscillations as well as the qubit\nproperties display a rich collapse-revival structure, where, however, the\ncomplexity of the qubit evolution is in some sense stronger.

Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this\napplication largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.\nSpecifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the\ninteraction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for\nexperimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood\nbecause interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important,\nmean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps\ndoes not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where $a$ is\ninfinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they\ndepend only on the particle density and quantum statistics. While the unitary\nFermi gas has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical\ninvestigation, the degenerate unitary Bose gas has generally been deemed\nexperimentally inaccessible because of three-body loss rates that increase\ndramatically with increasing $a$.

Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the\nelectromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum\nfluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work\nrepresents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of\nindividual spins to microwave photons. \n\n"}

However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies\nEPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography.

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance.

In quantum systems the minimal group size\n$n_{\\textrm{min}}$ depends on the temperature $T$, contrary to the classical\ncase.

It expresses fidelity as an\ninterference sum of dephasing trajectories weighed by the Wigner function of\nthe initial state, and does not require that the initial state be localized in\nposition or momentum. This general dephasing representation is special in that,\ncounterintuitively, all of fidelity decay is due to dephasing and none due to\nthe decay of classical overlaps. Surprising accuracy of the approximation is\njustified by invoking the shadowing theorem: twice--both for physical\nperturbations and for numerical errors.

The\ntests are done in non-universal regimes in mixed phase space where detailed\nfeatures of fidelity are important.

The set of initial states which give an infinite hitting time form a\nsubspace.

The\nresulting von Neumann equation is nonlinear: $i\\dot\\rho=[H,\\rho^q]$. In spite\nof its nonlinearity the dynamics is consistent with linear quantum mechanics of\npure states. The free energy $F_q=U_q-TS_q$ is a stability function for the\ndynamics. This implies that q-equilibrium states are dynamically stable. The\n(microscopic) evolution of $\\rho$ is reversible for any q, but for $q\\neq 1$\nthe corresponding macroscopic dynamics is irreversible. \n\n"}

This condition is rarely met in atomic systems. We report\nthe possibility of bypassing this condition and thereby creating coherences by\nletting the atom with orthogonal dipoles to interact with the vacuum of a\npre-selected polarized cavity mode rather than the free space vacuum. We derive\na master equation for the reduced density operator of a model four level atomic\nsystem, and obtain its analytical solution to describe the interference\neffects. We report the quantum beat structure in the populations. \n\n"}

We shall first\nconsider a model calculation based on Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED\nvacuum in the presence of an expanded bubble to that in the presence of a\ncollapsed bubble. In this way we shall derive an estimate for the spectrum and\ntotal energy emitted. This latter will be shown to be proportional to the\nvolume of space over which the refractive index changes, as Schwinger\npredicted. After this preliminary check we shall deal with the physical\nconstraints that any viable dynamical model for SL has to satisfy in order to\nfit the experimental data. We shall emphasize the importance of the timescale\nof the change in refractive index. This discussion will led us to propose a\nsomewhat different version of dynamical Casimir effect in which the change in\nvolume of the bubble is no longer the only source for the change in the\nrefractive index. \n\n"}

We restrict\nourselves to that subclass of these dynamical symmetries for which the\ncorresponding effective generating functions are necessaarily free of quantum\ncorrections. We demonstrate that infinite families of such transformations\nexist for a variety of familiar conservative systems of one degree of freedom.\nWe show how the geometry of the canonical transformations and the symmetry of\nthe effective generating function can be exploited to pin down the precise form\nof the integral equations for stationary state eigenfunctions. We recover\nseveral integral equations found in the literature on standard special\nfunctions of mathematical physics. We end with a brief discussion (relevant to\nstring theory) of the generalization to scalar field theories in 1+1\ndimensions. \n\n"}

The quantum algorithm is based on the essential use of\nGrover's operator for the quantum search of a database and of Shor's Fourier\ntransform for extracting the periodicity of a function, and their combined use\nin the counting algorithm originally introduced by Brassard et al. One of the\nmain features of our quantum probabilistic algorithm is its full unitarity and\nreversibility, which would make its use possible as part of larger and more\ncomplicated networks in quantum computers. As an example of this we describe\npolynomial time algorithms for studying some important problems in number\ntheory, such as the test of the primality of an integer, the so called 'prime\nnumber theorem' and Hardy and Littlewood's conjecture about the asymptotic\nnumber of representations of an even integer as a sum of two primes. \n\n"}
