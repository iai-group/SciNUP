We work in the general setting of\nderived algebraic geometry: our basic objects are derived stacks X and their\noo-categories QC(X) of quasicoherent sheaves. We show that for a broad class of\nderived stacks, called perfect stacks, algebraic and geometric operations on\ntheir categories of sheaves are compatible. We identify the category of sheaves\non a fiber product with the tensor product of the categories of sheaves on the\nfactors. We also identify the category of sheaves on a fiber product with\nfunctors between the categories of sheaves on the factors (thus realizing\nfunctors as integral transforms, generalizing a theorem of Toen for ordinary\nschemes). As a first application, for a perfect stack X, consider QC(X) with\nits usual monoidal tensor product. Then our main results imply the equivalence\nof the Drinfeld center (or Hochschild cohomology category) of QC(X), the trace\n(or Hochschild homology category) of QC(X) and the category of sheaves on the\nloop space of X. More generally, we show that the E_n-center and the E_n-trace\n(or E_n-Hochschild cohomology and homology categories respectively) of QC(X)\nare equivalent to the category of sheaves on the space of maps from the\nn-sphere into X.

We work in the setting of perfect stacks X and their stable\ninfinity-categories Q(X) of quasicoherent sheaves. Perfect stacks include all\nvarieties and common stacks in characteristic zero, and their stable\ninfinity-categories of sheaves are well behaved refinements of their\nquasicoherent derived categories, satisfying natural analogues of common\nproperties of function spaces.\n  To a morphism of perfect stacks pi:X-->Y, we associate the categorified\nmatrix algebra Q(X x_Y X) of sheaves on the derived fiber product equipped with\nits monoidal convolution product. We show that for pi faithfully flat (as a\ncorollary of the 1-affineness theorem of Gaisgory) or for pi proper and\nsurjective and X,Y smooth (as an application of proper descent, cf.

The witness complex\non the other hand enjoys a smaller size because of a subsampling, but fails to\ncapture the topology in high dimensions unless imposed with extra structures.\nWe investigate a complex called the {\\em graph induced complex} that, to some\nextent, enjoys the advantages of both. It works on a subsample but still\nretains the power of capturing the topology as the Vietoris-Rips complex. It\nonly needs a graph connecting the original sample points from which it builds a\ncomplex on the subsample thus taming the size considerably. We show that, using\nthe graph induced complex one can (i) infer the one dimensional homology of a\nmanifold from a very lean subsample, (ii) reconstruct a surface in three\ndimension from a sparse subsample without computing Delaunay triangulations,\n(iii) infer the persistent homology groups of compact sets from a sufficiently\ndense sample.

{"id": "1304.0664", "contents": "Title: Edge Contractions and Simplicial Homology Abstract: We study the effect of edge contractions on simplicial homology because these\ncontractions have turned to be useful in various applications involving\ntopology. It was observed previously that contracting edges that satisfy the so\ncalled link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional complexes, and\nhomotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation in\nall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\ncomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link\ncondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We\nprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and\n(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional\nhomology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the\n(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not\nintroduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,\nthough some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, the\nsurjection in relative homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relative\ntorsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link condition\nalone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and the\np-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology and\nrelative torsion are motivated by recent results on computing optimal\nhomologous chains, which state that such problems can be solved by linear\nprogramming if the complex has no relative torsion. Edge contractions that do\nnot introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts. \n\n"}

For this reason, it is impossible to formulate SPTs under\nGinzburg-Landau theory or probe SPTs via fractionalized bulk excitations and\ntopology-dependent ground state degeneracy. However, the partition functions\nfrom path integrals with various symmetry twists are the universal SPT\ninvariants defining topological probe responses, fully characterizing SPTs. In\nthis work, we use gauge fields to represent those symmetry twists in closed\nspacetimes of any dimensionality and arbitrary topology. This allows us to\nexpress the SPT invariants in terms of continuum field theory. We show that SPT\ninvariants of pure gauge actions describe the SPTs predicted by group\ncohomology, while the mixed gauge-gravity actions describe the\nbeyond-group-cohomology SPTs, recently observed by Kapustin. We find new\nexamples of mixed gauge-gravity actions for U(1) SPTs in 4+1D via mixing the\ngauge first Chern class with a gravitational Chern-Simons term, or viewed as a\n5+1D Wess-Zumino-Witten term with a Pontryagin class.

This enrichment uses a characterization of the laws of random variables\nin a probability space in terms of symmetries of the expectation. The laws of\nrandom variables are reinterpreted as invariants of the homotopy types of\ninfinity morphisms between certain homotopy algebras. The relevant category of\nhomotopy algebras is determined by the appropriate notion of independence for\nthe underlying probability theory. This theory will be both a natural\ngeneralization and an effective computational tool for the study of classical\nalgebraic probability spaces, while keeping the same central limit. This\narticle is focused on the commutative case, where the laws of random variables\nare also described in terms of certain affinely flat structures on the formal\nmoduli space of a naturally defined family attached to the given algebraic\nprobability space.

If\nno solution exists, the solver is expected to announce that no solution has\nbeen found. Owing to the complexity, type or difficulty of a constraint\nproblem, it is possible that the solver does not find a solution even though\none may exist. Thus, there may be false negatives, but there should never be\nfalse positives. Intuitively, the ability to find solutions can be considered a\nmeasure of solver's competence. We consider static constraint problems and\ntheir solvers. We do not consider dynamic constraint solvers, also known as\ndynamic geometry programs, in which specific geometric elements are moved,\ninteractively or along prescribed trajectories, while continually maintaining\nall stipulated constraints.

The book is\nessentially self-contained. Even if a few statements do not appear elsewhere\nand some proofs are slighlty different from the ones already available in the\nliterature, the monograph does not contain original results.\n  In the first part of the book we settle the fundamental definitions of the\ntheory, and we prove some (by now classical) results on low-dimensional bounded\ncohomology and on bounded cohomology of topological spaces.

Specifically, for each twisted modular operad $\\mathcal{P}$ (taking\nvalues in dg-vector spaces over a field $k$ of characteristic 0), there is a\ncertain sheaf $\\mathcal{F}$ associated with it on the moduli space of stable\nmetric graphs such that the Verdier dual sheaf $D\\mathcal{F}$ is associated\nwith the Feynman transform $F\\mathcal{P}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$.

For the proof, they define a notion of a lopsided dependency between\nthe events suitable for this framework. In this work, we strengthen this\nnotion, defining a novel directed notion of dependency and prove LLL for the\ncorresponding graph. We show that this graph can be strictly sparser (thus the\nsufficient condition for LLL weaker) compared with graphs that correspond to\nother extant lopsided versions of dependency. Thus, in a sense, we address the\nproblem \"find other simple local conditions for the constraints (in the\nvariable framework) that advantageously translate to some abstract lopsided\ncondition\" posed by Szegedy (2013).

Specifically, we transform each\ninstance of the time-varying graph into metric spaces, extract topological\nfeatures using persistent homology, and compare those features over time. We\nprovide a visualization that assists in time-varying graph exploration and\nhelps to identify patterns of behavior within the data. To validate our\napproach, we conduct several case studies on real world data sets and show how\nour method can find cyclic patterns, deviations from those patterns, and\none-time events in time-varying graphs. We also examine whether\npersistence-based similarity measure as a graph metric satisfies a set of\nwell-established, desirable properties for graph metrics. \n\n"}

Especially,\nsynthesized computed tomography (CT) data can provide X-ray attenuation map for\nradiation therapy planning. In this work, we propose a generic cross-modality\nsynthesis approach with the following targets: 1) synthesizing realistic\nlooking 3D images using unpaired training data, 2) ensuring consistent\nanatomical structures, which could be changed by geometric distortion in\ncross-modality synthesis and 3) improving volume segmentation by using\nsynthetic data for modalities with limited training samples.

The relation is mediated by the notion of boundary field theory:\nIsing models are boundary theories for pure gauge theory in one dimension\nhigher. Thus the Ising order/disorder operators are endpoints of Wilson/'t\nHooft defects of gauge theory. Symmetry breaking on low-energy states reflects\nthe multiplicity of topological boundary states. In the process we describe\nlattice theories as (extended) topological field theories with boundaries and\ndomain walls.

More precisely, under a coprimality condition on the\nsides of the rectangle, the number of independent sets of even and odd\ncardinality always differ by 1. In physics terms, this means looking at the\nhard-particle model on these grids at activity -1. This conjecture was recently\nproved by Jonsson.

We prove that the additive $\\chi_y$-genus which arises in\nthe motivic context satisfies the so-called ``stratified multiplicative\nproperty\", which shows how to compute the invariant of the source of a proper\nsurjective morphism from its values on various varieties that arise from the\nsingularities of the map. By considering morphisms to a curve, we obtain a\nHodge-theoretic analogue of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. We also study the\ncontribution of monodromy to the $\\chi_y$-genus of a smooth projective family,\nand prove an Atiyah-Meyer type formula for twisted $\\chi_y$-genera. This\nformula measures the deviation from multiplicativity of the $\\chi_y$-genus, and\nexpresses the correction terms as higher-genera associated to cohomology\nclasses of the quotient of the total period domain by the action of the\nmonodromy group. By making use of Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules, we\nalso obtain formulae of Atiyah-Meyer type for the corresponding Hirzebruch\ncharacteristic classes. \n\n"}

We prove that any invariant of a topological\nspace w.r.t. pseudo-homeomorphisms is an invariant of the fundamental group of\nthis space.
