The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star\nformation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and\nintracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation. The data also imply that ESO\n137-001 is in an active stage of transformation, accompanied by the build-up of\na central bulge and depletion of the ISM. \n\n"}

Objects with low X-ray to\noptical ratio escape even the deepest X-ray surveys performed so far. In a\nprevious study we presented a sample of candidates selected through optical\nvariability in the Chandra Deep Field South, where repeated optical\nobservations were performed for the STRESS supernova survey. We obtained new\noptical spectroscopy for a sample of variability selected candidates with the\nESO NTT telescope. We analysed the new spectra, together with those existing in\nthe literature and studied the distribution of the objects in U-B and B-V\ncolours, optical and X-ray luminosity, and variability amplitude. A large\nfraction (17/27) of the observed candidates are broad-line luminous AGNs,\nconfirming the efficiency of variability in detecting quasars. We detect: i)\nextended objects which would have escaped the colour selection and ii) objects\nof very low X-ray to optical ratio.

Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the\nGOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear\nin the underdense regions until z~3. These environmental variations are not\ncaused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but\nrather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to\nanother, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.\nAt all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250\nkm/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of \"downsizing\" (even\nin the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have\nmostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form\nat later times.

A\nprevious study of shearing boxes with zero net magnetic field performed with\nthe ZEUS code found that turbulence dies out for values of the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber, P_m = \\nu/\\eta, below P_m \\sim 1; for P_m \\gtrsim 1, time- and\nvolume-averaged stress levels increase with P_m. We repeat these experiments\nwith Athena and obtain consistent results.

Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust.

Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the\nnear-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to\nstudy the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for\nasymmetries. Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,\ntaking advantage of the \"cube\" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a\nlarge number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a \"lucky\nimaging\" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images\nover the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters.

We\ninvestigate the 5-35 um Spitzer IRS spectra of a sample of 13 group I sources\nand 20 group II sources. We focus on the continuum emission to study the\nunderlying disk geometry. We have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7]\ncontinuum flux ratios. The 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellar\nphotosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-IR emission\nproduced by the inner disk. We have compared our data to self-consistent\npassive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We\nconfirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between\ngroup I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small\ndust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and\n[13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources. Moreover, the [30/13.5] flux\nratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous.

We identify a total of 125 sources within the 5'x5' region\nimaged by IRAC. Of these sources 87 are detected in the R-band image and 51 are\ndetected in the 2MASS survey. The detailed physical properties of the sources\nare explored using a combination of near/mid-infrared color-color diagrams,\ngreybody fitting of SEDs and an online SED fitting tool that uses a library of\n2D radiation transfer based accretion models of young stellar objects with\ndisks. Ori I-2 shows clear evidence of triggered star formation with four young\nlow luminosity pre-main sequence stars embedded in the globule. At least two,\npossibly as many as four, additional low-mass PMS objects, were discovered in\nthe field which are probably part of the young sigma-Orionis cluster.

We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter\nVLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion\ndisk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust\nagainst calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization\nfraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of\nchanges in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.\nThe shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures\nthat are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry. The detection of\nperiodic variability in source polarization should not be significantly\naffected even if instrumental polarization terms cannot be calibrated out.

The\nrelevant dynamical properties of young stellar clusters are explored over a\nwide range of possible star formation environments using N-body simulations.\nMany realizations of equivalent initial conditions are used to produce robust\nstatistical descriptions of cluster evolution including the cluster bound\nfraction, radial probability distributions, as well as the distributions of\nclose encounter distances and velocities.

Planet\nformation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal\nmechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model.

We detected 17 RR Lyrae variables in\nF1 and 14 in F2. A 1-sigma upper limit of 6 RR Lyrae variables belonging to M32\nis inferred from these two fields alone.

The\ntransfer is effected by the galactic fountain -- cool clouds that are shot up\nfrom the plane to kiloparsec heights above the plane. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds. In external galaxies trails of HI behind individual\nclouds will not be detectable, although the integrated emission from all such\ntrails should be significant.

We use this empirical evidence to argue that a revision of\nlower Main Sequence stellar models, suggested from nearby stars, could\nsignificantly reduce the helium content inferred for the subpopulations of\nthose globular clusters. A simple formula based on empirically calibrated\nhomology relations is constructed, for an alternative estimate of DY/DZ in\nmultiple main sequences.

Nevertheless, tens of young main sequence B\nstars have been observed in an isotropic distribution close to it. Various\nmodels have been suggested for the formation of the B-stars closest to the MBH\n(<0.05 pc; the S-stars), typically involving the migration of these stars from\ntheir original birthplace to their currently observed position. Here we explore\nthe orbital phase space distribution of the B-stars throughout the central pc\nexpected from the various suggested models for the origin of the B-stars. We\nfind that most of these models have difficulties in explaining, by themselves,\nboth the population of the S-stars (<0.05 pc), and the population of the young\nB-stars further away (up to 0.5 pc). Most models grossly over-predict the\nnumber of B-stars up to 0.5 pc, given the observed number of S-stars. Such\nmodels include the intermediate-mass black hole assisted cluster inspiral\nscenario, Kozai-like perturbations by two disks, spiral density waves migration\nin a gaseous disk, and some of the eccentric disk instability models. We focus\non one of the other models, the massive perturber induced binary disruption,\nwhich is consistent with both the S-stars and the extended population of\nB-stars further away. For this model we use analytical arguments and N-body\nsimulations to provide further observational predictions.

These predictions include the radial distribution of the young\nB-stars, their eccentricity distribution and its dependence on distance from\nthe MBH (higher eccentricities at larger distances from the MBH), as well as\nless specific expectations regarding their mass function. \n\n"}

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

When applied to Venus, assuming that planet lacks plate tectonics and has\na dehydrated mantle with an elevated viscosity, the model shows that the dynamo\nshuts down or never operated. Our model predicts that at a fixed planet mass,\ndynamo history is sensitive to core size, but not to the initial inventory of\nlong-lived, heat-producing radionuclides. It predicts that rocky planets larger\nthan 2.5 Earth masses will not develop inner cores because the\ntemperature-pressure slope of the iron solidus becomes flatter than that of the\ncore adiabat. Instead, iron \"snow\" will condense near or at the top of these\ncores, and the net transfer of latent heat upwards will suppress convection and\na dynamo.

While some areas of astronomy (most notably\npulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of\nconsiderably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have\ncrossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have\nfound that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups\ncan differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be\nmistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We\nargue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric\nand barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is\nimperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1\nminute are required.

This provides\na ready tool for classifying the nature of star-disc systems based on infrared\nphotometry. In particular we demonstrate the distinct loci followed by discs\nthat undergo `uniform draining' (reduction in surface density by a spatially\nuniform factor) from those that clear from the inside out. We draw attention to\nthe absence of objects on this `draining locus' in those star forming regions\nwhere the 24um sensitivity would permit their detection, as compared with the\n~20 objects in these regions with colours suggestive of inner holes. We thus\nconclude that discs predominantly clear from the inside out. We also apply our\nclassification of the infrared two colour plane to stars of spectral type M3-M5\nin the IC 348 cluster and show that some of its members (dubbed `weak excess'\nsources by Muzerolle et al 2010) that had previously been assumed to be in a\nstate of clearing are instead likely to be optically thick discs in which the\ndust is well settled towards the mid-plane. Nevertheless, there are many discs\nin a state of partial clearing in IC 348, with their abundance (relative to the\ntotal population of disc bearing stars) being around four times higher than for\ncomparable stars in Taurus. However, the number of partially cleared discs\nrelative to the total number of late type stars is similarly low in both\nregions (10 and 20 % respectively). We therefore conclude that IC 348\nrepresents a more evolved version of the Taurus population (with more of its\ndiscs being highly settled or partially cleared) but that the timescale for\nclearing is similarly short (a few times 10^5 years) in both cases. \n\n"}

In the collapsing cloud, the\nfirst adiabatic core appears prior to the protostar formation. Reflecting the\nthermodynamics of the collapsing gas, the first core is much more massive than\nthe protostar. When the molecular cloud has no angular momentum, the first core\nfalls onto the protostar and disappears a few years after the protostar\nformation. On the other hand, when the molecular cloud has an angular momentum,\nthe first core does not disappear even after the protostar formation, and\ndirectly evolves into the circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. There\nare two paths for the formation of the circumstellar disk. When the initial\ncloud has a considerably small rotational energy, two nested disks appear just\nafter the protostar formation. During the early main accretion phase, the inner\ndisk increases its size and merges with the outer disk (i.e. first core) to\nform a single circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. On the other hand,\nwhen the molecular cloud has a rotational energy comparable to observations, a\nsingle Keplerian disk that corresponds to the first core already exists prior\nto the protostar formation. In such a cloud, the first core density gradually\nincreases, maintaining the Keplerian rotation and forms the protostar inside\nit. Thus, the protostar is born in the Keplerian disk. In other words, a\nmassive disk already exists before the protostar formation. In each case, the\nprotostar at its formation is already surrounded by a massive circumstellar\ndisk. The circumstellar disk is about 10-100 times more massive than the\nprotostar in the main accretion disk. Such disks are favourable sites for the\nformation of binary companions and gas-giant planets. \n\n"}

The X-ray properties of the source and the photometry\nof the candidate near-infrared counterparts are consistent with an accreting\nneutron star X-ray binary on the near-side of the Galactic bulge, where the 626\ns period is most likely indicative of the pulsar spin period.

Abstract: Naked singularities are hypothetical astrophysical objects, characterized by\na gravitational singularity without an event horizon. Penrose has proposed a\nconjecture, according to which there exists a cosmic censor who forbids the\noccurrence of naked singularities. Distinguishing between astrophysical black\nholes and naked singularities is a major challenge for present day\nobservational astronomy. A possibility of differentiating naked singularities\nfrom black holes is through the comparative study of thin accretion disks\nproperties around rotating naked singularities and Kerr-type black holes,\nrespectively. In the present paper, we consider accretion disks around rotating\nnaked singularities, obtained as solutions of the field equations in the\nEinstein-massless scalar field theory. A first major difference between\nrotating naked singularities and Kerr black holes is in the frame dragging\neffect, the angular velocity of a rotating naked singularity being inversely\nproportional to its spin parameter. Due to the differences in the exterior\ngeometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks are\ndifferent for these two classes of compact objects, consequently giving clear\nobservational signatures that could discriminate between black holes and naked\nsingularities. For specific values of the spin parameter and of the scalar\ncharge, the energy flux from the disk around a rotating naked singularity can\nexceed by several orders of magnitude the flux from the disk of a Kerr black\nhole. The conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation by\nrotating naked singularities is always higher than the conversion efficiency\nfor black holes. Thus, these observational signatures may provide the necessary\ntools from clearly distinguishing rotating naked singularities from Kerr-type\nblack holes. \n\n"}

Using reasonable values for future outer heliosphere boundary\nconditions, ENA fluxes are predicted for one possible source of ENAs coming\nfrom outside of the heliopause. The ENA production simulations use\nthree-dimensional MHD plasma models of the heliosphere that include a kinetic\ndescription of neutrals and a Lorentzian distribution for ions.

Fast\noutflows exceeding 8 km/s are present along almost horizontal stretches of the\nmagnetic field; in the outer half of the penumbra, we see opposite polarity\nflux indicating flux returning beneath the surface. The bulk of the penumbral\nbrightness is maintained by small-scale motions turning over on scales shorter\nthan the length of a typical penumbral filament. The resulting vertical rms\nvelocity at tau=1 is about half of that found in the quiet Sun. Radial outflows\nin the sunspot penumbra have two components. In the uppermost few 100 km, fast\noutflows are driven primarily through the horizontal component of the Lorentz\nforce, which is confined to narrow boundary layers beneath tau=1, while the\ncontribution from horizontal pressure gradients is reduced in comparison to\ngranulation as a consequence of anisotropy.

Here\nwe take the truncated disc/hot inner flow picture which can describe the\nspectral changes, and show that propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in\nthe hot flow can match the broad band power spectral properties seen in black\nhole binaries, i.e. give approximately band limited noise between a low and\nhigh frequency break. The low frequency break marks the viscous timescale at\nthe outer edge of the hot inner flow, which is the inner edge of the truncated\ndisc. The model also predicts the Lense-Thirring precession timescale of the\nhot flow, as this is set by the surface density of the flow which is self\nconsistently calculated from the propagating fluctuations. We show that this\nnaturally gives the observed relation between the low frequency break and QPO\nfrequency as the outer radius of the flow moves inwards, and that this model\npredicts many of the observed QPO properties such as correlation of coherence\nwith frequency, and of the recently discovered correlation of frequency with\nflux on short timescales.

This\nprediction provides a means to observationally distinguish accreted gas from\noutflow gas: the accreted gas will show large one-sided velocity offsets in\nabsorption line studies while radial/bi-conical outflows will not (except\npossibly in special polar projections).

Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young\nstars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of\ndisc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference\nbetween the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest\nneighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older\npopulation should appear more spread out.\n  To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low\nmass star forming regions.

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes.

The 680 identified bona-fide PMS stars show a bimodal age distribution,\nwith two roughly equally numerous populations peaked respectively at ~1 Myr,\nand ~20 Myr. We use the age and other physical properties of these PMS stars to\nstudy how star formation has proceeded across time and space in NGC 346. We\nfind no correlation between the locations of young and old PMS stars, nor do we\nfind a correspondence between the positions of young PMS stars and those of\nmassive OB stars of similar age. Furthermore, the mass distribution of stars\nwith similar age shows large variations throughout the region.

By introducing the\nMadelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the dynamics of the\nsystem in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic Euler\nequations. The non-relativistic and Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational\ncondensate can be described as a gas, whose density and pressure are related by\na barotropic equation of state. In the case of a condensate with quartic\nnon-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic with index one. In the\nframework of the Thomas-Fermi approximation the structure of the Newtonian\ngravitational condensate is described by the Lane-Emden equation, which can be\nexactly solved. The case of the rotating condensate is also discussed. General\nrelativistic configurations with quartic non-linearity are studied numerically\nwith both non-relativistic and relativistic equations of state, and the maximum\nmass of the stable configuration is determined. Condensates with particle\nmasses of the order of two neutron masses (Cooper pair) and scattering length\nof the order of 10-20 fm have maximum masses of the order of 2 M_sun, maximum\ncentral density of the order of 0.1-0.3 10^16 g/cm^3 and minimum radii in the\nrange of 10-20 km.

It is, however, known that the large frequency separation varies\nwith frequency in a second order effect.

The effective spatial resolution of the maps is $21\"$, corresponding\nto 0.04 pc at a distance of 400 pc. A recent 1.1 mm dust continuum map reveals\nthat the dense gas is concentrated in several thin filaments. We find that a\nfew dust filaments are located at the parts where $^{12}$CO ($J=1-0$) emission\ndrops sharply. Furthermore, the filaments have two-components with different\nvelocities. The velocity difference between the two-components is about 3 km\ns$^{-1}$, corresponding to a Mach number of 10, significantly larger than the\nlocal turbulent velocity in the cloud. These facts imply that the collision of\nthe two components (hereafter, the cloud-cloud collision) possibly contributed\nto the formation of these filaments. Since the two components appear to overlap\ntoward the filaments on the plane of the sky, the collision may have occurred\nalmost along the line of sight. Star formation in the L1641-N cluster was\nprobably triggered by such a collision. We also find several parsec-scale CO\nshells whose centers are close to either the L1641-N cluster or V 380 Ori\ncluster.

Spectroscopic observations which\nstarted about 2 months after the supernova explosion, highlight significant\ndifferences between SN 2009E and the prototypical SN 1987A.

The light curve of SN 2009E is less\nluminous than that of SN 1987A and the other members of this class, and the\nmaximum light curve peak is reached at a slightly later epoch than in SN 1987A.\nLate-time photometric observations suggest that SN 2009E ejected about 0.04\nsolar masses of 56Ni, which is the smallest 56Ni mass in our sample of\n1987A-like events. Modelling the observations with a radiation hydrodynamics\ncode, we infer for SN 2009E a kinetic plus thermal energy of about 0.6 foe, an\ninitial radius of ~7 x 10^12 cm and an ejected mass of ~19 solar masses.

The standard\nprocedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data and\nthus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which are\nusually subtle in low surface brightness systems. Taking advantage of the fact\nthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce\ndiscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the\nFourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of\nsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark\nmatter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. In addition to strong mass loss and\nrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation\nthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first\npericenter passage. These tidally induced bars persist for a few Gyr before\nbeing shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strong\nenough. We test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape of\nnearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the Milky Way. We detect inner bars in\nUrsa Minor, Sagittarius, LMC and possibly Carina. In addition, six out of\neleven studied dwarfs show elongated stellar distributions in the outer parts\nthat may signify transition to tidal tails.

This in turn implied that the\nneutrino driven wind is proton rich during its entire life, precluding\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis and the synthesis of Sr, Y, and Zr. This work\nrelied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a\nfree nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon\npotential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly\nalters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear\nsymmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton\nsingle-particle energies $\\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the\ncharged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given\nneutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\\nu_e+n\\rightarrow e^-+p$ is\nenhanced while $ \\bar{\\nu}_e+p\\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$\nvalue for these reactions is altered by $\\pm\\Delta U$, respectively. In the\nneutrino decoupling region, collisional broadening acts to enhance both $\\nu_e$\nand $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ cross-sections and RPA corrections decrease the $\\nu_e$\ncross-section and increase the $\\bar \\nu_e$ cross-section, but mean field\nshifts have a larger effect. Therefore, electron neutrinos decouple at lower\ntemperature than when the nucleons are assumed to be free and have lower\naverage energies. The change is large enough to allow for a reasonable period\nof time when the neutrino driven wind is predicted to be neutron rich. It is\nalso shown that the electron fraction in the wind is influenced by the nuclear\nsymmetry energy. \n\n"}

Comparison with\nobservations has shown that the strongest of these lines manifest themselves as\nnarrow components of helium and metal emission lines, while the weaker ones\ndecrease significantly the depth of photospheric absorption lines, although\nuntil now, this effect has been thought to be due to the emission continuum\nalone. The veiling by lines changes the depth of different photospheric lines\nto a very different degree even within a narrow spectral range.

Observed at 250 microns, they must be\ncold, T ~ 15 K, hence the name \"Herschel cold clouds\" (HCCs). From the observed\nrotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nGalactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal\nsphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii. There are so many HCCs that they will make\nup all the missing Halo mass density if there is spherical symmetry and their\naverage mass is of order 15,000 Mo. This compares well with the Jeans mass of\ncirca 40,000 Mo and puts forward that the HCCs are in fact Jeans clusters,\nconstituting all the Galactic dark matter and much of its missing baryons, a\nconclusion deduced before from a different field of the sky (Nieuwenhuizen,\nSchild and Gibson 2011). A preliminary analysis of the intensities yields that\nthe Jeans clusters themselves may consist of some billion MACHOs of a few dozen\nEarth masses. With a size of dozens of solar radii, they would mostly obscure\nstars in the LMC, SMC and towards the Galactic center, and may thus have been\noverlooked in microlensing. \n\n"}

This instability revealed a so-called 'mutual influence\neffect' in the protoplanetary disc, where the dynamics of the system were\ndetermined by the collisionless collective motion of a low-mass subdisc\ncomposed of primary solids.

Weak\n  Accretion with No Vertical Magnetic Flux Abstract: We use local numerical simulations to investigate the strength and nature of\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary\ndisks, where ambipolar diffusion is the dominant non-ideal MHD effect. The\nsimulations include vertical stratification and assume zero net vertical\nmagnetic flux. We employ a super time-stepping technique to ameliorate the\nCourant restriction on the diffusive time step. We find that in idealized\nstratified simulations, with a spatially constant ambipolar Elsasser number Am,\nturbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) behaves in a\nsimilar manner as in prior unstratified calculations. Turbulence dies away for\nAm < 1, and becomes progressively more vigorous as ambipolar diffusion is\ndecreased. Near-ideal MHD behavior is recovered for Am > 1000. In the\nintermediate regime (10 < Am < 1000) ambipolar diffusion leads to substantial\nincreases in both the period of the MRI dynamo cycle and the characteristic\nscales of magnetic field structures. To quantify the impact of ambipolar\nphysics on disk accretion, we run simulations at 30 AU and 100 AU that include\na vertical Am profile based upon far ultraviolet (FUV) ionized disk models.\nThese models develop a vertically layered structure analogous to the Ohmic dead\nzone that is present at smaller radii. We find that, although the levels of\nsurface turbulence can be strong (and consistent with constraints on turbulent\nline widths at these radii), the inferred accretion rates are at least an order\nof magnitude smaller than those observed in T Tauri stars. This discrepancy is\nvery likely due to the assumption of zero vertical magnetic field in our\nsimulations and suggests that vertical magnetic fields are essential for\nMRI-driven accretion in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. \n\n"}

One possible explanation is the increased difficulty of detecting\nthese haloes if most of the visible matter is lost at early evolutionary phases\nthrough galactic winds. In this work we study the current models of triggering\ngalactic winds in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) from supernovae, and study,\nbased on 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations, the correlation of the mass\nloss rates and important physical parameters as the dark matter halo mass and\nits radial profile, and the star formation rate. We find that the existence of\nwinds is ubiquitous, independent on the gravitational potential. Our\nsimulations revealed that the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) may play a\nmajor role on pushing matter out of these systems, even for very massive\nhaloes. The instability is responsible for 5 - 40% of the mass loss during the\nearly evolution of the galaxy, being less relevant at $t > 200$Myrs.

The interaction term $Q=bH_0\\rho_{\\rm\nde}^\\alpha\\rho_{\\rm dm}^{1-\\alpha}$ is adopted, which abandons the Hubble\nexpansion rate $H$ and involves both $\\rho_{\\rm de}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm dm}$.\nMoreover, the new initial condition for the agegraphic dark energy is used,\nwhich solves the problem of accommodating baryon matter and radiation in the\nmodel. The solution of the model can be given using an iterative algorithm. A\nconcrete example for the calculation of the model is given. Furthermore, the\nmodel is constrained by using the combined Planck data (Planck+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$)\nand the combined WMAP-9 data (WMAP+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$). Three typical cases are\nconsidered: (A) $Q=bH_0\\rho_{\\rm de}$, (B) $Q=bH_0\\sqrt{\\rho_{\\rm de}\\rho_{\\rm\ndm}}$, and (C) $Q=bH_0\\rho_{\\rm dm}$, which correspond to $\\alpha=1$, 1/2, and\n0, respectively. The departures of the models from the $\\Lambda$CDM model are\nmeasured by the $\\Delta$BIC and $\\Delta$AIC values. It is shown that the INADE\nmodel is better than the NADE model in the fit, and the INADE(A) model is the\nbest in fitting data among the three cases. \n\n"}

When we start\nwith any near-equilibrium state, we find that the cloud's internal velocity\nalso remains subsonic for an extended period, in agreement with observations.\nHowever, the velocity becomes supersonic shortly before the star forms.\nConsequently, the accretion rate building up the protostar is much greater than\nthe benchmark value c_s^3/G, where c_s is the sound speed in the dense core.\nThis accretion spike would generate a higher luminosity than those seen in even\nthe most embedded young stars. Moreover, we find that the region of supersonic\ninfall surrounding the protostar races out to engulf much of the cloud, again\nin violation of the observations, which show infall to be spatially confined.\nSimilar problematic results have been obtained by all other hydrodynamic\nsimulations to date, regardless of the specific infall geometry or boundary\nconditions adopted.

Abstract: We present a catalog of 422 galaxies with published measurements of their\nglobular cluster (GC) populations. Of these, 248 are E galaxies, 93 are S0\ngalaxies, and 81 are spirals or irregulars. Among various correlations of the\ntotal number of GCs with other global galaxy properties, we find that N_GC\ncorrelates well though nonlinearly with the dynamical mass of the galaxy bulge\nM_dyn = 4 \\sigma_e^2 R_e /G, where \\sigma_e is the central velocity dispersion\nand R_e the effective radius of the galaxy light profile. We also present\nupdated versions of the GC specific frequency S_N and specific mass S_M versus\nhost galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass. These graphs exhibit the previously\nknown U-shape: highest S_N or S_M values occur for either dwarfs or\nsupergiants, but in the midrange of galaxy size (10^9 - 10^10 L_Sun) the GC\nnumbers fall along a well defined baseline value of S_N ~ 1 or S_M ~ 0.1,\nsimilar among all galaxy types. Along with other recent discussions, we suggest\nthat this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematically\ninhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, but\nwhich had its minimum effect for intermediate masses. Our results strongly\nreinforce recent proposals that GC formation efficiency appears to be most\nnearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass M_halo. The mean \"absolute\"\nefficiency ratio for GC formation that we derive from the catalog data is\nM_GCS/M_halo = 6 \\times 10^-5. We suggest that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter\naround this mean value may arise in part because of differences in the relative\ntiming of GC formation versus field-star formation. Finally, we find that an\nexcellent empirical predictor of total GC population for galaxies of all\nluminosities is N_GC \\sim (R_e \\sigma_e)^1.3$, a result consistent with\nFundamental Plane scaling relations. \n\n"}

Over the last years, twisted-torus geometries\nhave been considered both in Newtonian and general-relativistic equilibrium\nmodels, as they represent a potentially good description of neutron star\ninteriors. All of these works have found an apparent intrinsic limitation to\ngeometries that are poloidal-field-dominated, with a toroidal-to-poloidal\nenergy ratio inside the star that are <10%, unless surface currents are\nincluded and magnetic fields are allowed to be discontinuous. This limitation\nis in stark contrast with the general expectation that much higher toroidal\nfields should be present in the stellar interior and casts doubt about the\nstability and hence realism of these configurations. We here discuss how to\novercome this limitation by adopting a new prescription for the azimuthal\ncurrents that leads to magnetized equilibria where the toroidal-to-total\nmagnetic-field energy ratio can be as high as 90%, thus including geometries\nthat are toroidal-field-dominated. Moreover, our results show that for a fixed\nexterior magnetic-field strength, a higher toroidal-field energy implies a much\nhigher total magnetic energy stored in the star, with a potentially strong\nimpact on the expected electromagnetic and gravitational-wave emission from\nhighly magnetized neutron stars. \n\n"}

Molecular clouds provide targets\nfor CR protons to produce pionic gamma rays and ionization, but those same\nlosses may shield the cloud interiors. In the densest molecular clouds, gamma\nrays and Al-26 decay can provide ionization, at rates up to those in Milky Way\nmolecular clouds.

State-of-the-art NLTE models consider opacities of\nspecies up to trans-iron elements and provide reliable synthetic\nstellar-atmosphere spectra to compare with observation.\n  We establish a database of theoretical spectra of stellar flux standards that\nare easily accessible via a web interface.\n  In the framework of the Virtual Observatory, the German Astrophysical Virtual\nObservatory developed the registered service TheoSSA. It provides easy access\nto stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and is intended to ingest SEDs\ncalculated by any model-atmosphere code. In case of the DA white dwarf G\n191-B2B, we demonstrate that the model reproduces not only its overall\ncontinuum shape but also the numerous metal lines exhibited in its ultraviolet\nspectrum.\n  TheoSSA is in operation and contains presently a variety of SEDs for DA white\ndwarfs. It will be extended in the near future and can host SEDs of all primary\nand secondary flux standards. The spectral analysis of G 191-B2B has shown that\nour hydrostatic models reproduce the observations best at an effective\ntemperature of 60000 +/- 2000K and a surface gravity of log g = 7.60 +/- 0.05.\nWe newly identified Fe VI, Ni VI, and Zn IV lines.

The binary fractions in these two clusters are characterized by\nopposite trends in their radial profiles.

Strong pressure-broadened Na and K absorption signatures are also\nexcluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. We compare our combined\nbroadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmospheric\nmodels, though none are satisfactory fits. However, we do find that the full\ntransmission spectrum can be described by models which include significant\nopacity from aerosols: including Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, tholin\nhaze, and settling dust profiles. The transmission spectrum follows an\neffective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with the\nslope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphaT =\n-3528+/-660 K, where T is the atmospheric temperature. Rayleigh scattering\n(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminator\ntemperatures near 900 K. Sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equally\ngood fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,\nand we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol.

In a careful and homogeneous\nanalysis of the \"First stars\" sample (eighty per cent of the stars have a\nmetallicity [Fe/H]=-3.1$\\pm$0.4), it has been shown that at this metallicity\n[Eu/Ba] is constant, and therefore the Eu-rich stars (generally called\n\"r-rich\") are also Ba-rich. The very large variation of [Ba/Fe] (existence of\n\"r-poor\" and \"r-rich\" stars) induces that the early matter was not perfectly\nmixed. On the other hand, the distribution of the values of [Sr/Ba] vs. [Ba/Fe]\nappears with well defined upper and lower envelopes. No star was found with\n[Sr/Ba]<-0.5 and the scatter of [Sr/Ba] increases regularly when [Ba/Fe]\ndecreases.

For a same quantity of accreted matter, this additional Sr\nproduction would barely affect the r-rich matter (which already contains an\nimportant quantity of Sr) but would change significantly the composition of the\nr-poor matter.

The diffusion equation for\nCompton scattering is coupled to a single-temperature pair gas and an exact\n(trans-relativistic) cyclo-synchrotron photon source. We find that the photon\nspectrum develops a quasi-thermal peak, with a power-law slope below it that is\ncharacteristic of gamma-ray bursts. The formation of a thermal high-frequency\nspectrum is checked using the full kinetic equations at l ~ 10^3.

Baryon rest mass carries less than ~ 10^{-5} of the energy\nflux at jet breakout inside ~ 10^{12} cm from the engine, with most carried by\nthe magnetic field. 2. This degree of baryon purity points to the presence of\nan event horizon in the engine, and neutrons play a negligible role in the\nprompt emission mechanism. 3.

During this\nperiod, an elevated level of the M87 flux is reported at VHE gamma rays. We\ndetected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolved\njet base (radio core) with VERA at 22 and 43GHz coincident with the VHE\nactivity. Meanwhile, we confirmed with EVN at 5GHz that HST-1 (an alternative\ngamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its flux\ndensity and structure. These results in the radio bands strongly suggest that\nthe VHE gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or\n56 Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. We further\nconducted VERA astrometry for the M87 core during the flaring period, and\ndetected core shifts between 22 and 43GHz. We also discovered a clear\nfrequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5GHz; the\nradio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a larger\namplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at\n22 and 43GHz. This indicates that a new radio-emitting component was created\nnear the black hole in the period of the VHE event, and then propagated outward\nwith progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. By combining these results,\nwe estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived a\nsub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. This value is significantly slower than\nthe super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during the\nprominent VHE flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger VHE activity\ncan be associated with the production of the higher Lorentz factor jet. \n\n"}

The other half of the\nfibrils rise with distance from the sunspot until they leave the Ca II IR\nformation height. Many of the fibrils show a central dark core and two lateral\nbrightenings as seen in line-core intensity images.

Secular dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital\ncommensurability having negligible effect. Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD.

Here, we turn to\nthe quintessential hazy world -- Titan -- to clarify how high altitude hazes\ninfluence transit spectra. We use solar occultation observations of Titan's\natmosphere from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) aboard\nNASA's Cassini spacecraft to generate transit spectra. Data span 0.88-5 microns\nat a resolution of 12-18 nm, with uncertainties typically smaller than 1%. Our\napproach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transit\nradius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering,\nrefraction, and gas absorption. We use a simple model of haze extinction to\nexplore how Titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. Our spectra show strong\nmethane absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. Most\nimportantly, the data demonstrate that high altitude hazes can severely limit\nthe atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations to\npressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength.

Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully\nquantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star\ncluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power. We would have to\nresolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the\nsame time follow the evolution of a parsec-size cloud for a million years.\nCurrent computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving\nthis. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS)\nmodel for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and\nreproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of\nreal jets, with ~ 1000 times lower resolution than would be required without\nSGS model.

Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small.

Two competing hypotheses suggest that the\nplanets migrated either through interaction with the protoplanetary disk during\ntheir formation, or by disk-free mechanisms such as gravitational interactions\nwith a third body. Observations of eccentricities and spin-orbit misalignments\nof hot Jupiter systems have been unable to differentiate between the two\nhypotheses. In the present work, we suggest that chemical depletions in hot\nJupiter atmospheres might be able to constrain their migration mechanisms. We\nfind that sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances in Jovian-mass hot Jupiters\naround Sun-like stars are hard to explain by disk migration. Instead, such\nabundances are more readily explained by giant planets forming at large orbital\nseparations, either by core accretion or gravitational instability, and\nmigrating to close-in orbits via disk-free mechanisms involving dynamical\nencounters. Such planets also contain solar or super-solar C/O ratios.

We also speculate on how the\nquantity changes with time. Because of dark-matter and baryonic collapse\nprocesses, it likely decreases with time, i.e.\\ information sinks dominate\nsources. But sources of new random information do exist; e.g., a central black\nhole with an accretion disk and jets could in principle broadcast small-scale\nquantum fluctuations over a substantial portion of a galaxy.\n  A speculative example of how this concept might be useful is in\ndifferentiating between warm (WDM) and cold (CDM) dark matter. With WDM, the\ninitial patch that formed the Milky Way would have had few features, making the\npresent high degree of structure a curiosity. The primordial patch would have\nhad only several billion independent information-carrying `pixels' if the WDM\nparticle had a mass of 1 keV. This number of `pixels' is much less than even\nthe number of stars in the Milky Way. If the dark matter is proven to be warm,\nthe high degree of structure in the Milky Way could have arisen in two ways:\n(1) from a high sensitivity to initial conditions, like an intricate fractal\narising from a relatively simple computer code; or (2) from random information\ngenerated after the galaxy formed, i.e.\\ not entirely deterministically from\nthe initial conditions. \n\n"}

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,\nplanets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.\nCurrently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal\nphotoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The\ndistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much\nlonger periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of\nstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart.

Our approach relies on an\nADM formulation based on the hypersurfaces where the underlying scalar field is\nuniform. The advantage of this approach is that it can describe in the same\nlanguage and in a minimal way a vast number of existing models, such as\nquintessence models, $F(R)$ theories, scalar tensor theories, their Horndeski\nextensions and beyond. It also naturally includes Horava-Lifshitz theories. As\nsummarized in this review, our approach provides a unified treatment of the\nlinear cosmological perturbations about a FLRW universe, obtained by a\nsystematic expansion of our general action up to quadratic order. This shows\nthat the behaviour of these linear perturbations is generically characterized\nby five time-dependent functions. We derive the full equations of motion in the\nNewtonian gauge, and obtain in particular the equation of state for dark energy\nperturbations, in the Horndeski case, in terms of these functions. Our unifying\ndescription thus provides the simplest and most systematic way to confront\ntheoretical models with current and future cosmological observations. \n\n"}

Because the ionization\ndegree in star forming clouds is extremely low, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation work strongly\nduring protostellar collapse. These effects have significant impacts in the\nearly phase of star formation as they redistribute magnetic flux and suppress\nangular momentum transport by magnetic fields. We perform three-dimensional\nnested-grid radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations including Ohmic\ndissipation and ambipolar diffusion. Without these effects, magnetic fields\ntransport angular momentum so efficiently that no rotationally supported disk\nis formed even after the second collapse. Ohmic dissipation works only in a\nrelatively high density region within the first core and suppresses angular\nmomentum transport, enabling formation of a very small rotationally supported\ndisk after the second collapse. With both Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar\ndiffusion, these effects work effectively in almost the entire region within\nthe first core and significant magnetic flux loss occurs. As a result, a\nrotationally supported disk is formed even before a protostellar core forms.\nThe size of the disk is still small, about 5 AU at the end of the first core\nphase, but this disk will grow later as gas accretion continues. Thus the\nnon-ideal MHD effects can resolve the so-called magnetic braking catastrophe\nwhile maintaining the disk size small in the early phase, which is implied from\nrecent interferometric observations. \n\n"}

Full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutions\nvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. Global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,\nrelative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the sky\nmodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. For polarization, the model includes\nCMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. These models provide excellent\nfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK\nover 93% of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional\nerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. The main limitations of\nthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among the\nspinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observations\nfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. The\nmain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies are\nuncertainties in the 545 and 857 GHz calibration and zero-points. For\npolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the\n100-353 GHz bands on large angular scales in the form of\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digital\nconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expected\nto improve in the near future. \n\n"}

Among the publicly available codes, the model input files\nare heterogeneous, making the creation of multiple models tedious. An enhanced\nmethod of creating model files and a method to easily create multiple models,\nmay increase the number of comparison studies. HydraLens simplifies the\ncreation of model files for four strong gravitational lens model software\npackages, including Lenstool, Gravlens/Lensmodel, glafic and PixeLens, using a\ncustom designed GUI for each of the four codes that simplifies the entry of the\nmodel for each of these codes, obviating the need for user manuals to set the\nvalues of the many flags and in each data field. HydraLens is designed in a\nmodular fashion, which simplifies the addition of other strong gravitational\nlens codes in the future. HydraLens can also translate a model generated for\nany of these four software packages into any of the other three. Models created\nusing HydraLens may require slight modifications, since some information may be\nlost in the translation process. However the computer generated model greatly\nsimplifies the process of developing multiple lens models.

In this\nwork, we analyze its transit signal and the radial velocity data obtained with\nthe Calar Alto Fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph (CAFE). By simultaneously\nmodeling both datasets, we obtain the orbital and physical properties of the\nsystem. According to our results, Kepler-447b is a Jupiter-mass planet\n($M_p=1.37^{+0.48}_{-0.46}~M_{\\rm Jup}$), with an estimated radius of\n$R_p=1.65^{+0.59}_{-0.56}~R_{\\rm Jup}$ (uncertainties provided in this work are\n$3\\sigma$ unless specified). This translates into a sub-Jupiter density. The\nplanet revolves every $\\sim7.8$ days in a slightly eccentric orbit\n($e=0.123^{+0.037}_{-0.036}$) around a G8V star with detected activity in the\nKepler light curve. Kepler-447b transits its host with a large impact parameter\n($b=1.076^{+0.112}_{-0.086}$), being one of the few planetary grazing transits\nconfirmed so far and the first in the Kepler large crop of exoplanets. We\nestimate that only around 20% of the projected planet disk occults the stellar\ndisk. The relatively large uncertainties in the planet radius are due to the\nlarge impact parameter and short duration of the transit. Planets with such an\nextremely large impact parameter can be used to detect and analyze interesting\nconfigurations such as additional perturbing bodies, stellar pulsations,\nrotation of a non-spherical planet, or polar spot-crossing events. All these\nscenarios would periodically modify the transit properties (depth, duration,\nand time of mid-transit), what could be detectable with sufficient accurate\nphotometry. Short-cadence photometric data (at the 1 minute level) would help\nin the search for these exotic configurations in grazing planetary transits\nlike that of Kepler-447b. \n\n"}

We find that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around 12\nmutual Hill radii, when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted\nfor. In comparison, dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing\nrequired for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability for as\nlong as a billion years is, ~10 if all orbits are circular and coplanar, and\n~12 if planetary orbits have eccentricities ~0.02 (a value suggested by studies\nof planet transit-time-variations). This apparent coincidence, between the\nobserved spacing and the theoretical stability threshold, leads us to propose\nthat typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most,\nexcept for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared\ndown to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and\nlarger spacings. So while the high multiple systems (five or more transiting\nplanets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double\nplanetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the\ndescendants of more closely packed high multiple systems.

We report line observations of the HCO+ and H13CO+\nmolecular ions and the first detection of SO+, N2H+, and (tentatively) H3O+ in\nthis source. SO+ and H3O+ have not been detected before in CSEs around evolved\nstars.

Except for H3O+, all the molecular ions detected in this work\ndisplay emission lines with broad profiles (FWHM 50-90 km/s), which indicates\nthat these ions are abundant in the fast bipolar outflow of OH 231.8. The\nnarrow profile (FWHM 14 km/s) and high critical densities (>1e6cm-3 ) of the\nH3O+ transitions observed are consistent with this ion arising from denser,\ninner (and presumably warmer) layers of the fossil remnant of the slow AGB CSE\nat the core of the nebula. From rotational diagram analysis, we deduce\nexcitation temperatures of Tex 10-20 K for all ions except for H3O+, which is\nmost consistent with Tex 100 K. Although uncertain, the higher excitation\ntemperature suspected for H3O+ is similar to that recently found for H2O and a\nfew other molecules, which selectively trace a previously unidentified, warm\nnebular component.The column densities of the molecular ions reported here are\nin the range Ntot [1-8]x1e13 cm-2, leading to beam-averaged fractional\nabundances relative to H2 of X(HCO+) 1e-8, X(H13CO+) 2e-9, X(SO+) 4e-9, X(N2H+)\n2e-9, and X(H3O+) 7e-9 cm-2.

The\nprotostellar accretion in our models is time-variable, thanks to the nonlinear\ninteraction between different spiral modes in the gravitationally unstable\ndisk, and can undergo episodic bursts when fragments migrate onto the star\nowing to the gravitational interaction with other fragments or spiral arms.\nMost bursts occur in the partly embedded Class I phase, with a smaller fraction\ntaking place in the deeply embedded Class 0 phase and a few possible bursts in\nthe optically visible Class II phase.

Here we analyze\nKepler-12b and Kepler-41b atmosphere based on their Kepler phase curve, while\nthe analysis of Kepler-7b was presented elsewhere. The model we used\nefficiently computes reflection and thermal emission contributions to the phase\ncurve, including inhomogeneous atmospheric reflection due to longitudinally\nvarying cloud coverage. We confirm Kepler-12b and Kepler-41b show a westward\nphase shift between the brightest region on the planetary surface and the\nsubstellar point, similar to Kepler-7b. We find that reflective clouds located\non the west side of the substellar point can explain the phase shift.

Therefore it is likely to be present also in planetary\nphase curves that do not allow a direct view of the planetary atmosphere as\nthey contain additional orbital processes. We discuss the implications of a\nbright-spot shift on the analysis of phase curves where both atmospheric and\ngravitational processes appear.

Previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannot\nexplain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and high\ncontrast of the spiral arms in observations. We have carried out three\ndimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks\nexcited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the\npitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be\nexplained by the non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a\ntertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive\nplanet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have\nlarger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in\nthe azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in\nthe outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have\nsignificant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk\natmosphere. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer\ncalculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably more\nprominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3-D hydrodynamical models than\nimages based on 2-D models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium,\nindicating the need to model observations with full 3-D hydrodynamics. Overall,\ncompanion-induced spiral arms not only pinpoint the companion's position but\nalso provide three independent ways (pitch angle, separation between two arms,\nand contrast of arms) to constrain the companion's mass. \n\n"}

Single main-sequence stars typically have masses estimated\nfrom evolutionary tracks, which generally provide accurate results due to their\nextensive empirical calibration.

The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target\nfor such a study, as its components stand at the L/T transition and show high\nlevels of variability.

We have performed\nhydrodynamic simulations of an asymptotic giant branch star interacting with\ncompanions with a range of masses in orbits with a range of initial\neccentricities and periastron separations.

One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,\nrequiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of\nlight species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain\naxion-driven inflation.

This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions.

The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside.

The gas surface density near the integral-shaped filament (ISF) is\nwell represented by a power law, Sigma(b)=72 Msun/pc^2(b/pc)^{-5/8} for our\nentire range, 0.05<b/pc<8.5, of distance from the filament ridge. Essentially\nall protostars lie on the ISF or other filament ridges, while almost all\npre-main-sequence stars do not. Combined with the fact that protostars move <1\nkms relative to the filaments while stars move several times faster, this\nimplies that protostellar accretion is terminated by a slingshot ejection from\nthe filaments. The ISF is the 3rd in a series of star bursts that are\nprogressively moving south, with separations of a few Myr in time and 3 pc in\nspace. This, combined with the filament's observed undulations (spatial and\nvelocity), suggests that repeated propagation of transverse waves thru the\nfilament is progressively digesting the material that formerly connected Orion\nA and B into stars in discrete episodes. We construct an axially symmetric gas\ndensity profile rho(r)=16 Msun/pc^3(r/pc)^{-13/8}. The model implies that the\nobserved magnetic fields are supercritical on scales of the observed\nundulations, suggesting that the filament's transverse waves are magnetically\ninduced. Because the magnetic fields are subcritical on scales of the filament\non larger scales, the system as a whole is relatively stable and long lived.\nProtostellar ejection occurs because the gas accelerates away from the\nprotostars, not the other way around. The model also implies that the ISF is\nkinematically young, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. The\nsouthern filament has a broken power law, which matches the ISF profile for\n2.5<b/pc<8.5, but is shallower closer in. It is also kinematically older than\nthe ISF. \n\n"}

Globular clusters are the best sites to\nexamine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership\nin the cluster and to identify the evolutionary state of each star. In 72 hours\nof Keck/DEIMOS exposures in 25 clusters, we found four Li-rich RGB and two\nLi-rich AGB stars. There were 1696 RGB and 125 AGB stars with measurements or\nupper limits consistent with normal abundances of Li. Hence, the frequency of\nLi-richness in globular clusters is (0.2 +/- 0.1)% for the RGB, (1.6 +/- 1.1)%\nfor the AGB, and (0.3 +/- 0.1)% for all giants. Because the Li-rich RGB stars\nare on the lower RGB, Li self-generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the\nluminosity function bump or He core flash cannot explain these four lower RGB\nstars. We propose the following origin for Li enrichment: (1) All luminous\ngiants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash.

We combine stellar kinematics in the central regions with\nthe dynamics of 612 globular clusters out to 200 kpc and satellite galaxies\nextending to scales comparable with the virial radius. Using a spherical Jeans\nanalysis, we are able to disentangle the mass contributions from the dark and\nbaryonic components and set constraints on the structure of each.

We infer a\nstellar mass-to-light ratio $\\Upsilon_{\\star,v} = 6.9 \\pm 0.1$ -- consistent\nwith a Salpeter-like IMF -- and a core radius $r_c = 67 \\pm 20$ kpc.

Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of\nbinary systems among the CEMP-s stars, which exhibit strong enhancements of\nneutron-capture elements associated with the s-process. This allows us to test\nwhether local mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary and sufficient\nto explain their dramatic carbon excesses. Eighteen of the 22 stars exhibit\nclear orbital motion, yielding a binary frequency of 82+-10%, while four stars\nappear to be single (18+-10%). We thus confirm that the binary frequency of\nCEMP-s stars is much higher than for normal metal-poor giants, but not 100% as\npreviously claimed. Secure orbits are determined for 11 of the binaries and\nprovisional orbits for six long-period systems (P > 3,000 days), and orbital\ncircularisation time scales are discussed. The conventional scenario of local\nmass transfer from a former AGB binary companion does appear to account for the\nchemical composition of most CEMP-s stars. However, the excess of C and\ns-process elements in some single CEMP-s stars was apparently transferred to\ntheir natal clouds by an external (distant) source. This finding has important\nimplications for our understanding of carbon enrichment in the early Galactic\nhalo and some high-redshift DLA systems, and of the mass loss from extremely\nmetal-poor AGB stars.

In particular, the\nconditions for having an orbital flip, where the inner orbit switches between\nprograde and retrograde with respect to the outer orbit and the associated\nextremely high eccentricities during the switch, can be modified significantly.\nThe failure of DA can arise for a relatively strong perturber where the mass of\nthe tertiary is considerable compared to the total mass of the inner binary.\nThis issue can be relevant for astrophysical systems such as stellar triples,\nplanets in stellar binaries, stellar-mass binaries orbiting massive black holes\nand moons of the planets perturbed by the Sun.

The intrinsic shapes of\n  low-luminosity galaxies in the core of the Virgo cluster, and a comparison\n  with the Local Group Abstract: (Abridged) We investigate the intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in\nthe central 300 kpc of the Virgo cluster using deep imaging obtained as part of\nthe NGVS. We build a sample of nearly 300 red-sequence cluster members in the\nyet unexplored $-14 < M_{g} < -8$ magnitude range. The observed distribution of\napparent axis ratios is then fit by families of triaxial models with\nnormally-distributed intrinsic ellipticities and triaxialities. We develop a\nBayesian framework to explore the posterior distribution of the model\nparameters, which allows us to work directly on discrete data, and to account\nfor individual, surface brightness-dependent axis ratio uncertainties. For this\npopulation we infer a mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.43, and a mean triaxiality\nT=0.16. This implies that faint Virgo galaxies are best described as a family\nof thick, nearly oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57.\nWe additionally attempt a study of the intrinsic shapes of Local Group\nsatellites of similar luminosities. For the LG population we infer a slightly\nlarger mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.51, and the paucity of objects with round\napparent shapes translates into more triaxial mean shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. We\nfinally compare the intrinsic shapes of NGVS low-mass galaxies with samples of\nmore massive quiescent systems, and with field, star-forming galaxies of\nsimilar luminosities. We find that the intrinsic flattening in this\nlow-luminosity regime is almost independent of the environment in which the\ngalaxy resides--but there is a hint that objects may be slightly rounder in\ndenser environments. The comparable flattening distributions of low-luminosity\ngalaxies that have experienced very different degrees of environmental effects\nsuggests that internal processes are the main drivers of galaxy structure at\nlow masses--with external mechanisms playing a secondary role. \n\n"}

Observations indicate that the\n$z=0$ stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in\nstellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\\lesssim$ 0.2 dex) with little dependence on\nhalo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body\nsimulations with observational constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that\nat the group and cluster scale ($M_{\\rm vir}>10^{14}{M_\\odot}$) the scatter due\npurely to hierarchical assembly is $\\approx0.16$ dex, which is comparable to\nrecent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since\n$z\\approx2$ is driven largely by in-situ growth. We include a model for the\nin-situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this\ngrowth channel of $0.2$ dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass\nthat is consistent with observations from $10^{12}{M_\\odot}<M_{\\rm\nvir}<10^{14.75}{M_\\odot}$. The approximately constant scatter across a wide\nrange of halo masses at $z=0$ thus appears to be a coincidence as it is\ndetermined largely by in-situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly\nat high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation\ncan provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process. \n\n"}

If the energy scale of inflation is as high as the GUT scale,\ninflationary quantum fluctuations of the Higgs field can easily destabilize the\nstandard electroweak vacuum and produce a lot of AdS domains. This\ndestabilization during inflation can be avoided if a relatively large\nnonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling is introduced. Such\ncouplings generate a large effective mass term for the Higgs, which can raise\nthe effective Higgs potential and suppress the vacuum fluctuation of the Higgs\nfield. After primordial inflation, however, such effective masses drops rapidly\nand the nonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling can cause large\nfluctuations of the Higgs field to be generated via parametric resonance, thus\nproducing AdS domains in the preheating stage. Furthermore, thermal\nfluctuations of the Higgs field cannot be neglected in the proceeding reheating\nepoch. We discuss the Higgs vacuum fluctuations during inflation, preheating,\nand reheating, and show that the Higgs metastability problem is severe unless\nthe energy scale of the inflaton potential is much lower than the GUT scale. \n\n"}

Despite their\nimportance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for\nthe driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into\nthe nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst\ngalaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays injected by supernovae,\nand specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of\ncosmic rays along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects\ncan have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors\ndepending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the cosmic ray streaming\ninstability, cosmic rays propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on\nself-excited Alfven waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to\nthe streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as the\nturbulent damping, the cosmic ray coupling to the gas is weaker and their\neffective propagation speed faster than the Alfven speed. Alternatively, cosmic\nrays could scatter from \"extrinsic turbulence\" that is driven by another\nmechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfvenic cosmic\nray streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays\nstream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered\nmagnetic fields and, in the process, accelerate more tenuous gas away from the\ngalaxy. For cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the\nobservational constraints, cosmic rays reduce the galactic star formation rates\nand significantly aid in launching galactic winds. \n\n"}

To do this, however, also the same parameters of its host star are\nneeded. By using spectroscopy, I participated in TRANSITS, an RV follow-up\nprogram of Kepler Objects of Interest.

I also inspected the behavior of SOPHIE/OHP spectra for\ninstrumental effects which can affect the measure of the stellar parameters.\nFrom a different perspective, I studied Kepler-117, a multi-planetary system\nwhich presents Transit Timing Variations (TTV). A specific approach was\ndeveloped in order to realize a simultaneous fit of transits, RV, and TTV, used\nto measure the mass of the lightest planet of the system, which was poorly\nconstrained by RV alone.

In this process, rotational energy of the magnetar is radiated via\nmagnetic dipole radiation and heats the supernova ejecta. However, if magnetars\nare highly distorted in their geometric shape, rotational energy is mainly lost\nas gravitational wave radiation and thus such magnetars cannot power SLSNe. By\nsimply comparing electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission timescales, we\nconstrain upper limits to the ellipticity of magnetars by assuming that they\npower the observed SLSNe. We find that their ellipticity typically needs to be\nless than about a few 1e-3. This indicates that the toroidal magnetic field\nstrengths in these magnetars are typically less than a few 1e16 G so that their\ndistortions remain small. Because light-curve modelling of SLSNe shows that\ntheir dipole magnetic field strengths are of the order of 1e14 G, the ratio of\npoloidal to toroidal magnetic field strengths is found to be larger than ~ 0.01\nin magnetars powering SLSNe. \n\n"}

In this paper we investigate a\nsample of 29 well-characterized brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, for which\nHerschel far-infrared fluxes as well as (sub)-mm fluxes are available. We have\nmeasured new Herschel PACS fluxes for 11 objects and complement these with\n(sub)-mm data and Herschel fluxes from the literature. We analyze their\nspectral energy distributions in comparison with results from radiative\ntransfer modeling. Fluxes in the far-infrared are strongly affected by the\nshape and temperature of the disk (and hence stellar luminosity), whereas the\n(sub)-mm fluxes mostly depend on disk mass. Nevertheless, there is a clear\ncorrelation between far-infrared and (sub)-mm fluxes. We argue that the link\nresults from the combination of the stellar mass-luminosity relation and a\nscaling between disk mass and stellar mass. We find strong evidence of dust\nsettling to the disk midplane. The spectral slopes between near- and\nfar-infrared are mostly between $-0.5$ and $-1.2$ in our sample, comparable to\nmore massive T Tauri stars, which may imply that the disk shapes are similar as\nwell, though highly-flared disks are rare among brown dwarfs.

We perform ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations adopting four\nmodels that could account for the formation of such structures. In the first\ntwo models striations are created by velocity gradients between ambient,\nparallel streamlines along magnetic field lines.

Finally, in the fourth model striations are formed from the nonlinear\ncoupling of MHD waves due to density inhomogeneities.

Filtering is frequently used to\nminimize the impact of low frequency noise, atmospheric contributions and/or\nscan synchronous signals on the resulting maps. In this work we explicitly\nconstruct a general filtering operator, which can unambiguously remove any set\nof unwanted modes in the data, and then amend the map-making procedure in order\nto incorporate and correct for it. We show that such an approach is\nmathematically equivalent to the solution of a problem in which the sky signal\nand unwanted modes are estimated simultaneously and the latter are marginalized\nover. We investigate the conditions under which this amended map-making\nprocedure can render an unbiased estimate of the sky signal in realistic\ncircumstances. We then study the effects of time-domain filtering on the noise\ncorrelation structure in the map domain, as well as impact it may have on the\nperformance of the popular pseudo-spectrum estimators. We conclude that\nalthough maps produced by the proposed estimators arguably provide the most\nfaithful representation of the sky possible given the data, they may not\nstraightforwardly lead to the best constraints on the power spectra of the\nunderlying sky signal and special care may need to be taken to ensure this is\nthe case.

Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ulGRBs) are a new population of GRBs with\nextreme durations of $\\sim 10^{4}$ s. Leading candidates for their origin are\nblue supergiant collapsars, magnetars, and white dwarf tidal disruption events\n(WD-TDEs) caused by massive black holes (BHs). Recent observations of\nsupernova-like (SN-like) bumps associated with ulGRBs challenged both the\nWD-TDE and the blue supergiant models because of the detection of SNe and the\nabsence of hydrogen lines, respectively. We propose that WD-TDEs can\naccommodate the observed SN-like bumps if the fallback WD matter releases\nenergy into the unbound WD ejecta. The observed ejecta energy, luminosity, and\nvelocity are explained by the gravitational energy, Eddington luminosity, and\nescape velocity of the formed accretion disk, respectively. We also show that\nthe observed X-rays can ionize the ejecta, eliminating lines. The SN-like light\ncurves (SN 2011kl) for the ulGRB 111209A are consistent with all three models,\nalthough a magnetar model is unnatural because the spin-down time required to\npower the SN-like bump is a hundred times longer than the GRB.

Our Doppler maps show evolution from a one-arm\nwave structure in H$\\alpha$ to two-armed waves in the other lines. The location\nof the two-arm structures agrees with simulations showing tidally driven spiral\nwaves in the accretion disc. During consecutive cycles, the qualitative\ncharacteristics of the detected structures remained similar but the central\nabsorption increased. For the first time, using the Doppler tomography method,\nwe obtained temperature maps of the accretion disc.

We compared these to a reanalysis\nof Voyager-1 and -2 IRIS spectra covering the same spectral range. Para-H$_2$\nincreases from equator to pole, with low-$f_p$ air at the equator representing\nsub-equilibrium conditions (i.e., less para-H$_2$ than expected from thermal\nequilibration), and high-$f_p$ air and possible super-equilibrium at higher\nlatitudes. In particular, we confirm the continued presence of a region of\nhigh-$f_p$ air at high northern latitudes discovered by Voyager/IRIS, and an\nasymmetry with generally higher $f_p$ in the north than in the south. We note\nthat existing collision-induced absorption databases lack opacity from\n(H$_2$)$_2$ dimers, leading to under-prediction of the absorption near the S(0)\nand S(1) peaks.

I use numerical simulations of gas clumps embedded\nin massive gas discs to show that these observations are consistent with $\\sim\n0.2 - 10$ planetary mass clumps per star being born in young gravitationally\nunstable discs. A trio of processes -- rapid clump migration, tidal disruption\nand runaway gas accretion -- destroys or transforms all of the simulated clumps\ninto other objects, resulting in a desert of gas giants beyond separation of\napproximately 10 au. The cooling rate of the disc controls which of the three\nprocesses is dominant.

Observational campaign and\n  OB-type spectroscopic binaries Abstract: Massive binaries (MBs) play a crucial role in the Universe. Knowing the\ndistributions of their orbital parameters (OPs) is important for a wide range\nof topics, from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels, from the\ndistribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet, no\ndirect measurements exist outside the Milky Way. The Tarantula Massive Binary\nMonitoring was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial\nvelocity monitoring of 102 MBs in the 30 Dor. In this paper, we analyse 32\nVLT/FLAMES observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier\nanalysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single- and 31\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries. Overall, the OPs and binary fraction are\nremarkably similar across the 30 Dor region and compared to existing Galactic\nsamples (GSs). This indicates that within these domains environmental effects\nare of second order in shaping the properties of MBs. A small difference is\nfound in the distribution of orbital periods (OrbPs), which is slightly flatter\n(in log space) in 30 Dor than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible\nwithin error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, OrbPs\nin 30 Dor can be as short as 1.1 d; somewhat shorter than seen in GSs. Equal\nmass binaries q>0.95 in 30 Dor are all found outside NGC 2070 the very young\nand massive cluster at 30 Dor's core. One outstanding exception however is the\nfact that earliest spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter OrbPs than\nlatter (O9.2-O9.7). Our results point to a relative universality of the\nincidence rate of MBs and their OPs in the metallicity range from solar\n($Z_{\\odot}$) to about $0.5Z_{\\odot}$.

The consequent multimodality of the\nlikelihood function leads to extremely challenging search, optimization, and\nMCMC posterior sampling over the orbital parameters. Here we create a custom\nMonte Carlo sampler for sparse or noisy radial-velocity measurements of\ntwo-body systems that can produce posterior samples for orbital parameters even\nwhen the likelihood function is poorly behaved. The six standard orbital\nparameters for a binary system can be split into four non-linear parameters\n(period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters\n(velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a\nsampling method in which we densely sample the prior pdf in the non-linear\nparameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function\nmarginalized over the linear parameters. With sparse or uninformative data, the\nsampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense.\nWith informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too\nsparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC. The\nmethod produces correct samplings in orbital parameters for data that include\nas few as three epochs. The Joker can therefore be used to produce proper\nsamplings of multimodal pdfs, which are still informative and can be used in\nhierarchical (population) modeling.

We show that this process can be understood as a modified,\nPCA-like process that produces porous, but non-fractal particles whose filling\nfactor is chiefly determined by the porosity of the building blocks.\n  We also show that in a coagulation environment where relative velocities are\ndriven by turbulence, a logarithmically flat mass distribution (equal mass per\nmass decade) as it is typically found in environments where fragmentation\nreplenishes small grains, leads to a situation where small particles and\naggregates dominate the growth of large ones. Therefore, in such environments,\nhierarchical growth should be seen as the norm. Consequently, we predict that\nthe aggregates in such environments are not fractals with extremely low\ndensities as they would result from extrapolation fractal laws to large sizes.\nThe compactification of aggregates does not only result from collisions with\nenough energy to restructure aggregates - it starts already earlier by filling\nvoids in particles with smaller grains that contribute to the growth. \n\n"}

With the TEE, it is straightforward to\nestimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future\ninstruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.\n  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit\nshape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using\nMonte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in\nparticular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.\n  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to\nthe correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit\ningress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.\n  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing\nerrors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to\nestimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of\nlong-coverage observations are possible as well.

Allowing for\nrealistic baryonic content and spatial distributions, however, helps create a\nlarge variety of rotation curve shapes; which is in better agreement with\nobservations in the case of self-interactions due to the characteristic cored\nprofiles being more accommodating to the slowly rising rotation curves than\nCDM. We find individual fits to model two of the most remarkable outliers of\nsimilar Vmax, UGC 5721 and IC 2574, the former a cusp-like rotation curve and\nthe latter a seemingly 8 kpc cored profile. This diversity in SIDM arises as\npermutations of overly concentrated halos with compact baryonic distributions\nversus underdense halos with extended baryonic disks. The SIDM solution is\npromising and its feasibility ultimately depends on the sampling of the halo\nmass-concentration relation and its interplay with the baryonic profiles,\nemphasising the need for a better understanding of the frequency of extreme\noutliers present in current observational samples. \n\n"}

Abstract: Elemental abundances of stars are the result of the complex enrichment\nhistory of their galaxy. Interpretation of observed abundances requires\nflexible modeling tools to explore and quantify the information about Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) stored in such data. Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the\nposterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test\ndata-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets. We find that of the IMF $11.6_{-1.6}^{+2.1}$ %\nexplodes as core-collapse SN, compatible with Salpeter 1955. We also constrain\nthe incidence of SN Ia per 10^3 Msun to 0.5-1.4. At the same time, this Chempy\napplication shows persistent discrepancies between predicted and observed\nabundances for some elements, irrespective of the chosen yield set. These\ncannot be remedied by any variations of Chempy's parameters and could be an\nindication for missing nucleosynthetic channels. Chempy should be a powerful\ntool to confront predictions from stellar nucleosynthesis with far more complex\nabundance data sets. \n\n"}

We use the stellar evolution code MESA to\ncompute models with atomic diffusion--with and without radiative\nacceleration--and extra mixing in the surface layers. The extra mixing consists\nof both density-dependent turbulent mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based\non these models we argue that it is important to distinguish between initial,\nbulk abundances (parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the\nanalysis of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions\non evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface abundances.\nWe show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with current, surface\nmetallicity in isochrone age analysis the resulting stellar ages can be\nsystematically over-estimated by up to 20%. The change of surface abundances\nwith evolutionary phase also complicates chemical tagging, the concept that\ndispersed star clusters can be identified through unique, high-dimensional\nchemical signatures.

We speculate that calibration\nof stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also\ninitial abundances for individual stars.

We find, by\napplying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs\ncontaining no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and\nthe formation of Rossby vortices play a critical role in setting the\nequilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is\nabsent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium gap\ndepth there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by\ntorque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present,\nand two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is\npresent. This can be understood if the planet gap is maintained at marginal\nstability, even when there is no obvious Rossby wave instability present.\nFurther investigation shows the final equilibrium gap depth is very sensitive\nto the form of the applied torque density distribution, and using improved one\ndimensional approximations from three dimensional simulations can go even\nfurther to reducing the discrepancy between one and two dimensional models,\nespecially for lower mass planets. This behaviour is found to be consistent\nacross discs with varying parameters. \n\n"}

Mars-crossing asteroids (MCs) are a dynamically unstable group\nbetween the main belt and the near-Earth populations. Characterising the\nphysical properties of a large sample of MCs can help to understand the\noriginal sources of many near-Earth asteroids, some of which may produce\nmeteorites on Earth. Aims. Our aim is to provide diameters and albedos of MCs\nwith available WISE/NEOWISE data. Methods. We used the near-Earth asteroid\nthermal model to find the best-fitting values of equivalent diameter and,\nwhenever possible, the infrared beaming parameter. With the diameter and\ntabulated asteroid absolute magnitudes we also computed the visible geometric\nalbedos. Results. We determined the diameters and beaming parameters of 404\nobjects observed during the fully cryogenic phase of the WISE mission, most of\nwhich have not been published elsewhere. We also obtained 1572 diameters from\ndata from the 3-Band and posterior non-cryogenic phases using a default value\nof beaming parameter. The average beaming parameter is 1.2 +/- 0.2 for objects\nsmaller than 10 km, which constitute most of our sample. This is higher than\nthe typical value of 1.0 found for the whole main belt and is possibly related\nto the fact that WISE is able to observe many more small objects at shorter\nheliocentric distances, i.e. at higher phase angles. We argue that this is a\nbetter default value for modelling Mars-crossing asteroids from the\nWISE/NEOWISE catalogue and discuss the effects of this choice on the diameter\nand albedo distributions. We find a double-peaked distribution for the visible\ngeometric albedos, which is expected since this population is compositionally\ndiverse and includes objects in the major spectral complexes. However, the\ndistribution of beaming parameters is homogeneous for both low- and high-albedo\nobjects. \n\n"}

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially.

Using this Bayesian framework, we forecast the ability\nof the proposed CMB space mission LiteBIRD to constrain $r$ in the presence of\nrealistic lensing and foreground contributions. We compute the joint posterior\ndistribution of $r$ and $A_{lens}$, which we improve by adopting a prior on\n$A_{lens}$ taken from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) measurement. As it applies\nto the power spectrum, this approach cannot mitigate the uncertainty on $r$\nthat is due to E-mode cosmic variance transferred to B-modes by lensing, unlike\nstandard delensing techniques that are performed on maps. However, the method\nallows to correct for the bias on $r$ induced by lensing, at the expense of a\nlarger uncertainty due to the increased volume of the parameter space. We\nquantify, for different values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the trade-off\nbetween bias correction and increase of uncertainty on $r$. For LiteBIRD\nsimulations, which include foregrounds and lensing contamination, we find that\ncorrecting the foreground-cleaned CMB B-mode power spectrum for the lensing\nbias, not the lensing cosmic variance, still guarantees a $3\\sigma$ detection\nof $r=5\\times 10^{-3}$.

Parker's\nconjecture that spontaneous current singularities lead to nanoflares that heat\nthe corona has been controversial. In ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), can\ngenuine current singularities emerge from a smooth 3D line-tied magnetic field?\nTo numerically resolve this issue, the schemes employed must preserve magnetic\ntopology exactly to avoid artificial reconnection in the presence of singular\ncurrent densities. Structure-preserving numerical methods are favorable for\nmitigating numerical dissipation, and variational integration is a powerful\nmachinery for deriving them. In this thesis, we develop variational integrators\nfor ideal MHD in Lagrangian labeling by discretizing Newcomb's Lagrangian on a\nmoving mesh using discretized exterior calculus. With the built-in frozen-in\nequation, the schemes are free of artificial reconnection, hence optimal for\nstudying current singularity formation.\n  Using this method, we first study a fundamental prototype problem in 2D, the\nHahm-Kulsrud-Taylor (HKT) problem. It considers the effect of boundary\nperturbations on a 2D plasma magnetized by a sheared field, and its linear\nsolution is singular. We find that with increasing resolution, the nonlinear\nsolution converges to one with a current singularity. We then extend the HKT\nproblem to 3D line-tied geometry, which models the solar corona by anchoring\nthe field lines in the boundaries. The linear solution, which is singular in\n2D, is found to be smooth. The nonlinear solution turns out smooth for short\nsystems. Nonetheless, the scaling of peak current density vs. system length\nsuggests that the nonlinear solution may become singular at a finite length.\nWith the results in hand, we cannot confirm or rule out this possibility\nconclusively, since we cannot obtain solutions with system lengths near the\nextrapolated critical value. \n\n"}

In this paper I will summarize the theory and then present evidence\nthat candidate Shapiro steps of this type have indeed been seen in several\nindependent condensed matter experiments. Assuming the observed tiny Shapiro\nsteps are due to axion flow then these data point to an axion mass of $(106 \\pm\n6)\\mu$eV, consistent with what is expected for the QCD axion.

Our survey, together with other ALMA\nstudies, have yielded null results for disks around young planet-mass\ncompanions and placed stringent dust mass upper limits, typically less than 0.1\nM_earth, when assuming dust continuum is optically thin. Such low-mass gas/dust\ncontent can lead to a disk lifetime estimate (from accretion rates) much\nshorter than the age of the system. To alleviate this timescale discrepancy, we\nsuggest that disks around wide companions might be very compact and optically\nthick, in order to sustain a few Myr of accretion yet have very weak\n(sub)millimeter flux so as to still be elusive to ALMA.

Since the timescale of the growth of\nthe secular GI is much longer than the Keplerian rotation period, we develop a\nnew numerical scheme for a long term calculation utilizing the concept of\nsymplectic integrator.

In our framework, the variability features observed in\ndifferent AGN at different timescales may be explained as realisations of the\nsame underlying statistical properties. In this context, we propose a model to\nsimulate the evolution of AGN light curves with time based on the probability\ndensity function (PDF) and power spectral density (PSD) of the Eddington ratio\n($L/L_{\\rm Edd}$) distribution. Motivated by general galaxy population\nproperties, we propose that the PDF may be inspired by the $L/L_{\\rm Edd}$\ndistribution function (ERDF), and that a single (or limited number of) ERDF+PSD\nset may explain all observed variability features. After outlining the\nframework and the model, we compile a set of variability measurements in terms\nof structure function (SF) and magnitude difference.

The presence of the majority of these species\ncan be explained by shock-induced non-TE chemical models, where shocks caused\nby the pulsating star take the chemistry out of TE in the inner region.\nMoreover, a non-uniform density structure has been detected in several AGB\noutflows.

We\npresent a parameter study of the effect of clumping and porosity on the\nchemistry throughout the outflow. Both the higher density within the clumps and\nthe increased UV radiation field penetration have an important impact on the\nchemistry, as they both alter the chemical pathways.

We find that\nthe differential desorption of volatile species is amplified by the grains\nlarger than 0.1 $\\mu$m, because larger grains are heated to a lower temperature\nby cosmic-rays and hence more sensitive to the variations in binding energies.\nAs a result, atomic nitrogen N is $\\sim$2 orders of magnitude more abundant\nthan CO; N$_2$H$^+$ also becomes a few times more abundant than HCO$^+$ due to\nthe increased gas-phase N$_2$. However, the changes in ionization fraction due\nto freeze-out and desorption only have minor effects on the non-ideal MHD\ndiffusivities. Our chemical network confirms that the very small grains (VSGs:\nbelow a few 100 $\\AA$) weakens the efficiency of both ambipolar diffusion and\nHall effect.

We detect highly\nstructured dust polarization toward the inner disks and the extended ring with\ntypical polarization fractions ~ 1.7% and ~ 2.4%, respectively. The two\ncomponents also show distinct polarization morphologies. The inner disks have\nuniform polarization angles aligned with their minor axes. This morphology is\nconsistent with expectations from dust scattering. By contrast, the extended\ndust ring has an azimuthal polarization morphology not previously seen in\nlower-resolution observations. We find that our observations are well fit by a\nstatic, oblate spheroid model with a flux-frozen, poloidal magnetic field. We\npropose that the polarization traces magnetic grain alignment likely from flux\nfreezing on large scales and magnetic diffusion on small scales. Alternatively,\nthe azimuthal polarization may be attributed to grain alignment by the\nanisotropic radiation field. If the grains are radiatively aligned, then our\nobservations indicate that large (~ 100 um) dust grains grow quickly at large\nangular extents.

The magnitude of this feature is\npredicted to be independent of age at fixed chemical composition. For this\nreason, its difference in magnitude with respect to the MS turn-off (MS-TO)\npoint has been suggested as a possible diagnostic to estimate absolute globular\ncluster (GC) ages. We first demonstrate that the operational definition of the\nMS-knee currently adopted in the literature refers to the inflection point of\nthe MS (that we here more appropriately named MS-saddle), a feature that is\nwell distinct from the knee and that cannot be used as its proxy. The MS-knee\nis only visible in near-infrared CMDs, while the MS-saddle can be also detected\nin optical-NIR CMDs. By using different sets of isochrones we then demonstrate\nthat the absolute magni- tude of the MS-knee varies by a few tenths of a dex\nfrom one model to another, thus showing that at the moment stellar models may\nnot capture the full systematic error in the method. We also demonstrate that\nwhile the absolute magnitude of the MS-saddle is almost coincident in different\nmodels, it has a systematic dependence on the adopted color combinations which\nis not predicted by stellar models. Hence, it cannot be used as a reliable\nreference for absolute age determination. Moreover, when statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties are properly taken into ac- count, the difference in\nmagnitude between the MS-TO and the MS-saddle does not provide absolute ages\nwith better accuracy than other methods like the MS-fitting. \n\n"}

Microlensing has the potential to probe\nthis hidden population, as it can measure both the mass and five of the six\nphase-space coordinates (all except the radial velocity) even of a dark\nisolated lens. However, the measurements of both the microlens parallax and\nfinite-source effects are needed in order to recover the full information.\nHere, we combine $Spitzer$ satellite parallax measurement with the ground-based\nlight curve, which exhibits strong finite-source effects, of event\nOGLE-2017-BLG-0896. We find two degenerate solutions for the lens (due to the\nknown satellite-parallax degeneracy), which are consistent with each other\nexcept for their proper motion. The lens is an isolated brown dwarf with a mass\nof either $18\\pm1M_J$ or $20\\pm1M_J$.

Low-mass M-dwarfs have pre-main\nsequence life times on the order of $\\sim100$ Myr and therefore are continually\nevolving along a mass-luminosity track throughout the YMG phase, providing\nideal laboratories for precise isochronal dating, if a model-independent\ndynamical mass can be measured.

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

However, it remains relatively unexplored because dense\nmolecular gas tracers like HCN and HCO+ are faint in low metallicity systems.\nWe present Green Bank Telescope observations of HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) on giant\nmolecular cloud (34pc) scales in the nearby low metallicity ($12+\\log({\\rm\nO/H})=8.2$) starburst IC 10 and compare them to those in other galaxies.

The\n$I_{\\rm HCN}/I_{\\rm HCO+}$ values are within the range seen in other galaxies,\nbut are most similar to those seen in other low metallicity sources and in\nstarbursts. The detections follow the fiducial $L_{\\rm IR}$-$L_{\\rm HCN}$ and\n$L_{\\rm IR}$-$L_{\\rm HCO+}$ relationships.

Using a sample of open clusters stars, we wish to address two issues:\nminimize chemical abundance differences which origin is linked to the\nevolutionary stage of the stars and not their original composition; evaluate a\nphylogenetic approach to group stars based on their chemical composition.\n  Methods. We derived differential chemical abundances for 207 stars (belonging\nto 34 open clusters) using the Sun as reference star (classical approach) and a\ndwarf plus a giant star from the open cluster M67 as reference (new approach).\nThese abundances were then used to perform two phylogenetic analyses,\ncladistics (Maximum Parsimony) and Neighbour-Joining, together with a\npartitioning unsupervised classification analysis with k-means.

SU Lyn has hard, thermal, X-ray emission that is strongly\naffected by a variable local absorber - that has little impact on the UV\nemission.

By\nincorporating knowledge of the properties of the planetary radius gap\nidentified by the CKS survey, we are able to investigate the properties of\nplanetary cores and their gaseous envelopes separately. Our primary findings\nare that the solid core masses of planets are higher around higher metallicity\nstars and that these more massive cores were able to accrete larger gas\nenvelopes. Furthermore, investigating the recently reported result that planets\nwith radii in the range (2-6Rearth) are more common at short periods around\nhigher metallicity stars in detail, we find that the average host star\nmetallicity of H/He atmosphere-hosting planets increases smoothly inside an\norbital period of ~20 days. We interpret the location of the metallicity\nincrease within the context of atmospheric photoevaporation: higher metallicity\nstars are likely to host planets with higher atmospheric metallicity, which\nincreases the cooling in the photoevaporative outflow, lowering the mass-loss\nrates. Therefore, planets with higher metallicity atmospheres are able to\nresist photoevaporation at shorter orbital periods. Finally, we find evidence\nat 2.8 sigma that planets that do not host H/He atmospheres at long periods are\nmore commonly found around lower metallicity stars. Such planets are difficult\nto explain by photoevaporative stripping of planets which originally accreted\nH/He atmospheres. Alternatively, this population of planets could be\nrepresentative of planets that formed in a terrestrial-like fashion, after the\ngas disc dispersed. \n\n"}

There are two main\ncontributing processes. 1) Lower mass galaxies are less rotationally supported.\nThis is confirmed observationally from the skewness of linewidths in bins of HI\nmass in both ALFALFA and HIPASS observations. 2) The HI distributions are less\nextended (relative to the dark matter halo) in dwarf galaxies. Coupled to the\nlower baryon-to-halo ratio results in rotation curves that are still rising at\nthe last measured data point, in agreement with observations from SPARC.\nCombining these two effects, in both simulations and observations lower mass\ngalaxies have on average lower W_50 / W_20.

If strong\nfirst-order phase transitions do not exist within neutron stars, both neutron\nstars are described by the same equation of state, and their Lambdas are highly\ncorrelated through their masses even if the equation of state is unknown. If,\nhowever, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the\ntwo stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least\nmassive star does not, this correlation will be weakened. In all cases, a\nminimum Lambda for each neutron star mass is imposed by causality, and a less\nconservative limit is imposed by the unitary gas constraint, both of which we\ncompute. In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively. Moreover, they are\nbounded by q^{n_-}>Lambda_1/Lambda_2> q^{n_{0+}+qn_{1+}}, where\nn_-<n_{0+}+qn_{1+}; the parameters depend only on M_chirp, which is accurately\ndetermined from the gravitational-wave signal. We also provide analytic\nexpressions for the wider bounds that exist in the case of a strong phase\ntransition. We argue that bounded ranges for Lambda_1/Lambda_2, tuned to\nM_chirp, together with lower bounds to Lambda(M), will be more useful in\ngravitational waveform modeling than other suggested approaches. \n\n"}

We use self-consistent numerical simulations to uncover what\nparameters of host galaxies govern the opening angle spread. We constructed a\nseries of equilibrium models of galaxies with high spatial resolution, varying\nthe dark halo and bulge contribution in the overall gravitational potential,\nthe initial disc thickness of models and the Toomre parameter Q and followed\ntheir evolution for almost 8 Gyrs. Each model demonstrated the formation of\nclear X-structures with different flatness. We have obtained that opening\nangles lie in the range from 25 deg to 42 deg throughout the entire evolution.\nThese values are roughly consistent with observational data. The greatest\nvariation in the opening angles is obtained by varying the mass of the dark\nhalo. The initial thickness of the disc and the Toomre parameter are\nresponsible for smaller variations of the angle and shorter X-structures. An\nincrease of both parameters changes the morphology of in-plane bars and\nX-structures. In some cases we observed even double X-structures. The main\neffect of the bulge is to prevent buckling at intermediate and late stages of\nthe disc evolution. Comparison of models with different halo masses indicates\nthat the smallest observable values of opening angles can be associated with\nthe presence of a heavy dark halo (more than 3 masses of the disc within the\noptical radius). \n\n"}

These predictions motivated us to\nperform a sophisticated time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the GW signals, aimed\nat preparation for future observations. By reanalyzing a gravitational waveform\nobtained in a three-dimensional general-relativistic CCSN simulation, we show\nthat both the spectrogram with an adequate window and the quadratic TFA\nseparate the multimodal GW signatures much more clearly compared with the\nprevious analysis. We find that the observed low-frequency excess during the\nSASI active phase is divided into two components, a stronger one at 130 Hz and\nan overtone at 260 Hz, both of which evolve quasi-statically during the\nsimulation time. We also identify a new mode whose frequency varies from 700 to\n600 Hz. Furthermore, we develop the quadratic TFA for the Stokes I, Q, U, and V\nparameters as a new tool to investigate the GW circular polarization. We\ndemonstrate that the polarization states that randomly change with time after\nbounce are associated with the PNS g-mode oscillation, whereas a slowly\nchanging polarization state in the low-frequency domain is connected to the PNS\ncore oscillation. This study demonstrates the capability of the sophisticated\nTFA for diagnosing the polarized CCSN GWs in order to explore their complex\nnature. \n\n"}

Currently, our understanding of the GSS, in terms of both its geometry\nand its chemistry, results from either wide-field imaging probing only a few\nmagnitudes below the red giant branch tip, or deep imaging or spectroscopy of\nisolated regions.

Several\nmassive stars have been detected as doublelined spectroscopic binaries and\namong these, the OWN Survey has detected a non-negligible number whose\ncomponents show very different spectral line broadening (i.e., projected\nrotational velocities). This fact raises a discussion about the contributing\nprocesses, such as angular-momentum transfer and tidal forces. Aims. We seek to\nconstrain the physical and evolutionary status of one of such systems, the O+O\nbinary HD 93343. Methods. We analyzed a series of high-resolution multiepoch\noptical spectra to determine the orbital parameters, projected rotational\nvelocities, and evolutionary status of the system. Results. HD 93343 is a\nbinary system comprised of two O7.5 Vz stars that each have minimum masses of\napproximately 22 Mo in a wide and eccentric orbit (e = 0.398$\\pm$0.004;\nP=50.432$\\pm$0.001 d). Both stars have very similar stellar parameters, and\nhence ages. As expected from the qualitative appearance of the combined\nspectrum of the system, however, these stars have very different projected\nrotational velocities (~65 and ~325 km/s, respectively).

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary\nsystems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those\nfound around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to\nbe extremely rare in such environments. \n\n"}

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.

I focus on the evolution of the apparent spin frequency, which is\ntypically associated with the motion of a specific point on the stellar surface\n(e.g., polar cap). I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model. For\nexample, despite that widely applied evolution equations predict effective spin\nto be constant in absence of dissipation, the CFS-unstable star should be\nobserved as spinning-down.

Without the selection\nfunction taken into account, the results might reflect the properties of the\nselection function rather than those of the underlying stellar population.\nAims. In this work, we introduce a method to estimate the selection function\nfor a given spectroscopic survey. We apply this method to a large sample of\npublic spectroscopic surveys. Methods. We apply a median division binning\nalgorithm to bin observed stars in the colour-magnitude space. This approach\nproduces lower uncertainties and lower biases of the selection function\nestimate as compared to traditionally used 2D-histograms.

Abstract: Disk polarization in (sub)millimeter dust continuum is a rapidly growing\nfield in the ALMA era. It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3. We conclude that neither of these two mechanisms alone can explain\nthe data and the origin of the 3 mm polarization remains a mystery.

An assessment of\nLISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties\nof MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this\naim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within\ntheir host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the\nbinaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is\ndriven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel\nchannel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black\nhole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with\nphysically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the\norbital eccentricity.

Thus, all low-frequency ion\nheating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations (\"slow modes\").\nBecause these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\\'enic ones\nalready in the inertial range, the above conclusion means that the energy\npartition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas is decided at the\nouter scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems.

These lines are likely to originate from relativistic outflows\n(or jets) in the vicinity of the central black hole. Consequently, the profile\nof such a line should be distorted by strong gravitational effects near the\nblack hole, as well as special relativistic effects. In this paper, we present\nresults from a detailed study on how each process affects the observed line\nprofile. We found that the profile is sensitive to the intrinsic properties of\nthe jets (Lorentz factor, velocity profile, and emissivity law), as well as to\nthe spin of the black hole and the viewing angle (with respect to the axis of\nthe jets). More specifically, in the case of approaching jets, an intrisically\nnarrow line (blue-shifted) is seen as simply broadened at small viewing angles,\nbut it shows a doubly peaked profile at large viewing angles for extreme Kerr\nblack holes (due to the combination of gravitational focusing and Doppler\neffects); the profile is always singly peaked for Schwarzschild black holes.\nFor receding jets, however, the line profile becomes quite complicated owing to\ncomplicated photon trajectories.

Allowing for images not\nassociated with the fold, we derive analytic expressions for the photometric\nand astrometric behavior near a generic fold caustic.

In this case, the simplicity and high degree of\nsymmetry allows for the derivation of semi-analytic expressions for the\nphotometric and astrometric deviations in the presence of finite sources with\narbitrary surface brightness profiles.

The enormous energy liberated in the 2004 Dece 27\ngiant flare from SGR 1806-20, together with the likely recurrence time of such\nevents, points to an internal magnetic field strength ~ 10^{16} G. Such strong\nfields are expected to be generated by a coherent alpha-Omega dynamo in the\nearly seconds after the Neutron Star formation, if its spin period is of a few\nmilliseconds at most. A substantial deformation of the NS is caused by such\nfields and a newborn millisecond-spinning magnetar would thus radiate for a few\ndays a strong gravitational wave signal. Such a signal may be detected with\nAdvanced LIGO-class detectors up to the distance of the Virgo cluster, where ~\n1 magnetar per year are expected to form.

Abstract: The Milky Way is often considered to be the best example of a spiral for\nwhich the dark matter not only dominates the outer kinematics, but also plays a\nmajor dynamical role in the inner galaxy: the Galactic disk is therefore said\nto be ``sub-maximal.'' This conclusion is important to the understanding of the\nevolution of galaxies and the viability of particular dark matter models. The\nGalactic evidence rests on a number of structural and kinematic measurements,\nmany of which have recently been revised. The new constraints indicate not only\nthat the Galaxy is a more typical member of its class (Sb-Sc spirals) than\npreviously thought, but also require a re-examination of the question of\nwhether or not the Milky Way disk is maximal. By applying to the Milky Way the\nsame definition of ``maximal disk'' that is applied to external galaxies, it is\nshown that the new observational constraints are consistent with a Galactic\nmaximal disk of reasonable $M/L$. In particular, the local disk column can be\nsubstantially less than the oft-quoted required $\\Sigma_{\\odot} \\approx 100\n\\msolar pc^{-2}$ - as low as $40 \\msolar pc^{-2}$ in the extreme case - and\nstill be maximal, in the sense that the dark halo provides negligible rotation\nsupport in the inner Galaxy.

When\naccretion halts, the envelope relaxes to a thermal equilibrium set by the flux\nfrom the hot core, as if the neutron star were newly born. For the\ntime-averaged accretion rates typical of low-mass X-ray transients, standard\nneutrino cooling is unimportant and the core thermally re-radiates the\ndeposited heat. The resulting luminosity has the same magnitude as that\nobserved from several transient neutron stars in quiescence. Confirmation of\nthis mechanism would strongly constrain rapid neutrino cooling mechanisms for\nneutron stars. Thermal emission had previously been dismissed as a predominant\nsource of quiescent emission since blackbody spectral fits implied an emitting\narea much smaller than a neutron star's surface. However, as with thermal\nemission from radio pulsars, fits with realistic emergent spectra will imply a\nsubstantially larger emitting area. Other emission mechanisms, such as\naccretion or a pulsar shock, can also operate in quiescence and generate\nintensity and spectral variations over short timescales.

In this work, we show that through\nnext-to-leading order, there are no unphysical counterterms in the\nextrapolation formulae, expressed in lattice-physical parameters, for meson\nscattering lengths in theories with Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks. Our work\napplies to most sea quark discretization, provided that chiral perturbation\ntheory is a valid approximation. We demonstrate our results with explicit\ncomputations and show that, in favorable circumstances, the extrapolation\nformulae do not depend on the unknown constant C_Mix appearing at lowest order\nin the mixed action chiral Lagrangian. We show that the I=1 KK scattering\nlength does not depend on C_Mix in contrast to the I=3/2 K-pi scattering\nlength. In addition, we show that these observables combined with f_K / f_pi\nand the I=2 pi-pi scattering length share only two linearly independent sets of\ncounterterms, providing a means to test the mixed action theory at one lattice\nspacing.
