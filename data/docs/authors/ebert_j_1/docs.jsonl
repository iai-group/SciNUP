The Pontrjagin-Thom construction along\nwith Hirsch's compression lemma identify every \\alpha \\in \\Pi_n with the framed\nbordism class of a framed immersion of a closed n-manifold into R^{n+k}, for\nany given k>0. Its self-intersection M projects to an immersion f: M \\to R^n\nwhich is framed by k copies of a line bundle \\kappa. It is well-known that\nH(\\alpha) = <w_1(\\kappa)^{n-k}, [M]>.

The setup consists of a highly sensitive\nmagnetometer inside a superconducting shielding. This is then placed inside a\nstrong (but sub-critical) magnetic field. In ordinary electrodynamics the\nmagnetic field cannot permeate the superconductor and no field should register\non the magnetometer. However, photon -- hidden-sector photon -- photon\noscillations would allow to penetrate the superconductor and the magnetic field\nwould \"leak\" into the shielded volume and register on the magnetometer.\nAlthough this setup resembles a classic ``light shining though a wall\nexperiment'' there are two crucial differences. First, the fields are (nearly)\nstatic and the photons involved are virtual. Second, the magnetometer directly\nmeasures the field-strength and not a probability.

As the torus action in this case\nhas only isolated fixed points it is possible to effectively apply localization\nformula for the universal toric genus. Using this we prove that the famous\ntopological results related to rigidity and multiplicativity of a Hirzebruch\ngenus can be obtained on homogeneous spaces just using representation theory.\nIn that context for homogeneous $SU$-spaces we prove the well known result\nabout rigidity of the Krichever genus. We also prove that for a large class of\nstable complex homogeneous spaces any $T^k$-equivariant Hirzebruch genus given\nby an odd power series vanishes. Related to the problem of multiplicativity we\nprovide construction of stable complex $T^k$-fibrations for which the universal\ntoric genus is twistedly multiplicative.

DeepCore was designed to lower the IceCube neutrino energy\nthreshold by over an order of magnitude, to energies as low as about 10 GeV.\nDeepCore is situated primarily 2100 m below the surface of the icecap at the\nSouth Pole, at the bottom center of the existing IceCube array, and began\ntaking physics data in May 2010. Its location takes advantage of the\nexceptionally clear ice at those depths and allows it to use the surrounding\nIceCube detector as a highly efficient active veto against the principal\nbackground of downward-going muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers. DeepCore\nhas a module density roughly five times higher than that of the standard\nIceCube array, and uses photomultiplier tubes with a new photocathode featuring\na quantum efficiency about 35% higher than standard IceCube PMTs.

When the target space is a flag manifold of\nsimple G, and the gauge group is a Cartan subgroup thereof, the perturbative\nmodel describes, purely physically, the recently formulated mathematical theory\nof \"Twisted Chiral Differential Operators\". This paves the way, via a\ngeneralized T-duality, for a natural physical interpretation of the geometric\nLanglands correspondence for simply-connected, simple, complex Lie groups. In\nparticular, the Hecke eigensheaves and Hecke operators can be described in\nterms of the correlation functions of certain operators that underlie the\ninfinite-dimensional chiral algebra of the flag manifold model. Nevertheless,\nnonperturbative worldsheet twisted-instantons can, in some situations,\ntrivialize the chiral algebra completely.

Abstract: We investigate the question of whether the recent modulation signal claimed\nby CoGeNT is best explained by the dark matter (DM) hypothesis from a Bayesian\nmodel comparison perspective. We consider five phenomenological explanations\nfor the data: no modulation signal, modulation due to DM, modulation due to DM\ncompatible with the total CoGeNT rate, and a signal coming from other physics\nwith a free phase but annual period, or with a free phase and a free period. In\neach scenario, we assign to the free parameters physically motivated priors. We\nfind that while the DM models are weakly preferred to the no modulation model,\nbut when compared to models where the modulation is due to other physics, the\nDM hypothesis is favoured with odds ranging from 185:1 to 560:1. This result is\nrobust even when astrophysical uncertainties are taken into account and the\nimpact of priors assessed. Interestingly, the odds for the DM model in which\nthe modulation signal is compatible with the total rate against a DM model in\nwhich this prior is not implemented is only 5:8, in spite of the former's\nprediction of a modulation amplitude in the energy range 0.9 to 3.0 keVee that\nis significantly smaller than the value observed by CoGeNT.

At present, the pion DA is not definitely determined, it is\nhelpful to have a pion DA model that can mimic all the suggested behaviors,\nespecially to agree with the constraints from the pion-photon TFF in whole\nmeasured region within a consistent way. For the purpose, we adopt the\nconventional model for pion wavefunction/DA that has been constructed in our\nprevious paper \\cite{hw1}, whose broadness is controlled by a parameter $B$. We\nfix the DA parameters by using the CELLO, CLEO, BABAR and Belle data within the\nsmaller $Q^2$ region ($Q^2 \\leq 15$ GeV$^2$), where all the data are consistent\nwith each other.

To break these degeneracies, it is\nimportant to identify and measure processes where the Higgs coupling to\nfermions interferes with other coupling(s).

But, checking the link condition involves computation in\nall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\ncomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link\ncondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We\nprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and\n(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional\nhomology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the\n(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not\nintroduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,\nthough some of the existing classes can be destroyed.

The models were computed with\nthe Vertex-CoCoNuT code, using three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino\ntransport in the ray-by-ray-plus approximation. Our results confirm the close\nsimilarity of the mean energies of electron antineutrinos and heavy-lepton\nneutrinos and even their crossing during the accretion phase for stars with\nM>10 M_sun as observed in previous 1D and 2D simulations with state-of-the-art\nneutrino transport. We establish a roughly linear scaling of the electron\nantineutrino mean energy with the proto-neutron star (PNS) mass, which holds in\ntime as well as for different progenitors. Convection inside the PNS affects\nthe neutrino emission on the 10-20% level, and accretion continuing beyond the\nonset of the explosion prevents the abrupt drop of the neutrino luminosities\nseen in artificially exploded 1D models.

In recent\nyears, theoretical evidence has been accumulated for both states in favor of a\npredominantly $DK$ and $D^*K$ molecular nature, respectively. However, a direct\nexperimental proof of this hypothesis still needs to be found. Since radiative\ndecays are generally believed to be sensitive to the inner structure of the\ndecaying particles, we study in this work the radiative and strong decays of\nboth the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, as well as of their counterparts\nin the bottom sector.

In particular, $g$ has a\ngeneral type, which is an extension of the type of an adapted metric. A\nrestriction on this general type is assumed, and then $g$ is called good.

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion. This feature invokes fake CP-asymmetry\nlike the SM matter effect and can severely affect the leptonic CP-violation\nsearches in long-baseline experiments. In this paper, we study in detail the\npossible impacts of these long-range flavor-diagonal neutral current\ninteractions due to $L_e-L_{\\mu}$ symmetry, when (anti-)neutrinos travel from\nFermilab to Homestake (1300 km) and CERN to Pyh\\\"asalmi (2290 km) in the\ncontext of future high-precision superbeam facilities, DUNE and LBNO\nrespectively.

With the availability of powerful digital signal processing\ntechniques, new attempts at measuring cosmic ray air showers via their radio\nemission were started at the beginning of the new millennium. Starting with\nmodest, small-scale digital prototype setups, the field has evolved, matured\nand grown very significantly in the past decade. Today's second-generation\ndigital radio detection experiments consist of up to hundreds of radio antennas\nor cover areas of up to 17 km$^{2}$.

Recent analysis demonstrated that this\napproach provides a satisfactory description of the experimental data for the\ninclusive hadron production in $pp/pA/AA$ collisions.

In this paper we consider the running\ncoupling corrected $k_T$ - factorization formula conjectured some years ago and\ninvestigate the impact of the running coupling corrections on the observables.\nIn particular, the pseudorapidity distributions and charged hadrons\nmultiplicity are calculated considering $pp$, $dAu/pPb$ and $AuAu/PbPb$\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC energies.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve.

If the energy thresholds of the\ndetector can be reduced to the meV scale, then dark matter as light as ~MeV can\nbe reached with ordinary nuclear recoils.

Two samples of SHERPA events are generated.

Thus there are currently three empirical data that\npoint to supersymmetry as an underlying symmetry of particle physics: the\nunification of gauge couplings within supersymmetry, the fact that nature\nrespects the supersymmetry prediction that the Higgs boson mass lie below 130\nGeV, and vacuum stability up to the Planck scale with a Higgs boson mass at\n$\\sim 125$ GeV while the standard model does not do that. Coupled with the fact\nthat supersymmetry solves the big hierarchy problem related to the quadratic\ndivergence to the Higgs boson mass square along with the fact that there is no\nalternative paradigm that allows us to extrapolate physics from the electroweak\nscale to the grand unification scale consistent with experiment, supersymmetry\nremains a compelling framework for new physics beyond the standard model. The\nlarge loop correction to the Higgs boson mass in supersymmetry to lift the tree\nmass to the experimentally observable value, indicates a larger value of the\nscale of weak scale supersymmetry, making the observation of sparticles more\nchallenging but still within reach at the LHC for the lightest ones.

Extensive systematic studies are performed, in order to match the\nlarge statistics of the data sample corresponding to over 300 000 measured and\nidentified $\\tau$ decays. Branching fractions are obtained for the two leptonic\nchannels and eleven hadronic channels defined by their respective numbers of\ncharged particles and $\\pi^0$'s. Using previously published ALEPH results on\nfinal states with charged and neutral kaons, corrections are applied to the\nhadronic channels to derive branching ratios for exclusive final states without\nkaons. Thus the analyses of the full LEP-1 ALEPH data are combined to yield a\ncomplete description of $\\tau$ decays, encompassing 22 non-strange and 11\nstrange hadronic modes. Some physics implications of the results are given, in\nparticular related to universality in the leptonic charged weak current,\nisospin invariance in $a_1$ decays, and the separation of vector and\naxial-vector components of the total hadronic rate. Finally, spectral functions\nare determined for the dominant hadronic modes and updates are given for\nseveral analyses.

It follows the idea that source\nand detector are identical. This will allow simultaneous measurements of 5\n$\\beta^-\\beta^-$ - and 4 $\\beta^+\\beta^+$ - emitters at once. Half-life limits\nfor neutrinoless double beta decay of Cd-116 and Te-130 can be improved by more\nthan one order of magnitude with respect to current limits and sensitivities on\nthe effective Majorana neutrino mass of less than 1 eV can be obtained.\nFurthermore, for the first time a realistic chance of observing double electron\ncapture processes exists. Additional searches for rare processes like the\n4-fold forbidden Cd-113 $\\beta$-decay, the electron capture of Te-123 and dark\nmatter detection can be performed. The achievable limits are evaluated for 10\nkg of such detectors and can be scaled accordingly towards higher detector\nmasses because of the modular design of the proposed experiment. \n\n"}

The 37Ar was released from the solid target by dissolution in\nacid, collected from this solution, purified, sealed into a small source, and\nbrought to the Baksan Neutrino Observatory where it was used to irradiate 13\ntonnes of gallium metal in the Russian-American gallium solar neutrino\nexperiment SAGE. Ten exposures of the gallium to the source, whose initial\nstrength was 409 +/- 2 kCi, were carried out during the period April to\nSeptember 2004. The 71Ge produced by the reaction 71Ga(nu_e,e^-)71Ge was\nextracted, purified, and counted. The measured production rate was 11.0 ^+1.0\n_-0.9 (stat) +/- 0.6 (syst) atoms of 71Ge/d, which is 0.79 ^+0.09_-0.10 of the\ntheoretically calculated production rate. When all neutrino source experiments\nwith gallium are considered together, there is an indication the theoretical\ncross section has been overestimated. \n\n"}

Abstract: We calculate the Gaussian radius parameters of the pion-emitting source in\nhigh energy heavy ion collisions, assuming a first order phase transition from\na thermalized Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) to a gas of hadrons. Such a model leads\nto a very long-lived dissipative hadronic rescattering phase which dominates\nthe properties of the two-pion correlation functions. The radii are found to\ndepend only weakly on the thermalization time tau_i, the critical temperature\nT_c (and thus the latent heat), and the specific entropy of the QGP. The\ndissipative hadronic stage enforces large variations of the pion emission times\naround the mean. Therefore, the model calculations suggest a rapid increase of\nR_out/R_side as a function of K_T if a thermalized QGP were formed. \n\n"}

This two-body current is the dominant\nuncertainty of every low energy weak interaction deuteron breakup process,\nincluding SNO's CC and NC reactions. Our method shows that the theoretical\ninputs to SNO's determination of the CC and NC fluxes can be self-calibrated,\nbe calibrated by SK, or be calibrated by reactor data. The only assumption made\nis that the total flux of active neutrinos has the standard ^8B spectral shape\n(but distortions in the electron neutrino spectrum are allowed). We show that\nSNO's conclusion about the inconsistency of the no-flavor-conversion hypothesis\ndoes not contain significant theoretical uncertainty, and we determine the\nmagnitude of the active solar neutrino flux. \n\n"}
