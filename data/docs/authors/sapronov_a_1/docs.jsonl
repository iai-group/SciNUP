The simplest model\nrelies on two scalar fields, whose entropy perturbation leads to a\nscale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations. The ekpyrotic solution has a\ntachyonic instability along the entropy field direction which, a priori,\nappears to require fine-tuning of the initial conditions. In this paper, we\nshow that these can be achieved naturally by adding a small positive mass term\nfor the tachyonic field and coupling to light fermions. Then, for a wide range\nof initial conditions, the tachyonic field gets stabilized with the appropriate\nvalues well before the onset of the ekpyrotic phase. Furthermore, we show that\nekpyrotic theory is successful in solving the flatness, horizon and homogeneity\nproblems of standard big bang cosmology. Motivated by the analysis of the\ntachyonic instability, we propose a simplification of the model in terms of new\nfield variables. Instead of requiring two exponential potentials, one for each\nscalar field, it suffices to consider a single nearly exponential potential for\none of the fields and a tachyonic mass term along the orthogonal direction in\nfield space. All other terms in the potential are essentially arbitrary. This\ngreatly widens the class of ekpyrotic potentials and allows substantial freedom\nin determining the spectral index and possible non-Gaussianity.

Integrating out these fermions at tree level we derive general\nformulae that can be used in any model containing such particles.

In particular we demonstrate explicitly that this protection is not\nspoiled by the mixing of the SM quarks with the KK fermions, which is\nguaranteed by the underlying P_LR symmetry.

In this study we propose an alternative scenario for the\nanomalous transport within the context of the slave-particle approach. Although\nthe marginal Fermi-liquid phenomenology was interpreted previously within\ndeconfinement of the compact gauge theory, referred to as the strange metal\nphase, we start from confinement, introducing the Polyakov-loop parameter into\nan SU(2) gauge theory formulation of the t-J model.

Because of that, the LHC experiments measure inclusive Higgs rates\nthat all must exactly agree with Standard Model predictions due to sum rules.\nWe show that if the dark sector and Standard Model communicate only via the\nsinglet messenger scalar that mixes with the Higgs, the spin independent direct\ndetection cross section of dark matter is suppressed by the scalar mass\ndegeneracy, explaining its non-observation so far. \n\n"}

Dilatons, Scale\n  Anomalies and Conformal Methods Abstract: The principal goal of the physics of the fundamental interactions is to\nprovide a consistent description of the nature of the subnuclear forces, which\nmanifest in our universe, together with the gravitational force, in a unified\nframework. This attempt, which is far from being complete, is characterized by\ntwo milestones, the Standard Model of the elementary particles and the\nEinstein's theory of General Relativity. The coupling of a quantum field\ntheory, such as the Standard Model, to a weak gravitational background provides\nsignificant information concerning the coupling of matter to gravity and allows\nto study in a systematic way the origin of the conformal anomaly. For this\nreason, the computation of correlation functions in a weak gravitational\nbackground is of remarkable interest and the consequences of this analysis are\nalso of phenomenological relevance. For instance, they concern the appearance\nin the spectrum of the theory of a composite state, the dilaton, which is\nidentified, in perturbation theory, by an infrared coupled anomaly pole. The\nstudy of some applications of the methods discussed so far is presented in the\nsecond part of this thesis. In particular it is shown that the analysis of the\nclassical metric perturbations in gravity can be related to some specific field\ntheories via a holographic mapping. This requires the computation of\ncorrelators of energy-momentum tensors in $d=3$ dimensions and plays a role in\nthe study of the non-gaussianities of the cosmic background radiation in the\nearly universe. Finally, we mention an application in momentum space of the\nconstraints derived from the conformal symmetry in the characterization of some\ncorrelation functions. This relies on the solution of a system of second order\npartial differential equations for a certain class of generalized\nhypergeometric functions of two variables. \n\n"}

We provide an explanation of the excess in terms of\nresummation of large logarithms that arise from a jet-veto condition, i.e., the\nrejection of high-pT jets with pT > pT(veto) that is imposed in the\nexperimental analyses to reduce backgrounds.

For the first time we study all regimes possible on the\nlevel of momentum distribution functions, which we obtain by solving a system\nof Boltzmann equations. These quantities contain the full information about the\nproduction process, which allows us to not only track the evolution of the DM\ngeneration but to also take into account all bounds related to the spectrum,\nsuch as constraints from structure formation or from avoiding too much dark\nradiation. In particular we show that this simple production mechanism can,\ndepending on the regime, lead to strongly non-thermal DM spectra which may even\nfeature more than one peak in the momentum distribution. These cases could have\nparticularly interesting consequences for cosmological structure formation, as\ntheir analysis requires more refined tools than the simplistic estimate using\nthe free-streaming horizon.

In\nparticular, we address its subtle issues as well. Unlike the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard model (MSSM), the Next to MSSM (NMSSM) can be scale\ninvariant and has no mass parameter in its Lagrangian before SUSY and gauge\nsymmetry breakings. Therefore, the NMSSM is a perfect framework for\nsuper-natural SUSY. To give the SUSY breaking soft mass to the singlet, we\nconsider the moduli and dilaton dominant SUSY breaking scenarios in M-theory on\n$S^1/Z_2$. In these scenarios, SUSY is broken by one and only one $F$-term of\nmoduli or dilaton, and the SUSY breaking soft terms can be determined via the\nK\\\"ahler potential and superpotential from Calabi-Yau compactification of\nM-theory on $S^1/Z_2$. Thus, as predicted by super-natural SUSY, the SUSY\nelectroweak fine-tuning measure is of unity order. In the moduli dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the right-handed sleptons are relatively light around 1 TeV,\nstau can be even as light as 580 GeV and degenerate with the lightest\nneutralino, chargino masses are larger than 1 TeV, the light stop masses are\naround 2 TeV or larger, the first two-generation squark masses are about 3 TeV\nor larger, and gluinos are heavier than squarks. In the dilaton dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the qualitative picture remain the same but we have heavier\nspectra as compared to moduli dominant SUSY breaking scenario. In addition to\nit, we have Higgs $H_{2}/A_{1}$-resonance solutions for dark matter (DM). In\nboth scenarios, the minimal value of DM relic density is about 0.2. To obtain\nthe observed DM relic density, we can consider the dilution effect from\nsupercritical string cosmology or introduce the axino as the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle. \n\n"}

Motivated by these\nobservations, people begun considering new inflationary models which may lead\nto statistical anisotropy. The simplest possible way to construct anisotropic\ninflation is to introduce vector fields. During the course of this thesis, we\nstudy models of anisotropic inflation and their observational implications such\nas power spectrum, bispectrum etc. Firstly we build a new model, which contains\nthe gauge field which breaks the conformal invariance while preserving the\ngauge invariance. We show that in these kind of models, there can be an\nattractor phase in the evolution of the system when the back-reaction of the\ngauge field becomes important in the evolution of the inflaton field.

Since the transport coefficients, related to\ndrag and diffusion processes are the main ingredients in the FP equation, the\nevolution of HQs is thus effectively controlled by them. At the initial stage\nof the relativistic heavy ion collisions, asymptotic weak-coupling causes the\nfree-streaming motions of partons in the beam direction and the expansion in\ntransverse directions are almost frozen, hence an anisotropy in the momentum\nspace sets in. Since HQs are too produced in the same time therefore the study\nof the effect of momentum anisotropy on the drag and diffusion coefficients\nbecomes advertently desirable. In this article we have thus studied the drag\nand diffusion of HQs in the anisotropic medium and found that the presence of\nthe anisotropy reduces both drag and diffusion coefficients. In addition, the\nanisotropy introduces an angular dependence to both the drag and diffusion\ncoefficients, as a result both coefficients get inflated when the partons are\nmoving transverse to the direction of anisotropy than parallel to the direction\nof anisotropy. \n\n"}

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today.

The BS provides the dynamical\norigin of the electroweak symmetry breaking, triggered by mixing between the\nelementary Higgs and a composite Higgs generated by a new-color strong\ndynamics, hypercolor (HC). At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale\ninvariance assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the \"chiral\"\nsymmetry present in the HC sector. In addition to the composite Higgs, HC\nbaryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken HC baryon\nnumber symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of\ninterest in the present scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC\nbaryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit \"chiral\"-breaking effect triggered\nafter the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions.\nAs in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was\nnever in the thermal equilibrium, which ends up with no thermal abundance. It\nis then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes into the game below\nthe HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs\nvia the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma\nbelow the HC scale, which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the\ncomposite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic bound placed in the\nconventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic\nabundance.

Because their\nstructures are related to the fundamental properties of QCD, studying exotic\nhadrons is currently one of the most active areas of research in hadron\nphysics. Experiments carried out at various accelerator facilities have\nindicated that some exotic hadrons may have already been produced. The present\nreview is a summary of the current understanding of a selected set of exotic\nparticle candidates that can be potentially measured in HIC. It also includes\ndiscussions on the production of exotic hadrons in HIC based on the coalescence\nand statistical models. A more detailed discussion leads to the conclusion that\nthe yield of a hadron is typically an order of magnitude smaller when it is a\ncompact multiquark state than that of an excited hadronic state with normal\nquark numbers and/or a molecular configuration.

Since the DM only interacts by transitioning to a heavier state,\nfreeze-out proceeds via coannihilation and the unstable heavier state is\ndepleted at later times. For sufficiently large mass splittings, direct\ndetection is kinematically forbidden and indirect detection is impossible, so\nthis scenario can only be tested with accelerators. Here we propose new\nsearches at proton and electron beam fixed-target experiments to probe sub-GeV\ncoannihilation, exploiting the distinctive signals of up- and down-scattering\nas well as decay of the excited state inside the detector volume.

The initial stage of\noperation focuses on top-quark pair production measurements, as well as the\nsearch for rare flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) top-quark decays. It\nalso includes a top-quark pair production threshold scan around 350 GeV which\nprovides a precise measurement of the top-quark mass in a well-defined\ntheoretical framework. At the higher-energy stages, studies are made of\ntop-quark pairs produced in association with other particles. A study of ttH\nproduction including the extraction of the top Yukawa coupling is presented as\nwell as a study of vector boson fusion (VBF) production, which gives direct\naccess to high-energy electroweak interactions. Operation above 1 TeV leads to\nmore highly collimated jet environments where dedicated methods are used to\nanalyse the jet constituents. These techniques enable studies of the top-quark\npair production, and hence the sensitivity to BSM physics, to be extended to\nhigher energies. This paper also includes phenomenological interpretations that\nmay be performed using the results from the extensive top-quark physics\nprogramme at CLIC. \n\n"}

Abstract: For a broad range of parameter values, braneworld models display a remarkable\nproperty which we call cosmic mimicry. Cosmic mimicry is characterized by the\nfact that, at low redshifts, the Hubble parameter in the braneworld model is\nvirtually indistinguishable from that in the LCDM cosmology. An important point\nto note is that the \\Omega_m parameters in the braneworld model and in the LCDM\ncosmology can nevertheless be quite different. Thus, at high redshifts (early\ntimes), the braneworld asymptotically expands like a matter-dominated universe\nwith the value of \\Omega_m inferred from the observations of the local matter\ndensity. At low redshifts (late times), the braneworld model behaves almost\nexactly like the LCDM model but with a renormalized value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter \\Omega_m^{LCDM}. The redshift which characterizes cosmic\nmimicry is related to the parameters in the higher-dimensional braneworld\nLagrangian. Cosmic mimicry is a natural consequence of the scale-dependence of\ngravity in braneworld models. The change in the value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter is shown to be related to the spatial dependence of the\neffective gravitational constant in braneworld theory. A subclass of mimicry\nmodels lead to an older age of the universe and also predict a redshift of\nreionization which is lower than z_{reion} \\simeq 17 in the LCDM cosmology.\nThese models might therefore provide a background cosmology which is in better\nagreement both with the observed quasar abundance at z \\gsim 4 and with the\nlarge optical depth to reionization measured by the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe. \n\n"}

This maximum is unique to heavy ion\ncollisions, and has no equivalent in elementary particle collisions.\n  The appearance of the maximum is due to the energy dependence of the chemical\nfreeze-out parameters and is clearly seen as a pronounced peak in the\nWroblewski factor as a function of the incident energy as well as in the\nbehavior of the K+/pi+ ratio. Below 30 A.GeV strange baryons contribute\nstrongly because of the very large value of the chemical potential muB.\n  As the energy increases, the decrease of the baryon chemical potential\ncoupled with only moderate increases in the associated temperature causes a\ndecline in the relative number of strange baryons above energies of about 30\nA.GeV leading to very pronounced maxima in the Lambda/pi+ and Xi-/pi+ ratios. \n\n"}

Supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the visible\nsector via the same fields that are responsible for gauge symmetry breaking\nrather than by vector-like quarks and leptons as in the conventional GMSB\nmodels. These models have a number of attractive properties such as exact\nR-parity conservation, non-vanishing neutrino masses and a solution to the\nSUSYCP (and strong CP) problem. In this paper, we present the detailed\nsparticle spectroscopy and phenomenological implications of the various models\nof this class that embody the general spirit of our previous work but use a\nlarger variety of messenger fields. A distinct characteristic of this class of\nmodels is that unlike the conventional GMSB ones, the lightest neutralino is\nalways the NLSP leading to photonic events in the colliders. \n\n"}

The\n  SO(10) and E_6 Models Abstract: We give a classification of 3-family SO(10) and E_6 grand unification in\nstring theory within the framework of conformal field theory and asymmetric\norbifolds. We argue that the construction of such models in the heterotic\nstring theory requires certain Z_6 asymmetric orbifolds that include a Z_3\nouter-automorphism, the latter yielding a level-3 current algebra for the grand\nunification gauge group SO(10) or E_6. We then classify all such Z_6 asymmetric\norbifolds that result in models with a non-abelian hidden sector. All models\nclassified in this paper have only one adjoint (but no other higher\nrepresentation) Higgs field in the grand unified gauge group. In addition, all\nof them are completely anomaly free. There are two types of such 3-family\nmodels. The first type consists of the unique SO(10) model with SU(2) X SU(2) X\nSU(2) as its hidden sector (which is not asymptotically-free at the string\nscale). This SO(10) model has 4 left-handed and 1 right-handed 16s. The second\ntype is described by a moduli space containing 17 models (distinguished by\ntheir massless spectra). All these models have an SU(2) hidden sector, and 5\nleft-handed and 2 right-handed families in the grand unified gauge group. One\nof these models is the unique E_6 model with an asymptotically-free SU(2)\nhidden sector. The others are SO(10) models, 8 of them with an asymptotically\nfree hidden sector at the string scale. \n\n"}

The reaction operator approach also\nleads to a simple algebraic proof of the ``color triviality'' of single\ninclusive distributions and to a solvable set of recursion relations. The\nanalytic solution generalizes previous continuum solutions (BDMPS) for\napplications to mesoscopic QCD plasmas. The solution is furthermore not\nrestricted to uncorrelated geometries and allows for evolving screening scales\nas well as the inclusion of finite kinematic constraints. The later is\nparticularly important because below LHC energies the kinematic constraints\nsignificantly decrease the non-abelian energy loss. Our solution for the\ninclusive distribution also generalizes the finite order exclusive (tagged)\ndistribution case studied previously (GLV1). The form of the analytic solution\nis well suited for numerical implementation in Monte Carlo event generators to\nenable more accurate calculations of jet quenching in ultra-relativistic\nnuclear collisions. Numerical results illustrating the constributions of the\nfirst three orders in opacity are compared to the ``self-quenching'' hard\nradiation intensity.
