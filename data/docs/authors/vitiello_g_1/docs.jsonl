We are mainly\nconsidering higher spin gauge fields in their own right as free-standing\ntheoretical constructs and not circumstances where they occur as part of\nanother system. Considering the problem of introducing interactions among\nhigher spin gauge fields, there has historically been two broad avenues of\napproach. One approach entails gauging a non-Abelian global symmetry algebra,\nin the process making it local. The other approach entails deforming an already\nlocal but Abelian gauge algebra, in the process making it non-Abelian. In cases\nwhere both avenues have been explored, such as for spin 1 and 2 gauge fields,\nthe results agree (barring conceptual and technical issues) with Yang-Mills\ntheory and Einstein gravity. In the case of an infinite tower of higher spin\ngauge fields, the first approach has been thoroughly developed and explored by\nM. Vasiliev, whereas the second approach, after having lain dormant for a long\ntime, has received new attention by several authors lately. In the present\npaper we briefly review some aspects of the history of higher spin gauge fields\nas a backdrop to an attempt at comparing the gauging vs. deforming approaches.\nA common unifying structure of strongly homotopy Lie algebras underlying both\napproaches will be discussed. The modern deformation approach, using BRST-BV\nmethods, will be described as far as it is developed at the present time. The\nfirst steps of a formulation in the categorical language of operads will be\noutlined. A few aspects of the subject that seems not to have been thoroughly\ninvestigated are pointed out. \n\n"}

The effect is due to graviton-ghost\ncondensates arising from the interference of quantum coherent states. The\ntheory is constructed as follows: Faddeev-Popov-De Witt gauged path integral ->\nfactorization of classical and quantum variables -> transition to the 1-loop\napproximation -> choice of ghost sector, satisfying 1-loop finiteness of the\ntheory off the mass shell. The Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY)\nchain for the spectral function of gravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to\nbuild a theory of gravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact\nsolutions of the equations that describe virtual graviton and ghost condensates\nas well as condensates of instanton fluctuations.

However, the explanations for a number of cosmological phenomena\nsuch as inflation, dark energy, symmetry breakings, and phase transitions need\nthe presence of classical scalar fields. Although the process of condensation\nof scalar fields in the lab is fairly well understood, the extension of results\nto a cosmological context is not trivial. Here we investigate the formation of\na condensate - a classical scalar field - after reheating of the Universe. We\nassume a light quantum scalar field produced by the decay of a heavy particle,\nwhich for simplicity is assumed to be another scalar. We show that during\nradiation domination epoch under certain conditions, the decay of the heavy\nparticle alone is sufficient for the production of a condensate. This process\nis very similar to preheating - the exponential particle production at the end\nof inflation. During matter domination epoch when the expansion of the Universe\nis faster, the decay alone can not keep the growing trend of the field and the\namplitude of the condensate decreases rapidly, unless there is a self\ninteraction. This issue is particularly important for dark energy. We show that\nquantum corrections of the self-interaction play a crucial role in this\nprocess. Notably, they induce an effective action which includes inverse\npower-law terms, and therefore can lead to a tracking behaviour even when the\nclassical self-interaction is a simple power-law of order 3 or 4. This removes\nthe necessity of having nonrenormalisable terms in the Lagrangian.

The D-particle foam model involves point-like brane defects\n(D-particles), which provide the topologically non-trivial foamy structures of\nspace-time.

We show that such a type of stochastic space-time foam can lead\nto acceptable cosmologies at late epochs of the Universe, due to the\nnon-trivial properties of the supersymmetric (BPS like) D-particle defects,\nwhich are such so as not to affect significantly the Hubble expansion.

The\nbranch cut is also useful for the calculation of the self-force on a point\nparticle moving in the Schwarzschild background. In this paper we use\ntechniques of analytic-continuation to the complex plane of the radial\ncoordinate in order to calculate the branch cut contribution to the Green\nfunction in the limit of large imaginary frequency. It is expected that the\ncontribution of this frequency regime to the perturbation response and to the\nself-force will be mostly for short time intervals. We also determine the\nhighly-damped quasinormal mode frequencies for electromagnetic perturbations in\nSchwarzschild for the first time (previously only the leading imaginary part\nwas known), which seem to have a 'deep connection' with the branch cut.

Although we failed to find exactly gapless non-Abelian modes,\nnon-Abelian rotational quasigapless excitations are argued to exist on the mass\nvortices in the B phase of the superfluid 3He, due to the fact that the order\nparameter in 3He-B is tensorial. While the U(1) rotational excitations are well\nestablished in vortices with asymmetric cores, the non-Abelian rotational\nexcitations belonging to the same family were not considered. In the general\ncase they are coupled with the translational modes. \n\n"}

Separately, recent experiments in fluid mechanics have demonstrated\nthe emergence of a full range of quantum phenomena from completely classical\nmotion. We present two specific hypotheses. First, Kuramoto theory may give a\nbasis for geometrical thinking about entanglement. Second, we consider a recent\nsoliton model of the electron, in which the quantum-mechanical wave function is\na phase modulation of a carrier wave. Both models are consistent with one\nanother and with observation. Both models suggest how entanglement and\ndecoherence may be related to device geometry. Both models predict that it will\nbe difficult to maintain phase coherence of more than three qubits in the\nplane, or four qubits in a three-dimensional structure.

A characteristic\nfeature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but\nopposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General\nRelativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure.\nTherefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be\nresponsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity. We test this possibility in the\ncontext of the \\textit{Gravitational Aether} proposal, using current\ncosmological observations, which probe the gravity of relativistic pressure in\nthe radiation era.

For example, a $2\\to4$\ngluon scattering process has a singularity in which each incoming gluon splits\ninto a pair of gluons, followed by a pair of $2\\to2$ collisions between the\ngluon pairs. This singularity mimics double parton scattering because it occurs\nwhen the transverse momentum of a pair of outgoing gluons vanishes. The\nsingularity is logarithmic at fixed order in perturbation theory. We exploit\nthe duality between scattering amplitudes and polygonal Wilson loops to study\nsix-point amplitudes in this limit to high loop order in planar ${\\cal N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory. The singular configuration corresponds to the limit in\nwhich a hexagonal Wilson loop develops a self-crossing. The singular terms are\ngoverned by an evolution equation, in which the hexagon mixes into a pair of\nboxes; the mixing back is suppressed in the planar (large $N_c$) limit.

It follows\nthat the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include\nnon-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot\ncarry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization;\none thus faces a quantum representation problem of gravitational observables.\nThis has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we\ninvestigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that\nfails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on\nstandard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any\nsolutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is\nto refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes\ncontinuous. In the toy model, it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type\ntopology, as e.g. used in loop gravity, is sufficient. Basing quantization of\nthe toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac\nobservables and a suitable semiclassical limit.

First, for frequencies that differ from the\nsingle-particle energy by terms of order ${\\cal O}(q)$ (i.e., small deviations\ncompared to the single-particle energy), the dynamic structure factor is\ndescribed by the impulse approximation of Hohenberg and Platzman. Second,\ndeviations of order ${\\cal O}(q^2)$ (i.e., of the same order or larger than the\nsingle-particle energy) are described by the operator product expansion, with a\nuniversal crossover connecting both regimes. The scaling is consistent with a\nnumber of sum rules in the large momentum limit. Furthermore, we derive an\nexact expression for the shift and width of the single-particle peak at large\nmomentum due to interactions, thus extending a result by Beliaev [JETP 7, 299\n(1958)] for the low-density Bose gas to arbitrary values of the scattering\nlength $a$. The shift exhibits a maximum around $qa \\simeq 1$, which is\nconnected with a maximum in the static structure factor due to strong\nshort-range correlations. For Bose gases with moderate interaction strengths,\nthe theoretically predicted shift is consistent with the value observed by Papp\net al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 135301 (2008)].

In various fields -- e.g. quantum\ninformation theory -- one frequently encounters constructions that rely on\nmatrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices\nto sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This\nresults in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent\nunitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford\ngroup. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a\n4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which\nthe Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design.

A\nstronger statement is that these (quantum) degrees of freedom live on the\nboundary and describe the physics inside the volume completely. The obvious\nquestion is, what mechanism is behind the holographic principle. Recently, 't\nHooft argued that the quantum degrees of freedom on the boundary are not\nfundamental. We argue that this interpretation opens up the possibility that\nthe mapping between the theory in the bulk (the holographic theory) and the\ntheory on the screen (the dual theory) is always given by a (generalized)\nprocedure of stochastic quantization. We show that gravity causes differences\nto the situation in Minkowski/Euclidean spacetime and argue that the fictitious\ncoordinate needed in the stochastic quantization procedure can be spatial. The\ndiffusion coefficient of the stochastic process is in general a function of\nthis coordinate. While a mapping of a bulk theory onto a (quantum) boundary\ntheory can be possible, such a mapping does not make sense in spacetimes in\nwhich the area of the screen is growing with time. This is connected to the\naverage process in the formalism of stochastic quantization.

Abstract: Entanglement entropy is often speculated as a strong candidate for the origin\nof the black-hole entropy. To judge whether this speculation is true or not, it\nis effective to investigate the whole structure of thermodynamics obtained from\nthe entanglement entropy, rather than just to examine the apparent structure of\nthe entropy alone or to compare it with that of the black hole entropy. It is\nbecause entropy acquires a physical significance only when it is related to the\nenergy and the temperature of a system. From this point of view, we construct a\n`thermodynamics of entanglement' by introducing an entanglement energy and\ncompare it with the black-hole thermodynamics. We consider two possible\ndefinitions of entanglement energy. Then we construct two different kinds of\nthermodynamics by combining each of these different definitions of entanglement\nenergy with the entanglement entropy. We find that both of these two kinds of\nthermodynamics show significant differences from the black-hole thermodynamics\nif no gravitational effects are taken into account. These differences are in\nparticular highlighted in the context of the third law of thermodynamics.\nFinally we see how inclusion of gravity alter the thermodynamics of the\nentanglement. We give a suggestive argument that the thermodynamics of the\nentanglement behaves like the black-hole thermodynamics if the gravitational\neffects are included properly.

The\nmodel is used to explain eye movements when tracking moving targets. Using a\nRecurrent Quantum Neural Network(RQNN) while simulating the quantum brain\nmodel, two very interesting phenomena are observed. First, as eye sensor data\nis processed in a classical brain, a wave packet is triggered in the quantum\nbrain. This wave packet moves like a particle. Second, when the eye tracks a\nfixed target, this wave packet moves not in a continuous but rather in a\ndiscrete mode. This result reminds one of the saccadic movements of the eye\nconsisting of 'jumps' and 'rests'. However, such a saccadic movement is\nintertwined with smooth pursuit movements when the eye has to track a dynamic\ntrajectory.
