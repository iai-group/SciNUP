In quantum\ninformation processing with solid state qubits, decoherence significantly\nlimits the performances of such devices. Therefore, it is necessary to fully\nunderstand the mechanisms that lead to decoherence. In this review we discuss\nhow decoherence affects two of the most successful realizations of solid state\nqubits, namely, spin-qubits and superconducting qubits. In the former, the\nqubit is encoded in the spin 1/2 of the electron, and it is implemented by\nconfining the electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. Superconducting\ndevices show quantum behavior at low temperatures, and the qubit is encoded in\nthe two lowest energy levels of a superconducting circuit. The electron spin in\na quantum dot has two main decoherence channels, a (Markovian) phonon-assisted\nrelaxation channel, due to the presence of a spin-orbit interaction, and a\n(non-Markovian) spin bath constituted by the spins of the nuclei in the quantum\ndot that interact with the electron spin via the hyperfine interaction.

Then we show that this generalized (and thus\nbroader) class of hash functions is in fact sufficient for the security of\nquantum cryptography. This result can be explained in two different formalisms.\nFirst, by noting its relation to the \\delta-biased family introduced by Dodis\nand Smith, we demonstrate that Renner's two-universal hashing lemma is\ngeneralized to our class of hash functions. Next, we prove that the proof\ntechnique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)\nsystems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy\namplification.

Therefore, the\nDirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth-order partial differential\nequation for one real function (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys. v.52, 082303\n(2011)). These results both belong in textbooks and can be used for development\nof new efficient methods of quantum chemistry.

Geometric\nmeasure of quantum discord is another measure of quantum correlations.\nRecently, the geometric quantum discord for multipartite states has been\nintroduced by Jianwei Xu [arxiv:quant/ph.1205.0330]. Motivated from the recent\nstudy [Ann. Phys. 327 (2012) 851] for the bipartite systems, I have\ninvestigated global quantum discord (QD) and geometric quantum discord (GQD)\nunder the influence of external environments for different multipartite states.\nWerner-GHZ type three-qubit and six-qubit states are considered in inertial and\nnon-inertial settings. The dynamics of QD and GQD is investigated under\namplitude damping, phase damping, depolarizing and flipping channels. It is\nseen that the quantum discord vanishes for p>0.75 in case of three-qubit GHZ\nstates and for p>0.5 for six qubit GHZ states. This implies that multipartite\nstates are more fragile to decoherence for higher values of N. Surprisingly, a\nrapid sudden death of discord occurs in case of phase flip channel. However,\nfor bit flip channel, no sudden death happens for the six-qubit states. On the\nother hand, depolarizing channel heavily influences the QD and GQD as compared\nto the amplitude damping channel. It means that the depolarizing channel has\nthe most destructive influence on the discords for multipartite states. From\nthe perspective of accelerated observers, it is seen that effect of environment\non QD and GQD is much stronger than that of the acceleration of non-inertial\nframes. The degradation of QD and GQD happens due to Unruh effect. Furthermore,\nQD exhibits more robustness than GQD when the multipartite systems are exposed\nto environment. \n\n"}

One might then wonder, does this\nquantum circuit produce a state that is separable or entangled? Here, we give\nevidence that it is computationally hard to decide the answer to this question,\neven if one has access to the power of quantum computation. We begin by\nexhibiting a two-message quantum interactive proof system that can decide the\nanswer to a promise version of the question. We then prove that the promise\nproblem is hard for the class of promise problems with \"quantum statistical\nzero knowledge\" (QSZK) proof systems by demonstrating a polynomial-time Karp\nreduction from the QSZK-complete promise problem \"quantum state\ndistinguishability\" to our quantum separability problem. By exploiting Knill's\nefficient encoding of a matrix description of a state into a description of a\ncircuit to generate the state, we can show that our promise problem is NP-hard\nwith respect to Cook reductions. Thus, the quantum separability problem (as\nphrased above) constitutes the first nontrivial promise problem decidable by a\ntwo-message quantum interactive proof system while being hard for both NP and\nQSZK.

We\ncall negation in this mode the mark, as it operates on itself to change from\nmarked to unmarked states.

However, since over a decade now,\nvariations of it are also routinely being implemented with ultracold atoms in\noptical lattices. We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a\nfocus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an\nintroduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss\nbriefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended\nBose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites,\nnext-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the\nimportance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding\napproximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the\nmodels to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects\nthe density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site\ninteraction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both\ncontact and dipolar interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, also\nthe effects related to higher Bloch bands become important even for deep\noptical lattices. Different approaches that aim at incorporating these effects,\nmainly via dressing the basis Wannier functions with interactions, leading to\neffective, density-dependent Hubbard-type models, are reviewed. We discuss also\nexamples of Hubbard-like models that explicitly involve higher $p$-orbitals, as\nwell as models that couple dynamically spin and orbital degrees of freedom.\nFinally, we review mean-field nonlinear-Schr\\\"odinger models of the Salerno\ntype that share with the non-standard Hubbard models the nonlinear coupling\nbetween the adjacent sites. In that part, discrete solitons are the main\nsubject of the consideration. We conclude by listing some future open problems. \n\n"}

Standard perturbation theory is implemented to locate the\nparameter range where the MI-SF transition may be simulated. This simulator\nallows single-site manipulations and we illustrate this feature by considering\ntwo scenarios where a single-site manipulation can drive a MI-SF transition.\nThe transition can be analyzed by mean-field analyses, and the exact\ndiagonalization was implemented to provide accurate results. The variance of\nthe photon density and the fidelity metric clearly show signatures of the\ntransition.

Thus lowering the\ntemperature of one of the thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard\nthe entanglement between the oscillators.

Our main focus is on optimizing\nthe memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by\nthe limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three\nmain techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing\nclassical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first,\nwherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to\nmodify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is\nintroduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing\nto clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to \"garbage collection\" for\nreversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to\ntransform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space\nconstraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed.\n  We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a\nsubset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which\ncan then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific\nlanguage for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#.

Unfortunately, compiling\n(embedding) an optimization problem into the annealing hardware is itself a\ndifficult optimization problem and a major bottleneck currently preventing\nwidespread adoption. Additionally, while finding a single embedding is\ndifficult, no generalized method is known for tuning embeddings to use minimal\nhardware resources. To address these barriers, we introduce a graph-theoretic\nframework for developing structured embedding algorithms. Using this framework,\nwe introduce a biclique virtual hardware layer to provide a simplified\ninterface to the physical hardware. Additionally, we exploit bipartite\nstructure in quantum programs using odd cycle transversal (OCT) decompositions.\nBy coupling an OCT-based embedding algorithm with new, generalized reduction\nmethods, we develop a new baseline for embedding a wide range of optimization\nproblems into fault-free D-Wave annealing hardware.

One of its critical properties is that it\nobeys a data processing inequality: the measure does not decrease under the\naction of a quantum channel on the underlying states. In this paper, I prove a\nrefinement of this data processing inequality that includes an additional term\nrelated to recoverability. That is, if the increase in the measure is small\nafter the action of a partial trace, then one of the states can be nearly\nrecovered by the Petz recovery channel, while the other state is perfectly\nrecovered by the same channel. The refinement is given in terms of the trace\ndistance of one of the states to its recovered version and also depends on the\nminimum eigenvalue of the other state.

A crucial step is to use natural,\nlow-weight operations with an ancilla to extract information about errors\nwithout causing backaction on the encoded system. Essentially, ancilla errors\nmust not propagate to the encoded system and induce errors beyond those which\ncan be corrected. The current schemes for achieving this fault-tolerance to\nancilla errors come at the cost of increased overhead requirements. An\nefficient way to extract error syndromes in a fault-tolerant manner is by using\na single ancilla with strongly biased noise channel. Typically, however,\nrequired elementary operations can become challenging when the noise is\nextremely biased. We propose to overcome this shortcoming by using a\nbosonic-cat ancilla in a parametrically driven nonlinear cavity. Such a\ncat-qubit experiences only bit-flip noise and is stabilized against\nphase-flips. To highlight the flexibility of this approach, we illustrate the\nsyndrome extraction process in a variety of codes such as qubit-based toric\ncodes, bosonic cat- and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes.

This mechanism has been\nextensively explored for classical and quantum systems in equilibrium, whose\ncritical behavior is described by a general theory of phase transitions.\nRecently, however, fundamentally distinct phase transitions have been\ndiscovered for out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, which can exhibit critical\nbehavior that defies this description and is not well understood. A\nparadigmatic example is the many-body-localization (MBL) transition, which\nmarks the breakdown of quantum thermalization. Characterizing quantum critical\nbehavior in an MBL system requires the measurement of its entanglement\nproperties over space and time, which has proven experimentally challenging due\nto stringent requirements on quantum state preparation and system isolation.\nHere, we observe quantum critical behavior at the MBL transition in a\ndisordered Bose-Hubbard system and characterize its entanglement properties via\nits quantum correlations. We observe strong correlations, whose emergence is\naccompanied by the onset of anomalous diffusive transport throughout the\nsystem, and verify their critical nature by measuring their system-size\ndependence. The correlations extend to high orders in the quantum critical\nregime and appear to form via a sparse network of many-body resonances that\nspans the entire system.

To stabilize against this influence beyond\nsimply increasing the bulk gap, it has been proposed to harness suitable\nnotions of disorder. Equipped with numerical tools for constructing locally\nconserved operators that we introduce, we comprehensively explore the interplay\nof local interactions and disorder on localized edge modes in the XZX cluster\nHamiltonian.

In\nprinciple, both classical and quantum protocols can be used for this\nprocessing. It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful.\nWe prove for general states but under the assumption of incoherent\neavesdropping that Alice and Bob share some so-called intrinsic information in\ntheir classical random variables, resulting from optimal measurements, if and\nonly if the parties' quantum systems are entangled. In addition, we provide\nevidence that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal in\nevery situation. Consequently, many techniques and results from quantum\ninformation theory directly apply to problems in classical information theory,\nand vice versa. For instance, it was previously believed that two parties can\ncarry out unconditionally secure key agreement as long as they share some\nintrinsic information in the adversary's view.

Following the\nresults of Carollo and Palma it is proved that it is impossible to distinguish\neven only one such a Bell state with certainty (i.e., with the probability of\nsuccess equal to one), irrespective of how many auxiliary photons are involved.\nHowever, it is shown that auxiliary photons can help to discriminate the Bell\nstates of qudits with the high probability of success: A Bell-state analyzer\nbased on the idea of linear optics quantum computation that can achieve the\nprobability of success arbitrarily close to one is described.

The strategy chosen is to begin by\nfocusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms, i.e., the\nclass of abelian algorithms of the Shor/Simon genre. Our strategy is to make\nthis class of algorithms as mathematically transparent as possible. By the\nphrase \"mathematically transparent\" we mean to expose, to bring to the surface,\nand to make explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently\nand fundamentally a part of such algorithms. In so doing, we create symbolic\nabelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous to the those\nsymbolic algorithms found within such software packages as Axiom, Cayley,\nMaple, Mathematica, and Magma.\n  As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different generalizations of\nShor's quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian groups of finite rank. We\nrefer to these algorithms as wandering (or vintage Z_Q) Shor algorithms. They\nare essentially quantum algorithms on free abelian groups A of finite rank n\nwhich, with each iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand Z of\nthe group A and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm to\nproduce a random character of the \"approximating\" finite group A=Z_Q, called\nthe group probe. These characters are then in turn used to find either the\norder P of a maximal cyclic subgroup Z_P of the hidden quotient group H_phi, or\nthe entire hidden quotient group H_phi. An integral part of these wandering\nquantum algorithms is the selection of a very special random transversal, which\nwe refer to as a Shor transversal.

Abstract: It has long been known that to minimise the heat emitted by a deterministic\ncomputer during it's operation it is necessary to make the computation act in a\nlogically reversible manner\\cite{Lan61}. Such logically reversible operations\nrequire a number of auxiliary bits to be stored, maintaining a history of the\ncomputation, and which allows the initial state to be reconstructed by running\nthe computation in reverse. These auxiliary bits are wasteful of resources and\nmay require a dissipation of energy for them to be reused. A simple procedure\ndue to Bennett\\cite{Ben73} allows these auxiliary bits to be \"tidied\", without\ndissipating energy, on a classical computer. All reversible classical\ncomputations can be made tidy in this way. However, this procedure depends upon\na classical operation (\"cloning\") that cannot be generalised to quantum\ncomputers\\cite{WZ82}. Quantum computations must be logically reversible, and\ntherefore produce auxiliary qbits during their operation. We show that there\nare classes of quantum computation for which Bennett's procedure cannot be\nimplemented. For some of these computations there may exist another method for\nwhich the computation may be \"tidied\".

The time-dependent\noccupation probabilities p_i(t) are assumed to obey the nonlinear rate\nequations tau dp_i/dt=-p_i ln p_i+ alpha(t)p_i-beta(t)e_ip_i where alpha(t) and\nbeta(t) are functionals of the p_i(t)'s that maintain invariant the mean energy\nE=sum_i e_ip_i(t) and the normalization condition 1=sum_i p_i(t). The entropy\nS(t)=-k sum_i p_i(t) ln p_i(t) is a non-decreasing function of time until the\ninitially nonzero occupation probabilities reach a Boltzmann-like canonical\ndistribution over the occupied energy eigenstates. Initially zero occupation\nprobabilities, instead, remain zero at all times. The solutions p_i(t) of the\nrate equations are unique and well-defined for arbitrary initial conditions\np_i(0) and for all times. Existence and uniqueness both forward and backward in\ntime allows the reconstruction of the primordial lowest entropy state.

For example, a scale-up by a factor of 22, with gate error rate\nof order $10^{-5}$, is sufficient to permit large quantum algorithms such as\nfactorization of thousand-digit numbers. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9902015", "contents": "Title: Double Solution with Chaos: Dynamic Redundance and Causal Wave-Particle\n  Duality Abstract: A system of two interacting, physically real, initially homogeneous fields is\nconsidered as the simplest basis for the world construction in which one of\nthem, a 'protofield' of electromagnetic nature, is attracted to another\nprotofield, or medium, responsible for the eventually emerging gravitational\neffects. The interaction process is analysed within the generalised 'effective\n(optical) potential method' in which we avoid any usual perturbative reduction.\nIt then appears that for generic system parameters the protofields, instead of\nsimply 'falling' one onto another and forming a fixed 'bound state', are\nengaged in a self-sustained process of nonlinear pulsation, or 'quantum beat',\nconsisting in unceasing cycles of self-amplified auto-squeeze, or 'collapse'\n('reduction'), of a portion of the extended protofields to a small volume\nfollowed by the inverse phase of extension. Centres of consecutive reductions\nform the physical 'points' of thus emerging, intrinsically discrete space, and\neach of them is 'selected' by the system in a causally random fashion among\nmany equally possible versions (or 'realisations'). This is a manifestation of\nthe dynamic redundance forming the unified basis of dynamically complex\n(chaotic) behaviour of any real system with interaction (physics/9806002). The\nsequence of reduction events constitutes the elementary physical 'clock' of the\nworld providing it with the unceasing, intrinsically irreversible time flow.\nThe complex-dynamical quantum beat process in the system of two interacting\nprotofields is observed as the massive elementary particle (like the electron)\nwhich naturally possesses the property of physically real wave-particle duality\ncompleting the double solution concept of Louis de Broglie (see also\nquant-ph/9902016, gr-qc/9906077). \n\n"}
