The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface.

The microscopic mechanism behind the glass\ntransition is still poorly understood.

Shear stress, as temperature,\nfavors the fluid-like state, and must be also considered to define the system\n'jamming phase diagram' [1-4]. Frictionless athermal systems [1], for instance,\ncan be described by the zero temperature plane of the jamming diagram in the\ntemperature, density, stress space. Here we consider the jamming of athermal\nfrictional systems [8-13] such as granular materials, which are important to a\nnumber of applications from geophysics to industry.

In\nthis region a system may slip, or even flow with a steady velocity for a long\ntime in response to an applied stress, but then eventually jams.

First, the particle is driven by the rapid collisions with the\nsurrounding solvent molecules, referred to as thermal noise. Second, the\nfriction between the particle and the viscous solvent damps its motion.\nConventionally, the thermal force is assumed to be random and characterized by\na white noise spectrum. Friction is assumed to be given by the Stokes drag,\nimplying that motion is overdamped. However, as the particle receives momentum\nfrom the fluctuating fluid molecules, it also displaces the fluid in its\nimmediate vicinity. The entrained fluid acts back on the sphere and gives rise\nto long-range correlation. This hydrodynamic memory translates to thermal\nforces, which display a coloured noise spectrum. Even 100 years after Perrin's\npioneering experiments on Brownian motion, direct experimental observation of\nthis colour has remained elusive.

In order to\nexplain this better we construct general diffusive and non-diffusive frequency\nresponse of the gain in translocation time for a single particle in changing\nenvironments and look at some specific variations.

The statistical sum of a such plat is related\nhere to the partition function of a two-component anyon gas. The constraints\nthat preserve the topological configuration of the plat are imposed on the\npolymer trajectories using the so-called Gauss linking number, a topological\ninvariant that has already been well studied in polymer physics. Due to these\nconstraints, short-range forces act on the monomers or, equivalently, on the\nanyon quasiparticles in a way that closely resembles the appearance of reaction\nforces in the constrained systems of classical mechanics.

First we consider an ideal chain with harmonic\nsprings and no excluded volume between the monomers. The Rouse model of\npolymers is generalized to the case of self-propelled monomers and solved\nanalytically. The swelling, as characterized by the spatial extension of the\nchain, scales with the monomer number defining a Flory exponent $\\nu$ which is\n$\\nu =1/2, 0, 1$ in the three different situations. As a result, we find that\nactivity does not change the Flory exponent but affects the prefactor of the\nscaling law.

PMMA/3-octanone has a UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) which\npresents a critical point at temperature Tc = 306.6 K and volume fraction\n$\\phi$c = 12.8 % [Crauste et al., ArXiv 1310.6720, 2012]. This oscillatory\nphenomenon appears because of thermophoretic and electrostriction effects and\nnon-linear diffusion. We analyze these oscillations and we propose a simple\nmodel which includes the minimal ingredients to produce the oscillatory\nbehavior. Phase transitions in binary mixtures are still a widely studied\nsubject, specifically near the critical point where several interesting and not\ncompletely understood phenomena may appear, among them we recall the critical\nCasimir forces [2],[3], confinement effects [4], [5] and out-of-equilibrium\ndynamics after a quench. The perturbation of the binary mixtures by mean of\nexternal fields is also an important and recent field of investigation [6]. For\nexample, a laser can induce interesting phenomena in demixing binary mixtures\nbecause the radiation pressure can deform the interface between the two phases\nand it can be used to measure the interface tension [7]. Depending on the\nnature of the binary mixtures, laser illumination can also lead to a mixing or\ndemixing transition. In ref.[8], focused infrared laser light heats the medium\ninitially in the homogeneous phase and causes a separation in the LCST (Low\nCritical Solution Temperature) system. The radiation pressure gradients in a\nlaser beam also contribute in the aggregation of polymers , thus producing a\nphase transition. The local heating may induce thermophoretic forces which\nattract towards the laser beam one of the binary-mixture components [9]. Other\nforces like electrostriction can also be involved [10].

By contrast, the jump of specific heat and the\nfragility are large away from this threshold valence. In a previous work [Proc.\nNatl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110, 6307 (2013)], we could explain these behaviors by\nintroducing a model of supercooled liquids in which local rearrangements\ninteract via elasticity. However, in that model the disorder characterizing\nelasticity was frozen, whereas it is itself a dynamic variable in supercooled\nliquids. Here we study numerically and theoretically adaptive elastic network\nmodels where polydisperse springs can move on a lattice, thus allowing for the\ngeometry of the elastic network to fluctuate and evolve with temperature. We\nshow numerically that our previous results on the relationship between\nstructure and thermodynamics hold in these models. We introduce an\napproximation where redundant constraints (highly coordinated regions where the\nfrustration is large) are treated as an ideal gas, leading to analytical\npredictions that are accurate in the range of parameters relevant for real\nmaterials. Overall, these results lead to a description of supercooled liquids,\nin which the distance to the rigidity transition controls the number of\ndirections in phase space that cost energy and the specific heat. \n\n"}

This is direct\nevidence for a fluid-to-solid arrest transition. The offset value of the shear\nstress characterizes plastic deformation of the arrested state {which\ncorresponds to {\\em dynamic yield stress} of the system}. {Based on an\nanalytical line of argument, we propose that the mean number of capillary\nbridges per particle, $\\nu$, follows a non-trivial dependence on the packing\nfraction, $\\phi$, and the capillary energy, $\\vareps$.

In this paper, we study the trapping problem in extended dendrimers\nwith generation-dependent segment lengths, which is different from that of\ncompact dendrimers where the length of the linear segments is fixed. We first\nconsider a particular case that the deep trap is located at the central node,\nand derive an exact formula for the average trapping time (ATT) defined as the\naverage of the source-to-trap mean first passage time over all starting points.\nThen, using the obtained result we deduce a closed-form expression for the ATT\nto an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain an explicit\nsolution to the ATT corresponding to the trapping issue with the trap uniformly\ndistributed in the polymer systems.

These systems share\ncommon features originating from their intrinsically out-of-equilibrium nature.\nIt remains elusive how energy dissipation affects the state selection in such\nnon-equilibrium states. As a simple model system, we consider a non-equilibrium\nstationary state maintained by continuous energy input, relevant to industrial\nprocessing of granular materials by vibration and/or flow.

In dense suspensions most of the stress comes\nfrom short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,\nso a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)\nof the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether a closed\ntime-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian\nhard spheres in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations\nfor the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for\nFEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)\nconstrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural\nanisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively\nconsider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no\nclosed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal.

Regardless of the disorder strength, our numerical simulations\nshow soft modes that are always sharply peaked at the softest point of the\nmaterial (unlike what happens for the depinning of an elastic interface).\nContrary to widespread views, the deformation halo around this peak does not\nalways have a quadrupolar (Eshelby-like) shape.

Here, we interpret active (or\nself-propelled) chiral microswimmers with a distribution of intrinsic\nfrequencies as motile oscillators and show that they can synchronize over very\nlarge distances, even for local coupling in 2D. This opposes to canonical\nnon-active oscillators on static or time-dependent networks, leading to\nsynchronized domains only. A consequence of this activity-induced\nsynchronization is the emergence of a `mutual flocking phase', where particles\nof opposite chirality cooperate to form superimposed flocks moving at a\nrelative angle to each other, providing a chiral active matter analogue to the\ncelebrated Toner-Tu phase. The underlying mechanism employs a positive feedback\nloop involving the two-way coupling between oscillators' phase and\nself-propulsion, and could be exploited as a design principle for synthetic\nactive materials and chiral self-sorting techniques \n\n"}

RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep\nlearning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution\nalong a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the\nmolecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nthis latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction\ncoordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum,\nyet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum\nprobability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for\na new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module\nwith appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing\nuntil estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike\nrecent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands\nout in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction\ncoordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to\nenhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning,\nand (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned\nby the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is\ndemonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity,\nincluding computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic\nligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than\nthree minutes, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for\numbrella sampling or metadynamics. \n\n"}

The external excitation representing ground motion during\nearthquakes is simulated via horizontalsinusoidal oscillations of controlled\nfrequency and amplitude. In the experiments, we use particles only\nslightlydenser than water, which as predicted theoretically increases the\neffect of liquefaction and allows clear depth-of-sinkingmeasurements. In the\nsimulations, a micromechanical model simulates grains using molecular\ndynamicswith friction between neighbors. The effect of the fluid is captured by\ntaking into account buoyancy effects onthe grains when they are immersed. We\nshow that the motion of an intruder inside a granular medium is mainlydependent\non the peak acceleration of the ground motion and establish a phase diagram for\nthe conditions underwhich liquefaction happens, depending on the soil bulk\ndensity, friction properties, presence of water, and peak acceleration of the\nimposed large-scale soil vibrations.We establish that in liquefaction\nconditions, most cases relaxtoward an equilibrium position following an\nexponential in time.We also show that the equilibrium position itself,for most\nliquefaction regimes, corresponds to the isostatic equilibrium of the intruder\ninside a medium of effectivedensity.

The possible existence\nof such an instability depends on the material constitutive model. Here, we\nrevisit this problem in the context of stochastic incompressible hyperelastic\nmaterials, and ask the question: what is the probability distribution of stable\nradially symmetric inflation, such that the internal pressure always increases\nas the radial stretch increases? For the classic elastic problem, involving\nisotropic incompressible materials, there is a critical parameter value that\nstrictly separates the cases where inflation instability can occur or not. By\ncontrast, for the stochastic problem, we show that the inherent variability of\nthe probabilistic parameters implies that there is always competition between\nthe two cases. To illustrate this, we draw on published experimental data for\nrubber, and derive the probability distribution of the corresponding random\nshear modulus to predict the inflation responses for a spherical shell and a\ncylindrical tube made of a material characterised by this parameter. \n\n"}

Our\ntheoretical model, which we validate against Brownian dynamics simulations, is\napplied to unravel the roles of motility, fluid flow, and lattice geometry on\nasymptotic mean velocity and dispersivity. In weak flows, transport is\ndominated by active dispersion, which results from self-propulsion in the\npresence of noise and is hindered by the obstacles that act as entropic\nbarriers.

Maximisation of polymer entropy drives the\nreversible crosslinks to bind preferentially near the permanent crosslinks in\nthe network, leading to local molecular reinforcement without significant\nalteration of the network topology.

The turbulent\nviscosity in such disks must be hydrodynamic in origin, not\nmagnetohydrodynamic. We investigate the growth of hydrodynamic perturbations in\na linear shear flow sandwiched between two parallel walls. The unperturbed flow\nis similar to plane Couette flow but with a Coriolis force included. Although\nthere are no exponentially growing eigenmodes in this system, nevertheless,\nbecause of the non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, it is possible to have a\nlarge transient growth in the energy of perturbations. For a constant angular\nmomentum disk, we find that the perturbation with maximum growth has a\nwave-vector in the vertical direction. The energy grows by more than a factor\nof 100 for a Reynolds number R=300 and more than a factor of 1000 for R=1000.\nTurbulence can be easily excited in such a disk, as found in previous numerical\nsimulations. For a Keplerian disk, on the other hand, similar vertical\nperturbations grow by no more than a factor of 4, explaining why the same\nsimulations did not find turbulence in this system. However, certain other\ntwo-dimensional perturbations with no vertical structure do exhibit modest\ngrowth. For the optimum two-dimensional perturbation, the energy grows by a\nfactor of ~100 for R~10^4.5 and by a factor of 1000 for R~10^6. It is\nconceivable that these two-dimensional disturbances might lead to\nself-sustained turbulence.

Commonly used models which assume Brownian\ndynamics for this variable predict a mean (unforced) passage time $\\tau$ that\nscales as $N^2$, even in the presence of an entropic barrier. However, the time\nit takes for a free polymer to diffuse a distance of the order of its radius by\nRouse dynamics scales with an exponent larger than 2, and this should provide a\nlower bound to the translocation time. To resolve this discrepancy, we perform\nnumerical simulations with Rouse dynamics for both phantom (in space dimensions\n$d=1$ and 2), and self-avoiding (in $d=2$) chains.

We\nassume that, first, the growth of the car cluster is governed by attachment of\ncars to the cluster whose rate is mainly determined by the mean headway\ndistance between the car in the vehicle flow and, may be, also by the headway\ndistance in the cluster. Second, the cluster dissolution is determined by the\ncar escape from the cluster whose rate depends on the cluster size directly.\nThe latter is justified using the available experimental data for the\ncorrelation properties of the synchronized mode.

This model is a simplified\nversion of a recently proposed one [J.-B. Manneville et al. Phys. Rev. E, 64,\n021908 (2001)] for non-equilibrium force-centres embedded in fluid membranes,\nsuch as light-activated bacteriorhodopsin pumps incorporated in phospholipid\n(EPC) bilayers. The pump/membrane system is modeled as an impermeable,\ntwo-component bilayer fluid membrane in the presence of an ambient solvent, in\nwhich one component, representing active pumps, is described in terms of force\ndipoles displaced with respect to the bilayer midpoint. We first discuss the\ncase in which such pumps are rendered inactive, computing the mode structure in\nthe bulk as well as the modification of hydrodynamic properties by the presence\nof a nearby wall. We then discuss the fluctuations and mode structure in steady\nstate of active two-component membranes near a repulsive wall.

This explicitly non-equilibrium result, a consequence of\nthe incorporation of curvature-concentration coupling in our treatment, also\nindicates that earlier scaling arguments which obtained an increase in the\nroughness of active membranes near repulsive walls may need to be reevaluated. \n\n"}

We find\na remarkably rich variety of dynamical locking phenomena as we vary the angle\nof the applied drive with respect to the orientation of the colloidal lattice.\nWhen the driven colloid locks to certain lattice symmetry directions, its\nmotion is not necessarily aligned with the drive. Applying a transverse force\nto the driven particle can result in either increased or decreased drag in the\ndriving direction, depending on the angle of the drive. The dynamical locking\nproduces anomalies in both the longitudinal and the transverse velocity vs\ndriving force curves, including steps and regimes of negative differential\nresistance. As the interaction of the driven particle with the surrounding\nlattice increases, significant distortion or dislocations in the surrounding\nmedia occur, and as a result the directional locking is enhanced. We compare\nthese results to those obtained for driving particles over fixed substrates,\nand show that a far richer variety of behaviors occurs when the underlying\nlattice is allowed to distort.

The free\nenergy $F_{\\text{dis}}(T)$ of any SMS must be equal to the T=0 crystal free\nenergy $E_{0}$ at two different temperatures $T=0,$ and $T=T_{\\text{eq}}>0$.\nThus, the stability requires $F_{\\text{dis}}(T)$ to possess a maximum at an\nintermediate but a strictly positive temperature $T_{\\text{K}},$ where the\nenergy is $E=E_{\\text{K}}.$ The SMS branch below $T_{\\text{K}}$ gives the\nentropy crisis and must be replaced by hand by an ideal glass free energy of\nconstant energy $E_{\\text{K}},$ and vanishing entropy.

Good qualitative accord is found with the results from a MFE\nmethod study of a corresponding van der Waals model that incorporates\nsize-dispersity both in the hard core reference and the attractive parts of the\nfree energy. The results show that polydispersity engenders considerable\nbroadening of the coexistence region between the cloud curves. The principal\neffect of fractionation in this region is a common overall scaling of the\nparticle sizes and typical inter-particle distances, and we discuss why this\neffect is rather specific to systems with Schulz diameter distributions.

In the\nfirst case, grains typically compete with each other, while in the second, they\ncooperate. A typical result of {\\it cooperation} is the formation of stable\nbridges, signatures of spatiotemporal inhomogeneities; we review their\ngeometrical characteristics and compare theoretical results with those of\nindependent simulations. {\\it Cooperative} excitations due to local density\nfluctuations are also responsible for relaxation at the angle of repose; the\n{\\it competition} between these fluctuations and external driving forces, can,\non the other hand, result in a (rare) collapse of the sandpile to the\nhorizontal. Both these features are present in a theory reviewed here.

We employ a Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics with constitutive\nrelations all of which (except the shear viscosity) diverge at the crystal\npacking density, while the shear viscosity diverges at a smaller density. The\nphase diagram of the steady flow is described by three parameters: an effective\nMach number, a scaled energy loss parameter, and an integer number m: the\nnumber of half-oscillations in a mechanical analogy that appears in this\nproblem. In a steady shear flow the viscous heating is balanced by energy\ndissipation via inelastic collisions.
