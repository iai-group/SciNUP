Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

We show that if the poloidal\nmagnetic field near the BH horizon is misaligned with the BH rotation axis,\ncharged particles, which initially spiral into the BH hole along the equatorial\nplane, penetrate into the regions above the BH \"polar caps\" and are ejected\nwith high energies to infinity.

This is the most important energy range for absorbing $\\g$-rays from\ndistant sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts and producing electron\npositron pairs.

This technique is extended to include post-main\nsequence stars and reprocessing of starlight by dust. In our simple model, the\ntotal energy absorbed by dust is assumed to be re-emitted as three blackbodies\nin the infrared, one at 40 K representing warm, large dust grains, one at 70 K\nrepresenting hot, small dust grains, and one at 450 K representing polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons.

Despite this, the nature of some of\nthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the VHE emission, is\nunclear. To answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelength\ncampaign of the VHE gamma-ray emitting X-ray binary LS I +61 303 including the\nMAGIC telescope, XMM-Newton, and Swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007\nSeptember. We detect a simultaneous outburst at X-ray and VHE bands, with the\npeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths.

As\nthe black hole mass grows, its spin changes in strength and direction due to\nits gravito-magnetic coupling with the small-scale accretion disc. We find that\nthe black hole spins loose memory of their initial orientation, as accretion\ntorques suffice to align the spins with the angular momentum of their orbit on\na short timescale (<1-2 Myr). A residual off-set in the spin direction relative\nto the orbital angular momentum remains, at the level of <10 degrees for the\ncase of a cold disc, and <30 degrees for a warmer disc.

Evidence suggests that gamma-ray prompt emission and X-ray\nflares share a common origin and that at least some flares can only be\nexplained by long-lasting central engine activity. We have developed a shell\nmodel code to address the question of how X-ray flares are produced within the\nframework of the internal shock model.

They are conventionally classified into long and short ones depending\non their time duration, $T_{90}$. Because of the advantage their high redshifts\noffer, many efforts have been made to apply GRBs to cosmology. The key to this\nis to find correlations between some measurable properties of GRBs and the\nenergy or the luminosity of GRBs. These correlations are usually referred to as\nluminosity relations and are helpful in understanding the GRBs themselves. In\nthis paper, we explored such correlations in the X-ray emission of GRBs. The\nX-ray emission of GRBs observed by \\emph{Swift} has the exponential functional\nform in the prompt phase and relaxes to a power-law decay at time $T_p$. We\nhave assumed a linear relation between $\\log L_{X, p}$ (with $L_{X, p}$ being\nthe X-ray luminosity at $T_p$) and $\\log [T_p/(1+z)]$, but there is some\nevidence for curvature in the data and the true relationship between $L_{X, p}$\nand $T_p/(1+z)$ may be a broken power law. The limited GRB sample used in our\nanalysis is still not sufficient for us to conclude whether the break is real\nor just an illusion caused by outliers. We considered both cases in our\nanalysis and discussed the implications of the luminosity relation, especially\non the time duration of GRBs and their classification. \n\n"}

Simulations show that if octupolar field strongly dominates\nat the disc-magnetosphere boundary, then matter flows into the ring-like\noctupolar poles, forming ring-shape spots at the surface of the star above and\nbelow equator. The light-curves are complex and may have two peaks per period.\nIn case where the dipole field dominates, matter accretes in two ordered funnel\nstreams towards poles, however the polar spots are meridionally-elongated due\nto the action of the octupolar component. In the case when the fields are of\nsimilar strengths, both, polar and belt-like spots are present.

The correlation for 21\nreverberation-mapped Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) appears very tight, with an\nintrinsic dispersion of 0.20 dex. The intrinsic dispersion of 0.27 dex can be\nobtained if BH masses are estimated from the stellar velocity dispersions. We\nfurther test the uncertainties of mass estimates from XVAs for objects which\nhave been observed multiple times with good enough data quality. The results\nshow that the XVAs derived from multiple observations change by a factor of 3.\nThis means that BH mass uncertainty from a single observation is slightly worse\nthan either reverberation-mapping or stellar velocity dispersion measurements;\nhowever BH mass estimates with X-ray data only can be more accurate if the mean\nXVA value from more observations is used. Applying this relation, the BH mass\nof RE J1034+396 is found to be $4^{+3}_{-2} \\times 10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$.

Spectral fit of the XMM-Newton data and of the RXTE data, taken in a\nsimultaneous temporal window, constrain the Comptonization parameters: the\nelectron temperature, kT_e=51(+6,-4) keV, is rather high, while the optical\ndepth (tau=1.34(+0.03,-0.06)) is moderate. The energy dependence of the pulsed\nfraction supports the interpretation of the cooler thermal component as coming\nfrom the accretion disc, and indicates that the Comptonizing plasma surrounds\nthe hot spots on the NS surface, which provide the seed photons. Signatures of\nreflection, such as a broadened iron K-alpha emission line and a Compton hump\nat 30 keV ca., are also detected. We derive from the smearing of the reflection\ncomponent an inner disc radius of ~> 40 km for a 1.4 Msun neutron star, and an\ninclination between 38{\\deg} and 68{\\deg}. XMM-Newton also observed two type-I\nX-ray bursts, probably ignited in a nearly pure helium environment. No\nphotospheric radius expansion is observed, thus leading to an upper limit on\nthe distance to the source of 10 kpc.

Pulsations observed during the burst decay are\ncompatible with being phase locked, and have a similar amplitude, than\npre-burst pulsations. \n\n"}

In particular we discuss how studying the energy spectra\nof each neutrino flavour coming from such distant sources and their distortion\nrelative to each other may serve as pointers to exotic physics such as neutrino\ndecay, Lorentz symmetry violation, pseudo-Dirac effects, CP and CPT violation\nand quantum decoherence. This allows us to probe hitherto unexplored ranges of\nparameters for the above cases, for example lifetimes in the range $\n10^{-3}-10^{4} $ s/eV for the case of neutrino decay. We show that standard\nneutrino oscillations ensure that the different flavours arrive at the earth\nwith similar shapes even if their flavour spectra at source may differ strongly\nin both shape and magnitude. As a result, observed differences between the\nspectra of various flavours at the detector would be signatures of non-standard\nphysics altering neutrino fluxes during propagation rather than those arising\nduring their production at source. Since detection of ultra-high energy (UHE)\nneutrinos is perhaps imminent, it is possible that such differences in spectral\nshapes will be tested in neutrino detectors in the near future.

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures\nresembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar\n4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the\nradio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks\nare even larger at 35kpc. Unusually for a classical double (FRII) radio source,\nthere is smooth low surface-brightness radio emission associated with the\nregions beyond the hotspots (further away from the nucleus than the hotspots\nthemselves), which seems to be symmetric for the ends of both jets. We consider\npossible explanations for this phenomenon, and conclude that it arises from\nhigh-energy electrons, recently accelerated in the nearby radio hotspots that\nare leaking into a pre-existing weakly-magnetized plasma that are symmetric\nrelic lobes fed from a previous episode of jet activity.

Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters.

The IBIS instrument onboard INTEGRAL detected a source at a position\ninconsistent with the optical coordinates of PKS 1502+106, but consistent with\nthose of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 841, located at 6.8 arcmin south-west from\nthe blazar, which is therefore responsible for all the hard X-ray flux detected\nby IBIS. At the location of the blazar, IBIS sets an upper limit of ~10^{-11}\nerg/s/cm2 on the 15-60 keV flux, that turns out to be consistent with a model\nof inverse Compton scattering accounting for the soft X-ray and gamma-ray\nspectra measured by Swift XRT and Fermi LAT, respectively. The gamma-ray\nspectrum during the outburst indicates substantial variability of the\ncharacteristic energy of the inverse Compton component in this\nblazar.(abridged). \n\n"}

We construct a purely gravitational theoretical model of perfectly\ncollimated jets of high energy particles in the ideal case where the central\nengine is a Kerr BH of mass $M$ and angular momentum by unit of mass $a$. We\nstudy in Weyl coordinates ($\\rho $, $z$) the unbound Kerr 2D-geodesics which\nare asymptotes to straight lines parallel to the $z$ axis of equations \\rho\n=constant= \\rho_{1}= [(a/M)^2+Q/(E^2-1)]^{1/2} of which existence was recently\ndemonstrated (Gariel et al.,A & A, 2010).

It was in outburst for about a month from September 13,\n2009. The broad-band average spectrum is well described by thermal\nComptonization with an electron temperature of kT_e ~ 25 keV, soft seed photons\nof kT_bb ~ 0.6 keV, and Thomson optical depth \\tau_T ~ 2 in a slab geometry.\nDuring the outburst the spectrum stays remarkably stable with plasma and soft\nseed photon temperatures and scattering optical depth being constant within\nerrors. We fitted the outburst profile with the exponential model, and using\nthe disk instability model we inferred the outer disk radius to be (4.8 - 5.4)\n\\times 1010 cm. The INTEGRAL and RXTE data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a\nperiod of 4.08 milliseconds up to ~ 120 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown to\ndecrease from ~22% at 3 keV to a constant pulsed fraction of ~17-18% between\n7-30 keV, and then to decrease again down to ~13% at 60 keV.

However, on time-scales less than a\nsecond the disc lags the power-law variations by a few ms, consistent with the\ndisc variations being dominated by X-ray heating by the power-law, with the\nshort lag corresponding to the light-travel time between the power-law emitting\nregion and the disc. Our results indicate that instabilities in the accretion\ndisc are responsible for continuum variability on time-scales of seconds or\nlonger and probably also on shorter time-scales. \n\n"}

Two major scenarios\nevolved in past 40 years to explain the pulsation mechanism: the inner\nmagnetosphere scenario and the outer magnetosphere scenario. Both scenarios\npredict a high energy cut-off in the gamma-ray energy spectrum, but with\ndifferent cut-off sharpness. An exponential cut-off is expected for the outer\nmagnetosphere scenario while a super-exponential cut-off is predicted for the\ninner magnetosphere scenario.

Abstract: We report the discovery by the Swift hard X-ray monitor of the transient\nsource Swift J2058.4+0516 (Sw J2058+05). Our multi-wavelength follow-up\ncampaign uncovered a long-lived (duration >~ months), luminous X-ray (L_X,iso ~\n3 x 10^47 erg s^-1) and radio (nu L_nu,iso ~ 10^42 erg s^-1) counterpart. The\nassociated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of\n1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust\nextinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the recently\ndiscovered GRB 110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw J1644+57), we suggest that\nSw J2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outbursts\nresulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If\nso, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate of\ntidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowly\ncollimated (theta < 1 degree), or only a small fraction of tidal disruptions\ngenerate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the black\nhole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component.\nAlternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus\n[AGN]), Sw J2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in these\nsources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with known\nclasses of AGNs capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies). \n\n"}

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features. \n\n"}

We compare these results with those\nfrom CGRO, and find a good agreement. Confirming previous studies, we find the\npresence of a high-energy MeV tail beyond a thermal-Comptonization spectrum;\nhowever, the tail is much softer and weaker than that recently published by\nLaurent et al. In spite of this difference, the observed high-energy tail could\nstill be due to the synchrotron emission of the jet of Cyg X-1, as claimed by\nLaurent et al.\n  To test this possibility, we study optically-thin synchrotron and\nself-Compton emission from partially self-absorbed jets. We develop formalisms\nfor calculating both emission of the jet base (which we define here as the\nregion where the jet starts its emission) and emission of the entire jet. We\nrequire the emission to match that observed at the turnover energy. The\noptically thin emission is dominated by that from the jet base, and it has to\nbecome self-absorbed within it at the turnover frequency. We find this implies\nthe magnetic field strength at the jet base of B_0 prop. to z_0^4, where z_0 is\nthe distance of the base from the black-hole centre. The value of B_0 is then\nconstrained from below by the condition that the self-Compton emission is below\nan upper limit in the GeV range, and from above by the condition that the\nPoynting flux does not exceed the jet kinetic power. This yields B_0 of the\norder of ~10^4 G and the location of the jet base at ~10^3 gravitational radii.\nUsing our formalism, we find the MeV tail can be due to jet synchrotron\nemission, but this requires the electron acceleration at a rather hard\npower-law index, p~1.3-1.6. For acceleration indices of p> 2, the amplitude of\nthe synchrotron component is much below that of MeV tail, and its origin is\nlikely to be due to hybrid Comptonization in the accretion flow. \n\n"}

Among 8 single-pulse long GRBs, 5 show\nhard-to-soft evolution, while 3 show intensity-tracking. The multi-pulse long\nGRBs have more complicated patterns. Among the GRBs whose time-resolved\nspectrum is available for the first pulse, almost half (15/32 GRBs) show clear\nhard-to-soft evolution, and the other half (17/32 GRBs) show clear\nintensity-tracking. Later pulses typically show the tracking behavior, although\na hard-to-soft evolution pattern was identified in the 2nd pulse of 2 GRBs\nwhose pulses are well separated. Statistically, the hard-to-soft evolution\npulses tend to be more asymmetric than the intensity-tracking ones, with a\nsteeper rising wing than the falling wing. Short GRBs have $E_{\\rm p}$ tracking\nintensity exclusively with the 16ms time resolution analysis. We performed a\nsimulation analysis, and suggest that at least for some bursts, the late\nintensity-tracking pulses could be a consequence of overlapping hard-to-soft\npulses.

In this work, we choose the\nmost energetic cavity, MS 0735+7421, with stored energy ~ 10^62 erg, to\nconstrain the jet formation mechanisms and the evolution of the central massive\nblack hole in this source. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN in this cavity\nis ~ 10^(-5) L_Edd, however, the mean power of the jet required to inflate the\ncavity is estimated as ~ 0.02 L_Edd, which implies that the source has\nexperienced strong outbursts previously. During outbursts, the jet power and\nthe mass accretion rate should be significantly higher than its present values.\nWe construct an accretion disk model, in which the angular momentum and energy\ncarried away by jets is properly included, to calculate the spin and mass\nevolution of the massive black hole. In our calculations, different jet\nformation mechanisms are employed, and we find that the jets generated with the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are unable to produce the giant cavity with ~\n10^62 erg in this source.

By accounting for the dynamical back-reaction of the\nnon-thermal particles, such a theory in fact predicts that the more efficient\nthe particle acceleration, the flatter the CR spectrum. In this work we put\nforward a self-consistent scenario in which the account for the magnetic field\namplification induced by CR streaming produces the conditions for reversing\nsuch a trend, allowing --- at the same time --- for rather steep spectra and CR\nacceleration efficiencies (about 20%) consistent with the hypothesis that SNRs\nare the sources of Galactic CRs. In particular, we quantitatively work out the\ndetails of instantaneous and cumulative CR spectra during the evolution of a\ntypical SNR, also stressing the implications of the observed levels of\nmagnetization on both the expected maximum energy and the predicted CR\nacceleration efficiency. The latter naturally turns out to saturate around\n10-30%, almost independently of the fraction of particles injected into the\nacceleration process as long as this fraction is larger than about $10^{-4}$. \n\n"}

There have been broadly utilized analytic and numerical\ntreatments of the global properties of accretion flows, but detailed numerical\nsimulations are required to address certain critical aspects. We use the ZEUS\ncode to run hydrodynamical simulations of rotating, axisymmetric accretion\nflows with Bremsstrahlung cooling, considering solutions for which the\ncentrifugal balance radius significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius, with\nand without viscous angular momentum transport. Infalling gas is followed from\nwell beyond the Bondi radius down to the vicinity of the black hole. We produce\na continuum of solutions with respect to the single parameter\nMdot_Bondi/Mdot_Edd, and there is a sharp transition between two general\nclasses of solutions at an Eddington ratio of Mdot_Bondi/Mdot_Edd ~ few x\n10^(-2).

Most have involved changes to the algorithm which either\nintroduce artificial correction terms or violate arguably the greatest\nadvantage of SPH over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy,\nmomentum, and angular momentum. Here, we show how a class of alternative SPH\nequations of motion (EOM) can be derived self-consistently from a discrete\nparticle Lagrangian (guaranteeing manifest conservation) in a manner which\ntremendously improves treatment of instabilities and contact discontinuities.\nSaitoh & Makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize the\nEOM does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the 'standard'\napproach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, can\nbe incorporated into the rigorous Lagrangian formulation that retains ideal\nconservation properties and includes the 'Grad-h' terms that account for\nvariable smoothing lengths. We derive a general EOM for any choice of volume\nelement (particle 'weights') and method of determining smoothing lengths. We\nthen specify this to a 'pressure-entropy formulation' which resolves problems\nin the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. Implementing this in a new\nversion of the GADGET code, we show it leads to good performance in mixing\nexperiments (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz & blob tests). And conservation is\nmaintained even in strong shock/blastwave tests, where formulations without\nmanifest conservation produce large errors. This also improves the treatment of\nsub-sonic turbulence, and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers.\nThe code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

In this paper, we investigate the validity domain of this\nassumption. Indeed, that premise disregards microlensing of the accretion disc\nin the MIR range, and does not account for recent progress in our knowledge of\nthe dusty torus. To simulate microlensing, we first built a simplified image of\nthe quasar composed of an accretion disc, and of a larger ring-like torus. The\nmock quasars are then microlensed using an inverse ray-shooting code. We\nsimulated the wavelength and size dependence of microlensing for different\nlensed image types and fraction of compact objects projected in the lens. This\nallows us to derive magnification probabilities as a function of wavelength, as\nwell as to calculate the microlensing-induced deformation of the spectral\nenergy distribution of the lensed images. We find that microlensing variations\nas large as 0.1 mag are very common at 11 microns (observer-frame). The main\nsignal comes from microlensing of the accretion disc, which may be significant\neven when the fraction of flux from the disc is as small as 5 % of the total\nflux. We also show that the torus of sources with Lbol <~ 10^45 erg/s is\nexpected to be noticeably microlensed.

Finally, we\ninvestigate whether microlensing in the mid-infrared can alter the so-called\nRcusp relation that links the fluxes of the lensed images triplet produced when\nthe source lies close to a cusp macro-caustic.

The flow structure is\ngeometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the\ncooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\\rm cool} \\gtrsim\nt_{\\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete\nand forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner\nhot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time the accretion flow\nseparates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a\ncold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot\ncorona corresponding to a critical value of $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff} (\\sim\n10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time. Based on our\nsimulations, we have developed a model for transients observed in black hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a\ncold black-body dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion\nrate. The transition from a thin disk to a RIAF happens because of mass\nexhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time\nbecomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous\ntimescale for a geometrically thin disk is quite long, the high-soft state is\nexpected to be long-lived. The different timescales in black hole transients\ncorrespond to different physical processes such as viscous evolution, cooling,\nand free-fall. Our model captures the overall features of observed state\ntransitions in XRBs. \n\n"}

To account for the principle effects of general\nrelativity (GR), we propose a modification of the standard Newtonian evolution\nequation for the (orbit-averaged) time-varying disk surface density. In our\nmodified equation the viscous torque in the disk is treated in full GR, while\nthe tidal torque is handled in the Newtonian limit. Our GR-hybrid treatment is\nreasonable because the tidal torque is concentrated near the orbital radius of\nthe secondary and is most important prior to binary-disk decoupling, when the\norbital separation is large and resides in the weak-field regime. The tidal\ntorque on the disk diminishes during late merger and vanishes altogether\nfollowing merger.

Rather than\nbeing confined within the circularizing radius, the disk can spread to larger\nradii to conserve angular momentum. A spreading disk is a source of matter for\nre-accretion at rates which can exceed the later stellar fallback rate,\nalthough a disk wind can suppress its contribution to the central black hole\naccretion rate. A spreading disk is detectible through a break in the central\naccretion rate history, or, at longer wavelengths, by its own emission. We\nmodel the evolution of TDE disk size and accretion rate, by accounting for the\ntime-dependent fallback rate, for the influence of wind losses in the early,\nadvective stage, and for the possibility of thermal instability for accretion\nrates intermediate between the advection-dominated and gas-pressure dominated\nstates.

Based on the two-branch correlation of the LFQPO frequency and the\nhardness ratio, the observations that were suitable for evaluating the LFQPO\namplitude spectrum were divided into two groups. According to a comparison\nbetween the radio and X-ray emissions, we deduced that the jets during the two\ngroups of observations are very different. A negative correlation between the\nLFQPO frequency and the radio flux was found for one group. The LFQPO amplitude\nspectrum was fitted by a power-law with an exponential cutoff in order to\ndescribe it quantitatively. It reveals that as the LFQPO frequency increases,\nthe power-law hardens. And the cutoff energy firstly decreases, and then\nsmoothly levels off. The fit also shows that the LFQPO amplitude spectra of the\ntwo groups are essentially the same, suggesting that the LFQPO seems not to\noriginate from the jet. The LFQPO amplitude spectra are hard, indicating a\npossible origin of the LFQPO in the corona. As the LFQPO frequency increases,\nthe LFQPO amplitude firstly increases and then decreases. The effects of the\nlow pass filter and the jet on the LFQPO amplitude are discussed. \n\n"}

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in\nArecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array\nsurvey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model.

The\ncause of this low radio detection rate has previously been attributed to\nlimited observing sensitivity.

Their properties\nsuggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to\nunderstand and study these events, more examples need to be found.

If this emission is\nproduced by low energy CRs which ionize the interstellar molecular gas the\nintensity of the line is quite small, < 1%. However, we cannot exclude that\nlocal sources of CRs or X-ray photons nearby the cloud may provide much higher\nintensity of the line from there. Production of the line emission from\nmolecular clouds depends strongly on processes of CR penetration into them. We\nshow that turbulent motions of neutral gas may generate strong magnetic\nfluctuations in the clouds which prevent free penetration of CRs into the\nclouds from outside. We provide a special analysis of the line production by\nhigh energy electrons. We concluded that these electrons hardly provide the\ndiffuse 6.4 keV line emission from the GC because their density is depleted by\nionization losses. We do not exclude that local sources of electrons may\nprovide an excesses of the 6.4 keV line emission in some molecular clouds and\neven reproduce a relatively short time variations of the iron line emission.\nHowever, we doubt whether a single electron source provides the simultaneous\nshort time variability of the iron line emission from clouds which are distant\nfrom each other on hundred pc as observed for the GC clouds. An alternative\nspeculation is that local electron sources could also provide the necessary\neffect of the line variations in different clouds that are seen simultaneously\nby chance that seems, however, very unlikely. \n\n"}

We investigate this by performing a detailed time-resolved spectral\nanalysis of the superburst from 4U 1636-536 observed in 2001 with the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer. Superbursts are attributed to the thermonuclear burning\nof carbon, and are approximately 1000 times more energetic than the regular\nshort Type I bursts. This allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,\ncompared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. A feature is present in the\nsuperburst spectra around 6.4 keV that is well fit with an emission line and an\nabsorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretion\ndisk.

In the nascent era of wide field transient\nsearches, objects with detailed observations are decreasing as a fraction of\nthe overall known SN population, and this strategy sacrifices the majority of\nthe information contained in the data about the underlying population of\ntransients. A population level modeling approach, simultaneously fitting all\navailable observations of objects in a transient sub-class of interest, fully\nmines the data to infer the properties of the population and avoids certain\nsystematic biases. We present a novel hierarchical Bayesian statistical model\nfor population level modeling of transient light curves, and discuss its\nimplementation using an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique.

Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain\nimages of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analyzing all\nof these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to\ncompute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of\na sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-$z$ PDFs.

Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although\nthe vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the\nsystem, they still dominate the response at intermediate times.

For\nthese detectors a distortion in the drift field due to geometrical or physics\nreasons can affect the reconstruction of the events. Depending on the TPC\ngeometry and electric drift field intensity this distortion could be of the\nsame magnitude as the drift field itself. Recently, we presented a method to\ncalibrate the drift field and correct for these possible distortions. While\nstraight cosmic ray muon tracks could be used for calibration, multiple coulomb\nscattering and momentum uncertainties allow only a limited resolution. A UV\nlaser instead can create straight ionization tracks in liquid argon, and allows\none to map the drift field along different paths in the TPC inner volume. Here\nwe present a UV laser feed-through design with a steerable UV mirror immersed\nin liquid argon that can point the laser beam at many locations through the\nTPC. The straight ionization paths are sensitive to drift field distortions, a\nfit of these distortion to the linear optical path allows to extract the drift\nfield, by using these laser tracks along the whole TPC volume one can obtain a\n3D drift field map.

The time domain landscape is set to radically change in the\ncoming decade, with surveys such as LSST providing huge numbers of transient\ndetections on a nightly basis; transient detections across the electromagnetic\nspectrum from other facilities such as SVOM, SKA and CTA; and the era of\n`multi-messenger astronomy', wherein events are detected via\nnon-electromagnetic means, such as gravitational wave emission. We describe\nhere our plans for Liverpool Telescope 2: a new robotic telescope designed to\ncapitalise on this new era of time domain astronomy. LT2 will be a 4-metre\nclass facility co-located with the LT at the Observatorio del Roque de Los\nMuchachos on the Canary island of La Palma. The telescope will be designed for\nextremely rapid response: the aim is that the telescope will take data within\n30 seconds of the receipt of a trigger from another facility. The motivation\nfor this is twofold: firstly it will make it a world-leading facility for the\nstudy of fast fading transients and explosive phenomena discovered at early\ntimes. Secondly, it will enable large-scale programmes of low-to-intermediate\nresolution spectral classification of transients to be performed with great\nefficiency. In the target-rich environment of the LSST era, minimising\nacquisition overheads will be key to maximising the science gains from any\nfollow-up programme. The telescope will have a diverse instrument suite which\nis simultaneously mounted for automatic changes, but it is envisaged that the\nprimary instrument will be an intermediate resolution, optical/infrared\nspectrograph for scientific exploitation of transients discovered with the next\ngeneration of synoptic survey facilities. In this paper we outline the core\nscience drivers for the telescope, and the requirements for the optical and\nmechanical design. \n\n"}

Unfortunately\nthis emission has been difficult to constrain and thus presents an uncertain\nforeground to any attempts to extract potential dark matter signal. Recently,\nIceCube has detected high-energy isotropic neutrino flux which could be of an\nextragalactic origin. In general, neutrinos can be linked to gamma rays since\ncosmic-ray interactions produce neutral and charged pions where neutral pions\ndecay into gamma rays, while charged pions decay to give neutrinos.

This is achieved by measuring the intensity of the\nredshifted 21cm line over the sky in a range of redshifts without the\nrequirement to resolve individual galaxies. In this chapter, we investigate the\npotential of SKA1 to deliver HI intensity maps over a broad range of\nfrequencies and a substantial fraction of the sky. By pinning down the baryon\nacoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion features in the matter power\nspectrum -- thus determining the expansion and growth history of the Universe\n-- these surveys can provide powerful tests of dark energy models and\nmodifications to General Relativity. They can also be used to probe physics on\nextremely large scales, where precise measurements of spatial curvature and\nprimordial non-Gaussianity can be used to test inflation; on small scales, by\nmeasuring the sum of neutrino masses; and at high redshifts where non-standard\nevolution models can be probed.

As a result, one of the fundamental uncertainties\nin these spectroscopic measurements arises from the absolute flux calibrations\nof the detectors being used. Using the stable X-ray burster, GS 1826-238, and\nits simultaneous observations by Chandra HETG/ACIS-S and RXTE/PCA as well as by\nXMM-Newton EPIC-pn and RXTE/PCA, we quantify the degree of uncertainty in the\nflux calibration by assessing the differences between the measured fluxes\nduring bursts.

Mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)\nactivity state, with a VHE flux of about half that of the Crab Nebula, yet the\nlight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highest\nvariability being in the X-rays.

We provide the expected\ncumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated GRBs in different\nenergy bands. We show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively high\nenergies (e.g. tens of keV to the MeV), can detect only the most luminous GRBs\nat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and the\nluminosity (Ep-Liso) of GRBs.

However, great progress in this area has been\nmade in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of\nground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.\nIn particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic\nrays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding\nof the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way\ndepends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in\ncomposition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy\nare considered. In this work we develop an analytical method to study these\neffects.

This\ninhomogeneous accretion disc model is claimed to describe not only the\nsingle-band variability amplitude, but also microlensing size constraints and\nthe quasar composite spectral shape. In this work, we examine the validity of\nthe inhomogeneous accretion disc model in the light of quasar UV-optical\nspectral variability by using five-band multi-epoch light curves for nearly 9\n000 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 region.

Radio emission escaping from\nmicrowave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explain all of the\nobserved properties of the peryton signals. Now that the peryton source has\nbeen identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwaves on site could\nnot have caused FRB 010724. This and other distinct observational differences\nshow that FRBs are excellent candidates for genuine extragalactic transients. \n\n"}

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV. Several array geometries, the shape of the energy\nerror distributions and the uncertainties due to the unknown composition of the\nprimary flux have been analyzed as well. \n\n"}

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources.

The significance of the\ncorrelations is evaluated using two different approaches: simulating light\ncurves and mixed source correlations. The cross-correlation analysis yielded 26\nsources with significant correlations. In most of the sources, the gamma-ray\npeaks lead the radio with time lags in the range +20 and +690 days, whereas in\nsources 1633+382 and 3C 345 we find the radio emission to lead the gamma rays\nby -15 and -40 days, respectively. Apart from the individual source study, we\nstacked the correlations of all sources and also those based on sub-samples.\nThe time lag from the stacked correlation is +80 days for the whole sample and\nthe distance travelled by the emission region corresponds to 7 pc. We also\ncompared the start times of activity in radio and gamma rays of the correlated\nflares using Bayesian block representation.

The corresponding run-away modes in\nflavor space can spontaneously break the original symmetries of the neutrino\nflux and in particular can spontaneously produce small-scale features as shown\nin recent schematic studies. However, the unavoidable \"multi-angle matter\neffect\" shifts these small-scale instabilities into regions of matter and\nneutrino density which are not encountered on the way out from a SN. The\ntraditional modes which are uniform on the largest scales are most prone for\ninstabilities and thus provide the most sensitive test for the appearance of\nself-induced flavor conversion. As a by-product we clarify the relation between\nthe time evolution of an expanding neutrino gas and the radial evolution of a\nstationary SN neutrino flux.

RIAFs are typically collisionless in the sense that the Coulomb mean\nfree path is large compared to $GM/c^2$, and relativistically hot near the\nevent horizon. In this paper we develop a phenomenological model for the plasma\nin RIAFs, motivated by the application to sources such as Sgr A* and M87. The\nmodel is derived using Israel-Stewart theory, which considers deviations up to\nsecond order from thermal equilibrium, but modified for a magnetized plasma.\nThis leads to thermal conduction along magnetic field lines and a difference in\npressure, parallel and perpendicular to the field lines (which is equivalent to\nanisotrotropic viscosity). In the non-relativistic limit, our model reduces to\nthe widely used Braginskii theory of magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas. We\ncompare our model to the existing literature on dissipative relativistic\nfluids, describe the linear theory of the plasma, and elucidate the physical\nmeaning of the free parameters in the model. We also describe limits of the\nmodel when the conduction is saturated and when the viscosity implies a large\npressure anisotropy.

These models differ not only in the\napproximations and techniques they use to solve the many-body Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, but also in the neutron star composition they assume. We study\nwhether gravitational wave observations of neutron star binaries in\nquasicircular inspirals will allow us to distinguish between equations of state\nof differing internal composition, thereby providing important information\nabout the properties of extremely high density matter. We carry out a Bayesian\nmodel selection analysis, and find that second generation gravitational wave\ndetectors can heavily constrain equations of state that contain only quark\nmatter, but hybrid stars containing both normal and quark matter are harder to\ndistinguish from normal matter stars. A gravitational wave detection with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 30 and masses around $1.4M_{\\odot}$ could either\ndetect or rule out strange quark stars with a 20 to 1 confidence.

In Super-Kamiokande, these beta decays\nare the dominant background in 6--18 MeV, relevant for solar neutrinos and the\ndiffuse supernova neutrino background. In a previous paper, we showed that\nthese spallation isotopes are produced primarily in showers, instead of in\nisolation.

The arrival distribution of cosmic rays at Earth is the convolution of\nthe distribution of their sources and of the effects of geometry and properties\nof the magnetic field through which particles propagate. It is generally\nbelieved that the anisotropy topology at the largest angular scale is\nadiabatically shaped by diffusion in the structured interstellar magnetic\nfield. On the contrary, the medium- and small-scale angular structure could be\nan effect of non-diffusive propagation of cosmic rays in perturbed magnetic\nfields. In particular, a possible explanation of the observed small-scale\nanisotropy observed at TeV energy scale, may come from the effect of particle\nscattering in turbulent magnetized plasmas. We perform numerical integration of\ntest particle trajectories in low-$\\beta$ compressible magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence to study how the cosmic rays arrival direction distribution is\nperturbed when they stream along the local turbulent magnetic field. We utilize\nLiouville's theorem for obtaining the anisotropy at Earth and provide the\ntheoretical framework for the application of the theorem in the specific case\nof cosmic ray arrival distribution.

This applies in particular to the propagation of cosmic rays from\ntheir sources to Earth, responsible for energy suppressions due to pion\nphotoproduction by UHE protons (the Greisen-Zatsepin Kuzmin limit) and photo\ndisintegration of UHE nuclei (the Gerasimova-Rozental limit). A suppression in\nthe flux of UHECRs at energies above 40 EeV -- as expected from both these\ninteractions -- has been established experimentally beyond any doubt by current\nexperiments. However, such an observation is still not conclusive on the origin\nof the suppression. In particular, data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can\nbe interpreted in a scenario in which the suppression is due to the maximum\nacceleration energy at the sources rather than to interactions in the\nbackground radiation. In this scenario, UHECR data can no longer yield bounds\non Lorentz invariance violations which increase the thresholds for interactions\nof nuclei on background photons, in particular through modification of the\ndispersion relations. Here we argue in turn that the study of UHECRs still\nrepresents an opportunity to test Lorentz invariance, by discussing the\npossibility of deriving limits on violation parameters from UHECR phenomena\nother than propagation. In particular we study the modifications of the shower\ndevelopment in the atmosphere due to the possible inhibition of the decay of\nunstable particles, especially neutral pions. \n\n"}

Here, we utilize the SuperNu radiative transfer\nsoftware to calculate three-dimensional synthetic light curves and spectra of\nthe spiral merger simulation with a system mass of 2.1 $M_\\odot$ from Kashyap\net al. Because of their large system masses, both violent and spiral merger\nlight curves are slowly declining. The spiral merger resembles very slowly\ndeclining SNe Ia, including SN 2001ay, and provides a more natural explanation\nfor its observed properties than other SN Ia explosion models. Previous\nsynthetic light curves and spectra of violent DD mergers demonstrate a strong\ndependence on viewing angle, which is in conflict with observations.

Methods. A\nMonte-Carlo simulation code is extended to allow for the generation of\nintensity profiles as well as anisotropy-time profiles.

In the case of strange particles, such a\ncomponent is familiar from the abundant production of $K^+\\Lambda$ pairs.\nModern collider experiments have no coverage in the very large rapidity region\nwhere the forward pair production dominates. While forward charm particles are\nproduced inside the LHC beampipe, they dominate the high-energy atmospheric\nneutrino flux in underground experiments because long-lived pions and kaons\ninteract before decaying into neutrinos. The fragmentation of the spectator\nquark in the partonic subprocesses $qc \\rightarrow qc$ and $gc \\rightarrow gc$\nis responsible for the forward component of charm production in perturbative\nQCD. We use this phenomenological framework to construct a charm cross section\nthat saturates available accelerator and cosmic ray data, i.e., it represents\nan upper limit on the normalization of the charm cross section that cannot be\nreliably calculated because the charm mass is much smaller than the\ncenter-of-mass energy.

To fulfill the constraint $M_{\\rm max}>2~M_{\\odot}$ with a\nreserve we exploit the stiff DD2 hadronic equation of state (EoS) without and\nwith excluded volume (DD2vex) correction, which produce maximum neutron star\nmasses of $M_{\\rm max} = 2.43~M_{\\odot}$ and $2.70~M_{\\odot}$, respectively. We\nshow that the stiffness of the EoS does not preclude an explanation of the\nwhole set of cooling data within \"nuclear medium cooling\" scenario for compact\nstars by a variation of the star masses. We select appropriate proton gap\nprofiles from those exploited in the literature and allow for a variation of\nthe effective pion gap controlling the efficiency of the medium modified Urca\nprocess.

The cooling of the compact star in\nthe supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is explained mainly by an efficient\nmedium modified Urca process.

We found that the optical transient PTF11agg could be the\nfirst evidence for the formation of post-merger millisecond magnetars. To\nenhance the probability of finding more evidence for the post-merger magnetar\nformation, it is better to extend the observational channel to other photon\nenergy bands. In this paper we propose to search the signature of post-merger\nmagnetar formation in X-ray and especially gamma-ray bands.

It is therefore important to develop\nthe most sensitive and efficient possible algorithms to identify point sources\nof these neutrinos. The most popular current method works by exploring a dense\ngrid of possible directions to individual sources, and identifying the single\ndirection with the maximum probability of having produced multiple detected\nneutrinos.

It can also be formulated as a compelling\ncomponent of dark matter. The haloscope, a leading axion detection scheme,\nrelies on the conversion of galactic halo axions into real photons inside a\nresonant cavity structure in the presence of a static magnetic field, where the\ngenerated photon frequency corresponds to the mass of the axion. For maximum\nsensitivity it is key that the central frequency of the cavity mode structure\ncoincides with the frequency of the generated photon. As the mass of the axion\nis unknown, it is necessary to perform searches over a wide range of\nfrequencies. Currently there are substantial regions of the promising\npre-inflationary low mass axion range without any viable proposals for\nexperimental searches. We show that 3D resonant LC circuits with separated\nmagnetic and electric fields, commonly known as re-entrant cavities, can be\nsensitive dark matter haloscopes in this region, with frequencies inherently\nlower than those achievable in the equivalent size of empty resonant cavity.

Such BHs bifurcate\nfrom the vacuum Kerr solution and can be regarded as a horizon within a\nrotating boson star. In a recent letter, it was shown that KBHsSH can exhibit\nvery distinct shadows from the ones of their vacuum counterparts. The setup\ntherein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere\nsufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an\nemitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical\nenvironment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far\naway observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We\nfind that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr\nBHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding\nshadows in the previous setup. In particular, we highlight two observables that\nmight allow differentiating KBHsSH and Kerr BHs. The first is the angular size\nof the photon ring (in a Kerr spacetime) or lensing ring (in a KBHSH\nspacetime), the latter being significantly smaller for sufficiently\nnon-Kerr-like spacetimes.

However, there are\nmany types-1 AGNs with unexplained intermediate values for both positional\nangles and polarization degrees. Our explanation of polarization degree and\npositional angle of Seyfert-1 AGNs focuses on the reflection of non-polarized\nradiation from sub-parsec jets in optically thick accretion discs. The presence\nof a magnetic field surrounding the scattering media will induce Faraday\nrotation of the polarization plane that may explain the intermediate values of\npositional angles if there is a magnetic field component normal to the\naccretion disc.

In order to fully exploit the potential of these data sets, it\nis important to understand the systematic effects associated with the\ninstrument and the analysis pipeline. A common approach to tackle this is to\nforward-model the entire system - from the hardware to the analysis of the data\nproducts. For this purpose, we introduce two newly developed, open-source\nPython packages: the HI Data Emulator (HIDE) and the Signal Extraction and\nEmission Kartographer (SEEK) for simulating and processing single-dish radio\nsurvey data. HIDE forward-models the process of collecting astronomical radio\nsignals in a single-dish radio telescope instrument and outputs pixel-level\ntime-ordered-data. SEEK processes the time-ordered-data, removes artifacts from\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI), automatically applies flux calibration, and\naims to recover the astronomical radio signal. The two packages can be used\nseparately or together depending on the application. Their modular and flexible\nnature allows easy adaptation to other instruments and data sets. We describe\nthe basic architecture of the two packages and examine in detail the noise and\nRFI modeling in HIDE, as well as the implementation of gain calibration and RFI\nmitigation in SEEK. We then apply HIDE & SEEK to forward-model a Galactic\nsurvey in the frequency range 990 - 1260 MHz based on data taken at the Bleien\nObservatory. For this survey, we expect to cover 70% of the full sky and\nachieve a median signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 - 6 in the cleanest\nchannels including systematic uncertainties. However, we also point out the\npotential challenges of high RFI contamination and baseline removal when\nexamining the early data from the Bleien Observatory. \n\n"}

Extragalactic cosmic rays\nshould be isotropic, but galactic cosmic rays of this type should be seen\nmostly along the galactic plane, and there should be a shortage of events\ncoming from directions near the galactic anticenter. This is due to the fact\nthat, under the influence of the galactic magnetic field, the transition from\nballistic to diffusive behavior is well advanced, and this qualitative picture\npersists over the whole energy range.

Self-regulation cycle and\n  non-thermal emission Abstract: Self-regulated feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to be\ncritical in balancing radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centres\nof galaxy clusters and in regulating star formation in central galaxies. In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii. Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs). In contrast, the\npredicted non-thermal emission is well below observational data in cooling\ngalaxy clusters without RMHs.

When $h<2$, the plasma effect\ndominates over the vacuum Schwarzschild curvature, potentially shifting the\nradius of the unstable circular photon orbit outside the surface of the CO.\nWhen this occurs, we define two relatively narrow radio-frequency bands in\nwhich plasma effects are particularly significant. Rays in the escape window\nhave $\\omega_{0} < \\omega \\leq \\omega_{+}$ and are free to propagate to\ninfinity from the CO surface.

A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the\norder of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is\nmandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting\nback into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of\nsubsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a\nconventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be\napplied without a significant loss of data.

The resulting radiation could potentially be detected\nby the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European\nExtremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from\nneutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic\ncenter, because dark matter is denser in these regions.

HAWC is able to detect secondary particles from\nextensive air showers (EAS) initiated in the interaction of a primary particle\n(either a gamma or a charged cosmic ray) with the upper atmosphere. Because an\noverwhelming majority of EAS events are triggered by cosmic rays, background\nnoise suppression plays an important role in the data analysis process of the\nHAWC observatory. Currently, HAWC uses cuts on two parameters (whose values\ndepend on the spatial distribution and luminosity of an event) to separate\ngamma-ray events from background hadronic showers.

The electrons producing these synchrotron radio\nflares could either be accelerated inside a relativistic jet or externally by\nshocks resulting from an outflow interacting with the circumnuclear medium.\nUntil now, evidence for the internal emission mechanism has been lacking;\nnearly all tidal disruption flare studies have adopted the external shock model\nto explain the observed properties of radio flares.

Variability features in the X-ray light\ncurve appear again in the radio light curve, but after a time lag of about 13\ndays.

Consequently\nnon-negligible degradation of azimuthal spatial resolution is caused due to\nthis IBF. Meanwhile, it is necessary to collect primary ionized electrons to\nmaintain intrinsic performance of the MPGDs. The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution. Because of a unique beam structure of\nthe ILC, the IBF is a critical issue for the realization of the ILD-TPC. Not\nonly to suppress the ion back-flow to the drift volume, but also to allow the\nprimary electrons pass through, a large aperture GEM-like gating device has\nbeen developed. Several bench tests for confirming the performance of the\ngating device have been conducted, besides that, beam test with the full\ndetector module equipped with the gating device was carried out to verify the\nresolution that the full module can provide. As a result, it turned out that\nthe developed gating device fulfills requirements for maintaining the\nperformance of the MPGD based TPC, and it has sufficient performance for the\ncentral tracker of the ILD at the ILC. \n\n"}

The efficiency of thermal conduction in\nthe intracluster medium (ICM) is complicated by the existence of turbulence and\nmagnetic fields, and has received a lot of attention in the literature.\nPrevious studies suggest that the magnetothermal instability developed in outer\nregions of galaxy clusters would drive magnetic field lines preferentially\nradial, resulting in efficient conduction along the radial direction. Using a\nseries of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate the impact of\nthermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions\nof three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially\nmodifies the ICM temperature profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a\nrepresentative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically decreases by ~10 - 20% and the\naverage temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops by ~ 30 -\n40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium\nstate in the presence of thermal conduction. However, X-ray observations show\nthat the outer regions of massive clusters have remarkably similar\nradially-declining temperature profiles, suggesting that they should be quite\nstable. Our study thus suggests that the effective conductivity along the\nradial direction must be suppressed below the Spitzer value by a factor of 10\nor more, unless additional heating sources offset conductive cooling and\nmaintain the observed temperature distributions. Our study provides a\nsmoking-gun evidence for the suppression of parallel conduction along magnetic\nfield lines in low-collisionality plasmas by kinetic mirror or whistler\ninstabilities. \n\n"}

Black holes seem like mystical objects, but they are\nan integral part of current astrophysics and are at the center of attempts to\nunify quantum physics and general relativity. Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast\nto earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due\nto a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of\nthe event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is\nattempting to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved\nby adding more telescopes to the array, in particular at high sites in Africa.\nUltimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event Horizon Imager, could\nproduce much more detailed images of black holes. In combination with numerical\nsimulations and precise measurements of the orbits of stars - ideally also of\npulsars - these images will allow us to study black holes with unprecedented\nprecision. \n\n"}

The outer layers\nof a neutron star consist of a solid nuclear crust, permeated by a neutron\nocean in its densest region, possibly on top of a nuclear \"pasta\" mantle. The\nproperties of these layers and of the homogeneous isospin asymmetric nuclear\nmatter beneath constituting the outer core may still be constrained by\nterrestrial experiments.

Until\nrecently, it was believed that proportional electroluminescence was fully due\nto VUV emission of noble gas excimers produced in atomic collisions with\nexcited atoms, the latter being in turn produced by drifting electrons.

The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the\noverwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady\naccreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The\nthird is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading\ndirectly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that\nis simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect.\nFor concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in\naccretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical\nwork directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic\n(\"viscous\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective\nradiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission\nproblem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar\nto breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar,\npermitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow\nthan otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent,\ntangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an\nangular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve.\nMoreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate\nbut to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then\nvertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then\nthat jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar\njets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven. \n\n"}

The\ndistribution of the radio signal on the ground contains information on crucial\ncosmic-ray properties, such as energy and mass. A long standing challenge is to\naccess this information experimentally with a sparse grid of antennas. We\npresent a new analytic model of the radio signal distribution that depends only\non the definition of the shower axis and on the parameters energy and distance\nto the emission region. The distance to the emission region has a direct\nrelation to the cosmic ray's mass. This new analytic model describes the\ndifferent polarizations of the radiation and therefore allows the use of\nindependently measured signals in different polarization, thereby doubling the\namount of information that is available in current radio arrays, compared to\nwhat has been used thus far. We show with the use of CoREAS Monte Carlo\nsimulation that fitting the measurements with our model does not result in\nsignificant contributions in both systematic bias and in resolution for the\nextracted parameters energy and distance to emission region, when compared to\nthe expected experimental measurement uncertainties. \n\n"}

This introduces several\nundesirable complexities while analytically dealing with the stationary\nintegral accretion solutions and the corresponding phase portraits. We propose\nthat introduction of an effective dynamical sound speed may resolve the issue\nin an elegant way. We linear perturb the full spacetime-dependent general\nrelativistic Euler and the continuity equations governing the structure and the\ndynamics of accretion disc in vertical equilibrium around Schwarzschild black\nholes and identify the sonic metric embedded within the stationary background\nflow. Such metric describes the propagation of the linear acoustic perturbation\ninside the accretion flow.

Such substitution will make\nthe value of Mach number at the critical point to be equal to unity. Use of the\naforementioned effective sound speed will lead to a modified stationary disc\nstructure where the critical and the sonic points will be identical. \n\n"}

The vector dark matter in the hidden sector does not\ndirectly couple to the visible sector, but instead annihilates into the hidden\nHiggs bosons which decay through a small coupling into the CP-odd Higgs bosons.\nIn this model, the Galactic center gamma-ray excess is mainly due to the 2-step\ncascade annihilation with $\\tau$'s in the final state. The obtained mass of the\nCP-odd Higgs $A$ in the Galactic center excess fit can explain the muon $g-2$\nanomaly at the 2$\\sigma$ level without violating the stringent constraints from\nthe lepton universality and $\\tau$ decays.

Our method makes use of \\textit{Lagrangian} particles\nmoving through an Eulerian grid where the (relativistic) MHD equations are\nsolved concurrently. Lagrangian particles follow fluid streamlines and\nrepresent ensembles of (real) relativistic particles with a finite energy\ndistribution. The spectral distribution of each particle is updated in time by\nsolving the relativistic cosmic ray transport equation based on local fluid\nconditions. This enables us to account for a number of physical processes, such\nas adiabatic expansion, synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. An accurate\nsemi-analytically numerical scheme that combines the method of characteristics\nwith a Lagrangian discretization in the energy coordinate is described.\n  In presence of (relativistic) magnetized shocks, a novel approach to\nconsistently model particle energization due to diffusive shock acceleration\nhas been presented. Our approach relies on a refined shock-detection algorithm\nand updates the particle energy distribution based on the shock compression\nratio, magnetic field orientation and amount of (parameterized) turbulence. The\nevolved distribution from each \\textit{Lagrangian} particle is further used to\nproduce observational signatures like emission maps and polarization signals\naccounting for proper relativistic corrections. We further demonstrate the\nvalidity of this hybrid framework using standard numerical benchmarks and\nevaluate the applicability of such a tool to study high energy emission from\nextra-galactic jets. \n\n"}

We\ndetect 15 candidate low frequency variables that show significant long term\nvariability (>2.8 years) with time-averaged modulation indices M = 3.1 - 7.1%.\nWith 7/15 of these variable sources having peaked spectral energy\ndistributions, and only 5.7% of the overall sample having peaked spectra, we\nfind an increase in the prevalence of variability in this spectral class. We\nconclude that the variability seen in this survey is most probably a\nconsequence of refractive interstellar scintillation and that these objects\nmust have the majority of their flux density contained within angular diameters\nless than 50 milli-arcsec (which we support with multi-wavelength data). At 154\nMHz we demonstrate that interstellar scintillation time-scales become long\n(~decades) and have low modulation indices, whilst synchrotron driven\nvariability can only produce dynamic changes on time-scales of hundreds of\nyears, with flux density changes less than one milli-jansky (without\nrelativistic boosting). From this work we infer that the low frequency\nextra-galactic southern sky, as seen by SKA-Low, will be non-variable on\ntime-scales shorter than one year. \n\n"}

Two processes that are commonly considered (e.g., for sub-grid\nprescriptions) are Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and the Eddington limit. A\nthird one is AGN wind feedback. It has been long suggested that such a wind\nfeedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently\nthat AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level\nconsistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the\neffect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection\nscheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are\nexplored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one\nin which it has an isothermal sphere profile. We also compare simulations with\nand without cooling. Our main finding is that for reasonable parameters, AGN\nfeedback always limits the accretion rate to be far below the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton limit. For typical wind parameters and a uniform ISM\ndensities of the order $1 {cm}^{-3}$, the accretion rate is found to be several\norders of magnitudes smaller than that inferred in large samples of high\nredshift AGNs. On the other hand, the accretion rate obtained for initially\nisothermal density profile is found to be consistent with the observations,\nparticularly when cooling is included. Furthermore, it roughly scales as\n$\\sigma^{5}$ with the velocity dispersion of the bulge, in accord with the\n$M-\\sigma$ relation. \n\n"}

Such an observing strategy delivers both the color and light curve\nevolution of transients on the same night. This allows the identification and\ninitial characterization of fast transient -- or fast features of longer\ntimescale transients -- such as rapidly declining supernovae, kilonovae, and\nthe signatures of SN ejecta interacting with binary companion stars or\ncircumstellar material. Some of these extragalactic transients are\nintrinsically rare and generally all hard to find, thus upcoming surveys like\nthe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could dramatically improve our\nunderstanding of their origin and properties. We colloquially refer to such a\nstrategy implementation for the LSST as the Presto-Color strategy\n(rapid-color).

These transients are generated during\nbinary neutron star and potentially neutron star-black hole mergers and are\nelectromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave signals detectable in nearby\nevents with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and other interferometers that will\ncome online in the near future. Discovering a large population of kilonovae\nwill allow us to determine how heavy element production varies with the\nintrinsic parameters of the merger and across cosmic time. The rate of binary\nneutron star mergers is still uncertain, but only few (less than 15) events\nwith associated kilonovae may be detectable per year within the horizon of\nnext-generation ground-based interferometers. The rapid evolution (hours to\ndays) at optical/infrared wavelengths, relatively low luminosity, and the low\nvolumetric rate of kilonovae makes their discovery difficult, especially during\nblind surveys of the sky. We propose future large surveys to adopt a rolling\ncadence in which g-i observations are taken nightly for blocks of 10\nconsecutive nights.

The time-averaged\nspectrum in the $1-79$ keV X-ray band is dominated by a power-law continuum\n($\\Gamma\\sim 1.8-1.9$), a strong soft excess around 1 keV, and signatures of\nX-ray reflection in the form of Fe K emission ($\\sim 6.4$ keV), an Fe K\nabsorption edge ($\\sim 7.1$ keV), and a Compton hump due to electron scattering\n($\\sim 20-30$ keV).

Deeper observations of this source are thus necessary\nto confirm the presence of relativistic reflection, and to further understand\nthe nature of its soft excess. \n\n"}

We\nconsider a Galactic component that is a mixture of five representative nuclear\nspecies (H, He, N, Si and Fe), for which we adopt rigidity dependent broken\npower-law spectra, and we allow for an extragalactic component which becomes\nstrongly suppressed for decreasing energies. The relative abundances of the\nGalactic components at $10^{15}$~eV are taken to be comparable to those\ndetermined by direct measurements at $10^{13}$~eV. The main features of the\nspectrum and of the composition are reproduced in these scenarios.

The form the spectrum spectrum takes\ndepends on the gravitational wave losses during the magnetars' early spindown -\npure electromagnetic spindown yields a flattening of the E^3 J(E) spectrum\nbelow 10^{20} eV, while a moderate GZK ``cutoff'' appears if gravitational wave\nlosses are strong enough. I outline the physics such that the high energy\nparticles escape with small energy losses from a magnetar's natal supernova,\nincluding Rayleigh-Taylor ``shredding'' of the supernova envelope, expansion of\na relativistic blast wave into the interstellar medium, acceleration of the UHE\nions through surf-riding in the electromgnetic fields of the wind, and escape\nof the UHE ions in the rotational equator with negligible radiation loss. The\nabundance of interstellar supershells and unusually large supernova remnants\nsuggests that most of the initial spindown energy is radiated in khz\ngravitational waves for several hours after each supernova, with effective\nstrains from sources at typical distances ~ 3 x 10^{-21}.

The\nconstant intensity cut method is based on the selection of air showers by\ncharged particle or muon size and therefore is subject to intrinsic shower\nfluctuations. We demostrate that, depending on the selection method, shower\nfluctuations can strongly influence the characteristics of the selected\nshowers. Furthermore, a mixture of different primaries in the cosmic ray flux\ncomplicates the interpretation of measurements based on the method of constant\nintensity cuts. As an example we consider data published by the Akeno\nCollaboration. The interpretation of the Akeno measurements suggests that more\nthan 60-70% of cosmic ray primaries in the energy range 10^{16}-19^{17} eV are\nheavy nuclei.

We suggest that the\nCompton-Getting effect can play a similar role at ultra-high energies: If at\nthese energies the cosmic ray flux is dominated by sources at cosmological\ndistances, then the movement of the Sun relative to the cosmic microwave\nbackground frame induces a dipole anisotropy at the 0.6% level. The energy\ndependence and the orientation of this anisotropy provide important information\nabout the transition between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays, the charge\nof the cosmic ray primaries, the galactic magnetic field and, at the highest\nenergies, the energy-loss horizon of cosmic rays. A 3-sigma detection of this\neffect requires around 10^6 events in the considered energy range and is thus\nchallenging but not impossible with present detectors. As a corollary we note\nthat the Compton-Getting effect allows one also to constrain the fraction of\nthe diffuse gamma-ray background emitted by sources at cosmological distance,\nwith promising detection possibilities for the GLAST satellite. \n\n"}

The latter has a break at a peak\nflux of 1.5 ph/cm^2/s, while the distribution of simple bursts is smooth down\nto the BATSE threshold. We also observe brightness dependent variations in the\nshape of the average peak aligned time profile (ATP) of GRBs. The decaying\nslope of the ATP shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts while\nthe rising slope hardly changes. Both slopes of the ATP are deformed for weak\nbursts as compared to strong bursts. The interpretation of these effects is\nsimple: a complex burst where a number of independent pulses overlap in time\nappears intrinsically stronger than a simple burst. Then the BATSE sample of\ncomplex bursts covers larger redshifts where some cosmological factor causes\nthe break in the peak brightness distribution.
