Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state. \n\n"}

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha.

The\nexistence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of\nangular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed. Rather, the\nturbulent angular momentum transport accounts for the poleward meridional flow\nwhile the often overlooked meridional force balance maintains the mid-latitude\nrotational shear. We suggest that the base of the NSSL is marked by a\ntransition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses in the meridional plane which\nsuppress Coriolis-induced circulations that would otherwise establish a\ncylindrical rotation profile. The turbulent angular momentum transport must be\nnon-diffusive and directed radially inward.

Most have involved changes to the algorithm which either\nintroduce artificial correction terms or violate arguably the greatest\nadvantage of SPH over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy,\nmomentum, and angular momentum. Here, we show how a class of alternative SPH\nequations of motion (EOM) can be derived self-consistently from a discrete\nparticle Lagrangian (guaranteeing manifest conservation) in a manner which\ntremendously improves treatment of instabilities and contact discontinuities.\nSaitoh & Makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize the\nEOM does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the 'standard'\napproach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, can\nbe incorporated into the rigorous Lagrangian formulation that retains ideal\nconservation properties and includes the 'Grad-h' terms that account for\nvariable smoothing lengths. We derive a general EOM for any choice of volume\nelement (particle 'weights') and method of determining smoothing lengths. We\nthen specify this to a 'pressure-entropy formulation' which resolves problems\nin the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. Implementing this in a new\nversion of the GADGET code, we show it leads to good performance in mixing\nexperiments (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz & blob tests).

This also improves the treatment of\nsub-sonic turbulence, and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers.\nThe code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense.

We apply this method to 6\ndifferent closures for forced-dissipative simulations of the barotropic\nvorticity equation on a f-plane (2D Navier-Stokes equation). Using a\nhigh-resolution benchmark, we compare each closure's model of energy and\nenstrophy transfer to the actual transfer observed in the benchmark run.

In this paper we provide an unified treatment\nof leaking systems and we review applications to different physical problems,\nboth in the classical and quantum pictures.

Two cases are considered. The first one is the\ncounterflowing (Vinen) turbulence, where the vortex lines are disordered, and\nthe evolution of quantity $\\mathcal{L}(t)$ obeys the Vinen equation. The second\ncase is the quasi-classic turbulence, where vortex lines are believed to form\nthe so called vortex bundles, and their dynamics is described by the HVBK\nequations. The latter case, is of a special interest, since a number of recent\nexperiments demonstrate the $\\omega ^{-5/3}$ dependence for spectrum VLD,\ninstead of $\\omega ^{1/3}$ law, typical for spectrum of vorticity. In\nnonstationary situation, in particular, in the fluctuating turbulent flow there\nis a retardation between the instantaneous value of the normal velocity and the\nquantity $\\mathcal{L}$. This retardation tends to decrease in the accordance\nwith the inner dynamics, which has a relaxation character. In both cases the\nrelaxation dynamics of VLD is related to fluctuations of the relative velocity,\nhowever if for the Vinen case the rate of temporal change for $\\mathcal{L}(t)$\nis directly depends on $\\delta \\mathbf{v}_{ns}$, for the HVBK dynamics it\ndepends on $\\nabla \\times \\delta \\mathbf{v}_{ns}$.

Part I: experiment Abstract: A experimental study of low Reynolds numbers unsteady pipe flows of a yield\nstress shear thinning fluid (Carbopol- 980) is presented. The investigation of\nthe solid-fluid transition in a rheometric flow in the presence and in the ab-\nsence of the wall slip reveals a coupling between the irreversible deformation\nstates and the wall slip phenomenon. Particularly, the presence of wall slip\nnearly suppresses the scaling of the deformation power deficit associated to\nthe rheological hysteresis with the rate at which the material is forced. The\nirreversible solid-fluid transition and the wall slip behaviour emerge in the\nsame range of the applied stresses and thus, the two phenomena appear to be\ncoupled to each other. In-situ measurements of the flow fields performed during\nan increasing/decreasing stepped pressure ramp reveal three distinct flow\nregimes: solid (pluglike), solid-fluid and fluid. The deformation power deficit\nassociated with the hysteresis observed during the increasing/decreasing\nbranches of the pressure ramps reveals a dependence on the rate at which the\nunsteady flow is driven consistent with that observed during the rheological\nmeasurements in the presence of slip. The dependence of the slip velocity on\nthe wall shear stresses reveals a Navier-type slip behaviour only within the\nfluid flow regime, which indicates that the wall slip phenomenon is directly\ncoupled to the solid-fluid transition. A universal scaling of the slip velocity\nwith the wall velocity gradients is found and the slip length is independent on\nthe characteristic time of forcing t0. The paper closes with a discussion of\nthe main findings, their possible impact on our current understanding of the\nyielding and slip behaviour of Carbopol gels.

For simple spherical particles, the time dependent growth of\nfluid domains is dominated by the formation of droplets, particle adsorption\nand coalescence of droplets (Ostwald ripening), which eventually can be almost\nfully blocked due to the presence of the particles. Ellipsoidal particles are\nknown to be more efficient stabilizers of fluid interfaces than spherical\nparticles and their anisotropic shape and the related additional rotational\ndegrees of freedom have an impact on the dynamics of emulsion formation.

For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity\nwaves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially tangential\nturbulence.

Most clusters reside in the\nintermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence\ndrifting towards isotropic velocities.

Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such\ndeficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability\ncondensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN\noutflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The\nresultant average distribution slope is $\\alpha \\simeq 2$, oscillating within\nthe observed $1<\\alpha<3$.

Instead, a rigorous derivation\nreveals complete arbitrariness rather than uniqueness in the construction of\ninvariant turbulent scaling laws. Important to note here is that the key\nresults obtained in Oberlack (2001) are based on several technical errors,\nwhich all will be revealed, discussed and corrected. The reason and motivation\nwhy we put our focus solely on Oberlack (2001) is that it still marks the core\nstudy and central reference point when applying the method of Lie-groups to\nturbulence theory. Hence it is necessary to shed the correct light onto that\nstudy. Nevertheless, even if the method of Lie-groups in its full extent is\napplied and interpreted correctly, strong natural limits of this method within\nthe theory of turbulence exist, which, as will be finally discussed, constitute\ninsurmountable obstacles in the progress of achieving a significant\nbreakthrough. \n\n"}

Recent 3D simulations suggest that\nturbulence might play a crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions,\nhowever the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these studies is\nunclear.

We report a detailed analysis of the way in which the\nturbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our results suggest that\nanisotropy and compressibility in CCSN turbulence have little effect on the\nturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ scaling is\nobtained in the inertial range.

While we know the growth rate the magnetic energy\nin the linear regime, the saturation level, i.e. the ratio of magnetic energy\nto turbulent kinetic energy that can be reached, is not known from analytical\ncalculations. In this paper we present the first scale-dependent saturation\nmodel based on an effective turbulent resistivity which is determined by the\nturnover timescale of turbulent eddies and the magnetic energy density. The\nmagnetic resistivity increases compared to the Spitzer value and the effective\nscale on which the magnetic energy spectrum is at its maximum moves to larger\nspatial scales.

The shocklet and shock wave are\ncaused by the solenoidal and compressive modes of driven forces, respectively.\nHereafter, the related two flows are called as SFT and CFT, respectively. It\nshows that in SFT the temperature spectrum follows the k^-5/3 power law, and\nthe temperature field has \"ramp-cliff\" structures. By contrast, in CFT the\ntemperature spectrum obeys the k^-2 power law, and the temperature field is\ndominated by large-scale rarefaction and compression. The power-law exponents\nfor the p.d.f. of large negative dilatation are -2.5 in SFT and -3.5 in CFT,\nclose to theoretical values. For the isentropic assumption of thermodynamic\nvariables, the derivation in SFT grows with the turbulent Mach number (Mt), and\nfor same Mt, the variables in CFT are more anisentropic.

The scaling of the wind Reynolds number with the Taylor\nnumber agrees with the theoretically predicted 3/7-scaling for the classical\nturbulent regime, which is much more pronounced than for the well-explored\n$\\eta=0.71$ case, for which the ultimate regime sets in at much lower Ta.

It is shown that the non-uniqueness problem of the\nFriedmann-Keller hierarchy emerges from the property that the system of\nequations is defined forward recursively.

Specifically, the inverse of the Planck's quantum ($h_e$) and the\nrotor's energy growth rate mimic the `filling fraction' and the `longitudinal\nconductivity' in conventional IQHE, respectively, and a hidden quantum number\nis found to mimic the `quantized Hall conductivity'.

Moreover, the rotor insulating phases are\ntopological, each of which is characterized by a hidden quantum number.

In order to reduce the\ncomputational cost, an adaptive mesh is employed and high mesh resolution is\nonly used near the interface. Parametric studies are performed on the droplet\nhorizontal radius and the capillary number. For droplets with an horizontal\nradius larger than half the channel height the droplet overfills the channel\nand exhibits a pancake shape. A lubrication film is formed between the droplet\nand the wall and particular attention is paid to the effect of the lubrication\nfilm on the droplet velocity. The computed velocity of the pancake droplet is\nshown to be lower than the average inflow velocity, which is in agreement with\nexperimental measurements.

It is known that the rainfall within\nthis area cannot be explained by local processes alone but requires imported\nmoisture. Nonetheless, the dynamics of this imported moisture appears unknown.\nHere, considering a region up to three thousand kilometers from storm center,\nwe analyze precipitation, atmospheric moisture and movement velocities for\nNorth Atlantic hurricanes. Our findings indicate that even over such large\nareas a hurricane's rainfall cannot be accounted for by concurrent evaporation.\nWe propose instead that a hurricane consumes pre-existing atmospheric water\nvapor as it moves. The propagation velocity of the cyclone, i.e. the difference\nbetween its movement velocity and the mean velocity of the surrounding air\n(steering flow), determines the water vapor budget. Water vapor available to\nthe hurricane through its movement makes the hurricane self-sufficient at about\n700 km from the hurricane center obviating the need to concentrate moisture\nfrom greater distances. Such hurricanes leave a dry wake, whereby rainfall is\nsuppressed by up to 40 per cent compared to its long-term mean. The inner\nradius of this dry footprint approximately coincides with the radius of\nhurricane self-sufficiency with respect to water vapor. We discuss how Carnot\nefficiency considerations do not constrain the power of such open systems that\ndeplete the pre-existing moisture. Our findings emphasize the incompletely\nunderstood role and importance of atmospheric moisture supplies, condensation\nand precipitation in hurricane dynamics. \n\n"}

The main difference concerns the\nmagnitude of the mode amplification: whereas transcritical flows display a\nlarge amplification (which is generally in good agreement with the Hawking\nprediction), this effect is heavily suppressed in subcritical flows.

As an important application, we reconsider the\nphenomenon of \"Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity\" or persistent\nnon-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing\nviscosity and diffusivity.

Lacking an instability, the large transient growth of\nthe roll/streak structure has been invoked to explain its appearance as\nresulting from chance occurrence in the free-stream turbulence (FST) of\nperturbations configured to optimally excite it. However, there is an\nalternative interpretation which is that FST interacts with the roll/streak\nstructure to destabilize it. Statistical state dynamics (SSD) provides analysis\nmethods for studying instabilities of this type which arise from interaction\nbetween the coherent and incoherent components of turbulence. Stochastic\nstructural stability theory (S3T), which implements SSD in the form of a\nclosure at second order, is used to analyze the SSD modes arising from\ninteraction between the coherent streamwise invariant component and the\nincoherent FST component of turbulence. The least stable S3T mode is\ndestabilized at a critical value of a parameter controlling FST intensity and a\nfinite amplitude roll/streak structure arises from this instability through a\nbifurcation in this parameter. Although this bifurcation has analytical\nexpression only in SSD, it is closely reflected in both the dynamically similar\nquasi-linear system, referred to as the restricted non-linear (RNL) system, and\nin DNS. S3T also predicts a second bifurcation at a higher value of the\nturbulent excitation parameter. This second bifurcation is shown to lead to\ntransition to turbulence.

We consider here the rate of growth\nof the classical and fractional enstrophy in the fractional Burgers equation in\nthe subcritical and supercritical regimes. Since solutions to this equation\nexhibit, respectively, globally well-posed behavior and finite-time blow-up in\nthese two regimes, this makes it a useful model to study the maximum\ninstantaneous growth of enstrophy possible in these two distinct situations.\nFirst, we obtain estimates on the rates of growth and then show that these\nestimates are sharp up to numerical prefactors. This is done by numerically\nsolving suitably defined constrained maximization problems and then\ndemonstrating that for different values of the fractional dissipation exponent\nthe obtained maximizers saturate the upper bounds in the estimates as the\nenstrophy increases. We conclude that the power-law dependence of the enstrophy\nrate of growth on the fractional dissipation exponent has the same global form\nin the subcritical, critical and parts of the supercritical regime. This\nindicates that the maximum enstrophy rate of growth changes smoothly as global\nwell-posedness is lost when the fractional dissipation exponent attains\nsupercritical values. In addition, nontrivial behavior is revealed for the\nmaximum rate of growth of the fractional enstrophy obtained for small values of\nthe fractional dissipation exponents. We also characterize the structure of the\nmaximizers in different cases. \n\n"}

Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance.

Rough-walled\nflows are of great practical significance, yet no recurring solutions are known\nfor these flows. We present a numerical homotopy method to continue solutions\nfrom flat-walled plane Couette flow (PCF) to grooved PCF, demonstrated here at\na Reynolds number of 400, to act as a starting point for similar continuation\nto rough-walled flows.

Nonetheless, the dynamics of\nquantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic are expected to show\nsome features that resemble chaotic motion.

The inverse problem is posed\nas follows: for a given selection of airfoils, the objective is to find the\nblade geometry (described as blade twist and chord distributions) which\nrealizes the desired turbine aerodynamic performance at the design point; the\ndesired performance is prescribed as angle of attack ($\\alpha$) and axial\ninduction factor ($a$) distributions along the blade. An iterative approach is\nused. An initial estimate of blade geometry is used with the direct solver\n(RANS/ADM) to obtain $\\alpha$ and $a$.

Lighthill (1971) originally proposed\nthat this burst-and-coast behavior can save fish energy during swimming by\ntaking advantage of the viscous Bone-Lighthill boundary layer thinning\nmechanism. Here, an additional inviscid Garrick mechanism is discovered that\nallows swimmers to control the ratio of their added mass thrust-producing\nforces to their circulatory drag-inducing forces by decreasing their duty\ncycle, DC, of locomotion. This mechanism can save intermittent swimmers as much\nas 60% of the energy it takes to swim continuously at the same speed. The\ninviscid energy savings are shown to increase with increasing amplitude of\nmotion, increase with decreasing Lighthill number, Li, and switch to an\nenergetic cost above continuous swimming for sufficiently low DC. Intermittent\nswimmers are observed to shed four vortices per cycle that form into groups\nthat are self-similar with the DC. In addition, previous thrust and power\nscaling laws of continuous self-propelled swimming are further generalized to\ninclude intermittent swimming. The key is that by averaging the thrust and\npower coefficients over only the bursting period then the intermittent problem\ncan be transformed into a continuous one. Furthermore, the intermittent thrust\nand power scaling relations are extended to predict the mean speed and cost of\ntransport of swimmers. By tuning a few coefficients with a handful of\nsimulations these self-propelled relations can become predictive.

This is particularly acute for\nsimulation models that are flexible in their use of multi-scale, anisotropic,\nfully unstructured meshes where a relatively large number of heterogeneous\nparameters are required to constrain their full description. As a consequence,\nit can be difficult to reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data\nhandling and initialisation, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons\nrigorously.

This framework contains four steps. First, the sensor signals are\nlifted to a dynamic feature space. Second, we identify a sparse\nhuman-interpretable nonlinear dynamical system for the feature state based on\nthe sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Third, if PIV\nsnapshots are available, a local linear mapping from the feature state to\nvelocity fields is shown to be orders of magnitudes more accurate than optimal\nmodal expansions of the same order. Fourth, a generalized feature-based modal\ndecomposition identifies coherent structures that are most dynamically\ncorrelated with the linear and nonlinear interaction terms in the sparse model,\nadding interpretability.

We first explicitly demonstrate that the non-relativistic\nlimit of these scaling relations reduce to known results from the statistical\ntheory of incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence. In simulations of the\ninverse-cascade range, we find the relevant relativistic scaling relation is\nsatisfied to a high degree of accuracy. We observe that the non-relativistic\nversions of this scaling relation underperform the relativistic one in both an\nabsolute and relative sense, with a progressive degradation as the rms Mach\nnumber increases from $0.14$ to $0.19$.

Recently, a\nmachine-learning approach has been proposed to assist RANS modeling by building\na functional mapping from mean flow features to discrepancies in RANS modeled\nReynolds stresses as compared to high-fidelity data. However, it remains a\nchallenge to represent discrepancies in the Reynolds stress eigenvectors in\nmachine learning due to the requirements of spatial smoothness,\nframe-independence, and realizability. In this work, we propose three schemes\nfor representing perturbations to the eigenvectors of RANS modeled Reynolds\nstresses: (1) discrepancy-based Euler angles, (2) direct-rotation-based Euler\nangles, and (3) unit quaternions. We compare these metrics by performing a\npriori and a posteriori tests on two canonical flows: fully developed turbulent\nflows in a square duct and massively separated flows over periodic hills.

Due to the high-order gas evolution model, the GKS provides a\ntime dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface. This time\nevolution solution can be used not only for the flux evaluation across a cell\ninterface and its time derivative, but also time accurate evolution solution at\na cell interface. As a result, besides updating the conservative flow variables\ninside each control volume, the GKS can get the cell averaged slopes inside\neach control volume as well through the differences of flow variables at the\ncell interfaces. So, with the updated flow variables and their slopes inside\neach cell, the HWENO reconstruction can be naturally implemented for the\ncompact high-order reconstruction at the beginning of next step. Therefore, a\ncompact higher-order GKS, such as the two-stages fourth-order compact scheme\ncan be constructed. This scheme is as robust as second-order one, but more\naccurate solution can be obtained. In comparison with compact fourth-order DG\nmethod, the current scheme has only two stages instead of four within each time\nstep for the fourth-order temporal accuracy, and the CFL number used here can\nbe on the order of $0.5$ instead of $0.11$ for the DG method.

The inverse\nof their inner product, which is unity for a purely normal mechanism, is\nproposed as a measure to quantify non-normality. In flows where there is\ndownstream spatial dependence of the base/mean, mean flow advection separates\nthe spatial support of forcing and response modes which impacts the inner\nproduct. Success of mean stability analysis depends on the normality of\namplification. If the amplification is normal, the resolvent operator written\nin its dyadic representation reveals that the adjoint and forward stability\nmodes are proportional to the forcing and response resolvent modes. If the\namplification is non-normal, then resolvent analysis is required to understand\nthe origin of observed flow structures. Eigenspectra and pseudospectra are used\nto characterize these phenomena. Two test cases are studied: low Reynolds\nnumber cylinder flow and turbulent channel flow.

Assuming small capillary number and small electric\nReynolds number, we employ a regular perturbation technique to solve the\ncoupled system of governing equations. It is shown that when a leaky dielectric\ndrop is sedimenting in another leaky dielectric fluid, Marangoni stress can\noppose the electrohydrodynamic motion severely, thereby causing corresponding\nchanges in internal flow pattern. Such effects further result in retardation of\ndrop settling velocity, which would have otherwise increased due to the\ninfluence of charge convection.

In this\ninvestigation of high-$Ra$ porous media convection in a minimal flow unit, two\nreduced modeling strategies are proposed that exploit these specific flow\ncharacteristics. Both approaches utilize the idea of decomposition since the\nflow exhibits different dynamics in different regions of the domain:\nsmall-scale cellular motions generally are localized within the thermal and\nvorticity boundary layers near the upper and lower walls, while in the\ninterior, the flow exhibits persistent large-scale structures and only a few\nlow (horizontal) wavenumber Fourier modes are active. Accordingly, in the first\nstrategy, the domain is decomposed into two near-wall regions and one interior\nregion. Our results confirm that suppressing the interior high-wavenumber modes\nhas negligible impact on the essential structural features and transport\nproperties of the flow.

The induced lift force is\nattributed to an elastohydrodynamic coupling that arises from the breaking of\nthe flow reversal symmetry induced by the elastic deformation of the\ntranslating object or the interface. Here we derive explicit analytical\nexpressions for the quasi-steady state lift force exerted on a rigid spherical\nparticle translating parallel to a finite-sized membrane exhibiting a\nresistance toward both shear and bending. Our analytical approach proceeds\nthrough the application of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem so as to obtain the\nsolution of the flow problem using a perturbation technique for small\ndeformations of the membrane.

Physically, the exponential growth is a front\npropagating into an unstable state in phase space. As in conventional Boltzmann\ntransport, which follows from the dynamics of the net particle number density\nexchange, the kernel of this kinetic integral equation is also set by the\n2-to-2 scattering rate.

However, the clustering strength does not monotonously\ndecay with the relative turbulence intensity. Various mechanisms by which\ncoherent structures can affect particle motion are discussed.

In this work, an inviscid regularization technique called\n'observable regularization' is proposed for the simulation of two-phase\ncompressible flows. The proposed approach regularizes the equations at the\nlevel of the partial differential equation and as a result, any numerical\nmethod can be used to solve the system of equations. The regularization is\naccomplished by introducing an 'observability limit' that represents the length\nscale below which one cannot properly model or continue to resolve flow\nstructures.

Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in\nfully periodic cubes composed of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale\nsinusoidal shear flow.

The perturbation theory\ntells that a perturbed energy eigenstate can be divided into a perturbative\npart and a non-perturbative part with the perturbative part expressed as a\nperturbation expansion. Numerically it is found that such a division is\nimportant in understanding many properties of both eigenstates and the\nso-called local spectral density of states (LDOS). For the average shape of\neigenstates, its central part is found to be composed of its non-perturbative\npart and a region of its perturbative part, which is close to the\nnon-perturbative part. A relationship between the average shape of eigenstates\nand that of LDOS can be explained.

This provides a natural classification of the tunneling\nsolutions. Second, we present a heuristic procedure for sorting out the least\nsuppressed trajectory. As an illustration, we apply our technique to the\nprocess of chaotic tunneling in a quantum mechanical model with two degrees of\nfreedom. Our analysis reveals rich dynamics of the system. At the classical\nlevel, there exists an infinite set of unstable solutions forming a fractal\nstructure. This structure is inherited by the complex tunneling paths and plays\nthe central role in the semiclassical study. The process we consider exhibits\nthe phenomenon of optimal tunneling: the suppression exponent of the tunneling\nprobability has a local minimum at a certain energy which is thus (locally) the\noptimal energy for tunneling. We test the proposed method by comparison of the\nsemiclassical results with the results of the exact quantum computations and\nfind a good agreement. \n\n"}

A simple\nimpeller model drives a flow which can generate a growing magnetic field,\ndepending upon the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, and the fluid Reynolds number.\nWhen the flow is laminar, the dynamo transition is governed by a simple\nthreshold in Rm, above which a growing magnetic eigenmode is observed. The\neigenmode is primarily a dipole field tranverse to axis of symmetry of the\nflow. In saturation the Lorentz force slows the flow such that the magnetic\neigenmode becomes marginally stable. For turbulent flow, the dynamo eigenmode\nis suppressed. The mechanism of suppression is due to a combination of a time\nvarying large-scale field and the presence of fluctuation driven currents which\neffectively enhance the magnetic diffusivity. For higher Rm a dynamo reappears,\nhowever the structure of the magnetic field is often different from the laminar\ndynamo; it is dominated by a dipolar magnetic field which is aligned with the\naxis of symmetry of the mean-flow, apparently generated by fluctuation-driven\ncurrents.

This result is an analogue for circulation\nof Onsager's theorem on energy dissipation for singular Euler solutions. The\nphysical mechanism of the breakdown of Kelvin's Theorem is diffusion of lines\nof large-scale vorticity out of the advected loop. This phenomenon can be\nviewed as a classical analogue of the Josephson-Anderson phase-slip phenomenon\nin superfluids due to quantized vortex lines. We show that the circulation\ncascade is local in scale and use this locality to develop concrete expressions\nfor the turbulent vortex-force by a multi-scale gradient-expansion. We discuss\nimplications for Taylor's theory of turbulent dissipation and we point out some\nrelated cascade phenomena, in particular for magnetic-flux in\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. \n\n"}

This kinetic description allows\nfor expansion or compression of a fluid element, and is characterized by a flux\nof volume that conventional modelling does not account for. A new convective\nform of transport arises from this new approach, which is due purely to\nmacroscopic expansion or compression. It supplements the conventional transport\nprocesses, which are transport due purely to mass motion (classical convective\ntransport) and transport due purely to random motion (diffusive transport). In\naddition, we show that the thermodynamic parameters of the fluid (temperature\nand pressure) appear with new non-equilibrium contributions that depend on\ndensity variations in the gas. Our new model may be useful for describing gas\nflows that display non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (rarefied gas flows),\nflows with relatively large variations of macroscopic properties, and/or highly\ncompressible fluids and flows. \n\n"}

In contrast to known waves (Faisst & Eckhardt Phys. Rev. Lett.\n91, 224502 (2003), Wedin & Kerswell, J. Fluid Mech. 508, 333 (2004)), they\npossess no rotational symmetry and exist at much lower Reynolds numbers.\nParticularly striking is an `asymmetric mode' which has one slow streak\nsandwiched between two fast streaks located preferentially to one side of the\npipe. This family originates in a pitchfork bifurcation from a mirror-symmetric\ntravelling wave which can be traced down to a Reynolds number of 773. Helical\nand non-helical rotating waves are also found emphasizing the richness of phase\nspace even at these very low Reynolds numbers.
