We investigate how upcoming astrophysical experiments will\nexplore the existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10^-33eV to\n10^-10eV. Axions with masses between 10^-33eV to 10^-28eV cause a rotation of\nthe CMB polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted\nrotation angle is of order \\alpha~1/137. Axions in the mass range 10^-28eV to\n10^-18eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, that will be\nprobed by upcoming galaxy surveys. Axions in the mass range 10^-22eV to\n10^-10eV affect the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of rapidly\nrotating astrophysical black holes through the Penrose superradiance process.\nWhen the axion Compton wavelength is of order of the black hole size, the\naxions develop \"superradiant\" atomic bound states around the black hole\n\"nucleus\". Their occupation number grows exponentially by extracting rotational\nenergy from the ergosphere, culminating in a rotating Bose-Einstein axion\ncondensate emitting gravitational waves.

We\nrevisit this scenario by using Green's function solutions to calculate the\ntemporal viscous evolution and the corresponding electromagnetic signature of\nthe circumbinary disk.

In these models, which we\ncall the canonical superconformal supergravity (CSS) models, the kinetic terms\nin the Jordan frame are canonical, and the scalar potential is the same as in\nthe global theory. The pure supergravity part of the total action has a local\nPoincare supersymmetry, whereas the chiral and vector multiplets coupled to\nsupergravity have a larger local superconformal symmetry. The scale-free\nglobally supersymmetric theories, such as the NMSSM with a scale-invariant\nsuperpotential, can be naturally embedded into this class of theories. After\nthe supergravity embedding, the Jordan frame scalar potential of such theories\nremains scale free; it is quartic, it contains no mass terms, no\nnonrenormalizable terms, no cosmological constant. The local superconformal\nsymmetry can be broken by additional terms, which, in the small field limit,\nare suppressed by the gravitational coupling. This can be achieved by\nintroducing the nonminimal scalar-curvature coupling, and by taking into\naccount interactions with a hidden sector.

Since there are a large number of metastable de Sitter vacua\nin string landscape, tunneling transitions to lower metastable vacua through\nthe bubble nucleation occur quite naturally. Although the deviation of Omega_0\nfrom unity is small by the observational bound, we argue that the effect of\nthis small deviation on the large angle CMB anisotropies can be significant for\ntensor-type perturbation in open inflation scenario. We consider the situation\nin which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum\ntunneling and that of the slow-roll inflation in the nucleated bubble. If the\npotential just after tunneling is steep enough, a rapid-roll phase appears\nbefore the slow-roll inflation. In this case the power spectrum is basically\ndetermined by the Hubble rate during the slow-roll inflation. If such\nrapid-roll phase is absent, the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high\nenergy density there in the large angular components. The amplitude of large\nangular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation\nmode if the bubble wall tension is small. Therefore, one can construct some\nmodels in which the deviation of Omega_0 from unity is large enough to produce\nmeasurable effects.

The small-scale nature of spacetime can be tested with observations of\ndistant quasars. We comment on a recent paper by Tamburini et al. (A&A, 533,\n71) which claims that Hubble Space Telescope observations of the most distant\nquasars place severe constraints on models of foamy spacetime.\n  Methods. If space is foamy on the Planck scale, photons emitted from distant\nobjects will accumulate uncertainties in distance and propagation directions\nthus affecting the expected angular size of a compact object as a function of\nredshift. We discuss the geometry of foamy spacetime, and the appropriate\ndistance measure for calculating the expected angular broadening. We also\naddress the mechanics of carrying out such a test. We draw upon our previously\npublished work on this subject (Christiansen et al. 2011), which carried out\nsimilar tests as Tamburini et al. and also went considerably beyond their work\nin several respects.\n  Results. When calculating the path taken by photons as they travel from a\ndistant source to Earth, one must use the comoving distance rather than the\nluminosity distance. This then also becomes the appropriate distance to use\nwhen calculating the angular broadening expected in a distant source. The use\nof the wrong distance measure causes Tamburini et al. to overstate the\nconstraints that can be placed on models of spacetime foam. In addition, we\nconsider the impact of different ways of parametrizing and measuring the\neffects of spacetime foam. Given the variation of the shape of the point-spread\nfunction (PSF) on the chip, as well as observation-specific factors, it is\nimportant to select carefully -- and document -- the comparison stars used as\nwell as the methods used to compute the Strehl ratio. \n\n"}

Here, we\ncalculate the signature of an initial state modification in single-field\nslow-roll inflation in both the scale-dependent bias of the large-scale\nstructure (LSS) and mu-type distortion in the black-body spectrum of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). We parametrize the initial state modifications and\nidentify certain choices of parameters as natural, though we also note some\nfine-tuned choices that can yield a larger bispectrum. In both cases, we\nobserve a distinctive k^-3 signature in LSS (as opposed to k^-2 for the\nlocal-form). As a non-zero bispectrum in the squeezed configuration correlates\na long-wavelength mode with two short-wavelength modes, it induces a\ncorrelation between the CMB temperature anisotropy on large scales with the\ntemperature-anisotropy-squared on very small scales; this correlation persists\nas the small-scale anisotropy-squared is processed into mu-type distortions.\nWhile the local-form mu-distortion turns out to be too small to detect in the\nnear future, a modified initial vacuum state enhances the signal by a large\nfactor owing to an extra factor of k_1/k.

Witten's classic argument that\nbaryons and interacting systems of baryons can be described in a mean-field\napproximation with each of the quarks moving in an average potential due to the\nremaining quarks is heuristic. It is important to justify this heuristic\ndescription for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting\nbaryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the\npossibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up\nthe entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful\nstates coupled together to make a color-singlet state. In this work, we provide\na formal justification of this heuristic prescription. In order to do this, we\nstart by taking the heavy quark limit, thus effectively reducing the problem to\na many-body quantum mechanical system. This problem can be formulated in terms\nof integrals over coherent states, which for this problem are simple Slater\ndeterminants. We show that for the many-body problem, the support region for\nthese integrals becomes narrow at large $N_c$, yielding an energy which is\nwell-approximated by a single coherent state---that is a mean-field\ndescription.

Comparing modified stellar evolution sequences with\nobservations provides some of the most restrictive limits on axions and other\nhypothetical low-mass particles and on non-standard neutrino properties. In\nparticular, a putative neutrino magnetic dipole moment mu_nu enhances the\nplasmon decay process, postpones helium ignition in low-mass stars, and\ntherefore extends the red-giant branch (RGB) in globular clusters (GCs). The\nbrightness of the tip of the RGB (TRGB) remains the most sensitive probe for\nmu_nu and we revisit this argument from a modern perspective. Based on a large\nset of archival observations, we provide high-precision photometry for the\nGalactic GC M5 (NGC5904) and carefully determine its TRGB position. On the\ntheoretical side, we add the extra plasmon decay rate brought about by mu_nu to\nthe Princeton-Goddard-PUC stellar evolution code. Different sources of\nuncertainty are critically examined.

Primordial black\nholes are assumed to be formed when overdensities that cross the horizon have\nSchwarzschild radii larger than the horizon.

However, the physics of tilted discs (e.g., angular momentum\ntransport and jet formation) is poorly understood. Using our new\nGPU-accelerated code H-AMR, we performed 3D general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted thick accretion discs around rapidly\nspinning BHs, at the highest resolution to date. We explored the limit where\ndisc thermal pressure dominates magnetic pressure, and showed for the first\ntime that, for different magnetic field strengths on the BH, these flows launch\nmagnetized relativistic jets propagating along the rotation axis of the tilted\ndisc (rather than of the BH). If strong large-scale magnetic flux reaches the\nBH, it bends the inner few gravitational radii of the disc and jets into\npartial alignment with the BH spin.

Then,\non very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad\nequation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system,\nas well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of\ncurvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations\nconstrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the\ninteraction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes\nby the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths.\nTherefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur\nwithout altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify\nall scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the\ncase in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field.

Once black holes are produced, they will\ngive us much information about TeV-scale new physics directly. But such black\nholes can also be used for the precision measurements of the Standard Model\n(SM). The SM is nothing but a theory which can describe weak-scale, and\nTeV-scale physics will affect it. So if some experimental results which cannot\nbe explained in the SM are found, they will be attributed to TeV-scale physics\nand we can obtain ``bottom-up'' type information about new physics. In this\npaper, we consider the precision measurements of the top sector at the LHC by\nusing black holes. The stringent trigger conditions to confirm the black hole\nproduction vanish almost all of the QCD background, and we can examine the top\nquark emitted from black holes very precisely. The error of the top quark mass\nand the top Yukawa coupling are drastically reduced, leading to a very accurate\ntest of the Higgs mechanism.

Abstract: A sextet quark sector of QCD, together with the sextet higgs mechanism, would\nproduce a major change in the strong interaction above the electroweak scale.\nThis change may already be evident in Cosmic Ray physics and, if so, dramatic\neffects are to be expected at the LHC. In this paper we discuss whether\nevidence for the sextet sector could be seen at the Tevatron.\n  A major consequence of the connection between QCD and electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is the strong coupling of the pomeron to the electroweak sector. At\nthe Tevatron, the energy is too low to produce vector boson pairs directly via\ndouble pomeron exchange, but a number of small cross-section effects could be\nseen in diffractive, and diffractive related, processes involving $W^{\\pm}$ and\n$Z^0$ vector bosons. Probably, the most important feature that could be\ndecisively established is that the production cross-section for $W^+W^-$ and\n$Z^0Z^0$ pairs has an anomalous component with event characteristics different\nfrom the Standard Model. This would be the first indication of what should\nbecome a dominant, very large, cross-section at the LHC.\n  If the sextet quark dynamical mass scale is well above the top quark mass,\nthen the production properties of $W$'s and $Z$'s could be the only new physics\nvisible at the Tevatron scale. If this scale is lower the situation could be\nmore subtle. The observed $t\\bar{t}$ events could originate from the $\\eta_6$ -\nthe ``sextet higgs'', even though they can be understood perturbatively. The\ninterpretation of the top quark mass would, however, be different and\nnon-perturbative decay modes should also be seen.

This two photon process requires\npair annihilation contributions which are subtle to handle in light-front\ndynamics. We are careful to derive such contributions in the light-front\nBethe-Salpeter formalism. This derivation highlights the connection to the Fock\nspace picture as well as provides a toy model for generalized parton\ndistributions.Ultimately we use light-front dynamics to build a\nphenomenological parametrization for the proton's generalized parton\ndistributions. This task is non-trivial due to the field theoretic constraints\nrequired of these distributions. To meet the constraints imposed by Lorentz\ncovariance, we approach generalized parton distributions from the perspective\nof double distributions. Despite avid phenomenological use, surprisingly little\nwork has been done to calculate double distributions. We first focus on a\nnumber of simple pedagogical examples and demonstrate how double distributions\ncan be correctly determined. The double distributions we derive, including\nthose for the proton, satisfy known constraints and are adequate for\nphenomenological estimates of cross sections. The models used allow one to\nstudy the interplay between the light-front formulation and Lorentz covariance. \n\n"}

It is based on the most\ngeneral structure of any pion-nucleon partial wave amplitude neglecting the\nunphysical cuts as derived from the N/D method. This amplitude is then matched\nto the one-loop heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory result at third order\nand to tree level exchanges of baryon- and meson states in the s,t and u\nchannels. This generates the left-hand cuts. The unitarization procedure does\nnot involve form factors or regulator functions. The resonance parameters are\ndetermined from fits to the S- and P-wave pion-nucleon partial wave amplitudes\nfor energies up to 1.3 GeV. In particular, the $\\Delta (1232)$ is accurately\nreproduced whereas scalar and vector meson couplings are less precisely pinned\ndown. We also obtain a satisfactory description of the $\\pi$N threshold\nparameters. Further extensions of this method to coupled channels and the\nthree-flavor case are briefly discussed. \n\n"}
