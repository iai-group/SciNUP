Abstract: We consider the possibility that the dark matter, which is required to\nexplain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the\ngalactic center, could be in the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate. To study\nthe condensate we use the non-relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By\nintroducing the Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the\ndynamics of the system in terms of the continuity equation and of the\nhydrodynamic Euler equations. Hence dark matter can be described as a\nnon-relativistic, Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational condensate gas, whose\ndensity and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. In the case\nof a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic\nwith index $n=1$. To test the validity of the model we fit the Newtonian\ntangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of rotation curves of\nlow surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, respectively. We find a very good\nagreement between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data\nfor the low surface brightness galaxies. The deflection of photons passing\nthrough the dark matter halos is also analyzed, and the bending angle of light\nis computed.

Its implementation amounts to treating\nWeyl invariance as a fundamental symmetry of all physical theories. In this\nthesis, we study the consequences of this \"unit invariance\" principle and find\nthat it is a unifying one. Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge\nfield called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to\npoint. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and\nmatter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations.\nAs a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to\nchanges of scale. This response is calibrated by certain \"tractor Weyl\nweights\". Reality of these weights yield Breitenlohner-Freedman stability\nbounds in anti de Sitter spaces.

One\nspecific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the\ncurvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In\nthis work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show\nthat certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant\nimprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton\ntrajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without\ninterrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses\napproaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasise that turning is defined with\nrespect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether\nthis is canonical or non-trivial. The imprints generically take the form of\ndamped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum.

Of course this\napproach can only be applied whenever there is a newtonian limit, and the\nlatter is related to the GR solution that is generalized by a given ST solution\nunder consideration. This procedure thus assumes two hypothesis: On the one\nhand, that there should be a weak field limit of the GR solution; On the other\nhand that the latter corresponds to the limit case of given ST solution.

In this paper, we extend the ghost dark energy model to the\nuniverse with spatial curvature in the presence of interaction between dark\nmatter and dark energy. We study cosmological implications of this model in\ndetail. In the absence of interaction the equation of state parameter of ghost\ndark energy is always $w_D > -1 $ and mimics a cosmological constant in the\nlate time, while it is possible to have $w_D < -1 $ provided the interaction is\ntaken into account. When $k = 0$, all previous results of ghost dark energy in\nflat universe are recovered.

They should be the final result of an irreversible gravitational\ncollapse of very massive bodies. However, an unsolved problem concerning such\nobjects is the presence of a space-time singularity in their core. Such a\nproblem was present starting by the first historical papers concerning black\nholes. It is a common opinion that this problem could be solved when a correct\nquantum gravity theory will be, finally, constructed. In this work we review a\nway to remove black hole singularities at a classical level i.e. without\narguments of quantum gravity. By using a particular non-linear electrodynamics\nLagrangian, an exact solution of Einstein field equations is shown.

In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these\nobjects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if\nthe observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes. I then\ncompare the bounds inferred from the twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations observed in three micro-quasars (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and\nGRS 1915+105) with the measurements from the continuum-fitting method of the\nsame objects.

Quantum tunneling then modifies the initial state away\nfrom the original Euclidean vacuum. While most of the previous study on\nmodifications of the initial quantum state introduces, by hand, an initial time\nat which the quantum state is modified as well as the form of the modification,\nan effective initial time naturally emerges and the form is fixed by quantum\ntunneling in open inflation models.

First we shall\nidentify several natural dimensionless figures of merit, and thereby compare\nthe mean time between emission of successive Hawking quanta to several distinct\nbut quite natural timescales that can be associated with the emitted quanta,\ndemonstrating that very large ratios are typical for emission of massless\nquanta from a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore these ratios are\nindependent of the mass of the black hole as it slowly evolves. We shall then\nshow that the situation for the more general Reissner-Nordstrom and generic\n\"dirty'' black holes is even worse, at least as long as the surrounding matter\nsatisfies some suitable energy conditions. The situation for the Kerr and\nKerr--Newman black holes (or even for charged particle emission from a\nReissner--Nordstrom black hole) is considerably trickier, and depends on a\ncareful accounting of the super-radiant modes. Overall, the Hawking quanta are\nseen to be dribbling out of the black hole one at a time, in an extremely slow\ncascade of 2-body decays. Among other things, this implies that the Hawking\nflux is subject to \"shot noise''. Observationally, the Planck spectrum of the\nHawking flux can only be determined by collecting and integrating data over a\nvery long timescale. We conclude by connecting these points back to various\nkinematic aspects of the Hawking evaporation process. \n\n"}

Instead, gauge invariant quantities generally become\ndiscontinuous, thus not admitting Poisson-algebraic structures and posing\nserious challenges to a quantization. Non-integrability also renders the\nparadigm of relational dynamics cumbersome, thereby straining common\ninterpretations of the dynamics. We illustrate these conceptual and technical\nchallenges with simple toy models. In particular, we exhibit reparametrization\ninvariant models which fail to be integrable and, as a consequence, can either\nnot be quantized with standard methods or lead to sick quantum theories without\na semiclassical limit. These troubles are qualitatively distinct from\nsemiclassical subtleties in unconstrained quantum chaos and can be directly\ntraced back to the scarcity of Dirac observables. As a possible resolution, we\npropose to change the method of quantization by refining the configuration\nspace topology until the generalized observables become continuous in the new\ntopology and can acquire a quantum representation. This leads to the polymer\nquantization method underlying loop quantum cosmology and gravity.

We assumed both the dark\nmatter field and the Higgs doublet to be nonminimally coupled to gravity. Using\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime we derived an effective action for the\ninflationary period and analyzed its consequences. In this approach, after\nintegrating out both dark matter and Standard Model sectors we obtained the\neffective action expressed purely in terms of the gravitational field. We paid\nspecial attention to determination, by explicit calculations, of the form of\ncoefficients controlling the higher-order in curvature gravitational terms.\nTheir connection to the Standard Model coupling constants has been discussed. \n\n"}

In this set-up, the\nLifshitz symmetry manifests itself as an isometry in the bulk and our universe\nis a four-dimensional brane moving in such six-dimensional bulk. After finding\nthe correspondence between the bulk and the brane dynamical Lifshitz exponents,\nwe find the intriguing result that the preferred value of the dynamical\nLifshitz exponent of our observed universe, at both linear and non-linear\nscales, corresponds to a fixed point of the RGE flow of the dynamical Lifshitz\nexponent in the dual system where the symmetry is enhanced to the Schrodinger\ngroup containing a non-relativistic conformal symmetry.

This study was\nperformed in a flat spacetime background, and it is important to extend the\nanalysis to curved spacetime since these are Planckian-physics effects.

In the Unruh state for the\nevaporating black holes, the free-fall energy density is found to be negative\ndivergent at the horizon, which is in contrast to the conventional calculations\nperformed in the Kruskal coordinates. We resolve this conflict by invoking that\nthe Kruskcal coordinates could be no longer proper coordinates at the horizon.\nIn the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, despite the negative finite proper energy\ndensity at the horizon, the Tolman temperature is divergent there due to the\ninfinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. However, a consistent\nStefan-Boltzmann law with the Hawking radiation shows that the effective Tolman\ntemperature is eventually finite everywhere and the equivalence principle is\nsurprisingly restored at the horizon. Then, we also show that the firewall\nnecessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum, so that the Tolman temperature in\nthe evaporating black hole is naturally divergent due to the infinitely\nblueshifted negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon, whereas the outgoing\nHawking radiation characterized by the effective Tolman temperature indeed\noriginates from the quantum atmosphere, not just at the horizon. So, the\nfirewall and the atmosphere for the Hawking radiation turn out to be\ncompatible, once we discard the fact that the Hawking radiation in the Unruh\nstate originates from the infinitely blueshifted outgoing excitations at the\nhorizon. Finally, as a cosmological application, the initial radiation energy\ndensity in warm inflation scenarios has been assumed to be finite when\ninflation starts. We successfully find the origin of the non-vanishing initial\nradiation energy density in the warm inflation by using the effective Tolman\ntemperature. \n\n"}

Describing the system by the coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE), we use the machinery of Floquet theory to\nperform a linear stability analysis, calculating the wavenumber associated with\nthe first instability band for a variety of experimental parameters. However,\nwe demonstrate that, by tuning the frequency of the time-varying coupling, it\nmay be possible to push the first instability band outside the validity of the\nGPE, where dissipative effects are expected to damp any instabilities. This\nprovides a viable range of experimental parameters to perform analog\nexperiments of false vacuum decay. \n\n"}

This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system,\nas well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of\ncurvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations\nconstrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the\ninteraction strengths.

The first GW memory effect\ndiscovered was a lasting change in the GW strain. It can occur when GWs or\nmassless fields carry away 4-momentum from an isolated source. Subsequently, it\nwas shown that fluxes of intrinsic angular momentum can generate a new type of\nmemory effect called the spin memory, which is an enduring change in a portion\nof the time integral of the GW strain. In this paper, we note that there is\nanother new type of memory effect. We call it the center-of-mass (CM) memory\neffect, because it is related to changes in the CM part of the angular momentum\nof a spacetime. We first examine a few properties of the CM angular momentum.\nSpecifically, we describe how it transforms under the supertranslation symmetry\ntransformations of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, and we compute a new\nexpression for the flux of CM angular momentum carried by GWs in terms of a set\nof radiative multipole moments of the GW strain. We then turn to the CM memory\neffect. The CM memory effect appears in a quantity which has units of the time\nintegral of the GW strain. We define the effect in asymptotically flat\nspacetimes that start in a stationary state, radiate, and settle to a different\nstationary state. We show that it is invariant under infinitesimal\nsupertranslation symmetries in this context. To determine the magnitude of the\nflux of CM angular momentum and the CM memory effect, we compute these\nquantities for nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries in the\npost-Newtonian approximation.

For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with\nphysically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the\norbital eccentricity.

A construction of these quantities has\nrecently been given by Brunetti, Fredenhagen, and Kohler, and by Brunetti and\nFredenhagen, but they did not impose any ``locality'' or ``covariance''\ncondition in their constructions.

While there is general agreement that this observation\ntests the gravitomagnetic properties of the gravitational field, a controversy\nhas emerged over the question of whether the results depend on the speed of\nlight, $c$, or the speed of gravity, $c_g$.

In this\npaper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal\nstructure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum\ntheory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical\ntheory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of\nquantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We\napply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to\nquantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular\nregion of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is\na second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above\nthe first level physical compression for the component regions. Each\napplication of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a\nmatrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical\ntheory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of\nphysical compression. This third level of physical compression gives rise to a\nnew mathematical object which we call the causaloid. From the causaloid for a\nparticular physical theory we can calculate verything the physical theory can\ncalculate. This approach allows us to set up a framework for calculating\nprobabilistic correlations in data without imposing a fixed causal structure\n(such as a background time). We show how to put quantum theory in this\nframework (thus providing a new formulation of this theory). We indicate how\ngeneral relativity might be put into this framework and how the framework might\nbe used to construct a theory of quantum gravity. \n\n"}

Abstract: It has been argued that a black hole horizon can support the long range\nfields of a Nielsen-Olesen string, and that one can think of such a vortex as\nblack hole ``hair''. In this paper, we examine the properties of an Abelian\nHiggs vortex in the presence of a charged black hole as we allow the hole to\napproach extremality. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we show\nthat the magnetic field lines (as well as the scalar field) of the vortex are\ncompletely expelled from the black hole in the extreme limit. This was to be\nexpected, since extreme black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are known to\nexhibit such a ``Meissner effect'' in general. This would seem to imply that a\nvortex does not want to be attached to an extreme black hole. We calculate the\ntotal energy of the vortex fields in the presence of an extreme black hole.\nWhen the hole is small relative to the size of the vortex, it is energetically\nfavoured for the hole to remain inside the vortex region, contrary to the\nintuition that the hole should be expelled. However, as we allow the extreme\nhorizon radius to become very large compared to the radius of the vortex, we do\nfind evidence of an instability. This proves that it is energetically\nunfavourable for a thin vortex to interact with a large extreme black hole.\nThis would seem to dispel the notion that a black hole can support `long'\nabelian Higgs hair in the extreme limit.

The principle aim of this paper is to investigate the validity\nof this approximation which is not specific to gravity. To this end, for\nreasons of simplicity and clarity, we shall compare the descriptions of thermal\nprocesses induced by constant acceleration (i.e. the Unruh effect) in four\ndynamical frameworks. In this problem, the position of the ``heavy''\naccelerated system plays the role of gravity. In the first framework, the\ntrajectory is treated at the BFA: it is given from the outset and unaffected by\nradiative processes. In the second one, recoil effects induced by these\nemission processes are taken into account by describing the system's position\nby WKB wave functions. In the third one, the accelerated system is described by\nsecond quantized fields and in the fourth one, gravity is turned on. It is most\ninteresting to see when and why transitions amplitudes evaluated in different\nframeworks but describing the same process do agree. It is indeed this\ncomparison that determines the validity of the BFA. It is also interesting to\nnotice that the abandonment of the BFA delivers new physical insights\nconcerning the processes.

Because of that, the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for coincident\nbrane nucleation may not exist, unless there is some short range interaction\nwhich keeps the branes together. If the CdL instanton exists, we find that the\ndegeneracy factor depends only mildly on the ambient de Sitter temperature, and\ndoes not switch off even in the case of tunneling from flat space. This would\nresult in catastrophic decay of the present vacuum. If, on the contrary, the\nCdL instanton does not exist, coindident brane nucleation may still proceed\nthrough a \"static\" instanton, representing pair creation of critical bubbles --\na process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space. In that case,\nthe branes may stick together due to thermal symmetry restoration, and the pair\ncreation rate depends exponentially on the ambient de Sitter temperature,\nswitching off sharply as the temperature approaches zero. Such static instanton\nmay be well suited for the \"saltatory\" relaxation scenario proposed by Feng et\nal. \n\n"}

It expresses the condition of local realism in the form of a {\\it\nnoncommutative spectral theorem}. Applications of this relation to the security\nof quantum key distribution in quantum cryptography are considered. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0203030", "contents": "Title: Towards Quantum Information Theory in Space and Time Abstract: Modern quantum information theory deals with an idealized situation when the\nspacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the\ntransmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in\nspacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,\nchannel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space\nand time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)\nthe basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a\nnotion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group\nlabeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin. We\nemphasize an importance of consideration of quantum information theory from the\npoint of view of quantum field theory. We point out and discuss a fundamental\nfact that in quantum field theory there is a statistical dependence between two\nregions in spacetime even if they are spacelike separated. A classical\nprobabilistic representation for a family of correlation functions in quantum\nfield theory is obtained. Entangled states in space and time are considered. It\nis shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory becomes\ndisentangled (factorizable) at large spacelike distances if one makes local\nobservations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed\nwithout inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if\nthe distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further\nexperimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence\nof the correlation functions on the distance between detectors. \n\n"}

For a\npair of spin 1/2 particles, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bell entangled states and\ntheir behaviour under the Lorentz group are analysed in the context of quantum\nfield theory. Group theoretical considerations suggest a convenient definition\nof the Bell states which is slightly different from the conventional\nassignment. The behaviour of Bell states under arbitrary Lorentz\ntransformations can then be described succinctly. Reduced density matrices\napplicable to identical particles are defined through Yang's prescription. The\nvon Neumann entropy of each of the reduced density matrix is Lorentz invariant;\nand its relevance as a measure of entanglement is discussed, and illustrated\nwith an explicit example. A regularization of the entropy in terms of\ngeneralized zeta functions is also suggested. \n\n"}

We show that a large number of\nstates in relativistic quantum field theory, including the vacuum state and\nthermal equilibrium states, are distillable over subsystems separated by\narbitrary spacelike distances. These results apply to any quantum field model.\nIt will also be shown that these results can be generalized to quantum fields\nin curved spacetime, leading to the conclusion that there is a large number of\nquantum field states which are distillable over subsystems separated by an\nevent horizon. \n\n"}

We consider a solution to this\nproblem based on the spectral decomposition of the particle's (Heisenberg)\nstate into the eigenstates of a suitable operator, which we denote as the\n``time-of-arrival'' operator. We discuss the general properties of this\noperator. We construct the operator explicitly in the simple case of a free\nnonrelativistic particle, and compare the probabilities it yields with the ones\nestimated indirectly in terms of the flux of the Schr\\\"odinger current. We\nderive a well defined uncertainty relation between time-of-arrival and energy;\nthis result shows that the well known arguments against the existence of such a\nrelation can be circumvented. Finally, we define a ``time-representation'' of\nthe quantum mechanics of a free particle, in which the time-of-arrival is\ndiagonal. Our results suggest that, contrary to what is commonly assumed,\nquantum mechanics exhibits a hidden equivalence between independent (time) and\ndependent (position) variables, analogous to the one revealed by the\nparametrized formalism in classical mechanics. \n\n"}
