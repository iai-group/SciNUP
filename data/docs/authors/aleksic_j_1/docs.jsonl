Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

Consequently, different\ncosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. On the\nother hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actual\nmass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. In this paper we establish the link between\ngalaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosity\nfunction (CLF). We constrain the CLF parameters using the galaxy luminosity\nfunction and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies.\nThe resulting CLF models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.\nFor a cosmology with $(\\Omega_{\\rm m},\\sigma_8)=(0.238,0.734)$, the model\naccurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the SDSS.

We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These\nparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates\nconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of\ngravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical\nprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an\nexample, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary\ncoalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular\ninspiral. The parametrized post-Einsteinian framework should allow matched\nfiltered data to select a specific set of post-Einsteinian parameters without a\npriori assuming the validity of the former, thus either verifying general\nrelativity or pointing to possible dynamical strong-field deviations. \n\n"}

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN. AGN jets of this magnitude must be almost perfectly\nidentically bipolar. The relativistic momentum of a single jet would cause a\ncentral AGN black hole of mass 10^9 M_{sun} to recoil at ~6000 km s^{-1},\nexceeding kick velocities during black hole mergers, and be ejected from the\ncluster-center galaxy. When the cavity inflation is complete, 4PV\nunderestimates the total energy received by the cluster gas. Deviations of the\ncluster gas from hydrostatic equilibrium are most pronounced during the early\ncavity evolution when the integrated cluster mass found from the observed gas\npressure gradient can have systematic errors near the cavities of ~10-30%.

Many proposals have been put forth to\nexplain these data, usually relying on a single particle to annihilate or decay\nto produce e+e-. In this paper, we consider models with multiple species of\nWIMPs with significantly different masses. We show if such dark matter\ncandidates chi_i annihilate into light bosons, they naturally produce equal\nannihilation rates, even as the available numbers of pairs for annihilation\nn_chi_i^2 differ by orders of magnitude. We argue that a consequence of these\nmodels can be to add additional signal naturally at lower (~100 GeV) versus\nhigher (~ TeV) energies, changing the expected spectrum and even adding bumps\nat lower energies, which may alleviate some of the tension in the required\nannihilation rates between PAMELA and Fermi.

We find that these electrons remain confined to the\nshock front, as long as the upstream magnetic field is >~ 10 micro-Gauss, and\ndon't suffer substantial radiative losses, the only condition required is that\nthe external reverse shock emission be not too bright: peak flux less than 1 Jy\nin order to produce photons of 100 MeV, and less than ~100 mJy for producing\n1-GeV photons.

Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to\npower their AGN by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN\npower and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a\ngiven AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the\nfraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN,\nboth vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in\nBCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus\nby the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot\natmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGN, unless their black holes\nare more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. We identify several\npowerful AGN that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating an\nunusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their AGN are powered by another\nmechanism.

We model the energy spectrum throughout the\noutburst using a generic Comptonization model assuming that part of the input\nsoft radiation in the form of a black body spectrum gets reprocessed in the\nComptonizing medium. We follow the evolution of fractional root-mean-square\n(RMS) variability in the RXTE/PCA energy band with the source spectral state\nand conclude that broad band variability is strongly correlated with the source\nhardness (or Comptonized fraction). We follow changes in the energy\ndistribution of rms variability during the low-hard state and the state\ntransition and find further evidence that variable emission is strongly\nconcentrated in the power-law spectral component. We discuss the implication of\nour results to the Comptonization regimes during different spectral states.\nCorrelations of spectral and variability properties provide measurements of the\nBH mass and distance to the source. The spectral-timing correlation scaling\ntechnique applied to the RXTE observation during the hard-to-soft state\ntransition indicates a mass of the BH in XTE J1752-223 between 8 and 11 solar\nmasses and a distance to the source about 3.5 kiloparsec. \n\n"}

We conduct 2-D hydrodynamic simulations\nto study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the natural\nproducts of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by the\nthermal and ram pressures of the ICM. We find that the temperature of a\nsimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,\nconsistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas\ntemperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically\nrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a\nresult, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram\npressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the\ncoronae. The density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,\nif present, and hence the formation of stars. The increase also enhances\nradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black\nholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in\nclusters than in the field. The radiation enhancement is consistent with a\nsubstantially higher surface brightness of the X-ray emission detected from\ncoronae in cluster environment.

In the test-mass limit,\nwell-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.\nIn the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in\na post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO\ncondition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)\nbinaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected\nproperties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass\nlimit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the\nSchwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational\nself-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to\nspinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr\nISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are\ncurrently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is\nalso calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly\nreproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a\nfully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the\nstability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of\n\"resummation\") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr\nspacetime.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius.

We show that the nature\nof this reported offset may be explained by a recently proposed\nanti-correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the metallicity of\nstar forming galaxies. If low metallicity galaxies produce more stars than\ntheir equally massive, high-metallicity counterparts, then transient events\nthat closely trace the SFR in a galaxy would be more likely to be found in\nthese low metallicity, low mass galaxies. Therefore, the offset between the GRB\nand SDSS defined M-Z relations may be the result of the different methods used\nto select their respective galaxy populations, with GRBs being biased towards\nlow metallicity, high SFR, galaxies. We predict that such an offset should not\nbe expected of transient events that do not closely follow the star formation\nhistory of their host galaxies, such as short duration GRBs and SN Ia, but\nshould be evident in core collapse SNe found through upcoming untargeted\nsurveys. \n\n"}

It was in outburst for about a month from September 13,\n2009. The broad-band average spectrum is well described by thermal\nComptonization with an electron temperature of kT_e ~ 25 keV, soft seed photons\nof kT_bb ~ 0.6 keV, and Thomson optical depth \\tau_T ~ 2 in a slab geometry.\nDuring the outburst the spectrum stays remarkably stable with plasma and soft\nseed photon temperatures and scattering optical depth being constant within\nerrors. We fitted the outburst profile with the exponential model, and using\nthe disk instability model we inferred the outer disk radius to be (4.8 - 5.4)\n\\times 1010 cm. The INTEGRAL and RXTE data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a\nperiod of 4.08 milliseconds up to ~ 120 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown to\ndecrease from ~22% at 3 keV to a constant pulsed fraction of ~17-18% between\n7-30 keV, and then to decrease again down to ~13% at 60 keV.

For generating so-called surrogate maps a shuffling scheme is\napplied to the Fourier phases of the original data, which allows to test for\nthe presence of higher order correlations (HOCs) on well-defined scales. Using\nscaling indices as test statistics we find highly significant signatures for\nnon-Gaussianities when considering all scales. We test for NGs in the bands l =\n[2,20], l = [20,60], l = [60,120] and l = [120,300]. We find highly significant\nsignatures for non-Gaussianities and ecliptic hemispherical asymmetries for l =\n[2, 20]. We also obtain highly significant deviations from Gaussianity for the\nband l = [120,300]. The result for the full l-range can be interpreted as a\nsuperposition of the signatures found in the bands l = [2, 20] and l = [120,\n300].

Abstract: Observations with the Swift satellite of X-ray afterglows of more than a\nhundred gamma ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshift reveal ubiquitous soft\nX-ray absorption. The directly measured optical depth \\tau at a given observed\nenergy is found to be constant on average at redshift z > 2, i.e., <\\tau (0.5\nkeV) >_{z > 2} = 0.40+/- 0.02. Such an asymptotic optical depth is expected if\nthe foreground diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) dominates the absorption\neffect, and if the metallicity of the diffuse IGM reaches ~ 0.2 - 0.4 solar at\nz = 0. To further test the IGM absorption hypothesis, we analyze the 12 highest\nS/N (> 5000 photon) z > 2 quasar spectra from the XMM-Newton archive, which are\nall extremely radio loud (RLQs). The quasar optical depths are found to be\nconsistent with the mean GRB value. The four lowest-z quasars (2 < z < 2.5),\nhowever, do not show significant absorption. The best X-ray spectra of\nradio-quiet quasars (RQQs) at z > 2 provide only upper limits to the\nabsorption, which are still consistent with the RLQs, albeit with much lower\nS/N (< 1000 photons at z ~ 4). Lack of quasar absorption poses a challenge to\nthe smooth IGM interpretation, and could allude to the opacity being rather due\nto the jets in RLQs and GRBs. However, the jet absorbing column would need to\nappear in RLQs only at z > 2.5, and in GRBs to strongly increase with z in\norder to produce the observed tendency to a constant mean \\tau. High X-ray\nspectral resolution can differentiate between an absorber intrinsic to the\nsource that produces discernible spectral lines, and the diffuse IGM that\nproduces significant absorption, but no discrete features. \n\n"}

Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between\nstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a\nnovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong\nconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation (SHMR) from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass\nscales as Mh M*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with\nredshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh/M*, varies from low\nto high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh/M*~27 at M*=4.5x10^10 Msun and\nMh=1.2x10^12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation\nbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the\ncentral galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this\nminimum in terms of the \"pivot stellar mass\", M*piv, the \"pivot halo mass\",\nMhpiv, and the \"pivot ratio\", (Mh/M*)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a\nsingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for\nboth Mhpiv and M*piv.

We\nthen review, from a first-principles perspective, the physical processes at\nplay in accretion disks.

However, lacking a local GRBs\nsample, calibrating the scaling relations proposed as an equivalent to the\nPhillips law to standardize GRBs is not an easy task because of the need to\nestimate the GRBs luminosity distance in a model independent way.

We run the simulation\nuntil the Be disk is fully developed and starts to repeat a regular tidal\ninteraction with the pulsar. Then, we turn on the pulsar wind and the Be wind.\nWe run two simulations with different wind mass-loss rates for the Be star, one\nfor a B2V type and the other for a significantly earlier spectral type.\nAlthough the global shape of the interaction surface between the pulsar wind\nand the Be wind agrees with the analytical solution, the effect of the pulsar\nwind on the Be disk is profound.

The inflationary model\nrelies on renormalizable superpotetial terms and does not lead to\noverproduction of magnetic monopoles. It is largely independent of the one-loop\nradiative corrections and can become consistent with the current observational\ndata on the inflationary observables, with the symmetry breaking scale of G_PS\nassuming its SUSY value.

When\nsufficient gas is driven towards the BH, gravitational instabilities\ngenerically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. The lopsided\nstellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuel\nrapid BH growth. Here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'\ninvoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has\ncharacteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the\ntorus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are\nsubstantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the\nvertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and\nwarps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly\nattributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:\nmisalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and\nturbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN\nluminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations\nof gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities\nin AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent. We argue that it is not\npossible to reproduce these observations and the observed column density (N_H)\ndistribution without a clumpy gas distribution, but allowing for clumping on\nsmall scales the predicted N_H distribution is in good agreement with\nobservations from 10^20-27 cm^-2. We examine how N_H scales with galaxy and AGN\nproperties, and find that AGN feedback may be necessary to explain some trends\nwith luminosity and/or redshift.

We used multi-wavelength\nfollow-up observations obtained with GROND and the XRT onboard the Swift\nsatellite. The resulting afterglow light curve is of excellent accuracy, and\nthe spectral energy distribution is well-sampled over 5 decades in energy.\nThese data present one of the most comprehensive observing campaigns for a\nsingle GRB afterglow and allow us to test several proposed emission models and\noutflow characteristics in unprecedented detail. Both the multi-color light\ncurve and the broad-band SED of the afterglow of GRB 091127 show evidence of a\ncooling break moving from high to lower energies. The early light curve is well\ndescribed by a broken power-law, where the initial decay in the optical/NIR\nwavelength range is considerably flatter than at X-rays. Detailed fitting of\nthe time-resolved SED shows that the break is very smooth with a sharpness\nindex of 2.2 +- 0.2, and evolves towards lower frequencies as a power-law with\nindex -1.23 +- 0.06. These are the first accurate and contemporaneous\nmeasurements of both the sharpness of the spectral break and its time\nevolution. The measured evolution of the cooling break (nu_c propto t^-1.2) is\nnot consistent with the predictions of the standard model, wherein nu_c propto\nt^-0.5 is expected.

A\nlarge effort is therefore undertaken to compile global galaxy cluster\nproperties in particular obtained through X-ray observations and to study their\nscaling relations. However, the scaling schemes used in the literature differ.\nThe present paper aims to clarify this situation by providing a thorough review\nof the scaling laws within the standard model of large-scale structure growth\nand to discus various steps of practical approximations. We derive the scaling\nlaws for X-ray observables and cluster mass within the pure gravitational\nstructure growth scenario. Using N-body simulations we test the recent\nformation approximation used in earlier analytic approaches which involves a\nredshift dependent overdensity parameter.We find this approximation less\nprecise than the use of a fiducial radius based on a fixed overdensity with\nrespect to critical density. Inspired by the comparison of the predicted\nscaling relations with observations we propose a first order modification of\nthe scaling scheme to include the observed effects of hydrodynamics in\nstructure formation. This modification involves a cluster mass dependent gas\nmass fraction. We also discuss the observational results of the reshift\nevolution of the most important scaling relations and find that also a redshift\ndependence of the gas mass to total mass relation has to be invoked within our\nmodification scheme.

In the low L_X limit, gas accretes in a stable,\nspherically symmetric fashion. In the high L_X limit, the inner gas is\nsignificantly heated up and expands, reducing the central mass inflow rate. The\nexpanding gas can turn into a strong enough outflow capable of expelling most\nof the gas at larger radii. For some intermediate L_X, the accretion flow\nbecomes unstable developing prominent non-spherical features, the key reason\nfor which is thermal instability (TI) as shown by our analyses. Small\nperturbations of the initially spherically symmetric accretion flow that is\nheated by the intermediate L_X quickly grow to form cold and dense clumps\nsurrounded by overheated low density regions. The cold clumps continue their\ninward motion forming filamentary structures; while the hot infalling gas slows\ndown because of buoyancy and can even start outflowing through the channels in\nbetween the filaments.

In\nthis paper we discuss various ways of using these high resolution data to\nconstrain velocity power spectrum in galaxy clusters.

The\neffective length $l_{\\rm eff}$ along the line of sight, which provides dominant\ncontribution to the line flux, increases with R, allowing one to probe the\namplitude of the velocity variations at different spatial scales. In\nparticular, we show that the width of the line as a function of R is closely\nlinked to the structure function of the 3D velocity field. Yet another easily\nobtainable proxy of the velocity field length scales is the ratio of the\namplitude of the projected velocity field (line energy) variations to the\ndispersion of the velocity along the line of sight (line width). Finally the\nprojected velocity field can be easily converted into 3D velocity field,\nespecially for clusters like Coma with an extended flat core in the surface\nbrightness. Under assumption of a homogeneous isotropic Gaussian 3D velocity\nfield we derived simple expressions relating the power spectrum of the 3D\nvelocity field (or structure function) and the observables. The uncertainties\nin the observables, caused by stochastic nature of the velocity field, are\nestimated by making multiple realizations of the random Gaussian velocity field\nand evaluating the scatter in observables. If large scale motions are present\nin the ICM these uncertainties may dominate the statistical errors of line\nwidth and shift measurements. \n\n"}

Using a sample with a broad range in orientation\nangle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power\nsources (L_kin > 10^45.5 erg s^{-1}) show a significant increase in the ratio\nof inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing\norientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the\ndistribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming\nexpectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self\nCompton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L_kin < 10^43.5 erg s^{-1}),\nno trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with\nSSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat\nspectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields. Coupled with the\nevidence that jet power is linked to the jet speed (Kharb et al. 2010), this\nfinding suggests that external photon fields become the dominant source of seed\nphotons in the jet comoving frame only for the faster and therefore more\npowerful jets. \n\n"}

Recent searches for annihilation products of DM annihilation have just\nreached the sensitivity to exclude this canonical cross section for 100%\nbranching ratio to certain final states and small WIMP masses. The ultimate\ngoal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass\nand, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass.\nProbing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a\nlight WIMP in direct and indirect searches.

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace.

If General Relativity is the true theory, these\nobservatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4\nkm, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds. \n\n"}

Radio relics, located mostly in the outskirts of\nclusters, seem to associate with shock waves, especially those developed during\nmergers.

The star formation rate (SFR) for the GRB 021211 host of ~825\nMo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a GRB host, places it in the category\nof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We found that at least 63% of GRB hosts\nhave SFR < 100 Mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have SFR > 500 Mo yr^-1. For the\nundetected hosts the mean radio flux (<35 uJy 3sigma) corresponds to an average\nSFR < 15 Mo yr^-1.

Fermi data on the diffuse gamma-ray background (DGB)\nshows a possible unexplained feature at very high energies (VHE), which we have\ncalled the \"VHE Excess\" relative to expectations for an attenuated power law\nextrapolated from lower energies.

This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter\nclustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy\nclustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on\nlarge-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7).

An alternative is\nto ascribe the radiation around the spectral peak to a thermalization process\noccurring well inside the Thomson photosphere. This quasi-thermal spectrum can\nevolve into the observed non-thermal shape by additional energy release at\nmoderate to small Thomson optical depths, which can readily give rise to the\nhard spectral tail. The position of the spectral peak is determined by the\ntemperature and Lorentz factor of the flow in the termalization zone, where the\ntotal number of photons carried by the jet is established.

A 15M_{sun} progenitor\nmodel is employed. We incorporate nuclear network calculations with a\nconsistent equation of state in the simulations to account for the energy\nrelease by nuclear reactions and their feedback to hydrodynamics. Varying the\nshock-relaunch time rather arbitrarily, we investigate the ensuing long-term\nevolutions systematically, paying particular attention to the explosion energy\nand nucleosynthetic yields as a function of this relaunch time, or equivalently\nthe accretion rate at shock revival. We study in detail how the diagnostic\nexplosion energy approaches the asymptotic value and which physical processes\ncontribute to the explosion energy in what proportions as well as their\ndependence on the relaunch time and the dimension of dynamics.

Abstract: The lightcurve of the explosion of a star with a radius <10-100Rsun is\npowered mostly by radioactive decay. Observationally such events are dominated\nby hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae: white\ndwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia) and core collapses of\nhydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ibc). Transient surveys are finding SNe I\nin increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be\nstudied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize\nthe physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observations\ncan be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered\nlightcurves probe the shallowest 56Ni deposits. If the amount of 56Ni mixing\ncan be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties of\nthe explosive burning. In practice we find it is difficult to disentangle\nwhether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56Ni heating near the\nsurface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56Ni heating is deeper.\nIn the latter case there is a \"dark phase\" between the moment of explosion and\nthe first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56Ni. Because of this,\nsimply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56Ni back in time is not a reliable\nmethod for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly\nidentify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout or\nshock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the rising\nlightcurve is known. Since this is typically not available, we identify other\ndiagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion\noccurred. As an example we apply these arguments to the SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We\ndemonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and\ntemperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,\nand 56Ni mixing. \n\n"}

The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is\n13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc.\nInflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian\nrandom phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from\nunity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s =\n0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k =\n-0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a\nreduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the\nstandard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model\nincluding tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a\nfactor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB\npredictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume\neven further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit,\nthe inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted\nin WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology. \n\n"}

Blazars are powerful active galactic nuclei (AGNs) radiating\nprominently in the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from the radio to the X-ray\nand gamma-ray bands. Their emission is dominated by synchrotron and\ninverse-Compton radiation from a relativistic jet originating from an accreting\ncentral supermassive black hole. The object IGR J12319-0749 has recently been\nidentified as a soft gamma-ray source with the IBIS instrument of the INTEGRAL\nsatellite, coincident with a quasar at high redshift (z=3.12). Aims. We studied\nthe radio structure of IGR J12319-0749 to strengthen its blazar identification\nby detecting a compact radio jet on the milli-arcsecond (mas) angular scale,\nand to measure its astrometric position accurate to mas level. Methods. We used\nthe technique of electronic very long baseline interferometry (e-VLBI) to image\nIGR J12319-0749 with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 5 GHz on 2012 June 19.\nResults. IGR J12319-0749 (J1231-0747) is a compact radio source, practically\nunresolved on interferometric baselines up to ~136 million wavelengths. The\nestimated brightness temperature (at least ~2 x 10^12 K) indicates that the\nradio emission of its jet is Doppler-boosted.

During the super-soft emission phase, a coherent\n7.1 hr modulation was found in the soft X-ray, UV, optical and near-IR data,\nvarying in phase across all wavebands.

Here we\nshall present a comprehensive picture of quasinormal modes, late-time tails and\nstability of a massive charged scalar field around Kerr-Newman black holes for\nany physically meaningful values of the parameters. We shall show that despite\npresence of the two mechanisms of superradiance (owing to black hole's rotation\nand charge) and the massive term creating growing bound states, there is no\nindication of instability under quasinormal modes' boundary conditions.

{"id": "1307.2890", "contents": "Title: The stability of tidally deformed neutron stars to three- and four-mode\n  coupling Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the tidal deformation of a neutron star\nexcites daughter p- and g-modes to large amplitudes via a quasi-static\ninstability. This would remove energy from the tidal bulge, resulting in\ndissipation and possibly affecting the phase evolution of inspiralling binary\nneutron stars and hence the extraction of binary parameters from gravitational\nwave observations. This instability appears to arise because of a large\nthree-mode interaction among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes of\nsimilar radial wavenumber. We show that additional four-mode interactions enter\ninto the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previously\nconsidered. We compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preserving\ncoordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star to\nthat of a radially perturbed spherical star. Using this method, we relate the\nfour-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exact\ncancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactions\nand the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. We then show that the\nequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and\ng-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static\napproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may\nslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at\nleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. We conclude that the\np-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does not\nimpact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. \n\n"}

Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai\nresonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,\ntypically another BH, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary\neccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision N-body simulations of the\nlong term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions\nthat lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an\nobservable source of GW radiation. We find that the secular orbit average\ntreatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamics\nof these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined\norbit at a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai\ncycle the torque due to the outer BH can drive the binary to extremely large\neccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. This occurs before\nrelativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW\nsignal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities. We show\nthat ~50 % of coalescing BH binaries driven by the Kozai mechanism in GCs will\nhave eccentricities larger than 0.1, with 10 % of them being extremely\neccentric, (1-e)<~10^-5, when they first chirp in the frequency band of ground\nbased laser interferometers. This implies that a large fraction of such GW\nsources could be missed if conventional quasi-circular templates are used for\nanalysis of GW detectors data. The efficient detection of all coalescing BH\nbinaries in GCs will therefore require template banks of eccentric inspiral\nwaveforms for matched-filtering and dedicated search strategies. \n\n"}

The Chandra data reveal\na long (>40 kpc) and narrow tail with a nearly constant width (~3 kpc) to the\nsoutheast of the galaxy, and a leading edge ~1.5 kpc from the galaxy center on\nthe upstream side of the tail. The tail is most likely caused by the nearly\nedge-on stripping of ESO 137-002's ISM by ram pressure, compared to the nearly\nface-on stripping of ESO 137-001 discussed in our previous work. Spectral\nanalysis of individual regions along the tail shows that the gas throughout it\nhas a rather constant temperature, ~1 keV, very close to the temperature of the\ntails of ESO 137-001, if the same atomic database is used. The derived gas\nabundance is low (~0.2 solar with the single-kT model), an indication of the\nmultiphase nature of the gas in the tail. The mass of the X-ray tail is only a\nsmall fraction (<5%) of the initial ISM mass of the galaxy, suggesting that the\nstripping is most likely at an early stage. However, with any of the single-kT,\ndouble-kT and multi-kT models we tried, the tail is always \"over-pressured\"\nrelative to the surrounding ICM, which could be due to the uncertainties in the\nabundance, thermal vs. non-thermal X-ray emission, or magnetic support in the\nICM.

In order to\nestimate the reheat temperature, there are two important conditions one needs\nto satisfy: (a) the decay products of the inflaton must dominate the energy\ndensity of the universe, i.e. the universe becomes completely radiation\ndominated, and (b) the decay products of the inflaton have attained local\nthermodynamical equilibrium. For some choices of parameters, the latter is a\nmore stringent condition, such that the decay products may thermalise much\nafter the beginning of radiation-domination. Consequently, we have obtained\nthat the reheat temperature can be much lower than the standard-lore\nestimation.

We find that the value of the bias on large scales is\nreasonably well reproduced by the Tinker fitting formula once the linear cold\ndark matter power spectrum is used, instead of the total matter power spectrum.\nWe investigate whether scale-dependent bias really comes from purely neutrino's\neffect or from nonlinear gravitational collapse of haloes.

We calculated the Balmer line emission and the shape of the broad\nBalmer line for parameter values suitable for SNR RCW 86 (G315.4-2.3) as a\nfunction of the cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and of the level of\nthermal equilibration between electrons and protons behind the shock.

We then discuss the current\nobservational state of the field, with constraints from the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SN),\ndirect measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), and measurements of galaxy\nand matter clustering. Assuming a flat universe and dark energy with a constant\nequation-of-state parameter $w = P/\\rho$, the combination of Planck CMB\ntemperature anisotropies, WMAP CMB polarization, the Union2.1 SN compilation,\nand a compilation of BAO measurements yields $w = -1.10^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$,\nconsistent with a cosmological constant ($w=-1$). However, with these\nconstraints the cosmological constant model predicts a value of $H_0$ that is\nlower than several of the leading recent estimates, and it predicts a parameter\ncombination $\\sigma_8(\\Omega_m)^{0.5}$ that is higher than many estimates from\nweak gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, and redshift-space distortions.\nIndividually these tensions are only significant at the ~$2\\sigma$ level, but\nthey arise in multiple data sets with independent statistics and distinct\nsources of systematic uncertainty.

This is applied to CFHTLenS, a 154 square degree\nimaging survey with a median redshift of 0.7 and an effective number density of\n11 galaxies per square arcminute usable for weak lensing. To account for survey\nmasks we apply a 3D pseudo-Cl approach on weak lensing data, and to avoid\nuncertainties in the highly non-linear regime, we separately analyse radial\nwave numbers k<=1.5h/Mpc and k<=5.0h/Mpc, and angular wavenumbers l~400-5000.\nWe show how one can recover 2D and tomographic power spectra from the full 3D\ncosmic shear power spectra and present a measurement of the 2D cosmic shear\npower spectrum, and measurements of a set of 2-bin and 6-bin cosmic shear\ntomographic power spectra; in doing so we find that using the 3D power in the\ncalculation of such 2D and tomographic power spectra from data naturally\naccounts for a minimum scale in the matter power spectrum.

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic\nsolutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux\nthrough the star increases with decreasing rotation period. The observational\ndata can be matched if we assume the emissions to go as the power 3-4 of $f_m$.\nAssuming that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism saturates with increasing\nrotation, we can provide an explanation for the observed saturation of emission\nat low Rossby numbers.

A maximum in the DCF suggests the presence of a time lag\nbetween the curves, whose value and uncertainty are estimated through a\nGaussian fitting of the DCF profile and light curve simulation via a Monte\nCarlo approach. The cross-correlation of the observed LAT and GBM light curves\nyields time lags that are mostly similar to those reported in the literature,\nbut they are formally consistent with zero.

In this work, we\ntest this issue by exploring hard X-ray spectral evolution in four black-hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs) with multiple, quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray\nobservations. Firstly, we find that hard X-ray photon indices, $\\Gamma$, are\nanti- and positively correlated to X-ray fluxes when the X-ray flux, $F_{\\rm\n3-9keV}$, is below and above a critical flux, $F_{\\rm X,crit}$, which are\nconsistent with prediction of advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and\ndisk-corona model respectively. Secondly and most importantly, we find that the\nradio-X-ray correlations are also clearly different when the X-ray fluxes are\nhigher and lower than the critical flux that defined by X-ray spectral\nevolution.

Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$.

For a case with a small guide field (20 % of the\nmagnitude of the reconnecting component) the curvature drift is the dominant\nsource of electron heating. However, for a larger guide field (equal to the\nmagnitude of the reconnecting component) electron acceleration by the curvature\ndrift is comparable to that of the parallel electric field.

Heating by the\ncurvature-drift dominates in the outflow exhausts where bent field lines expand\nto relax their tension and is therefore distributed over a large area.

In addition to more distant\npulsars (thus probing a larger volume of the Galaxy), or ones in high\nbackground regions (thus improving the sampling uniformity across the Galactic\nplane), we detect pulsars with broader pulses or lower luminosity. Adding\npulsars to our catalog with inclination angles that are rare in the observed\nsample, and/or with lower spindown power, will reduce the bias in the currently\nknown gamma-ray pulsar population.

Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger.

The resulting abundances are very\nsimilar to each other and reproduce the general features of the observed\nr-process abundance (the second and third peaks, the rare-earth peak and the\nlead peak) for all mass models as they are mainly determined by the fission\nyields. We find distinct differences in the abundance yields at and just above\nthe third peak, which can be traced back to different predictions of neutron\nseparation energies for r-process nuclei around neutron number $N=130$. The\nremaining trajectories, which contribute 10% by mass to the total integrated\nabundances, follow such a fast expansion that the r process does not use all\nthe neutrons. This also leads to a larger variation of abundances among\ntrajectories as fission does not dominate the r-process dynamics. The total\nintegrated abundances are dominated by contributions from the slow abundances\nand hence reproduce the general features of the observed r-process abundances.\nWe find that at timescales of weeks relevant for kilonova light curve\ncalculations, the abundance of actinides is larger than the one of lanthanides.\nHence actinides can be even more important than lanthanides to determine the\nphoton opacities under kilonova conditions.

The\nfirst comment by Boyarsky et al. confirms the absence of a line from M31 in the\n3-4 keV energy range, but criticizes the energy range for spectral fitting on\nthe basis that (i) the background model adopted between 3-4 keV is invalid\noutside that range and that (ii) extending the energy range multiple features\nappear, including a 3.5 keV line. Point (i) is manifestly irrelevant (the 3-4\nkeV background model was not meant to extend outside that range), while closer\ninspection of point (ii) shows that the detected features are inconsistent and\nlikely unphysical. We demonstrate that the existence of an excess near 3.5 keV\nin the M31 data requires fitting a broad enough energy range such that the\nbackground modeling near 3.5 keV is poor to a level that multiple spurious\nresidual features become significant.

While a technically correct\nremark, this is only a red herring: our predictions are based on line ratios,\nand not on absolute emissivities; line ratios, for atomic transitions with\nsimilar peak temperatures, are largely temperature-independent, thus the line\nratios we employed to draw our conclusions are substantially correct.

In this work, we use 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the\nonset of condensation in idealized galaxy-cluster cores. In particular, we look\nat how the condensation process depends on the ratio of cooling time to\nfreefall time and on the geometry of the gravitational potential. We conclude\nthat the ICM can always evolve to a state in which condensation occurs if given\nenough time, but that an initial timescale ratio tcool /tff < 10 is needed for\nthermal instability to grow quickly enough to affect realistic cluster cores\nwithin a timescale that is relevant for cosmological structure formation.

In our\nsimulations, the geometry of the gravitational potential does not have a strong\neffect on thermal stability.

In this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed from\nshear measurements in a 139 sq. deg area from the Dark Energy Survey (DES)\nScience Verification (SV) data. We compare the distribution of mass with that\nof the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. The overdensities in\nthe reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of optically\ndetected clusters. We demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids along\nthe line of sight can be identified, exploiting the tight scatter of the\ncluster photometric redshifts. We cross-correlate the mass map with a\nforeground magnitude-limited galaxy sample from the same data.

By stacking only short\nframe-time observations to limit pileup, and after subtracting the nuclear PSF,\nwe analysed the X-ray gas properties within the Bondi radius at 0.12-0.22 kpc\n(1.5-2.8 arcsec), depending on the black hole mass. Within 2 kpc radius, we\ndetect two significant temperature components, which are consistent with\nconstant values of 2 keV and 0.9 keV down to 0.15 kpc radius. No evidence was\nfound for the expected temperature increase within ~0.25 kpc due to the\ninfluence of the SMBH. Within the Bondi radius, the density profile is\nconsistent with $\\rho\\propto r^{-1}$. The lack of a temperature increase inside\nthe Bondi radius suggests that the hot gas structure is not dictated by the\nSMBH's potential and, together with the shallow density profile, shows that the\nclassical Bondi rate may not reflect the accretion rate onto the SMBH. If this\ndensity profile extends in towards the SMBH, the mass accretion rate onto the\nSMBH could be at least two orders of magnitude less than the Bondi rate, which\nagrees with Faraday rotation measurements for M87. We discuss the evidence for\noutflow from the hot gas and the cold gas disk and for cold feedback, where gas\ncooling rapidly from the hot atmosphere could feed the cirumnuclear disk and\nfuel the SMBH. At 0.2 kpc radius, the cooler X-ray temperature component\nrepresents ~20% of the total X-ray gas mass and, by losing angular momentum to\nthe hot gas component, could provide a fuel source of cold clouds within the\nBondi radius. \n\n"}

The difference between the ~410 Hz QPO\nfrequency and the spin frequency follows a similar frequency correlation as the\nlow frequency power spectral components, suggesting that the ~410 Hz QPO is a\nretrograde beat against the spin frequency of a rotational phenomenon in the 9\nHz range.

In this scenario there are however some open\nissues, like the difficulty to explain the observed flux at 8.8 GHz, the high\nvalue of the required annihilation cross section, and the lack of observed\nemission coming from the minor DM subhalo. We also find that part of the radio\nemission originated by DM annihilation could be associated with a slightly\nextended radio source present near the main DM subhalo.

In\nthis work, we show that these solutions can be unstable when the spin of the\nhigher-mass black hole is aligned with the orbital angular momentum and the\nspin of the lower-mass black hole is anti-aligned. Spins in these\nconfigurations are unstable to precession to large misalignment when the binary\nseparation $r$ is between the values $r_{\\rm ud\\pm}= (\\sqrt{\\chi_1} \\pm \\sqrt{q\n\\chi_2})^4 (1-q)^{-2} M$, where $M$ is the total mass, $q \\equiv m_2/m_1$ is\nthe mass ratio, and $\\chi_1$ ($\\chi_2$) is the dimensionless spin of the more\n(less) massive black hole. This instability exists for a wide range of spin\nmagnitudes and mass ratios and can occur in the strong-field regime near\nmerger.

By studying the details of the X-ray light curve, properties of carbon\ncombustion can be determined.

A suppression in\nthe flux of UHECRs at energies above 40 EeV -- as expected from both these\ninteractions -- has been established experimentally beyond any doubt by current\nexperiments. However, such an observation is still not conclusive on the origin\nof the suppression.

Dynamical capture mergers may take place in globular clusters, as\nwell as other dense stellar systems, where most neutron stars have large spins.\nWe find significant variability in the merger outcome as a function of initial\nneutron star spin. For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive\nneutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for\nantialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the\ncollapse to a black hole. We show that even moderate spins can significantly\nincrease the amount of ejected material, including the amount unbound with\nvelocities greater than half the speed of light, leading to brighter\nelectromagnetic signatures associated with kilonovae and interaction of the\nejecta with the interstellar medium. Furthermore, we find that the initial\nneutron star spin can strongly affect the already rich phenomenology in the\npostmerger gravitational wave signatures that arise from the oscillation modes\nof the hypermassive neutron star. In several of our simulations, the resulting\nhypermassive neutron star develops the one-arm ($m=1$) spiral instability, the\nmost pronounced cases being those with small but non-negligible neutron star\nspins.

Its prime scientific\ngoal is to measure the masses and radii of non-accreting neutron stars via fits\nto the energy-dependent waveforms produced by the rotation of hot spots on\ntheir surfaces.

We perform a shear peak statistics analysis of the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data, using weak gravitational lensing\nmeasurements from a 139 deg$^2$ field. We measure the abundance of peaks\nidentified in aperture mass maps, as a function of their signal-to-noise ratio,\nin the signal-to-noise range $0<\\mathcal S / \\mathcal N<4$. To predict the peak\ncounts as a function of cosmological parameters we use a suite of $N$-body\nsimulations spanning 158 models with varying $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$,\nfixing $w = -1$, $\\Omega_{\\rm b} = 0.04$, $h = 0.7$ and $n_s=1$, to which we\nhave applied the DES SV mask and redshift distribution.

Despite being observed for decades, the macroscopic\ntransport properties of the ICM are still not well-constrained. A path to\ndetermine macroscopic ICM properties opened up with the discovery of \"cold\nfronts\". These were observed as sharp discontinuities in surface brightness and\ntemperature in the ICM, with the property that the brighter (and denser) side\nof the discontinuity is the colder one. The high spatial resolution of the\nChandra X-ray Observatory revealed two puzzles about the cold fronts. First,\nthey should be subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites, yet in many cases they\nappear relatively smooth and undisturbed. Second, the width of the interface\nbetween the two gas phases is typically narrower than the mean free path of the\nparticles in the plasma, indicating negligible thermal conduction. From the\ntime of their discovery, it was realized that these special characteristics of\ncold fronts may be used to probe the physical properties of the cluster plasma.\nIn this review, we will discuss the recent simulations of cold front formation\nand evolution in galaxy clusters, with a focus on those which have attempted to\nuse these features to constrain the physics of the ICM.

Below the breaking energy, the Band function\nreduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple\npower law.

We derive PDFs of the galaxy and projected matter\ndensity distributions via the Counts in Cells (CiC) method.

We confirm that the galaxy\ndensity contrast distribution is well modeled by a lognormal PDF convolved with\nPoisson noise at angular scales from 10-40 arcmin (corresponding to physical\nscales of 3-10 Mpc). We note that as kappa_WL is a weighted sum of the mass\nfluctuations along the line of sight, its PDF is expected to be only\napproximately lognormal. We find that the kappa_WL distribution is well modeled\nby a lognormal PDF convolved with Gaussian shape noise at scales between 10 and\n20 arcmin, with a best-fit chi^2/DOF of 1.11 compared to 1.84 for a Gaussian\nmodel, corresponding to p-values 0.35 and 0.07 respectively, at a scale of 10\narcmin.

Cosmic voids\nare usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information\nabout the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an\nincreasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void\nstudies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position\nerrors of $\\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable. In\nthis paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys,\nvalidate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-$z$\nredMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV)\ndata. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding\nvoids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the\nline-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-$z$ scatter,\nthe number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic\nand photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20% for all transverse void sizes,\nand indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius $\\sim 70$ Mpc/$h$ and\nlarger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric\nvoids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the\nalgorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.8$, we identify 87\nvoids with comoving radii spanning the range 18-120 Mpc/$h$, and carry out a\nstacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of $4.4\\sigma$, the\nlensing measurement confirms the voids are truly underdense in the matter field\nand hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics\nin the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the\nviability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys. \n\n"}

We focus on three main classes of systematics: (i) experimental\nsystematic errors in the observed shear; (ii) signal contamination by intrinsic\nalignments; and (iii) systematic effects due to an incorrect modelling of\nnon-linear scales. First, we show that a comprehensive, multi-wavelength\nanalysis provides a self-calibration method for experimental systematic\neffects, only implying <50% increment on the errors on cosmological parameters.\nWe also illustrate how the cross-correlation between radio and optical/near-IR\nsurveys alone is able to remove residual systematics with variance as large as\n0.00001, i.e. the same order of magnitude of the cosmological signal.

For instance, the higher-redshift bins of radio\ncatalogues peak at z~0.8-1, whereas their optical/near-IR counterparts are\nlimited to z<0.5-0.7.

The effect of neutrals Abstract: Supernova remnants are believed to be the main sources of galactic Cosmic\nRays (CR). Within this framework, particles are accelerated at supernova\nremnant shocks and then released in the interstellar medium. The mechanism\nthrough which CRs are released and the way in which they propagate still remain\nopen issues. The main difficulty is the high non-linearity of the problem: CRs\nthemselves excite the magnetic turbulence that confines them close to their\nsources. We solve numerically the coupled differential equations describing the\nevolution in space and time of the escaping particles and of the waves\ngenerated through the CR streaming instability. The warm ionized and warm\nneutral phases of the interstellar medium are considered. These phases occupy\nthe largest fraction of the disc volume, where most supernovae explode, and are\ncharacterised by the significant presence of neutral particles. The friction\nbetween those neutrals and ions results in a very effective wave damping\nmechanism. It is found that streaming instability affects the propagation of\nCRs even in the presence of ion-neutral friction. The diffusion coefficient can\nbe suppressed by more than a factor of $\\sim 2$ over a region of few tens of pc\naround the remnant. The suppression increases for smaller distances.

Abstract: Successful phenomenological models of pulsar wind nebulae assume efficient\ndissipation of the Poynting flux of the magnetized electron-positron wind as\nwell as efficient acceleration of the pairs in the vicinity of the termination\nshock, but how this is realized is not yet well understood. The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would\nfurther preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to\nequipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high\nmagnetization to values of order unity. Furthermore, it is speculated that the\nturbulence generated by the corrugation pattern may sustain a relativistic\nFermi process, accelerating particles close to the radiation reaction limit, as\nobserved in the Crab nebula.

We used the type Ia\nsupernova luminosity distances to calibrate the correlation between the peak\nphoton energy, $E_{p, i}$, and the isotropic equivalent radiated energy, $\nE_{iso}$ in GRBs. With this correlation, we tested the reliability of applying\nGRBs to measure cosmological parameters and to obtain indications on the basic\nproperties and evolution of dark energy. Using 162 GRBs with measured redshifts\nand spectra, we applied a local regression technique to calibrate the $E_{p,\ni}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation against the type Ia SN data to build a calibrated GRB\nHubble diagram. We tested the possible redshift dependence of the correlation\nand its effect on the Hubble diagram. Finally, we used the GRB Hubble diagram\nto investigate the dark energy EOS. For this, we focused on the so-called\nChevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy EOS and\nimplemented the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to efficiently sample\nthe space of cosmological parameters. Our analysis shows once more that the\n$E_{p, i}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation has no significant redshift dependence.\nTherefore the high-redshift GRBs can be used as a cosmological tool to\ndetermine the basic cosmological parameters and to test different models of\ndark energy in the redshift region ($z\\geqslant 3$), which is unexplored by the\nSNIa and baryonic acoustic oscillations data.

We use long time span, high cadence, GRMHD+radiative\ntransfer models of Sgr A$^*$ to investigate the expected variability of closure\nphases in such observations. We find that, in general, closure phases along\nsmall baseline triangles show little variability, except in the cases when one\nof the triangle vertices crosses one of a small regions of low visibility\namplitude.

RCSED comprises integrated k-corrected photometry in up-to 11\nultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared bands published by the GALEX, SDSS, and\nUKIDSS wide-field imaging surveys; results of the stellar population fitting of\nSDSS spectra including best-fitting templates, velocity dispersions,\nparameterized star formation histories, and stellar metallicities computed for\ninstantaneous starburst and exponentially declining star formation models;\nparametric and non-parametric emission line fluxes and profiles; and gas phase\nmetallicities. We link RCSED to the Galaxy Zoo morphological classification and\ngalaxy bulge+disk decomposition results by Simard et al. We construct the\ncolor-magnitude, Faber-Jackson, mass-metallicity relations, compare them with\nthe literature and discuss systematic errors of galaxy properties presented in\nour catalog. RCSED is accessible from the project web-site and via VO simple\nspectrum access and table access services using VO compliant applications.

Macronovae are caused by the\nradioactivity from freshly synthesised heavy elements, e.g. from dynamic ejecta\nand various types of winds. We study macronova signatures by using\nmulti-dimensional radiative transfer calculations. We employ the radiative\ntransfer code SuperNu and state-of-the-art LTE opacities for a few\nrepresentative elements from the wind and dynamical ejecta (Cr, Pd, Se, Te, Br,\nZr, Sm, Ce, Nd, U) to calculate synthetic light curves and spectra for a range\nof ejecta morphologies. The radioactive power of the resulting macronova is\ncalculated with the detailed input of decay products. We assess the detection\nprospects for our most complex models, based on the portion of viewing angles\nthat are sufficiently bright, at different cosmological redshifts ($z$). The\nbrighter emission from the wind is unobscured by the lanthanides (or actinides)\nin some of the models, permitting non-zero detection probabilities for\nredshifts up to $z=0.07$. We also find the nuclear mass model and the resulting\nradioactive heating rate are crucial for the detectability. While for the most\npessimistic heating rate (from the FRDM model) no reasonable increase in the\nejecta mass or velocity, or wind mass or velocity, can possibly make the light\ncurves agree with the observed nIR excess after GRB130603B, a more optimistic\nheating rate (from the Duflo-Zuker model) leads to good agreement.

In this study, we search\nfor such directional variations in the shape of the energy spectrum using\nevents observed with the Telescope Array's surface detector. We divide the TA\nfield of view into two nearly equal-exposure regions: the \"on-source\" region\nwhich we define as $\\pm 30^\\circ$ of the supergalactic plane containing mostly\nnearby structures, and the complementary \"off-source\" region where the sources\nare further away on average. We compare the UHECR spectra in these regions by\nfitting them to the broken power law and comparing the resulting parameters.

This approach is based on the\nmultipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the global\nphysical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state),\nbut not to canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It\nleads to simple derivation of the CFS instability criterion for normal modes\nand the evolution equations for a star, affected by this instability. The\napproach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS\ninstability: it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission\nremoves angular momentum from the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation\nenergy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy, than the released amount\nof the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability in slowly\nrotating Newtonian stars. In resulting evolution equations emission of\ngravitational waves directly affects the spin frequency, being in line with the\narguments by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), but in contrast to widely accepted\nequations by Lindblom et al.

Our galaxy models exhibit a first burst of star\nformation that injects CRs at supernovae. Once CRs have sufficiently\naccumulated in our Milky-Way like galaxy, their buoyancy force overcomes the\nmagnetic tension of the toroidal disk field.

Our study\nresults in the following conclusions which are relevant for novae and other\nastrophysical systems: (1) Electrons are instantaneously energised to\nrelativistic velocities in the explosion alongside the heavier atoms and ions.\nNo post-ejection shock acceleration needs to be invoked. (2) Rotation of an\nincompressible spherical accreting object leads to a latitude-dependent\npotential such that the accretion rate is maximum at the poles and minimum at\nthe equator. This will form a prolate-shaped envelope. Energetic expulsion of\nthis envelope will result in a bipolar ejecta/outflow. Such outflows cannot be\nejected from non-rotating spherical objects. (3) The latitude-dependent\naccretion rates in a rotating accreting object will also lead to accumulation\nof the infalling matter outside the object in the non-polar regions thus\nforming an accretion disk. The angular momentum of the incoming matter plays no\nrole in the formation of an accretion disk. Accretion disks cannot form around\na non-rotating object. \n\n"}

The present\nwork aims to explore the adequacy of different gap-type (unscreened electric\nfield) models to account for the observed characteristics. Based on a\nphenomenological description of the gap potential, we estimate the maximum\nextractable gap power $L_{gap}$ for different magnetospheric set-ups, and study\nits dependence on the accretion state of the source. $L_{gap}$ is found to be\nin general proportional to the Blandford-Znajek jet power $L_{BZ}$ and a\nsensitive function of gap size $h$, i.e. $L_{gap} \\sim L_{BZ} (h/r_g)^{\\beta}$,\nwhere the power index $\\beta \\geq 1$ is dependent on the respective gap-setup.\nThe transparency of the black hole vicinity to VHE photons generally requires a\nradiatively inefficient accretion environment and thereby imposes constraints\non possible accretion rates, and correspondingly on $L_{BZ}$.

Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast\nto earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due\nto a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of\nthe event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is\nattempting to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved\nby adding more telescopes to the array, in particular at high sites in Africa.\nUltimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event Horizon Imager, could\nproduce much more detailed images of black holes. In combination with numerical\nsimulations and precise measurements of the orbits of stars - ideally also of\npulsars - these images will allow us to study black holes with unprecedented\nprecision. \n\n"}

Gravitational wave observations\nopened new possibilities for testing the viability of such theories in the\nstrong-field regime. One could test each theory against observed data one at a\ntime, though a more efficient approach would be to first probe gravity in a\ntheory-agnostic way and map such information to that on specific theories\nafterward. One example of such model-independent tests with gravitational waves\nis the parameterized post-Einsteinian formalism, where one introduces generic\nparameters in the amplitude and phase that capture non-Einsteinian effects. In\nthis paper, we derive gravitational waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries\nin various modified theories of gravity that violate at least one fundamental\npillar in general relativity. We achieve this by deriving relations between\ncorrections to the waveform amplitude/phase and those to the frequency\nevolution and Kepler's third law, since the latter two have already been (or\ncan easily be) derived in many theories. Such an analysis allows us to derive\ncorrections to the waveform amplitude, which extends many of previous works\nthat focused on phase corrections only. Moreover, we derive gravitational\nwaveforms in theories with varying gravitational constant. We extend the\nprevious work by introducing two gravitational constants (the conservative one\nentering in the binding energy and the dissipative one entering in the\ngravitational wave luminosity) and allowing masses of binary constituents to\nvary with time. We also correct some errors in previous literature. Our results\ncan be used to improve current analyses of testing general relativity as well\nas to achieve new projected constraints on many modified theories of gravity. \n\n"}

We probe that scenario by performing general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of differentially rotating massive stars\nsupported by thermal radiation pressure plus a gas pressure perturbation. The\nstars are initially threaded by a dynamically weak, poloidal magnetic field\nconfined to the stellar interior. We find that magnetic braking and turbulent\nviscous damping via magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability in\nthe bulk of the star redistribute angular momentum, damp differential rotation\nand induce the formation of a massive and nearly uniformly rotating inner core\nsurrounded by a Keplerian envelope.

Assuming Omega_tot=1, the equation of state parameter\nis constrained to w=-0.94+-0.09, indicating the potential for more ambitious\nfuture LRG measurements to provide precision tests of the nature of dark\nenergy. All these constraints are essentially independent of scales k>0.1h/Mpc\nand associated nonlinear complications, yet agree well with more aggressive\npublished analyses where nonlinear modeling is crucial. \n\n"}

We simulate the instrument\nresponse to the gamma-ray spectrum arising from the annihilation of common Dark\nMatter candidates, and derive full-sky sensitivity maps for the {\\it detection}\nof point sources and for the {\\it identification} of the Dark Matter (as\nopposed to astrophysical) origin of the gamma-ray emission. These maps\nrepresent a powerful tool to assess the detectability of point sources, i.e.\nsources with angular size smaller than the angular resolution of GLAST, ~ 0.1\ndegrees, in {\\it any} DM scenario. As an example, we apply the obtained results\nto the so-called 'mini-spikes' scenario, where the annihilation signal\noriginates from large Dark Matter overdensities around Intermediate Mass Black\nHoles. We find that if these objects exist in the Galaxy, not only GLAST should\nbe able to detect them over a timescale as short as 2 months, but in many cases\nit should be possible to determine with good accuracy the mass of the\nannihilating Dark Matter particles, while null searches would place stringent\nconstraints on this scenario. \n\n"}

We have measured the shapes of galaxies for the tell-tale distortions\ncaused by weak gravitational lensing, and traced the growth of that signal as a\nfunction of redshift. Using both 2D and 3D analyses, we measure cosmological\nparameters Omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, the\nnormalization of the matter power spectrum. The introduction of redshift\ninformation tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces the\nrelative sampling (or \"cosmic\") variance compared to recent surveys that may be\nlarger but are only two dimensional. From the 3D analysis, we find\nsigma_8*(Omega_m/0.3)^0.44=0.866+^0.085_-0.068 at 68% confidence limits,\nincluding both statistical and potential systematic sources of error in the\ntotal budget. Indeed, the absolute calibration of shear measurement methods is\nnow the dominant source of uncertainty. Assuming instead a baseline cosmology\nto fix the geometry of the universe, we have measured the growth of structure\non both linear and non-linear physical scales. Our results thus demonstrate a\nproof of concept for tomographic analysis techniques that have been proposed\nfor future weak lensing surveys by a dedicated wide-field telescope in space. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/9610120", "contents": "Title: Weak Lensing and Cosmology Abstract: We explore the dependence of weak lensing phenomena on the background\ncosmology. We first generalise the relation between $P_\\psi(\\omega)$, the\nangular power spectrum of the distortion, and the power spectrum of density\nfluctuations to non-flat cosmologies. We then compute $P_\\psi$ for various\nillustrative models. A useful cosmological discriminator is the growth of\n$P_\\psi$ with source redshift which is much stronger in low matter density\nmodels, and especially in $\\Lambda$-dominated models. With even crude redshift\ninformation (say from broad band colours) it should be possible to constrain\nthe cosmological world model. The amplitude of $P_\\psi(\\omega)$ is also quite\nsensitive to the cosmology, but requires a reliable external normalisation for\nthe mass fluctuations. If one normalises to galaxy clustering, with $M/L$ fixed\nby small-scale galaxy dynamics, then low density models predict a much stronger\ndistortion. If, however, one normalises to large-scale bulk-flows, the\npredicted distortion for sources at redshifts $Z_s \\sim 1-3$ is rather\ninsensitive to the background cosmology. The signals predicted here can be\ndetected at a very high level of significance with a photometric survey\ncovering say 10 square degrees, but sparse sampling is needed to avoid large\nsampling variance and we discuss the factors influencing the design of an\noptimum survey. Turning to weak lensing by clusters we find that for high lens\nredshifts ($Z_l\\simeq1$) the critical density is substantially reduced in\n$\\Lambda$ models, but that the ratio of the shear or convergence to the\nvelocity dispersions or X-ray temperature of clusters is only very weakly\ndependent on the cosmology. \n\n"}

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded\nset of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place\nconstraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the\ncosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the\ndynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia\nare, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density\n(Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve\nfitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor\neternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,\nOmega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0).\nWith no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the\nspectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma\nand 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and\n4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a\n``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection,\nOmega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior\n(Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require\nOmega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A\nUniverse closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7\nsigma to 8 sigma level.
