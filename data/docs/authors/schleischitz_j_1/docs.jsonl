It addresses global function fields with many\nrational points and, so far, most applications of this theory do not require\nadditional properties. Motivated by recent applications, we require global\nfunction fields with the additional property that their zero class divisor\ngroups contain at most a small number of $d$-torsion points.

Following an old suggestion of Clozel, recently realized by\nHarris-Lan-Taylor-Thorne for characteristic 0 cohomology classes, one realizes\nthe cohomology of the locally symmetric spaces for $\\GL_n$ as a boundary\ncontribution of the cohomology of symplectic or unitary Shimura varieties, so\nthat the key problem is to understand torsion in the cohomology of Shimura\nvarieties.\n  Thus, we prove new results on the $p$-adic geometry of Shimura varieties (of\nHodge type).

The Drinfeld-Lafforgue-Vinberg compactification is however\nalready singular for G=SL_2; questions about its singularities arise naturally\nin the geometric Langlands program, and form the topic of the present article.\n  Drinfeld's definition of the compactification for a general reductive group G\nrelies on the Vinberg semigroup of G, and will be given in [Sch]. In the\npresent paper we focus on the case G=SL_2. In this case the compactification\ncan alternatively be viewed as a canonical one-parameter degeneration of the\nmoduli space of SL_2-bundles. We study the singularities of this degeneration\nvia the weight-monodromy theory of its nearby cycles: We give an explicit\ndescription of the nearby cycles sheaf in terms of certain novel perverse\nsheaves which we call \"Picard-Lefschetz oscillators\" and which govern the\nsingularities of the degeneration. We then use this description to determine\nits intersection cohomology sheaf and other invariants of its singularities.\n  We also discuss the relationship of our results for G=SL_2 with the\nmiraculous duality of Drinfeld and Gaitsgory in the geometric Langlands\nprogram, as well as two applications of our results to the classical theory: To\nDrinfeld's and Wang's \"strange\" invariant bilinear form on the space of\nautomorphic forms; and to the categorification of the Bernstein asymptotics map\nstudied by Bezrukavnikov and Kazhdan as well as by Sakellaridis and Venkatesh. \n\n"}

We review a\nnumber of such cases from the literature, chiefly concerned either with\npositivity of coefficients or diagonal asymptotics. We then analyze coefficient\nasymptotics using ACSV (Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables) methods.\nWhile ACSV sometimes requires considerable overhead and geometric computation,\nin the case of symmetric multilinear rational functions there are some\nreductions that streamline the analysis. Our results include diagonal\nasymptotics across entire classes of functions, for example the general\n3-variable case and the Gillis-Reznick-Zeilberger (GRZ) case, where the\ndenominator in terms of elementary symmetric functions is $1 - e_1 + c e_d$ in\nany number $d$ of variables. The ACSV analysis also explains a discontinuous\ndrop in exponential growth rate for the GRZ class at the parameter value $c =\n(d-1)^{d-1}$, previously observed for $d=4$ only by separately computing\ndiagonal recurrences for critical and noncritical values of $c$. \n\n"}

We consider the cyclic homology of the\ncokernel (in the abelian category of cyclic modules) of the ``restriction map''\ndefined by the inclusion of the ideles class group of a global field in the\nnoncommutative adeles class space. Weil's explicit formula can then be\nformulated as a Lefschetz trace formula for the induced action of the ideles\nclass group on this cohomology. In this formulation the Riemann hypothesis\nbecomes equivalent to the positivity of the relevant trace pairing. This result\nsuggests a possible dictionary between the steps in the Weil proof and\ncorresponding notions involving the noncommutative geometry of the adeles class\nspace, with good working notions of correspondences, degree and codegree etc.\nIn particular, we construct an analog for number fields of the algebraic points\nof the curve for function fields, realized here as classical points (low\ntemperature KMS states) of quantum statistical mechanical systems naturally\nassociated to the periodic orbits of the action of the ideles class group, that\nis, to the noncommutative spaces on which the geometric side of the trace\nformula is supported. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/9808074", "contents": "Title: Stable maps and Hurwitz schemes in mixed characteristic Abstract: In this short note, we propose a definition of complete Hurwitz schemes (and\nstacks) in mixed characteristic. We follow an idea of R. Pandharipande, and\ndefine the complete Hurwitz stack as a substack of stable maps of degree d of\nnodal pointed curves of genus g to the universal curve over the moduli stack of\nstable pointed curves of genus h. This substack is simply the closure of the\nlocus of Hurwitz covers in characteristic 0.\n  We describe in detail the reduction modulo 2 of the complete Hurwitz stack of\ngenus 1 double covers of the projective line. The result is wilder than you\nwould imagine in your wildest dreams.\n  We end by speculating about a possible relationship with the work of\nAbramovich-Vistoli about stable maps into Deligne-Mumford stacks. \n\n"}

This gives a uniform version, in the spirit of a\nresult of Caporaso-Harris-Mazur, of an unconditional theorem of Faltings. We\nutilize recent results of Alexeev and Nakamura on complete moduli for\nquasi-abelian varieties. We expect that a thorough understanding of current\nwork of Alexeev should give a more general result for abelian varieties of an\narbitrary dimension with a polarizing divisor of an arbitrary degree - a\nproposed approach for such a generalization is given at the end of the paper. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/9901051", "contents": "Title: Scattering on the p-adic field and a trace formula Abstract: I apply the set-up of Lax-Phillips Scattering Theory to a non-archimedean\nlocal field. It is possible to choose the outgoing space and the incoming space\nto be Fourier transforms of each other. Key elements of the Lax-Phillips theory\nare seen to make sense and to have the expected interrelations: the scattering\nmatrix S, the projection K to the interacting space, the contraction semi-group\nZ and the time delay operator T. The scattering matrix is causal, its analytic\ncontinuation has the expected poles and zeros, and its phase derivative is the\n(non-negative) spectral function of T, which is also the restriction to the\ndiagonal of the kernel of K. The contraction semi-group Z is related to S (and\nT) through a trace formula. Introducing an odd-even grading on the interacting\nspace allows to express the Weil local explicit formula in terms of a\n``supertrace''. I also apply my methods to the evaluation of a trace considered\nby Connes. \n\n"}
