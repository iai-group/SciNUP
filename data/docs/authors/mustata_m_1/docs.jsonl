Despite hundreds of papers on the subject, the Kowalevski\nintegration is still understood as a magic recipe, an unbelievable sequence of\nskilful tricks, unexpected identities and smart changes of variables. The\nnovelty of our present approach is based on our four observations. The first\none is that the so-called fundamental Kowalevski equation is an instance of a\npencil equation of the theory of conics which leads us to a new geometric\ninterpretation of the Kowalevski variables $w, x_1, x_2$ as the pencil\nparameter and the Darboux coordinates, respectively.

In\nF-theory, gauge symmetries with abelian gauge factors are modeled by singular\nelliptic fibrations with additional rational sections, i.e. a non-trivial\nMordell-Weil rank. To determine the full scope of possible low energy theories\nwith abelian gauge factors, which allow for an F-theory realization, it is\ncentral to obtain a comprehensive list of all singular elliptic fibrations with\nextra sections. We answer this question for the case of one abelian factor by\napplying Tate's algorithm to the elliptic fiber realized as a quartic in the\nweighted projective space P^{(1,1,2)}, which guarantees, in addition to the\nzero section, the existence of an additional rational section. The algorithm\ngives rise to a tree-like enhancement structure, where each fiber is\ncharacterized by a Kodaira fiber type, that governs the non-abelian gauge\nfactor, and the separation of the two sections. We determine Tate-like forms\nfor elliptic fibrations with one extra section for all Kodaira fiber types. In\naddition to standard Tate forms that are determined by the vanishing order of\nthe coefficient sections in the quartic (so-called canonical models),the\nalgorithm also gives rise to fibrations that require non-trivial relations\namong the coefficient sections.

Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}. However\nthese procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary\ndifferential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a\nsystematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the\nalgebraic community. \n\n"}

The theory of CSM classes has been\nextended to the equivariant setting by Ohmoto. We prove that for an arbitrary\ncomplex projective manifold $X$, the homogenized, torus equivariant CSM class\nof a constructible function $\\varphi$ is the restriction of the characteristic\ncycle of $\\varphi$ via the zero section of the cotangent bundle of $X$. This\nextends to the equivariant setting results of Ginzburg and Sabbah. We\nspecialize $X$ to be a (generalized) flag manifold $G/B$. In this case CSM\nclasses are determined by a Demazure-Lusztig (DL) operator. We prove a `Hecke\northogonality' of CSM classes, determined by the DL operator and its\nPoincar{\\'e} adjoint. We further use the theory of holonomic\n$\\mathcal{D}_X$-modules to show that the characteristic cycle of a Verma\nmodule, restricted to the zero section, gives the CSM class of the\ncorresponding Schubert cell.

We quantize the Ng\\^o action, providing a universal integration for\nall quantum Hamiltonian systems coming from the center Z=Z(Ug) of the\nenveloping algebra. Namely we extend Kostant's Whittaker description of Z to\nthe action of a commutative quantum groupoid Wh, the bi-Whittaker Hamiltonian\nreduction of $D_G$, which also integrates all quantum Hamiltonian systems\ncoming from the action of Z. These actions come from a braided tensor functor,\nthe quantum Ng\\^o map, from the W-category (modules for Wh) to\nadjoint-equivariant D-modules on G, giving a categorical family of G-invariant\ncommuting operators on any strong G-category.

Until recently, it has been hopeless to find\nexplicit solutions to such systems, and mathematics has instead developed deep\nand powerful theories about the solutions to polynomial equations. Enumerative\nGeometry is concerned with counting the number of solutions when the\npolynomials come from a geometric situation and Intersection Theory gives\nmethods to accomplish the enumeration.\n  We use Macaulay 2 to investigate some problems from enumerative geometry,\nillustrating some applications of symbolic computation to this important\nproblem of solving systems of polynomial equations.

For example, the multiplicity of an ideal is used\nto count points of intersection of two analytic sets at points of\nnon-transverse intersection. A problem with the multiplicity of an ideal or\nmodule is that it is only defined for modules and ideals of finite colength.\n  In this paper we use pairs of modules and their multiplicities as a way\naround this difficulty. A key tool is the multiplicity-polar theorem which\napplies to families of pairs of modules, linking the multiplicity at a general\npair of the family to the multiplicity of the pair at the special fiber.\n  The specific problem we work on is:\n  Suppose X,0 is an equidimensional complex analytic set in C^n, and T^*_X(C^n)\nis the closure of the conormal vectors to the smooth part of X, s, a section of\nT^*(C^n), the cotangent bundle of C^n restricted to X.

One of our main results\nis an explicit description of the relationship between these parametrizations.\nOur approach to the above problems is based on a remarkable observation by G.\nLusztig that combinatorics of the canonical basis is closely related to\ngeometry of the totally positive varieties. We formulate this relationship in\nterms of two mutually inverse transformations: \"tropicalization\" and \"geometric\nlifting.\" \n\n"}

As an example the highest weight representation of the\nq-deformed algebra $sl_q(2,\\Cb)$ is calculated in detail. \n\n"}
