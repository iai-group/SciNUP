It is not obvious why these inconspicuous\nAbell-clusters should be the first to be seen in gamma-rays, but a possible\nreason is that all of them show direct evidence of recent or ongoing mergers.\nTheir identification with the EGRET gamma-ray sources is also supported by the\nclose correlation between their radio and (purported) gamma-ray fluxes. Under\nfavorable conditions (including a proton spectral index of 2.5 in the case of\nAbell 85, and sim 2.3 for Coma, and Abell 1758 and 1914), we expect ICECUBE to\nmake as many as 0.3 neutrino detections per year from the Coma cluster of\ngalaxies, and as many as a few per year from the Abell clusters 85, 1758, and\n1914. Also, Auger may detect as many as 2 events per decade at ~ EeV energies\nfrom these gamma-ray bright clusters. \n\n"}

The\ntime-dependent, \"plus\" and \"cross\" polarizations are expanded in Bessel\nfunctions, which are then self-consistently re-expanded in a power series about\nzero initial eccentricity to eighth order. The stationary phase approximation\nis then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the Fourier\ntransform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. We exemplify this\nframework by considering Newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in the\npost-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase and\namplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the Fourier domain\nwaveform. Such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiral\nmass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at the\ntime when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band.

We perform many\ndirect $N$-body simulations with various initial conditions and two different\nchoices of IMFs. One is a standard Kroupa IMF without any mass segregation. The\nother is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted. We\nargue that if Arches was created with a mass segregated IMF similar to what is\nobserved today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass star\nshould be created. However, whether a collisional runaway leads to the\nformation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) depends strongly on the\nmass loss rate via winds from massive stars. Growth of stellar mass through\ncollisions can be quenched by strong wind mass loss. In that case, the\ninter-cluster as well as intra-cluster medium are expected to have a\nsignificant Helium enrichment which may be observed via Helium recombination\nlines. The excess amount of gas lost in winds may also be observed via X-ray\nobservations as diffused X-ray sources. \n\n"}

Abstract: We study the effects of externally imposed turbulence on the thermal\nproperties of galaxy cluster cores, using three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations including magnetic fields, anisotropic thermal conduction, and\nradiative cooling. The imposed \"stirring\" crudely approximates the effects of\ngalactic wakes, waves generated by galaxies moving through the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), and/or turbulence produced by a central active galactic nucleus.\nThe simulated clusters exhibit a strong bimodality. Modest levels of\nturbulence, ~100 km/s (~10% of the sound speed), suppress the heat-flux-driven\nbuoyancy instability (HBI), resulting in an isotropically tangled magnetic\nfield and a quasi-stable, high entropy, thermal equilibrium with no cooling\ncatastrophe. Thermal conduction dominates the heating of the cluster core, but\nturbulent mixing is critical because it suppresses the HBI and (to a lesser\nextent) the thermal instability.

Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from\na single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars\nwith very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving\nnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral\ntype.

The radiative transfer\nformulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday\nrotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps\nwere generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and\nradiative properties of the evolving jets. Intensity light curves were computed\nvia integrating spatially over the emission maps. We apply the models to jets\nin active galactic nuclei (AGN). From the jet simulations and the\ntime-dependent emission calculations we derived empirical relations for the\nemission intensity and size for jets at various evolutionary stages. The\ntemporal properties of jet emission are not solely consequences of intrinsic\nvariations in the hydrodynamics and thermal properties of the jet.

Though the latter value fits well the\nMain Sequence around solar metallicity, and agrees with independent\nmeasurements from HII regions as well as with theoretical stellar yields and\nchemical evolution models, a much higher DY/DZ~10 is necessary to reproduce the\nbroadening observed for nearby subdwarfs.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc.

After reconstructing the post-CE evolution and based on fits\nto stellar evolution calculations as well as a parametrized energy equation for\nCE evolution that incorporates realistic approximations of the binding energy\nparameter lambda, we determine the possible evolutionary histories of the\nobserved PCEBs. We also reconstruct CE evolution replacing the classical energy\nequation with a scaled angular momentum equation and compare the results\nobtained with both algorithms. We find that all PCEBs in our sample can be\nreconstructed with the energy equation if the internal energy of the envelope\nis included. Although most individual systems have solutions for a broad range\nof values for alpha, only for alpha=0.2-0.3 do we find simultaneous solutions\nfor all PCEBs in our sample.

However, recent neutron scattering data has shown\nthat the pnictides have a relatively large spin wave dispersion in the\ndirection perpendicular to the planes. This indicates that the third dimension\nis very important. Motivated by this observation we study the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_c$\nmodel that is the three dimensional generalization of the $J_1$-$J_2$\nHeisenberg model for $S = 1/2$ and S = 1. Using self-consistent spin wave\ntheory we present a detailed description of the staggered magnetization and\nmagnetic excitations in the collinear state.

Aims: To study the effects of cosmic ray ion (H, He, CNO and\nFe-Co-Ni) and electron bombardment of PAHs in galactic and extragalactic\nenvironments. Methods: We calculate the nuclear and electronic interactions for\ncollisions between PAHs and cosmic ray ions and electrons with energies between\n5 MeV/nucleon and 10 GeV, above the threshold for carbon atom loss, in normal\ngalaxies, starburst galaxies and cooling flow galaxy clusters. Results: The\ntimescale for PAH destruction by cosmic ray ions depends on the electronic\nexcitation energy Eo and on the amount of energy available for dissociation.\nSmall PAHs are destroyed faster, with He and the CNO group being the more\neffective projectiles. For electron collisions, the lifetime is independent of\nthe PAH size and varies with the threshold energy To. Conclusions: Cosmic rays\nprocess the PAHs in diffuse clouds, where the destruction due to interstellar\nshocks is less efficient.

Discovery of a low mass\n  companion to the hot subluminous planetary nebula central star EGB\\,5 - A\n  recently ejected common envelope? Abstract: Hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) in close binary systems are assumed to be formed\nvia common envelope ejection. According to theoretical models, the amount of\nenergy and angular momentum deposited in the common envelope scales with the\nmass of the companion. That low mass companions near or below the core\nhydrogen-burning limit are able to trigger the ejection of this envelope is\nwell known. The currently known systems have very short periods\n$\\simeq0.1-0.3\\,{\\rm d}$. Here we report the discovery of a low mass companion\n($M_{\\rm 2}>0.14\\,M_{\\rm \\odot}$) orbiting the sdB star and central star of a\nplanetary nebula EGB\\,5 with an orbital period of $16.5\\,{\\rm d}$ at a minimum\nseparation of $23\\,R_{\\rm \\odot}$. Its long period is only just consistent with\nthe energy balance prescription of the common envelope. The marked difference\nbetween the short and long period systems will provide strong constraints on\nthe common envelope phase, in particular if the masses of the sdB stars can be\nmeasured accurately. Due to selection effects, the fraction of sdBs with low\nmass companions and similar or longer periods may be quite high. Low mass\nstellar and substellar companions may therefore play a significant role for the\nstill unclear formation of hot subdwarf stars. Furthermore, the nebula around\nEGB\\,5 may be the remnant of the ejected common envelope making this binary a\nunique system to study this short und poorly understood phase of binary\nevolution. \n\n"}

All classes of Seyfert galaxies show on average the same nuclear\ncontinuum, as foreseen by the zeroth order unified model, with a cut-off energy\nof Ec>200keV, and a photon index of Gamma ~1.8. Compton-thin Seyfert 2's show a\nreflection component stronger than Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 1.5's.

Previous theoretical\npredictions of the ferromagnetic phase transition have been based on the\nperturbation theory, which treats the gas parameter as a small number. On the\nother hand, Belitz, Kirkpatrick, and Vojta (BKV) have argued that the phase\ntransition in clean itinerant ferromagnets is generically of first order at low\ntemperatures, due to the correlation effects that lead to a nonanalytic term in\nthe free energy. The second-order perturbation theory predicts a first-order\nphase transition at $(k_{\\rm F}a)_c=1.054$, consistent with the BKV argument.\nHowever, since the critical gas parameter is expected to be of order O(1),\nperturbative predictions may be unreliable. In this paper we study the\nnonperturbative effects on the ferromagnetic phase transition by summing the\nparticle-particle ladder diagrams to all orders in the gas parameter. We\nconsider a universal repulsive Fermi gas where the effective range effects can\nbe neglected, which can be realized in a two-component Fermi gas of $^6$Li\natoms by using a nonadiabatic field switch to the upper branch of a Feshbach\nresonance with a positive s-wave scattering length.

Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis.

In particular, the\nturbulent structure depends on the resistivity profile only through the\ncritical heights and is insensitive to the details of the resistivity profile.\nWe discover scaling relations between the amplitudes of various turbulent\nquantities (velocity dispersion, density fluctuation, vertical diffusion\ncoefficient, and outflow mass flux) and vertically integrated accretion\nstresses. We also obtain empirical formulae for the integrated accretion\nstresses as a function of the vertical magnetic flux and the critical heights.\nThese empirical relations allow to predict the vertical turbulent structure of\na protoplanetary disk for a given strength of the magnetic flux and a given\nresistivity profile. \n\n"}

The hypothesis we\nexploit is that large over-abundances of carbon are common among metal-poor\nstars. The selection was made by considering two line indices in the 4300A\nregion, applied directly to the low-resolution prism spectra. This work also\nextends a previously published method by adding bright sources to the sample.\nThe spectra of these stars suffer from saturation effects, compromising the\nindex calculations and leading to an undersampling of the brighter candidates.\nVisual inspection and classification of the spectra from the HES plates yielded\na list of 5,288 new metal-poor candidates, which are presently being used as\ntargets for medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up. Estimates of the stellar\natmospheric parameters, as well as carbon abundances, are now available for 117\nof the first candidates, based on follow-up medium-resolution spectra obtained\nwith the SOAR 4.1m and Gemini 8m telescopes.

We focus on binaries whose total mass exceeds\nthe maximum mass (Mmax) a cold, degenerate EOS can support against\ngravitational collapse. The time and length scales span many orders of\nmagnitude, making fully general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) simulations\ncomputationally prohibitive. For this reason, we model the WD as a\n\"pseudo-white dwarf\" (pWD) as in our binary WDNS head-on collisions study\n[PRD83:064002,2011]. Our GRHD simulations of a pWDNS system with a\n0.98-solar-mass WD and a 1.4-solar-mass NS show that the merger remnant is a\nspinning Thorne-Zytkow-like Object (TZlO) surrounded by a massive disk.

Given that the final total mass\nexceeds Mmax, magnetic fields and/or viscosity may redistribute angular\nmomentum and ultimately lead to delayed collapse to a BH.

The disk is proposed to\nhave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its\nenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal\ndebris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed\ncloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the\nexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters\nmay be as high as $\\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by\nthe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular\nmomentum from the star.

A fraction of these are\nlikely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of\nstellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular\nevolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with\nhighly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly\naffected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at\nthe highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission\nbecomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and\ncoalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than\nsimilar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of\nSMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of\nbinaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries\nwould be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation\nof GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging\nbinaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still\nvery eccentric (e>~0.5). The efficient gravitational wave analysis for such\nsystems would therefore require the use of eccentric templates. We also find\nthat binaries very close to the MBH could evolve through a complex dynamical\n(non-secular) evolution leading to emission of several GW pulses during only a\nfew yrs (though these are likely to be rare). Finally, we note that the\nformation of close stellar binaries, X-ray binaries and their merger products\ncould be induced by similar secular processes, combined with tidal friction\nrather than GW emission as in the case of compact object binaries. \n\n"}

The central star of IC 4663 (PN G346.2-08.2) is\ndominated by broad He II and N V emission lines which correspond to a [WN3]\nspectral type. Unlike previous [WN] candidates, the surrounding nebula is\nunambiguously a PN.

The nebula is typical of PNe with an elliptical morphology,\na newly discovered Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) halo, a relatively low\nexpansion velocity (v_exp=30 km/s) and a highly ionised spectrum with an\napproximately Solar chemical abundance pattern. The [WN3] star is hot enough to\nshow Ne VII emission (T_*=140+/-20 kK) and exhibits a fast wind (v_infty=1900\nkm/s), which at d=3.5 kpc would yield a clumped mass loss rate of Mdot = 1.8 x\n10^-8 Msun/yr with a small stellar radius (R_*=0.11 Rsun).

In the present calculation, we consider\nnot only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form\nfactors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change\nof baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter.

In particular we\ndevise an asymptotic method for small Ekman numbers (small viscosities) that\nremoves the Ekman boundary layer and lifts the degeneracy of the inviscid\nbaroclinic solutions.For the first time, realistic two-dimensional models of\nfast-rotating stars are computed with the actual baroclinic flows that predict\nthe differential rotation and the meridional circulation for intermediate-mass\nand massive stars. These models nicely compare with available data of some\nnearby fast-rotating early-type stars like Ras Alhague ($\\alpha$ Oph), Regulus\n($\\alpha$ Leo), and Vega ($\\alpha$ Lyr). It is shown that baroclinicity drives\na differential rotation with a slow pole, a fast equator, a fast core, and a\nslow envelope.

One way\nto distinguish between the SDS and the double-degenerate scenario is to search\nfor the post-impact remnant stars (PIRSs) in SN Ia remnants. Using a technique\nthat combines multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations with one-dimensional\nstellar evolution simulations, we have examined the post-impact evolution of\nhelium-rich binary companions in the SDS. It is found that these helium-rich\nPIRSs (He PIRSs) dramatically expand and evolve to a luminous phase ($L\\sim\n10^4 L_\\odot$) about 10 years after a supernova explosion. Subsequently, they\ncontract and evolve to become hot blue-subdwarf-like (sdO-like) stars by\nreleasing gravitational energy, persisting as sdO-like stars for several\nmillion years before evolving to the helium red-giant phase.

In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral\nshape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37\nmillisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral\nshape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We\nalso construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and\nluminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into\naccount constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including\nboth sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which\ncould be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more\nthan ~10% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess. Each of these arguments strongly\ndisfavor millisecond pulsars as the source of this signal. \n\n"}

Although this is a simple and\nrobust approach, a number of drawbacks exist thus making fourth order schemes\ndesirable. A robust and simple finite-difference scheme, which can easily be\nimplemented in either 1D or 2D stellar pulsation codes is therefore required.\n  Aims: One of the difficulties in setting up higher order finite-difference\nschemes for stellar pulsations is the so-called mesh-drift instability. Current\nways of dealing with this defect include introducing artificial viscosity or\napplying a staggered grids approach. However these remedies are not well-suited\nto eigenvalue problems, especially those involving non-dissipative systems,\nbecause they unduly change the spectrum of the operator, introduce\nsupplementary free parameters, or lead to complications when applying boundary\nconditions.\n  Methods: We propose here a new method, inspired from the staggered grids\nstrategy, which removes this instability while bypassing the above\ndifficulties.

The method enables to reduce the calculation amount by\nusing the Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the density of states compared to a\nconventional Monte Carlo technique based on the exact diagonalization of the\nfermion Hamiltonian matrix. Further reduction is brought by a real-space\ntruncation of the vector-matrix operations. We apply the method to the model\nwith spin-ice type Ising spins on a three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice, and\ncarefully examine the convergence in terms of the order of polynomials and the\ntruncation distance. We find that, in a wide range of electron density at a\nrelatively weak Kondo coupling compared to the noninteracting bandwidth, the\nresults by the polynomial expansion method show good convergence to those by\nthe conventional method within reasonable numbers of polynomials.

The luminosities of the sources are typically several\nthousand L_sun while the effective temperatures are 4000-8000 K.

If the stars are pre-main-sequence\nstars, they are substantially cooler and younger than stars at the birth line\nwhere Galactic protostars are first supposed to become optically visible out of\ntheir molecular clouds. They should therefore be hidden in their present\nevolutionary state. The second explanation for these stars is that they are\npost-AGB or post-RGB stars that have recently undergone a binary interaction\nwhen the red giant of the binary system filled its Roche lobe.

However, the irregular nature of the solar cycle makes solar activity\npredictions a challenging task. This is best achieved through appropriately\nconstrained solar dynamo simulations and as such the first step towards\npredictions is to understand the underlying physics of the solar dynamo\nmechanism. In Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models, the poloidal field is\ngenerated near the solar surface whereas the toroidal field is generated in the\nsolar interior. Therefore a finite time is necessary for the coupling of the\nspatially segregated source layers of the dynamo. This time delay introduces a\nmemory in the dynamo mechanism which allows forecasting of future solar\nactivity. Here we discuss how this forecasting ability of the solar cycle is\naffected by downward turbulent pumping of magnetic flux. With significant\nturbulent pumping the memory of the dynamo is severely degraded and thus long\nterm prediction of the solar cycle is not possible; only a short term\nprediction of the next cycle peak may be possible based on observational data\nassimilation at the previous cycle minimum. \n\n"}

[...] One of the most efficient methods is the measurement of the\nequivalent width (EW) of the Calcium II Triplet (CaT), corrected for the\nluminosity and temperature effects via magnitude differences from the\nhorizontal branch (HB). Methods. We use the Ks magnitude difference between the\nstar and the reddest part of the HB (RHB) to generate reduced equivalent widths\n(rEW) from the datasets presented in Saviane et al. (2012) and Rutledge et al.\n(1997). Subsequently we calibrated these rEW against three different\nmetellicity (met) scales: the one presented in Carretta et al. (2009), the met\nvalues given in Harris (2010) and a version of the former corrected via\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic met. Results. We calculated the calibration\nrelations for the two datasets and the three met scales and found that they are\napproximately equivalent, with differences almost negligible. We compared our\nnIR calibrations with the corresponding optical ones, and found them to be\nequivalent, establishing that the luminosity-corrected rEW using the Ks\nmagnitude is compatible with the one obtained from the V magnitude. We then\nused the met obtained from the calibration to investigate the internal met\ndistributions of the GCs. Conclusions. We have established that the\n([Fe/H]:rEW) relation is independent from the mag used for the luminosity\ncorrection and find that the calibration relations only change slightly for\ndifferent met scales. The CaT technique using NIR photometry is thus a powerful\ntool to derive met. In particular, it can be used to study the internal met\nspread of a GC. We confirm the presence of at least two met populations in NGC\n6656 and find that several other GCs present peculiar met distributions. \n\n"}

We investigate the evolution of\nsuperbubbles in exponentially stratified disks. We present advanced analytical\nmodels for the expansion of such bubbles and calculate their evolution in space\nand time. With these models one can derive the energy input that is needed for\nblow-out of superbubbles into the halo and derive the break-up of the shell,\nsince Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop soon after a bubble starts to\naccelerate into the halo. The approximation of Kompaneets is modified in order\nto calculate velocity and acceleration of a bubble analytically. Our new model\ndiffers from earlier ones, because it presents for the first time an analytical\ncalculation for the expansion of superbubbles in an exponential density\ndistribution driven by a time-dependent energy input rate.

Whether- and when this remnant collapses to a\nblack hole (BH) depends primarily on the equation of state and on angular\nmomentum transport processes, both of which are uncertain. Here we show that\nthe lifetime of the merger remnant may be directly imprinted in the\nradioactively powered kilonova emission following the merger. We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta. When BH formation is relatively\nprompt (~ 100 ms), outflows from the disk are sufficiently neutron rich to form\nheavy r-process elements, resulting in ~ week-long emission with a spectral\npeak in the near-infrared (NIR), similar to that produced by the dynamical\nejecta. In contrast, delayed BH formation allows neutrinos from the HMNS to\nraise the electron fraction in the polar direction to values such that\npotentially Lanthanide-free outflows are generated. The lower opacity would\nproduce a brighter, bluer, and shorter-lived ~ day-long emission (a `blue\nbump') prior to the late NIR peak from the dynamical ejecta and equatorial\nwind.

However, in 3D the skyrmion crystal phase\nis observed only in a narrow region of the temperature-field phase diagram. We\nshow here, using a general analysis based on symmetry, that skyrmions are much\nmore readily stabilized in two-dimensional (2D) systems with Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling.

The inner boundary of the\nsimulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is\nresolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined\nself-consistently. In analogy to previous works, we assume that the specific\nangular momentum of the galaxy is low.

Using high-resolution 3D plasma simulations, we study the statistics\nof the velocity field and its relation with the thermodynamic perturbations.\nThe normalization of the ICM spectrum (density, entropy, or pressure) is\nlinearly tied to the level of large-scale motions, which excite both gravity\nand sound waves due to stratification. For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity\nwaves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially tangential\nturbulence. For M>0.5, sound waves start to significantly contribute, passing\nthe leading role to compressive pressure fluctuations, associated with\nisotropic (or slightly radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations\nare then characterized by the dominant process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic\n(high M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters reside in the\nintermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence\ndrifting towards isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the regime,\nthe variance of density perturbations is comparable to the 1D Mach number.

These\nsimulations reproduce a broad range of locally observed trends among quenching,\nhalo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo center. We show that\nmass quenching is independent of environment because 10^12-10^13 Msun\n\"quenching halos\" -- those where most mass quenching occurs -- inhabit a large\nrange of environments. On the other hand, environment quenching is independent\nof stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in dense\nenvironments as satellites of groups and clusters. Furthermore, satellite\ngalaxies show signs of mass quenching independent of halo mass because massive\nsatellites at z=0 have typically been mass quenched as centrals in their own\nhot halos at higher z -- a kind of pre-processing.

Currently, the separation distribution of\nVLM binaries remains poorly constrained at small separations ($\\leq$ 1 AU),\nleading to uncertainty in the overall binary fraction. We approach this problem\nby searching for late-M/early-L plus T dwarf spectral binaries whose combined\nlight spectra exhibit distinct peculiarities, allowing for\nseparation-independent identification. We define a set of spectral indices\ndesigned to identify these systems, and use a spectral template fitting method\nto confirm and characterize spectral binary (SB) candidates from a library of\n815 spectra from the SpeX Prism Spectral Libraries. We present eleven new\nbinary candidates, confirm three previously reported candidates and rule out\ntwo previously identified candidates, all with primary and secondary spectral\ntypes between M7-L7 and T1-T8, respectively. We find that subdwarfs and blue L\ndwarfs are the primary contaminants in our sample and propose a method for\nsegregating these sources. If confirmed by follow-up observations, these\nsystems may add to the growing list of tight separation binaries, whose orbital\nproperties may yield further insight into brown dwarf formation scenarios. \n\n"}

The ejected material contributes to a\nradioactively-powered electromagnetic transient, with properties that depend\nsensitively on the composition of the outflow. Here we investigate how the spin\nof the black hole remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscous\ntimescales. We carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic\nsimulations of merger remnant accretion disks including viscous angular\nmomentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation. The gravity of\nthe spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find\nthat a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of\nseveral, relative to the non-spinning case. The enhanced mass loss is due to\nenergy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational potential,\nraising the disk temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regions\nwhere neutrino cooling is ineffective. The mean electron fraction of the\noutflow increases moderately with BH spin due to a highly-irradiated (though\nnot neutrino-driven) wind component. While the bulk of the ejecta is still very\nneutron-rich, thus generating heavy r-process elements, the leading edge of the\nwind contains a small amount of Lanthanide-free material.

For the first time we quantify the morphology in Lya images: even if\na variety of intrinsic conditions of the interstellar medium can favour the\nescape of Lya photons, LARS-LAEs appear small in the continuum, and their Lya\nis compact. LARS galaxies tend to be more extended in Lya than in the\nrest-frame UV. It means that Lya photons escape by forming haloes around HII\nregions of LARS galaxies. The stack of LARS-LAE Lya images is peaked in the\ncentre, indicating that the conditions, which make a galaxy an LAE, tend to\nproduce a concentrated surface brightness profile. On the other hand, the stack\nof all LARS galaxies is shallower and more extended. This can be caused by the\nvariety of dust and HI amount and distribution, which produces a more complex,\npatchy, and extended profile, like the one observed for Lyman break galaxies\nthat can contribute to the stack.

It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable\nfield lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines\nwithout requiring much energy. This expulsion of only short lines of force can\nbe accomplished by a spike instability associated with gigantic astrophysical\nsuperbubbles.

The gas that first collapses has been enriched to a metallicity of Z\n~ 2e-5 Zsun. Due to the extremely low metallicity, collapse proceeds similarly\nto metal-free gas until dust cooling becomes efficient at high densities,\ncausing the cloud to fragment into a large number of low mass objects. This\nexternal enrichment mechanism provides a plausible origin for the most\nmetal-poor stars observed, such as SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, that appear to\nhave formed out of gas enriched by a single supernova.

Large-scale correlations inside the\ncritical region are expressed in terms of correlators in a (euclidean)\ntwo-dimensional massless Dirac field theory. It is observed that this theory is\ninhomogenous: the metric is position-dependent, so it is in fact a Dirac field\ntheory in curved space. The technique used to solve the toy-model is then\nextended to deal with the transfer matrices of other models: dimers on the\nhoneycomb and square lattice, and the six-vertex model at the free fermion\npoint ($\\Delta=0$). In all cases, explicit expressions are given for the\nlong-range correlations in the critical region, as well as for the underlying\nDirac action.

Baryon content of the bright cluster sample Abstract: Traditionally, galaxy clusters have been expected to retain all the material\naccreted since their formation epoch. For this reason, their matter content\nshould be representative of the Universe as a whole, and thus their baryon\nfraction should be close to the Universal baryon fraction. We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit\nrelation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\\rm\ngas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\\left(M_{\\rm\n500}/10^{14}M_\\odot\\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$. The baryon budget of galaxy\nclusters therefore falls short of the Universal baryon fraction by about a\nfactor of two at $r_{\\rm 500}$. Our measurements require a hydrostatic bias\n$1-b=M_X/M_{\\rm WL}=0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ to match the gas fraction obtained\nusing lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium. Comparing our gas fraction\nmeasurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, our results\nfavour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of the\nbaryons are expelled from the cores of halos. This model is, however, in\ncontrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might\nsuggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. We note that a mass bias\n$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile Planck CMB and cluster counts should\ntranslate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to\nour current understanding of galaxy clusters.

In the presence of a rotating bar, these neighbouring\nstream stars experience different bar orientations during pericentric passage\nand hence each star receives a different torque from the bar. These differing\ntorques reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the\nstream, which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream. For a progenitor\norbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance\ncondition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than\nexpected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur\nalong the bar's minor or major axis respectively. We present a full discussion\nof this phenomenon focusing mainly on streams confined to the Galactic plane.\nIn stark contrast with the evolution in static potentials, which give rise to\nstreams that grow steadily in time, rotating barred potentials can produce\ndynamically old, short streams. This challenges the traditional viewpoint that\nthe inner halo consists of well phase-mixed material whilst the\ntidally-disrupted structures in the outer halo are more spatially coherent.

The data\ncover the spectral region surrounding the broad Balmer emission lines, which\nenables the estimation of black hole masses (M_BH) and accretion rates (in\nterms of L/L_Edd). We focus on 10 AGN at z~3.3, where we observe the Hbeta\nspectral region, while for the other four z~2.4 sources we use the Halpha broad\nemission line. Compared with previous detailed studies of unobscured AGNs at\nthese high redshifts, our sources are fainter by an order of magnitude,\ncorresponding to number densities of order ~10^-6--10^-5 Mpc^-3. The lower AGN\nluminosities also allow for a robust identification of the host galaxy\nemission, necessary to obtain reliable intrinsic AGN luminosities, BH masses\nand accretion rates. We find the AGNs in our sample to be powered by\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) with a typical mass of M_BH~5*10^8 M_Sol --\nsignificantly lower than the higher-luminosity, rarer quasars reported in\nprevious studies.

Previous studies identified\nthis excess in relatively small samples and suggested that such non-stellar\nemission, which could be linked to the $3.3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons feature or hot dust emission, is associated with an\nincreased star formation rate (SFR). In this Letter, we confirm and quantify\nthe presence of an IR excess in a significant fraction of galaxies in the\n3D-HST GOODS catalogs. By constructing a matched sample of galaxies with and\nwithout strong non-stellar near-IR emission, we find that galaxies with such\nemission are predominantly star-forming galaxies. Moreover, star-forming\ngalaxies with an excess show increased mid- and far-IR and H$\\alpha$ emission\ncompared to other star-forming galaxies without. While galaxies with a near-IR\nexcess show a larger fraction of individually detected X-ray active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs), an X-ray stacking analysis, together with the IR-colors and\nH$\\alpha$ profiles, shows that AGNs are unlikely to be the dominant source of\nthe excess in the majority of galaxies. Our results suggest that non-stellar\nnear-IR emission is linked to increased SFRs and is ubiquitous among\nstar-forming galaxies. As such, the near-IR emission might be a powerful tool\nto measure SFRs in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope. \n\n"}

The key\nfactor of the star formation is the transition of hydrogen from atomic to\nmolecular state, since the star formation is associated with the molecular\nphase. This transition is also strongly coupled with chemical evolution,\nbecause dust grains, i.e., tiny solid particles of heavy elements, play a\ncritical role in molecular formation.

In\nparticular, we study analytically how the anisotropy of the intensity\ncorrelation in the channel maps changes with the thickness of velocity\nchannels. In agreement with the earlier VCA studies we find that the anisotropy\nin the thick channels reflects the anisotropy of the density field, while the\nrelative contribution of density and velocity fluctuations to the thin velocity\nchannels depends on the density spectral slope. We show that the anisotropies\narising from Alfven, slow and fast magnetohydrodynamical modes are different,\nin particular, the anisotropy in PPV created by fast modes is opposite to that\ncreated by Alfven and slow modes, and this can be used to separate their\ncontributions. We successfully compare our results with the recent numerical\nstudy of the PPV anisotropies measured with synthetic observations.

It is interesting to find\nthat the band dispersion, conductance, and thermopower can be modulated by\napplying a bias voltage and boundary potentials to the two layers of the ZPNRs.\nUnder the certain bias voltage, the two-fold degenerate quasi-flat edge bands\nsplit perfectly. The conductance can be switched off, and the thermopower\naround zero energy increases. In addition, when only the boundary potential of\nthe top layer or bottom layer is adjusted, only one edge band bends and merges\ninto the bulk band. The first conductance plateau is strongly decreased to\n$e^2/h$ around zero energy. Particularly, when the two boundary potentials are\nadjusted, all the edge bands bend and fully merge into the bulk band, and the\nbulk energy gap is maximized. More interestingly, a pronounced conductance\nplateau with $G=0$ is found around zero energy, which is attributable to the\nopening of the bulk energy gap between the valence and conduction bands.\nMeanwhile, the thermopower can be enhanced more than twice, compared to that of\nthe perfect ZPNRs. The large magnitude of thermopower is ascribed to the\nappearance of the bulk energy gap around zero energy.

We propose that the\ntransformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs\nexceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The\nbottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the\nfirst e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past\nthis bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated\nepisodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass\ndensity in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by\nepisodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have\nprobably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars.

Abstract: We present B and V time-series photometry of Andromeda XXV, the third galaxy\nin our program on the Andromeda's satellites, that we have imaged with the\nLarge Binocular Cameras of the Large Binocular Telescope. The field of\nAndromeda XXV is found to contain 63 variable stars, for which we present light\ncurves and characteristics of the light variation (period, amplitudes,\nvariability type, mean magnitudes, etc.). The sample includes 58 RR Lyrae\nvariables (46 fundamental-mode $-$ RRab, and 12 first-overtone $-$RRc,\npulsators), three anomalous Cepheids, one eclipsing binary system and one\nunclassified variable. The average period of the RRab stars ($\\langle Pab\n\\rangle$ = 0.60 $\\sigma=0.04$ days) and the period-amplitude diagram place\nAndromeda XXV in the class of the Oosterhoff-Intermediate objects. From the\naverage luminosity of the RR Lyrae stars we derive for the galaxy a distance\nmodulus of (m-M)$_0$=$24.63\\pm0.17$ mag.

For example in fractional quantum Hall systems, excitations can\ncarry fractional charges while the electrons making up the system have charge\none. An important question is to understand what symmetry fractionalization\n(SF) patterns are possible given different types of topological order and\ndifferent symmetries. A lot of progress has been made recently in classifying\nthe SF patterns, providing deep insight into the strongly correlated\nexperimental signatures of systems like spin liquids and topological\ninsulators. We review recent developments on this topic. First, it was shown\nthat the SF patterns need to satisfy some simple consistency conditions. More\ninteresting, it was realized that some seemingly consistent SF patterns are\nactually `anomalous', i.e. they cannot be realized in strictly 2D systems. We\nreview various methods that have been developed to detect such anomalies.\nApplying such an understanding to 2D spin liquid allows one to enumerate all\npotentially realizable SF patterns and propose numerical and experimental\nprobing methods to distinguish them. On the other hand, the anomalous SF\npatterns were shown to exist on the surface of 3D systems and reflect the\nnontrivial order in the 3D bulk.

The [OI] and HI concentrations, and the high radiation\nfield and density are consistent with the hypothesis of a very recent (at most\na few tens of Myr ago) inflow of atomic gas triggering star formation. Dust has\nnot had time to build up (explaining high line-to-continuum ratios).

A number of\ncorrelations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation\ntimescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole\nmass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is\nplausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based\nsurvey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to\nthe input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light\ncurves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,\ncadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most\nsignificant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return\nunconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do\nnot probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The\nexperiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW\ntimescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum\n10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for\nsufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias\ndepends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly\naffected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because\nthe DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing\ndata, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN\nparameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct.

In this paper we use SDSS\nspectrophotometry to explore the systematics of the correlation using the\n[OIII]5007 lines instead of Halpha or Hbeta to measure luminosities and line\nwidths. We also examine possible systematic effects involved in measuring the\nprofile-widths and the luminosities through different apertures.

Within the framework of a quantum master equation,\nthe asymptotic states of such systems are described by time-periodic density\noperators. Resolution of these operators constitutes a non-trivial\ncomputational task. To go beyond the current size limits, we use the quantum\ntrajectory method which unravels master equation for the density operator into\na set of stochastic processes for wave functions. The asymptotic density matrix\nis calculated by performing a statistical sampling over the ensemble of quantum\ntrajectories, preceded by a long transient propagation. We follow the ideology\nof event-driven programming and construct a new algorithmic realization of the\nmethod.

We present\nthe first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements.\nBeyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see\na star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which\nconsists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude \"nu_max\"\nand the mean frequency separation between mode overtones \"Delta nu\", is\nsurprising as the nu_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the\naccepted value.

These lecture notes provide a short review of the\ncurrent status of the theoretical and experimental exploration of these Kitaev\nmaterials. \n\n"}

This map, which\nexplores distances up to 15 kpc from the Sun, reveals clear evidence for the\ndual nature of the Galactic halo, based on the spatial distribution of stellar\ncarbonicity. The metallicity distribution functions of stars in the inner- and\nouter-halo regions of the carbonicity map reproduce those previously argued to\narise from contributions of the inner- and outer-halo populations, with peaks\nat [Fe/H] = -1.5 and -2.2, respectively.

As\nfield galaxies have an H I covering fraction of ~100% at similar radii, the\ndearth of CGM H I in our data indicates that the cluster environment has\neffectively stripped or overionized the gaseous halos of these cluster\ngalaxies. Second, we assess the contribution of warm-hot (10^5 - 10^6 K) gas to\nthe ICM as traced by O VI and broad Ly-alpha (BLA) absorption.

In the models considered here, dark matter can undergo\nself-annihilation/decay into radiation and baryons.

For some dark matter models, DMAF's ability to evacuate gas is enhanced\nin lower mass, concentrated halos where the injected energy is comparable to\nits gravitational binding energy.

It\nwas the first system in which both the bow and upstream shock fronts were\ndetected at X-ray wavelengths (Mach$\\sim2$), yet deep GMRT 325 MHz observations\nfailed to detect extended radio emission associated with the cluster as is\ntypically seen in such systems. We present new, multi-configuration $1-2$ GHz\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of Abell 2146 totalling 16\nhours of observations. These data reveal for the first time the presence of an\nextended ($\\approx850$ kpc), faint radio structure associated with Abell 2146.\nThe structure appears to harbour multiple components, one associated with the\nupstream shock which we classify as a radio relic and one associated with the\nsubcluster core which is consisted as being a radio halo bounded by the bow\nshock. The newly detected structures have some of the lowest radio powers\ndetected thus far in any cluster ($P_{\\rm 1.4 GHz,\nhalo}=2.4\\pm0.2\\times10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $P_{\\rm 1.4 GHz,\nrelic}=2.2\\pm0.2\\times10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$).

Both the\nexistence and the nature of the high-velocity peak are still under debate. Here\nwe revisit this feature with the latest APOGEE DR13 data. We find that most of\nthe low latitude bulge fields display a skewed Gaussian distribution with a HV\nshoulder. However, only 3 out of 53 fields show distinct high-velocity peaks\naround 200 km/s. The velocity distribution can be well described by\nGauss-Hermite polynomials, except the three fields showing clear HV peaks. We\nfind that the correlation between the skewness parameter ($h_{3}$) and the mean\nvelocity ($\\bar{v}$), instead of a distinctive HV peak, is a strong indicator\nof the bar. It was recently suggested that the HV peak is composed of\npreferentially young stars. We choose three fields showing clear HV peaks to\ntest this hypothesis using the metallicity, [$\\alpha$/M] and [C/N] as age\nproxies. We find that both young and old stars show HV features. The similarity\nbetween the chemical abundances of stars in the HV peaks and the main component\nindicates that they are not systematically different in terms of chemical\nabundance or age. In contrast, there are clear differences in chemical space\nbetween stars in the Sagittarius dwarf and the bulge stars.

Whether a quantum spin-liquid is stabilized or not depends on the\ninterplay of various exchange interactions with chemical disorder that is\ninherent to the layered structure of the compound. We combine time-domain\nterahertz spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering measurements in the\nfield polarized state of YbMgGaO$_{4}$ to obtain better microscopic insights on\nits exchange interactions. Terahertz spectroscopy in this fashion functions as\nhigh-field electron spin resonance and probes the spin-wave excitations at the\nBrillouin zone center, ideally complementing neutron scattering. A global\nspin-wave fit to all our spectroscopic data at fields over 4T, informed by the\nanalysis of the terahertz spectroscopy linewidths, yields stringent constraints\non $g$-factors and exchange interactions.

An important difference between these two cases\nis the nucleosynthetic yield, which is altered by the increased neutron excess\nin Chandrasekhar progenitors due to their pre-explosion simmering and high\ncentral density.\n  From comparison with theoretical nucleosynthesis yields, we show that the\nchemical composition of the most metal-rich star in the Ursa Minor dwarf\ngalaxy, COS 171, is dominated by nucleosynthesis from a low-metallicity,\nlow-mass, sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Key diagnostic abundance ratios include\nC/Fe, {\\alpha}/Fe, Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios, which could not have been produced\nby Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia, Core-Collapse Type II supernovae or\nPair-Instsability supernovae.

Yet determining this time is important for precision tests of the\ngeneral theory of relativity that compare an observed signal with quasinormal\nmode descriptions of the ringdown, such as tests of the no-hair theorem.

Using numerical relativity\nsimulations, we characterize the Kerrness of the strong-field region close to\nthe black hole using a set of local, gauge-invariant geometric and algebraic\nconditions that measure local isometry to Kerr.

In\nthis work, to understand what quantities of galaxies are responsible for\ncontrolling the escape fraction, we numerically evaluate the escape fraction by\nperforming ray-tracing calculation with simplified disc galaxy models.

In addition, we find that clumpiness regulates\nthe escape fraction via two ways when the total clump mass dominates the total\ngas mass; the escape fraction is controlled by the covering factor of clumps if\nthe clumps are dense sufficient to block LyC photons, otherwise the clumpiness\nworks to reduce the escape fraction by increasing the total number of\nrecombination events in a galaxy. \n\n"}

There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such\ndisks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the\nreconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The\nformation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has\ninteresting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and\nplanet formation. \n\n"}

This scenario predicts an isotropic distribution of spin\ntilts. In the concordant models with GW150914, the masses of seed BHs are\nrequired to be $\\gtrsim 25~M_\\odot$. The potential sites of such \"chance\nmeeting\" BH mergers are active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and dense\ninterstellar clouds. Assuming the LIGO O1, we roughly estimate the event rates\nfor PopI BHs and PopIII BHs in AGN disks to be respectively $\\simeq\n1-2\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\\simeq 1\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Multiple episodes of\nAGNs may enhance the rates by roughly an order of magnitude.

We show that, by\nmeasuring the virial ratio of the stars alone (disregarding the gas\ncompletely), we can estimate how much mass a star cluster will retain after gas\nexpulsion to within 10% accuracy, no matter how complex the background\nstructure of the gas is, and we present a simple analytical recipe describing\nthis behaviour.

Recently\nthere has been interest in using observational estimates of the RGB Teff to\nplace constraints on the mixing length parameter, a_MLT, and possible variation\nwith metallicity. Here we use 1D MESA stellar evolution models to explore the\nsensitivity of the RGB Teff to the treatment of the surface boundary condition.\nWe find that different surface boundary conditions can lead to +/- 100 K\nmetallicity-dependent offsets on the RGB relative to one another in spite of\nthe fact that all models can reproduce the properties of the Sun. Moreover, for\na given atmosphere T-tau relation, we find that the RGB Teff is also sensitive\nto the optical depth at which the surface boundary condition is applied in the\nstellar model. Nearly all models adopt the photosphere as the location of the\nsurface boundary condition but this choice is somewhat arbitrary. We compare\nour models to stellar parameters derived from the APOGEE-Kepler sample of first\nascent red giants and find that systematic uncertainties in the models due to\ntreatment of the surface boundary condition place a limit of ~100 K below which\nit is not possible to make firm conclusions regarding the fidelity of the\ncurrent generation of stellar models. \n\n"}

This technique is of particular utility for\ndetecting signals in power spectra with frequency-dependent noise backgrounds,\nas it is only sensitive to features that are sharp relative to the inspected\nfrequency bin width. We develop a CV-based algorithm to quickly detect the\npresence of solar-like oscillations in photometric power spectra that are\ndominated by stellar granulation.

We uncover seven regimes in total, one of which allows\nthree unstable condensation modes.

The three hottest known DAs (surface gravity log g $\\geq$\n7.0) have effective temperatures around Teff = 140,000 K, followed by only five\nobjects in the range 104,000 - 120,000 K. They are by far outnumbered by forty\nnon-DAs with Teff = 100,000 - 250,000 K, giving a DA/non-DA ratio of 0.2. In\ncontrast, this ratio is the inverse of that for the cooler WDs. One reason for\nthis discrepancy could be uncertainties in the temperature determination of hot\nDAs using Balmer-line spectroscopy. Recent investigations involving\nmetal-ionization balances in ultraviolet (UV) spectra indeed showed that the\ntemperatures of some DAs were underestimated, but the paucity of extremely hot\nDAs prevailed. Here we present the results of a UV spectral analysis of one of\nthe three hottest DAs, PG0948+534. We find that its temperature was strongly\noverestimated by recent Balmer line analyses. We correct it downward to 105,000\n$\\pm$ 5000 K, aggravating the hot-DA paucity. The Balmer-line problem\nencountered previously is not resolved by our non-LTE line-blanketed model\natmospheres.

When the time needed for the rearrangement of\nthe local atomic structure reaches approximately 100 seconds, the system\nbecomes \"solid\" for any practical purpose, and this defines the glass\ntransition temperature $T_g$.

The two particle scattering matrices obtained from the\nsecular equations are consistent with this symmetry, and they differ in an\noverall sign in the two sectors. \n\n"}

One dynamical\nsymmetry of this model corresponds to the previously proposed SO(5) model for\nunification of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, but there are two\nadditional dynamical symmetries: SO(4), associated with antiferromagnetic order\nand SU(2), associated with a D-wave pairing condensate. These provide a 3-phase\nmicroscopic model of high-$T_c$ superconductivity and permit a clear\nunderstanding of the role played by the SO(5) symmetry. \n\n"}

The method can be used to study\nground-state landscapes by calculating many independent ground states for each\nrealization of the disorder. The algorithm is analyzed with respect to the\nstatistics of the ground states and the valleys of the energy landscape.\nFurthermore, the distribution inside each valley is evaluated. It is shown that\nthe algorithm does not lead to a true T=0 thermodynamic distribution, i.e. each\nground state has not the same frequency of occurrence when performing many\nruns. An extension of the technique is outlined, which guarantees that each\nground states occurs with the same probability. \n\n"}

The S-side\n(F and AF-side) is described by the attractive (repulsive) Hubbard model, and\nthe Bogoliubov de Gennes equation derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation\nis solved numerically. The superconducting order parameter and the\nmagnetization (m) can coexist near the interface, and the spatial variation of\nm induces the spin-triplet p-wave component in both F and AF cases. The local\ndensity of states is also calculated and discussed. \n\n"}

On cooling within the paramagnetic\nstate, we observe purely two-dimensional behavior with a crossover to\nthree-dimensional scaling close to the ferromagnetic transition.

We discuss the\ncombined use of these functional equations as well as outlining the\nconstruction of practical renormalisation schemes, also valid in the presence\nof composite operators.
