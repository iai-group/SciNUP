Making a quantum expansion around such\na time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantum\nfield theory. We call this mechanism cosmological symmetry breaking and argue\nthat it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking.

The\nmotivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background\nindependence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that\nboth the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are\nderived are as self-consistent as possible.

However, in order to\nderive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose a\nthree-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physically\nappropriate geometry. The expression of this choice process requires a\nthree-dimensional topological manifold Q, to which all considered three-space\nregions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q.\nThese solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through the\ntopology of Q and constitute Einstein gravity.

We\npoint out, however, that his EREs are incorrect, since his putative saddle\npoints do not in fact solve the Einstein equation. We remedy this situation in\nthe case of two-dimensional CFTs, considering regions consisting of one or two\nintervals. For a single interval, the EREs are known for a general CFT; we\nreproduce them using gravity. For two intervals, the RT formula predicts a\nphase transition in the entanglement entropy as a function of their separation,\nand that the mutual information between the intervals vanishes for separations\nlarger than the phase transition point. By computing EREs using gravity and CFT\ntechniques, we find evidence supporting both predictions. We also find evidence\nthat large-$N$ symmetric-product theories have the same EREs as holographic\nones. \n\n"}

The model is embedded in an anisotropic type\nIIB compactification with two exponentially large extra dimensions and\nTeV-scale gravity. The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the\nscale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the\ncosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the\nsize of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the\norder (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.\nThe mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is\nprotected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to\nordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the\nquintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very\nsmall, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which\navoids stringent fifth-force constraints.

Motivated by this, we explore eta/s in black hole accretion flows, in\norder to understand if such exotic flows could be a natural site for the lowest\neta/s. Accretion flow plays an important role in black hole physics in\nidentifying the existence of the underlying black hole.

In algebraic terms, this\nis due to the presence of a center --- a set of operators which commute with\nall others --- in the gauge invariant operator algebra corresponding to finite\nregion. A unique entropy can be assigned to algebras with center, giving place\nto a local entropy in lattice gauge theories. However, ambiguities arise on the\ncorrespondence between algebras and regions. In particular, it is always\npossible to choose (in many different ways) local algebras with trivial center,\nand hence a genuine entanglement entropy, for any region. These choices are in\ncorrespondence with maximal trees of links on the boundary, which can be\ninterpreted as partial gauge fixings. This interpretation entails a gauge\nfixing dependence of the entanglement entropy.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity. \n\n"}

We start by reviewing in details the supercoset\nconstruction of the superstring action in $AdS_5 \\times S^5$, pointing out the\nlimits of this procedure for $AdS_4$ and $AdS_3$ backgrounds. For the $AdS_4\n\\times CP^3$ case we give a thorough derivation of an alternative action, based\non the double-dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional super-membranes. We\nthen consider the expansion about the BMN vacuum and the S-matrix for the\nscattering of worldsheet excitations in the decompactification limit. To\nevaluate its elements efficiently we describe a unitarity-based method\nresulting in a very compact formula yielding the cut-constructible part of any\none-loop two-dimensional S-matrix.

A careful comparison of these\ndifferent data sets help us to draw the following conclusions: (i) All the data\nsets strongly rule out non-accelerating models. Interestingly, the first and\nthe second sets favour a closed universe; i.e., the probability P(Omega_{tot} >\n1) \\gtrsim 0.97.

The observed\nweakness of gravity on distances $\\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n\n\\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The\nPlanck scale $M_{Pl} \\sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity\nis simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While\ngravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the\nStandard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of\nweak scale \"thickness\" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number\nof striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments.

If\nD-branes wrap a torus with B-flux the rank of the gauge group is reduced due to\nnon-commuting Wilson lines whose presence is implied by the B-flux. In the case\nof D-branes transverse to a torus with B-flux the rank reduction is due to a\nsmaller number of D-branes required by tadpole cancellation conditions in the\npresence of B-flux as some of the orientifold planes now have the opposite\norientifold projection. We point out that T-duality in the presence of B-flux\nis more subtle than in the case with trivial B-flux, and it is precisely\nconsistent with the qualitative difference between the aforementioned two\nsetups. In the case where both types of branes are present, the states in the\nmixed (e.g., 59) open string sectors come with a non-trivial multiplicity,\nwhich we relate to a discrete gauge symmetry due to non-zero B-flux, and\nconstruct vertex operators for the the mixed sector states.

The obtained recently supergeneralization\nof the Kerr-Newman solution suggests the existence of extra axial singular line\nand fermionic traveling waves concentrating near these singularities.\n  We discuss briefly a possibility of experimental test of these predictions. \n\n"}
