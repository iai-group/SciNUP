While the flux of solar 8B neutrinos has been\nrecently measured at Superkamiokande with a 3.5% uncertainty and a precise\nmeasurement of 7Be neutrino flux is foreseen in the next future, the predicted\nfluxes are still affected by larger errors.

J/psi suppression\nmechanisms based on energy density (such as color screening, interaction with\nco-movers, etc.) predict the opposite trend. On the other hand, it is expected\nthat more c\\bar{c} pairs should be available to form quarkonia at mid-rapidity\nvia recombination. Some models provide a way to differentiate J/psi production\nfrom initially produced c\\bar{c} pairs and final state recombination of\nuncorrelated pairs, via the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the\nelliptic flow (v2).\n  During 2007 data taking at RHIC, a large sample of Au+Au collisions at\nsqrt(sNN)=200 GeV was collected.

These observations were obtained with OSIRIS using the Keck Laser\nGuide Star Adaptive Optics system. All sources have a compact spatial extent of\n~1\", with an average half light radius of r=2.9 kpc and average dereddened star\nformation rate of 22 Msolar per year. Based on H-alpha kinematics we find that\nthese six galaxies are dynamically distinguishable, and we classify them as\neither merger or disk candidate systems. We find three merger systems\n(HDF-BX1287, HDF-BX1315, and Q1623-BX491) with varying geometries and dynamical\nproperties. Three galaxies (HDF-BMZ1299, Q2343-BX344, and Q2343-BM145) are\nwell-fit by an inclined-disk model with low velocity residuals (20 to 46\nkm/sec). An average plateau velocity of v_p=185 km/sec is achieved within 1.0\nkpc. The majority of observed velocity dispersions (~88 km/sec) can be\nexplained by the residual seeing halo, and are not intrinsic to our sources.\nHowever, one merger and one disk candidate have high velocity dispersions (>\n200 km/sec) that cannot be solely explained by beam smearing.

Active longitudes\n  and short-term spot cycle in a young Sun-like star Abstract: The space experiment CoRoT has recently detected transits by a hot Jupiter\nacross the disc of an active G7V star (CoRoT-Exo-2a) that can be considered as\na good proxy for the Sun at an age of approximately 0.5 Gyr. We present a spot\nmodelling of the optical variability of the star during 142 days of\nuninterrupted observations performed by CoRoT with unprecedented photometric\nprecision. We apply spot modelling approaches previously tested in the case of\nthe Sun by modelling total solar irradiance variations. To model the light\ncurve of CoRoT-Exo-2a, we take into account both the photometric effects of\ncool spots as well as those of solar-like faculae, adopting solar analogy. Two\nactive longitudes initially on opposite hemispheres are found on the\nphotosphere of CoRoT-Exo-2a with a rotation period of 4.522 $\\pm$ 0.024 days.\nTheir separation changes by approximately 80 degrees during the time span of\nthe observations. From this variation, a relative amplitude of the surface\ndifferential rotation lower than about 1 percent is estimated. Individual spots\nform within the active longitudes and show an angular velocity about 1 percent\nsmaller than that of the longitude pattern. The total spotted area shows a\ncyclic oscillation with a period of 28.9 $\\pm$ 4.3 days, which is close to 10\ntimes the synodic period of the planet as seen by the rotating active\nlongitudes. The implications of such results for the internal rotation of\nCoRoT-Exo-2a are discussed on the basis of solar analogy. A possible magnetic\nstar-planet interaction is suggested by the cyclic variation of the spotted\narea. Alternatively, the 28.9-d cycle may be related to Rossby-type waves\npropagating in the subphotospheric layers of the star. \n\n"}

The chameleon mechanism can screen the scalar charge for\nlarge objects but not for small ones (large/small is defined by the\ngravitational potential and controlled by the scalar coupling). This leads to\norder one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan\nframe, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if\nthe scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld\nmodel, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level.

This allows us to describe the\nvarious components of the model in a simple and transparent way.

To demonstrate this point, we\nexamine several different galaxy formation models, which are all consistent\nwith the observational data. Each model is characterized by a different unique\nfeature: cold accretion in low mass haloes, zero feedback, stars formed only in\nmerger-induced bursts, and shutdown of star-formation after mergers.

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts. Indeed, if the symmetry energy is supersoft, the surface\ncontribution becomes dominant. We note that the linear correlation of NST of\n208Pb with the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy arises from\nthe bulk part of NST. We also note that most models predict a mixed-type\n(between halo and skin) neutron distribution for 208Pb. Although the halo-type\nlimit is actually found in the models with a supersoft symmetry energy, the\nskin-type limit is not supported by any mean-field model.

Is any fit\n  acceptable? Abstract: The $^{15}{\\rm N}(p,\\gamma)^{16}{\\rm O}$ reaction provides a path from the CN\ncycle to the CNO bi-cycle and CNO tri-cycle. The measured astrophysical factor\nfor this reaction is dominated by resonant capture through two strong\n$J^{\\pi}=1^{-}$ resonances at $E_{R}= 312$ and 962 keV and direct capture to\nthe ground state. Recently, a new measurement of the astrophysical factor for\nthe $^{15}{\\rm N}(p,\\gamma)^{16}{\\rm O}$ reaction has been published [P. J.\nLeBlanc {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. {\\bf C 82}, 055804 (2010)]. The analysis has\nbeen done using the $R$-matrix approach with unconstrained variation of all\nparameters including the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). The best\nfit has been obtained for the square of the ANC $C^{2}= 539.2$ fm${}^{-1}$,\nwhich exceeds the previously measured value by a factor of $\\approx 3$. Here we\npresent a new $R$-matrix analysis of the Notre Dame-LUNA data with the fixed\nwithin the experimental uncertainties square of the ANC $C^{2}=200.34$\nfm${}^{-1}$. Rather than varying the ANC we add the contribution from a\nbackground resonance that effectively takes into account contributions from\nhigher levels. Altogether we present 8 fits, five unconstrained and three\nconstrained. In all the fits the ANC is fixed at the previously determined\nexperimental value $C^{2}=200.34$ fm${}^{-1}$. For the unconstrained fit with\nthe boundary condition $B_{c}=S_{c}(E_{2})$, where $E_{2}$ is the energy of the\nsecond level, we get $S(0)=39.0 \\pm 1.1 $ keVb and normalized ${\\tilde\n\\chi}^{2}=1.84$, i.e. the result which is similar to [P.

Abstract: Since the 1930s, and with very few exceptions, it has been assumed that the\nprocess of radioactive decay is a random process, unaffected by the environment\nin which the decaying nucleus resides. There have been instances within the\npast few decades, however, where changes in the chemical environment or\nphysical environment brought about small changes in the decay rates. But even\nin light of these instances, decaying nuclei that were undisturbed or\nun-\"pressured\" were thought to behave in the expected random way, subject to\nthe normal decay probabilities which are specific to each nuclide. Moreover,\nany \"non-random\" behavior was assumed automatically to be the fault of the\ndetection systems, the environment surrounding the detectors, or changes in the\nbackground radiation to which the detector was exposed. Recently, however,\nevidence has emerged from a variety of sources, including measurements taken by\nindependent groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Physikalisch-Technische\nBundesanstalt, and Purdue University, that indicate there may in fact be an\ninfluence that is altering nuclear decay rates, albeit at levels on the order\nof $10^{-3}$.

Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet.

This in turn implied that the\nneutrino driven wind is proton rich during its entire life, precluding\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis and the synthesis of Sr, Y, and Zr. This work\nrelied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a\nfree nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon\npotential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly\nalters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear\nsymmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton\nsingle-particle energies $\\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the\ncharged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given\nneutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\\nu_e+n\\rightarrow e^-+p$ is\nenhanced while $ \\bar{\\nu}_e+p\\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$\nvalue for these reactions is altered by $\\pm\\Delta U$, respectively. In the\nneutrino decoupling region, collisional broadening acts to enhance both $\\nu_e$\nand $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ cross-sections and RPA corrections decrease the $\\nu_e$\ncross-section and increase the $\\bar \\nu_e$ cross-section, but mean field\nshifts have a larger effect. Therefore, electron neutrinos decouple at lower\ntemperature than when the nucleons are assumed to be free and have lower\naverage energies. The change is large enough to allow for a reasonable period\nof time when the neutrino driven wind is predicted to be neutron rich. It is\nalso shown that the electron fraction in the wind is influenced by the nuclear\nsymmetry energy. \n\n"}

This instability is cosmologically relevant since quantum fluctuations\nduring inflation can easily destabilize the electroweak vacuum if the Hubble\nparameter during inflation is larger than $\\Lambda_I$ (as preferred by the\nrecent BICEP2 measurement).

While the total nuclear symmetry energy at nuclear saturation\ndensity (\\rho_0) is relatively well determined, its value at supranuclear\ndensities is not. The latter can be better constrained by separately examining\nits kinetic and potential terms and their density dependencies. The kinetic\nterm of the symmetry energy, E_sym^kin(\\rho_0), equals the difference in the\nper-nucleon kinetic energy between pure neutron matter (PNM) and symmetric\nnuclear matter (SNM), often calculated using a simple Fermi gas model. However,\nexperiments show that tensor force induced short-range correlations (SRC)\nbetween proton-neutron pairs shift nucleons to high-momentum in SNM, but have\nalmost no effect in PNM.

Old\nmetal-poor stars carry the signature of the astrophysical source(s). Among the\nelements dominantly made by the r-process, europium (Eu) is relatively easy to\nobserve. In this work we simulate the evolution of europium in our galaxy with\nthe inhomogeneous chemical evolution model 'ICE', and compare our results with\nspectroscopic observations. We test the most important parameters affecting the\nchemical evolution of Eu: (a) for neutron star mergers the coalescence time\nscale of the merger ($t_{\\mathrm{coal}}$) and the probability to experience a\nneutron star merger event after two supernova explosions occurred and formed a\ndouble neutron star system ($P_{\\mathrm{NSM}}$) and (b) for the sub-class of\nmagneto-rotationally driven supernovae (\"Jet-SNe\"), their occurrence rate\ncompared to standard supernovae ($P_{\\mathrm{Jet-SN}}$).

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams.

The deuterium data show a smaller\nlongitudinal structure function, and smaller ratio of longitudinal to\ntransverse cross section R, than the proton. This suggests either an unexpected\ndifference in R for the proton and neutron or a suppression of the gluonic\ndistribution in nuclei. \n\n"}

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

About half (a third) of the\nsimulated massive galaxies (massive central galaxies) at z~2 have broad-band\ncolours classifying them as 'quiescent', and the fraction of quiescent centrals\nis steeply decreasing towards higher redshift, in agreement with observations.\nThe progenitors of z~2 quiescent central galaxies are, on average, more\nmassive, have lower specific SFRs, and reside in more massive haloes than the\nprogenitors of similarly massive star forming centrals. The simulations further\npredict a morphological mix of galaxies that includes disk-dominated,\nirregular, and early-type galaxies. However, our simulations do not reproduce\nthe reddest of the quiescent galaxies observed at z~2. We also do not find\nevidence for a colour bimodality, but are limited by our modest sample size.

In contrast to standard quasi-homogeneous dark energy,\nnegligible sound speed implies clustering of the dark energy fluid at all\nscales, allowing us to measure the effects of dark energy perturbations at\ncluster scales. We compare those models and set the stage for using non-linear\ninformation from semi-analytical modelling in cluster growth data analyses. For\nthis, we recalibrate the halo mass function with non-linear characteristic\nquantities, the spherical collapse threshold and virial overdensity, that\naccount for model and redshift dependent behaviours, as well as an additional\nmass contribution for cold dark energy. We present the first constraints from\nthis cold dark matter plus cold dark energy mass function using our cluster\nabundance likelihood, which self-consistently accounts for selection effects,\ncovariances and systematic uncertainties. We combine cluster growth data with\nCMB, SNe Ia and BAO data, and find a shift between cold versus\nquasi-homogeneous dark energy of up to $1\\sigma$.

It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should\nstrive for; it is not a descriptive \"law of nature\" in the usual sense. 2) All\nprobabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they\nnever tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum\nstates thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world. 3) Quantum measurement outcomes\njust are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them.

Hyperpolarisation offers enormous gains in signal\nand spatial resolution which may ultimately lead to the development of\nmolecular MRI and NMR. At present, techniques used to polarise nuclear spins\ngenerally require low temperatures and/or high magnetic fields, radio-frequency\ncontrol fields, or the introduction of catalysts or free-radical mediators. The\nemergence of room temperature solid-state spin qubits has opened exciting new\npathways to circumvent these requirements to achieve direct nuclear spin\nhyperpolarisation using quantum control. Employing a novel cross-relaxation\ninduced polarisation (CRIP) protocol using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncentre in diamond, we demonstrate the first external nuclear spin\nhyperpolarisation achieved by a quantum probe, in this case of $^1$H molecular\nspins in poly(methyl methacrylate).

The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent\non the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The\nanisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of\ndisk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits\nare isotropic in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of\nradius, although this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and\nluminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second\nGaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies. A new\ncorrelation is evidenced, linking the absolute magnitude or stellar mass of the\ndisks to the azimuthal anisotropy. More luminous disks have more radial orbits\nand less luminous disks have isotropic and somewhat tangential orbits. This\ncorrelation is consistent with the picture in galaxy evolution in which orbits\nbecome more radial as the mass grows and is redistributed as a function of\ntime. With the help of circular velocity curves, it is also shown that the\nepicycle theory fails to reproduce the diversity of the azimuthal anisotropy of\nstellar random motions, as it predicts only nearly radial orbits in the\npresence of flat curves. The origin of this conflict is yet to be identified.\nIt also questions the validity of the vertical-to-radial axis ratio of the\nvelocity ellipsoid derived by many studies in the framework of the epicyclic\napproximation. \n\n"}

Color\nvariations are consistent with variable extinction with a flatter wavelength\ndependence than interstellar extinction, i.e., larger grains. MHO 3252 Y3 is\nthe source of a large scale bipolar outflow, but the most recent outflow\nactivity has produced a microjet detectable in the shock excited H_2 1--0 S(1)\nline while [FeII] emission appears confined to the immediate vicinity of the\ncentral star.

The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively.

One technique\ncurrently used to bring Fermi gases in the degenerate regime is sympathetic\ncooling through a reservoir made of an ultracold Bose gas. We discuss a\nproposal for trapping and cooling of two-species Fermi-Bose mixtures into\noptical dipole traps made from combinations of laser beams having two different\nwavelengths. In these bichromatic traps it is possible, by a proper choice of\nthe relative laser powers, to selectively trap the two species in such a way\nthat fermions experience a stronger confinement than bosons. As a consequence,\na deep Fermi degeneracy can be reached having at the same time a softer\ndegenerate regime for the Bose gas.

Our approach enables reliable extraction of the pentaquark\nproperties from the sum rule with good stability in a remarkably wide Borel\nwindow. The appearance of its valid window originates from a favorable setup of\nthe correlation functions with the aid of it chirality of the interpolating\nfields on the analogy of the Weinberg sum rule for the vector currents. Our\nsetup leads to large suppression of the continuum contributions which have\nspoiled the Borel stability in the previous analyses, and consequently enhances\nimportance of the higher-dimensional contributions of the OPE, which are\nindispensable for investigating the pentaquark properties. Implementing the OPE\nanalysis up to dimension 15, we find that the sum rules for the chiral-even and\nodd parts independently give the Theta^{+} mass of 1.68 pm 0.22 GeV with\nuncertainties of the condensate values. Our sum rule indeed gives rather flat\nBorel curves almost independent of the continuum thresholds both for the mass\nand pole residue.

In the limit when fluctuations and couplings\nare small compared to the one-qubit energy spacing, the spectrum has a band\nstructure and we study the quantum computer core (central band) with the\nhighest density of states. Above a critical inter-qubit coupling strength,\nquantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of eigenstates in an\nisolated quantum computer. The onset of chaos results in the interaction\ninduced dynamical thermalization and the occupation numbers well described by\nthe Fermi-Dirac distribution.

Motivated by the importance\nof such systems in quantum computing, we show that typical pure states of N\nqubits are highly entangled but have decreasing amounts of pairwise\nentanglement (measured using the Wootter's concurrence formula) as N increases.\nAbove six qubits very few states have any pairwise entanglement, and generally,\nfor a typical pure state of N qubits there is a sharp cut-off where its\nsubsystems of size m become PPT (positive partial transpose i.e., separable or\nonly bound entangled) around N >~ 2m + 3, based on numerical analysis up to\nN=13. \n\n"}

A {\\bf 71}, 060312(R) (2005) the robustness of the local\nadiabatic quantum search to decoherence in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the\nsearch Hamiltonian was examined. We expand this analysis to include the case of\nthe global adiabatic quantum search. As in the case of the local search the\nasymptotic time complexity for the global search is the same as for the ideal\nclosed case, as long as the Hamiltonian dynamics is present. In the case of\npure decoherence, where the environment monitors the search Hamiltonian, we\nfind that the time complexity of the global quantum adiabatic search scales\nlike $N^{3/2}$, where $N$ is the list length. We moreover extend the analysis\nto include success probabilities $p<1$ and prove bounds on the run time with\nthe same scaling as in the conditions for the $p\\to 1$ limit.
