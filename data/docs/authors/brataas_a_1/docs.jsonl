This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines.

Despite this long history the\nunambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an\noutstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the\ncondensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe\nthat this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail\nexotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support\nMajorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices.

Very substantial role is played also by the carrier density $n_s$ that\nnaturally emerges as an integration constant of the GL equation. Physical\ninterpretation of the obtained results is based on the $n_s$-dependent\neffective potential $V_{eff}({\\bf r})$ created by the nonlinear term and its\ninfluence on the lowest eigenvalue of the corresponding Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. In particular, for the large cubicities, the temperature $T$ becomes\n$\\Lambda$ independent linearly decreasing function of the growing $\\beta$ since\nin this limit the boundary conditions can not alter very strong $V_{eff}$. It\nis shown that the temperature increase, which is produced in the linear GL\nregime by the negative de Gennes distance, is wiped out by the growing\ncubicity.

We discuss how the techniques of atomic physics can be used to explore\nnew regimes and manifestations of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC),\nwhich could not be accessed in solid state systems. We consider a system of\nimpurity atoms localized by a strong optical lattice potential and immersed in\na sea of itinerant Fermi atoms. Ramsey interference experiments with impurity\natoms probe OC in the time domain, while radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy\nprobes OC in the frequency domain. The OC in such systems is universal for all\ntimes and is determined by the impurity scattering length and Fermi wave vector\nof itinerant fermions. We calculate the universal Ramsey response and RF\nabsorption spectra. In addition to the standard power-law contribution, which\ncorresponds to the excitation of multiple particle-hole pairs near the Fermi\nsurface, we identify a novel contribution to OC that comes from exciting one\nextra particle from the bottom of the itinerant band. This gives rise to a\nnon-analytic feature in the RF absorption spectra, which evolves into a true\npower-law singularity with universal exponent 1/4 at the unitarity.\nFurthermore, we discuss the manifestations of OC in spin-echo experiments, as\nwell as in the energy counting statistic of the Fermi gas following a sudden\nquench of the impurity state. Finally, systems in which the itinerant fermions\nhave two or more hyperfine states provide an even richer playground for\nstudying non-equilibrium impurity physics, allowing one to explore\nnon-equilibrium OC and to simulate quantum transport through nano-structures.\nThis provides a useful connection between cold atomic systems and mesoscopic\nquantum transport. \n\n"}

This unexpected behavior can be understood as arising due to\na common path interference between two distinct tunneling solutions. The\nphenomenon is insensitive to magnetic field, and arises whenever the low energy\ndispersion relation contains higher order terms in addition to the usual $p^2$\nterm. Such higher order terms are generically present, albeit with small\nco-efficient, so that the oscillatory Zener tunneling is a universal\nphenomenon. However, the first `Zener oscillation' occurs at a transmission\nprobability which is exponentially small when the co-efficient of the higher\norder terms is small. This explains why this oscillatory aspect of Zener\ntunneling has been hitherto overlooked, despite its universality. The common\npath interference is also destroyed by the presence of odd powers of $p$ in the\nlow energy dispersion relation. Since odd powers of $p$ are strictly absent\nonly when the tunneling barrier lies along an axis of mirror symmetry, it\nfollows that the robustness of the oscillatory behavior depends on the\norientation of the tunneling barrier.

In one interpretation, the switching originates\nfrom carriers with spin-dependent scattering giving rise to a relativistic\nanti-damping spin-orbit torque (SOT) in structures with broken space-inversion\nsymmetry. The alternative interpretation combines the relativistic spin Hall\neffect (SHE), making the normal-conductor an injector of a spin-current, with\nthe non-relativistic spin-transfer torque (STT) in the ferromagnet. Remarkably,\nthe SHE in these experiments originates from the Berry phase effect in the band\nstructure of a clean crystal and the anti-damping STT is also based on a\ndisorder-independent transfer of spin from carriers to magnetization.

In the current work, we\ntheoretically study the relevance of Migdal's theorem in graphene and Weyl\nsemimetals which are examples of 2D and 3D Dirac materials, respectively, with\nlinear and chiral band dispersion. Our work also applies to 2D and 3D\ntopological insulator systems. In Fermi liquids, the renormalization of the\nelectron-phonon vertex scales as the ratio of sound ($v_s$) to Fermi ($v_F$)\nvelocity, which is typically a small quantity. In two- and three-dimensional\nquasirelativistic systems, such as undoped graphene and Weyl semimetals, the\none loop electron-phonon vertex renormalization, which also scales as\n$\\eta=v_s/v_F$ as $\\eta \\rightarrow 0$, is, however, enhanced by an ultraviolet\n\\emph{logarithmic divergent correction}, arising from the linear, chiral Dirac\nband dispersion. Such enhancement of the electron-phonon vertex can be\nsignificantly softened due to the logarithmic increment of the Fermi velocity,\narising from the long range Coulomb interaction, and therefore, the\nelectron-phonon vertex correction does not have a logarithmic divergence at low\nenergy. Otherwise, the Coulomb interaction does not lead to any additional\nrenormalization of the electron-phonon vertex. Therefore, electron-phonon\nvertex corrections in two- and three-dimensional Dirac fermionic systems scale\nas $v_s/v^0_F$, where $v^0_F$ is the bare Fermi velocity, and small when $v_s\n\\ll v^0_F$. These results, although explicitly derived for the intrinsic\nundoped systems, should hold even when the chemical potential is tuned away\nfrom the Dirac points. \n\n"}

The curved cavity system\nresolves the quandary of the conventional mechanical system where the\nBose-Einstein distribution requires higher frequencies for lower quantum\noccupation factors contrary to the constraint of an inverse frequency\ndependence of the quantum fluctuations of displacement. We demonstrate how the\nnon-trivial cavity geometry can lead to better phonon trapping, enhancing the\nvariance of zero-point-fluctuations of displacement.

However, the geometric topology of the studied samples is\nusually trivial, such as a ribbon or a cylinder. In this paper, we consider a\ngraphene M\\\"obius band irradiated with circularly polarised light.\nInterestingly, due to the non-orientability of the M\\\"obius band, a homogeneous\nquantum Hall effect cannot exist in this system, but the quantum spin Hall\neffect can.

One\nway to accomplish this is to use nanomagnetic `non-volatile' logic gates that\ncan perform Boolean operations and then store the output data in the\nmagnetization states of nanomagnets, thereby doubling as both logic and memory.\nUnfortunately, many proposed nanomagnetic gates do not possess the seven\nessential characteristics of a Boolean logic gate: concatenability,\nnon-linearity, isolation between input and output, gain, universal logic\nimplementation, scalability and error resilience. More importantly, their\nenergy-delay products and error-rates vastly exceed that of conventional\ntransistor-based logic gates, which is a drawback.

In the\npresence of an ac drive, the dynamics of a single spin acquires additional\nharmonics at frequencies determined by both, the drive frequency and the local\nfield.

In the\noverdamped limit, the skyrmion depins into a sliding state with a Hall angle of\nzero. When a Magnus term is included, the Hall angle is nonzero in the absence\nof a substrate. On a periodic substrate, the Hall angle varies with the drive\namplitude. Due to the substrate symmetry the Hall angle does not change\ncontinuously with drive, but forms a series of discrete steps at rational\nratios of the skyrmion velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the\ndrive direction, when the skyrmion motion locks to symmetry directions of the\nsubstrate for fixed intervals of the drive amplitude. On each step, the Hall\nangle is constant and the skyrmion motion is orderly. Transitions between\nlocked phases generate pronounced cusps in the velocity-force curves, as well\nas regions of negative differential mobility. The number of observable locking\nsteps increases when the relative strength of the Magnus term increases. We\nfind an overshoot phenomena where the Hall angle exceeds the clean limit value,\nas well as an acceleration effect where the skyrmion moves faster over a\nsubstrate than through a clean sample. These effects are robust for different\ntypes of periodic substrates. With a simple model for a skyrmion interacting\nwith a single pin, we can capture the behavior of the Hall angle. The Magnus\nterm induces a curvature in the skrymion orbit as it moves through the pin,\nresulting in a side step phenomenon that decreases with increasing drive. When\nthe Magnus term is large, the range of impact parameters that permit the\nskyrmion to be trapped by the pin is small, which is a reasons that strong\nMagnus force effects reduce the pinning in skyrmion systems. \n\n"}

The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from\nany reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement.\nThe combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge transfer\nbetween the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling. Resonance is\ncontrolled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS energy\nsplitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter\nsplitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite\nvalue by gate-driven shortening of the topological wire. Simulations show that\nthe oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to\nreadout, but requires precise gate control of the MBS spatial position and dot\npotential.

We consider the\nsimplest possible non-trivial system: a linear polymer of three of discs\nconstrained to remain in contact, and immersed in an equilibrium heat bath so\nthe internal angle of the polymer changes due to stochastic fluctuations. We\ncompare two cases: one where the discs can slide relative to each other, and\nthe other where they are constrained to roll, like gears. Starting from the\nLangevin equations with arbitrary linear velocity constraints, we use formal\nhomogenization theory to derive the overdamped equations that describe the\nprocess in configuration space only. The resulting dynamics have the formal\nstructure of a Brownian motion on a Riemannian or sub-Riemannian manifold,\ndepending on if the velocity constraints are holonomic or non-holonomic.

In the conductance between the two\nN contacts we find a characteristic pattern of positive and negative\ndifferential subgap conductance, which we explain by considering two nonlocal\nprocesses, the creation of Cooper pairs in S by electrons from both N\nterminals, and a novel mechanism called resonant ABS tunneling.

Instead of local order\nparameters, topological phases are described by global topological invariants\nand are therefore robust against perturbations. A prominent example thereof is\nthe two-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect. It is characterized by the\nfirst Chern number which manifests in the quantized Hall response induced by an\nexternal electric field. Generalizing the quantum Hall effect to\nfour-dimensional systems leads to the appearance of a novel non-linear Hall\nresponse that is quantized as well, but described by a 4D topological invariant\n- the second Chern number. Here, we report on the first observation of a bulk\nresponse with intrinsic 4D topology and the measurement of the associated\nsecond Chern number. By implementing a 2D topological charge pump with\nultracold bosonic atoms in an angled optical superlattice, we realize a\ndynamical version of the 4D integer quantum Hall effect.

Although electric dipoles are highly attractive\nto couple spin qubits electrically over long distances, mechanisms identified\nto control two-qubit couplings do not permit single-qubit operations while\ntwo-qubit couplings are off. Here we identify a mechanism to modulate\nelectrical coupling of spin qubits that overcomes this drawback for hole spin\nqubits in acceptors,that is based on the electrical tuning of the direction of\nthe spin-dependent electric dipole by a gate. In this way, inter-qubit coupling\ncan be turned off electrically by tuning to a \"magic angle\" of vanishing\nelectric dipole-dipole interactions, while retaining the ability to manipulate\nthe individual qubits.

This is\naccomplished by deriving analytic asymptotic expressions for $T_{c}$ and\n$\\partial T_{c}/\\partial\\tau^{-1}$ in a two-dimensional two-band system. When\nthe inter-band pairing interaction is repulsive, we find that, despite the\nincipient nature of the band crossing the Fermi level, inter-band impurity\nscattering is extremely effective in breaking Cooper pairs, making $\\partial\nT_{c}/\\partial\\tau^{-1}$ quickly approach the limiting Abrikosov-Gor'kov value\nof the high-density regime.

We start by testing the accuracy of the RG approach in the\nabsence of inhomogeneities, and infer the correlation length exponent nu=2.39\nfrom a broad conductance distribution. We then incorporate macroscopic\ninhomogeneities into the RG procedure. Inhomogeneities are modeled by a smooth\nrandom potential with a correlator which falls off with distance as a power\nlaw, r^{-alpha}. Similar to the classical percolation, we observe an\nenhancement of nu with decreasing alpha. Although the attainable system sizes\nare large, they do not allow one to unambiguously identify a cusp in the\nnu(alpha) dependence at alpha_c=2/nu, as might be expected from the extended\nHarris criterion.

Because the Hamiltonian\ncontains no spin-flip terms, the six- dimension singlet state and\nnine-dimensional triplet state sub-spaces are decoupled and can be discussed\nrespectively. In particular, the nine-dimensional triplet state sub-spaces can\nalso be divided into 3 three-dimensional state sub-spaces which are fully\ndecoupled. The analysis shows that the Hamiltonian in each three-dimensional\ntriplet state sub-space, as well as the singlet state sub-space for the no\ndouble-occupancy case, has the same form similar to that of the driven two\nelectrons in two-quantum-dot molecule. Through solving the time-dependent\nSch\\\"odinger equation, we investigate the dynamical properties in the singlet\nstate sub-space, and find that the two electrons can maintain their initial\nlocalized state driven by an appropriately ac-field.

We identified the clapping mode and study\nits effects on the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities in the\nsuperconducting state. In contrast to the case of $^3$He, there is no resonance\nabsorption associated with the collective mode, since in metals $\\omega/(v_F\n|{\\bf q}|) \\ll 1$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity, {\\bf q} is the wave\nvector, and $\\omega$ is the frequency of the sound wave. However, the velocity\nchange in the collisionless limit gets modified by the contribution from the\ncoupling to the clapping mode. We compute this contribution and comment on the\nvisibility of the effect. In the diffusive limit, the contribution from the\ncollective mode turns out to be negligible. The behaviors of the sound velocity\nchange and the attenuation coefficient near $T_c$ in the diffusive limit are\ncalculated and compared with the existing experimental data wherever it is\npossible. We also present the results for the attenuation coefficients in both\nof the collisionless and diffusive limits at finite temperatures. \n\n"}
