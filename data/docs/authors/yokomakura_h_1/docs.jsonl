We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS\n(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include\ndust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare\nremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect\nagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust\nattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for\ngalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated\nwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple\nprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar\nmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and\nfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct\nstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming\nand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie\non a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong\nAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,\nwhile also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of\nquiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies\nthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)\ngalaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha\nemission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at\nz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged). \n\n"}

Starting from a\ngeneral parameterisation of the perturbed spacetime a la Bardeen, a complete\nset of gauge invariant variables is constructed. Three physical degrees of\nfreedom are identified and it is shown that, in the case where matter is\ndescribed by a scalar field, they generalize the Mukhanov-Sasaki variables. In\norder to show that they are canonical variables, the action for the\ncosmological perturbations at second order is derived. Two major physical\nimprints of the primordial anisotropy are identified: (1) a scalar-tensor\n``see-saw'' mechanism arising from the fact that scalar, vector and tensor\nmodes do not decouple and (2) an explicit dependence of the statistical\nproperties of the density perturbations and gravity waves on the wave-vector\ninstead of its norm. This analysis extends, but also sheds some light on, the\nquantization procedure that was developed under the assumption of a\nFriedmann-Lemaitre background spacetime, and allows to investigate the\nrobustness of the predictions of the standard inflationary scenario with\nrespect to the hypothesis on the symmetries of the background spacetime.

However finding old dwarf galaxies with a confirmed tidal origin is\nan observational challenge.

The key idea is that in models with large extra dimensions the strength of\ngravity in the bulk can be higher than on the brane where we live. A well-known\nexample of this situation is the case of warped extra dimensions. Even if the\nenergy of the collision is not sufficient to create a black hole on the brane,\nit may be enough to produce a particle which accelerates into the bulk up to\ntrans-Planckian energy and creates a large black hole there. In a concrete\nmodel we consider, the black hole is formed in a collision of the particle with\nits own image at an orbifold plane. When the particle in question carries some\nStandard Model gauge charges the created black hole gets attached to our brane\nby a string of the gauge flux.

Then we use the assumption that the mass eigen-components\ntravel at equal velocity to derive the energy-momentum square difference (EMSD)\n$E_{\\alpha}^2-p_{\\alpha}^2$ for the flavor eigenstate. It is shown that for the\nequal velocity assumption, $E_{\\alpha}^2-p_{\\alpha}^2$ will be a fixed constant\nin events with different $E_{\\alpha}$ and/or $p_{\\alpha}$. In contrast, for the\nequal energy or equal momentum assumption, $E_{\\alpha}^2-p_{\\alpha}^2$ will\nvary with $E_{\\alpha}$ or $p_{\\alpha}$ respectively. These EMSD can be checked\nby ongoing and future neutrino experiments.

Provided some physics for the absolute normalisation,\nthe creation of the scaling relations can be fully explained by the\nhierarchical assembly of black hole and stellar mass through galaxy merging,\nfrom an initially uncorrelated distribution of BH and stellar masses in the\nearly Universe. We show this with a suite of dark matter halo merger trees for\nwhich we make assumptions about (uncorrelated) black hole and stellar mass\nvalues at early cosmic times.

Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and\ndisplaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light\ncurves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the\ntime lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical\nformalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the\nproblems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated\nerrors, and seasonal gaps.

This\nperiod is in exact 5:3 resonance with the orbit of KOI-13.01, which is the\nfirst detection of a spin-orbit resonance in a host of a substellar companion.\nThe stellar rotation leads to stellar oblateness, which is expected to cause\nsecular variations in the orbital elements.

However, this\nsimple point of view ignores possible effects from competing hadronic channels\nand the opening of the corresponding thresholds.

Also the latter description is much too naive, since\nconsiderable mass shifts or even the dynamical generation of extra states due\nto unquenching are equally ignored.\n  In the present paper, a largely empirical yet very successful approach to\nmeson spectroscopy is revisited, in which all the above phenomena can be\naccounted for non-perturbatively, with concrete examples of some enigmatic\nmesonic states described in detail. First, the X(4260) charmonium enhancement\nis argued to be a non-resonant structure resulting from depletion effects due\nto competing channels and resonances.

The\ndirection of the estimated proper motion coincides with the extension of the\npulsar's X-ray tail, suggesting that this is a jet.

If the absence of pulsations is interpreted as evidence for the\nemitting surface area being the entire neutron star surface, the assumption of\nthe measured flux being due to a blackbody emission translates into a source\ndistance that is inconsistent with current estimates of the remnant's distance.\nAims: With the best available observational data, we extended the pulse period\nsearch down to a sub-millisecond time scale and used a carbon atmosphere model\nto describe the X-ray spectrum of the CCO and to estimate geometrical\nparameters of the neutron star.

In the one-bubble open\ninflationary scenario that naturally predicts a negative spatial curvature\nafter a quantum tunneling, it is known that a light scalar field has the\nso-called supercurvature mode, i.e. an additional discrete mode which describes\nfluctuations over scales larger than the spatial curvature scale. If such\nsupercurvature modes exist for a vector field with a sufficiently light mass,\nthen they would decay slower and easily survive the inflationary era. However,\nthe existence of supercurvature mode strongly depends on details of the system.\nTo clarify whether a massive vector field has supercurvature modes, we consider\na U(1) gauge field with gauge and conformal invariances spontaneously broken\nthrough the Higgs mechanism, and present explicit expressions for the Euclidean\nvacuum mode functions. We find that, for any values of the vector field mass,\nthere is no supercurvature mode.

Estimating the rate of false positives of the overall\nKepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. We present the\nresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with the\nSpitzer telescope during the the Kepler mission.

We select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges in\nstellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transits\nwith Spitzer at 4.5 microns. We use these observations to measures the\ncandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. A bandpass-dependent depth\nalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source\nof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. For most of the candidates\n(85%), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the depths\nmeasured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the\nmost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that\ndilute the photometry.

We demonstrate that it is feasible\nto analyze the high-quality data within a coupled-channel framework that\ndescribes the final state interaction of D+-> K-pi+pi+ as multiple\nrescatterings of three pseudoscalar mesons through two-pseudoscalar-meson\ninteractions in accordance with the two-body and three-body unitarity. The\ntwo-pseudoscalar-meson interactions are designed to reproduce empirical pi pi\nand pi bar K scattering amplitudes. Furthermore, we also include mechanisms\nthat are beyond simple iterations of the two-body interactions, i.e., a\nthree-meson force, derived from the hidden local symmetry model. A picture of\nhadronic dynamics in D+-> K-pi+pi+ described by our coupled-channel model is\nfound to be quite different from those of the previous isobar-type analyses.\nFor example, we find that the D+-> K-pi+pi+ decay width can get almost\ntriplicated when the rescattering mechanisms are turned on. Among the\nrescattering mechanisms, those associated with the rho(770) bar K0 channel,\nwhich contribute to D+-> K-pi+pi+ only through a channel coupling, give a large\ncontribution, and significantly improve the quality of the fits.

For off-axis viewing angles $\\theta_{\\rm\nview} \\gtrsim \\theta_{\\rm jet} + \\Gamma^{-1}$, the pulse broadening\nsignificantly smears out the light curve variability. This is largely\nindependent of geometry and emission processes. To explore a specific case, we\nset up a simple model of a single pulse under the assumption that the pulse\nrise and decay are dominated by the shell curvature effect. We show that such a\npulse observed off-axis is (i) broader, (ii) softer and (iii) displays a\ndifferent hardness-intensity correlation with respect to the same pulse seen\non-axis. For each of these effects, we provide an intuitive physical\nexplanation. We then show how a synthetic light curve made by a superposition\nof pulses changes with increasing viewing angle. We find that a highly variable\nlight curve, (as seen on-axis) becomes smooth and apparently single-pulsed\n(when seen off-axis) because of pulse overlap.

The dimesionless fundamental constants, such as the proton\nto electron mass ratio and the fine structure constant are key elements in the\ninvestigation.

Limits on their variance, on the other\nhand, constrains the parameter space available to new physics that requires a\nvariation with time of basic physical law. There are now observational\nconstraints on the time variation of the proton to electron mass ratio mu at\nthe 1.E-7 level.

Testing if a particular parameter set of such a model is\nexcluded by LHC data is a challenge: It requires the time consuming generation\nof scattering events, the simulation of the detector response, the event\nreconstruction, cross section calculations and analysis code to test against\nseveral hundred signal regions defined by the ATLAS and CMS experiment. In the\nBSM-AI project we attack this challenge with a new approach. Machine learning\ntools are thought to predict within a fraction of a millisecond if a model is\nexcluded or not directly from the model parameters. A first example is SUSY-AI,\ntrained on the phenomenological supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM). About\n300,000 pMSSM model sets - each tested with 200 signal regions by ATLAS - have\nbeen used to train and validate SUSY-AI. The code is currently able to\nreproduce the ATLAS exclusion regions in 19 dimensions with an accuracy of at\nleast 93 percent. It has been validated further within the constrained MSSM and\na minimal natural supersymmetric model, again showing high accuracy.

This\ndetermination relies on the calculation of deep-inelastic structure functions\nin the FONLL scheme, generalized to account for massive charm-initiated\ncontributions. In contrast to the usual situation in which the charm PDF is\nassumed to be generated perturbatively by pair radiation off gluons and light\nquarks, vanishing at a scale set by the value of the charm mass m_c, we find\nthat the fitted charm PDF vanishes within uncertainties at a scale Q~1.5 GeV\nfor all x<~0.1, independent of the value of m_c used in the coefficient\nfunctions. We also find some evidence that the charm PDF at large x>~0.1 and\nlow scales does not vanish, but rather has an \"intrinsic\" component, very\nweakly scale dependent and almost independent of the value of m_c, carrying\nabout 1% of the total momentum of the proton. The uncertainties in all other\nPDFs are only slightly increased by the inclusion of fitted charm, while the\ndependence of these PDFs on m_c is significantly reduced. When the EMC charm\nstructure function dataset is included, it is well described by the fit, and\nPDF uncertainties in the fitted charm PDF are significantly reduced, though we\nverify that excluding the EMC data does not qualitatively modify any of our\nfindings. The increased stability with respect to m_c persists at high scales\nand is the main implication of our results for LHC phenomenology. Fitting the\ncharm PDF modifies the predictions for processes such as high p_T and large\nrapidity charm pair production and Z+c production, and thus we expect that\nfuture LHC data will further constrain the charm content of the proton. \n\n"}

We find that disk winds are the dominant feedback mechanism setting star\nformation efficiencies (SFEs) from initial cores of ~0.3-0.5. However,\nradiation pressure is also significant to widen the outflow cavity causing\nreductions of SFE compared to the disk-wind only case, especially for >100Msun\nstar formation at clump mass surface densities Sigma<0.3g/cm2. Photoevaporation\nis of relatively minor importance due to dust attenuation of ionizing photons.\nStellar winds have even smaller effects during the accretion stage. For core\nmasses Mc~10-1000Msun and Sigma~0.1-3g/cm2, we find the overall SFE to be\n0.31(Rc/0.1pc)^{-0.39}, potentially a useful sub-grid star-formation model in\nsimulations that can resolve pre-stellar core radii,\nRc=0.057(Mc/60Msun)^{1/2}(Sigma/g/cm2)^{-1/2}pc. The decline of SFE with Mc is\ngradual with no evidence for a maximum stellar-mass set by feedback processes\nup to stellar masses of ~300Msun. We thus conclude that the observed truncation\nof the high-mass end of the IMF is shaped mostly by the pre-stellar core mass\nfunction or internal stellar processes. To form massive stars with the observed\nmaximum masses of ~150-300Msun, initial core masses need to be >500-1000Msun.\nWe also apply our feedback model to zero-metallicity primordial star formation,\nshowing that, in the absence of dust, photoevaporation staunches accretion at\n~50Msun.

At\nz~1, we find 37 pairs with R_perp<2 pMpc and Delta V<2300 km s^{-1} in the\ncurrent HSC-Wide coverage, including four from Hennawi et al. (2006). The\ndistribution of the peak overdensity significance within two arcminutes around\nthe pairs has a long tail toward high density (>4sigma) regions. Thanks to the\nlarge sample size, we find a statistical evidence that this excess is unique to\nthe pair environments when compared to single quasar and randomly selected\ngalaxy environments at the same redshift range. Moreover, there are nine\nsmall-scale (R_perp<1 pMpc) pairs, two of which are found to reside in cluster\nfields. Our results demonstrate that <2 pMpc-scale quasar pairs at both\nredshift range tend to occur in massive haloes, although perhaps not the most\nmassive ones, and that they are useful to search for rare density peaks. \n\n"}

Even if future experiments\nlower their energy thresholds, they will still be blind to parameter space\nwhere dark matter particles interact with nuclei strongly enough that they lose\nenough energy and become unable to cause a signal above the experimental\nthreshold by the time they reach the underground detector. Therefore in case\ndark matter is in the sub-GeV region and strongly interacting, possible\nunderground scatterings of dark matter with terrestrial nuclei must be taken\ninto account because they affect significantly the recoil spectra and event\nrates, regardless of whether the experiment probes DM via DM-nucleus or\nDM-electron interaction.

It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

Moreover we\ndemonstrate that the basic properties of these hosts are indistinguishable from\nthose of quiescent, evolved, low-redshift ellipticals of comparable mass. This\nresult kills any lingering notion that radio-loudness is determined by\nhost-galaxy morphology, and also sets severe constraints on evolutionary\nschemes which attempt to link low-z ULIRGs with RQQs. Instead, we show that our\nresults are as expected given the relationship between black-hole and spheroid\nmass established for nearby galaxies, and apply this relation to estimate the\nmass of the black hole in each object. The results agree very well with\ncompletely-independent estimates based on nuclear emission-line widths; all the\nquasars in our sample have M(bh) > 5 x 10^8 solar masses, while the radio-loud\nobjects are confined to M(bh) > 10^9 solar masses. This apparent mass-threshold\ndifference, which provides a natural explanation for why RQQs outnumber RLQs by\na factor of 10, appears to reflect the existence of a minimum and maximum level\nof black-hole radio output which is a strong function of black-hole mass.\nFinally, we use our results to estimate the fraction of massive\nspheroids/black-holes which produce quasar-level activity. This fraction is\n\\~0.1% at the present day, rising to > 10% at z = 2-3. \n\n"}

If confirmed, their existence places constraints on the rate of\nformation of microscopic black holes in models which invoke a TeV-scale Planck\nmass. In such models, black holes can form with ~TeV masses through nuclear\ninteractions of particles with PeV and greater energies. Once formed, these\nblack hole states are unstable to Hawking radiation, and rapidly decay.\nHowever, if such a black hole forms in the interior of a strange star, the\ndensity is high enough that the decay may be counterbalanced by accretion, and\nthe black hole can grow, leading to subsequent catastropic collapse of the\nstar. A guaranteed source of ultra-high energy particles is provided by the\ncosmogenic Greisen neutrinos, as well as by ultra-high energy cosmic rays, and\nthe implied lifetimes for strange stars are extremely short, contrary to\nobservations. The observed lifetimes of strange star candidates thus\neffectively exclude Planck mass scales of less than ~2 TeV with comparable\nblack hole masses, for up to 2 extra dimensions.

They can do so because the existence of density gradients\nallows g-modes to resonantly excite Alfven waves, causing mode energy to be\nfunnelled along magnetic field lines, away from the solar equatorial plane. The\nresulting wave forms show comparatively sharp spikes in the density profile at\nradii where these resonances take place.

Giant elliptical galaxies show mostly a bimodal color\ndistribution of globular clusters, indicating a factor of $\\approx 20$\nmetallicity difference between the two peaks.

This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo\nmasses which does not have a small-scale cut-off.\n  In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process\naffects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the\nevolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers\nof smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the\nmergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and\noccurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity:\nthese voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around\nthem. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales.\n  In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution\nof the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects\nwhich are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks\ncrossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution\nrequires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for\nvoids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds.

A detailed code is necessary to model grains in a photo-ionized\nmedium. In this paper we will use the spectral synthesis code Cloudy for this\npurpose. The grain model of this code has recently undergone a comprehensive\nupgrade. Part of this is the newly developed hybrid grain charge model, which\nwill be described in detail. This model allows discrete charge states of very\nsmall grains to be modelled accurately while simultaneously avoiding the\noverhead of fully resolving the charge distribution of large grains, thus\nmaking the model both accurate and computationally efficient.

To obtain increasing\ntemperatures and line ratios away from the midplane, our photoionization\nsimulations of a multi-component interstellar medium do not require as much\nadditional heating (over and above that from photoionization) as previous\nstudies that employed one dimensional, spherically averaged models.\n  Radiation leaking into the DIG from density bounded H II regions is generally\nharder in the H-ionizing continuum and has its He-ionizing photons suppressed\ncompared to the ionizing source of the H II region.

Abstract: We examine whether the annual modulation found by the DAMA dark matter\nexperiment can be explained by Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), in\nlight of new null results from other experiments. CDMS II has already ruled out\nmost WIMP-nucleus spin-independent couplings as an explanation for DAMA data.\nHence we here focus on spin-dependent (axial vector; SD) couplings of WIMPs to\nnuclei. We expand upon previous work by (i) considering the general case of\ncoupling to both protons and neutrons and (ii) incorporating bounds from all\nexisting experiments. We note the surprising fact that CMDS II places one of\nthe strongest bounds on the WIMP-neutron cross-section, and show that SD\nWIMP-neutron scattering alone is excluded.

Tau-neutrino decays influence primordial nucleosynthesis in three\ndistinct ways: (i) the energy density of the decaying tau neutrino and its\ndaughter products affect the expansion rate tending to increase $^4$He, D, and\n$^3$He production; (ii) electromagnetic (EM) decay products heat the EM plasma\nand dilute the baryon-to-photon ratio tending to decrease $^4$He production and\nincrease D and $^3$He production; and (iii) electron neutrinos and\nantineutrinos produced by tau-neutrino decays increase the weak rates that\ngovern the neutron-to-proton ratio, leading to decreased $^4$He production for\nshort lifetimes ($\\la 30\\sec$) and masses less than about $10\\MeV$ and\nincreased $^4$He production for long lifetimes or large masses.

We calculate formation and merging\nhistories, and the evolution in colour, luminosity and morphology of the galaxy\npopulations in different environments. Roughly $ 50\\ %$ of ellipticals in our\nmodel have undergone a major merger since $z = 0.5$, yet in spite of this we\nfind that cluster ellipticals have colour-magnitude diagrams with remarkably\nsmall scatter. The morphological mix of galaxies that become rich cluster\nmembers at high redshift is dominated by spiral galaxies, due to the long\ntimescale for galaxy mergers compared with the timescale for cluster assembly\nat high redshift. The assembly of low redshift clusters is slower, allowing\nmore galaxy mergers to occur in the progenitor halos.

Our treatment of\nthe inverse Compton (IC) scattering includes the effect of anisotropic\nscattering in the Galactic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a new\nevaluation of the ISRF itself. Models based on locally measured electron and\nnucleon spectra and synchrotron constraints are consistent with gamma-ray\nmeasurements in the 30-500 MeV range, but outside this range excesses are\napparent. A harder nucleon spectrum is considered but fitting to gamma rays\ncauses it to violate limits from positrons and antiprotons.

Mostafazadeh\nand F. Zamani in December, 2003, and February, 2006 (quant-ph/0312078,\nquant-ph/0602151, quant-ph/0602161). It is explicitly shown that the positive\nsemi-definite norm associated with the derived inner product for real KG fields\nmeasures the number of active positive and negative energy Fourier modes of the\nreal KG field on the relativistic mass shell. The very existence of an inner\nproduct with positive semi-definite norm for the considered real, i.e. neutral,\nKG fields shows that the metric operator entering the inner product does not\ncontain the charge-conjugation operator. This observation sheds some additional\nlight on the meaning of the C operator in the CPT inner product of PT-symmetric\nQuantum Mechanics defined by C.M. Bender, D.C. Brody and H.F. Jones. \n\n"}
