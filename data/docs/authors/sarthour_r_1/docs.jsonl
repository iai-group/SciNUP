We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks. \n\n"}

The aim of the present\npaper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit \"polar\" codes that are\ncapacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon\nobserved by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is\nan effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by \"channel combining\"\nand \"channel splitting,\" in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are\nperfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely useless\nfor data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the\nchannel. The channel polarization effect then leads to a simple scheme for data\ntransmission: send the information bits through the perfect channels and\n\"frozen\" bits through the useless ones. The main technical contributions of the\npresent paper are threefold.

In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the ground state\nRiemannian geometry induced by the metric tensor, using the quantum XY chain in\na transverse field as our primary example.

In this model, we use the reduced\nhierarchy equations of motion in the Wigner space representation. These\nequations represent a generalization of the Gaussian-Markovian quantum\nFokker-Planck equation introduced by Tanimura and Wolynes (1991), which was\nformulated to study non-Markovian and non-perturbative thermal effects at\nfinite temperature. This formalism allows us to treat both the classical limit\nand the tunneling regimes, and it is helpful for identifying purely quantum\nmechanical effects through the time evolution of the Wigner distribution. We\ncarried out extensive calculations of the classical and quantum currents for\nvarious temperatures, coupling strengths, and barrier heights. Our results\nreveal that at low temperature, while the quantum current is larger than the\nclassical current in the case of a high barrier, the opposite is true in the\ncase of a low barrier. We find that this behavior results from the fact that\nthe tunneling enhances the current in the case of a high barrier, while it\nsuppresses the current in the case of a low barrier. This is because the effect\nof the ratchet potential is weak in the case of a low barrier, due to the large\ndispersion of the distribution introduced by tunneling. This causes the\nspatio-temporal asymmetry, which is necessary for ratchet current, to be weak,\nand as a result, the net current is suppressed. \n\n"}

This surprising result occurs because the decay results in crossing of\nthe two eigenvalues of the instantaneous non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. On the\nother hand, if $|\\veps_1(\\pm T)-\\veps_2(\\pm T)| \\to \\infty$ as $T \\to \\infty$,\nthe probability is {\\em independent} of the decay rate.

We consider this question by comparing two\nimplementations of a detection-loophole-free Bell test. In particular, we study\nin detail a scenario where a heralded single photon source (HSPS) is used to\nherald path-entangled states, i.e. entanglement between two spatial modes\nsharing a single photon and where non-locality is revealed using photon\ncounting preceded by small displacement operations. We start by giving a\ntheoretical description of such a measurement. We then show how to optimize the\nBell-CHSH violation through a non-perturbative calculation, taking the main\nexperimental imperfections into account. We finally bound the amount of\nrandomness that can be extracted and compare it to the one obtained with the\nconventional scenario using photon pairs entangled e.g. in polarization and\nanalyzed through photon counting. While the former requires higher overall\ndetection efficiencies, it is far more efficient in terms of both the entropy\nper experimental run and the rate of random bit generation. \n\n"}

{"id": "1511.01072", "contents": "Title: Can quantum transition state theory be defined as an exact t=0+ limit? Abstract: The definition of the classical transition state theory (TST) as a t= 0+\nlimit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that\nsimultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical\nprocess. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. 138,\n084108 (2013)] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact\nt=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and\nthat it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory. It is shown that the t=0+ limit of the new rate expression\nvanishes in the exact quantum limit. \n\n"}

To do this,\nwe focus on two classes of measurements: (i) coarse-grained observables, such\nas the number of particles in a region of space, and (ii) few-mode\nmeasurements, such as phase correlators and correlation functions.

So far, this approach has been applied to\nclassical and quantum systems. Here we extend it to arbitrary physical\ntheories, proposing two requirements for the development of a general\nmicrocanonical framework. We then formulate three resource theories,\ncorresponding to three different sets of basic operations: i) random reversible\noperations, resulting from reversible dynamics with fluctuating parameters, ii)\nnoisy operations, generated by the interaction with ancillas in the\nmicrocanonical state, and iii) unital operations, defined as the operations\nthat preserve the microcanonical state. We focus our attention on a class of\nphysical theories, called sharp theories with purification, where these three\nsets of operations exhibit remarkable properties. Firstly, each set is\ncontained into the next. Secondly, the convertibility of states by unital\noperations is completely characterised by a majorisation criterion. Thirdly,\nthe three sets are equivalent in terms of state convertibility if and only if\nthe dynamics allowed by theory satisfy a suitable condition, which we call\nunrestricted reversibility. Under this condition, we derive a duality between\nthe resource theory of microcanonical thermodynamics and the resource theory of\npure bipartite entanglement. \n\n"}

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance.

We show\nthat these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic\nstructures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such\nstates. We find that selectively radiant states allow for a photon storage\nerror that scales exponentially better with number of atoms than previously\nknown bounds. \n\n"}

This was due to technological\nprogress, and for light in particular, the development of the laser. Hitherto,\nnearly all experiments and also nearly all realizations in the fields have been\nperformed with qubits, which are two-level quantum systems. We suggest that\nthis limitation is again mainly a technological one, because it is very\ndifficult to create, manipulate and measure more complex quantum systems. Here,\nwe provide a specific overview of some recent developments with\nhigher-dimensional quantum systems. We mainly focus on Orbital Angular Momentum\n(OAM) states of photons and possible applications in quantum information\nprotocols. Such states form discrete higher-dimensional quantum systems, also\ncalled qudits. Specifically, we will first address the question what kind of\nnew fundamental properties exist and the quantum information applications which\nare opened up by such novel systems. Then we give an overview of recent\ndevelopments in the field by discussing several notable experiments over the\npast 2-3 years. Finally, we conclude with several important open questions\nwhich will be interesting for investigations in the future. \n\n"}

In this setting, a quantum channel connects a sender to a\nreceiver, and their goal is to distill either a secret key or entanglement,\nalong with the help of arbitrary local operations and classical communication\n(LOCC). In this work, we establish a general theory of energy-constrained,\nLOCC-assisted private and quantum capacities of quantum channels, which are the\nmaximum rates at which an LOCC-assisted quantum channel can reliably establish\nsecret key or entanglement, respectively, subject to an energy constraint on\nthe channel input states. We prove that the energy-constrained squashed\nentanglement of a channel is an upper bound on these capacities. We also\nexplicitly prove that a thermal state maximizes a relaxation of the squashed\nentanglement of all phase-insensitive, single-mode input bosonic Gaussian\nchannels, generalizing results from prior work. After doing so, we prove that a\nvariation of the method introduced in [Goodenough et al., New J.

We study the time\nevolution of the quantum correlations under those protocols in two different\nlimits of the mass quench; fast limit and slow limit depending on the speed\nwith which the mass is changed.

We\nfirst identify that the conventional DQW can't exactly simulate Dirac Cellular\nAutomaton (DCA), a discretized theory of free Dirac Hamiltonian (DH). We found\nsome choice of coin parameters of the split-step (SS) DQW, a generalization of\nDQW can fully simulate single-particle DCA. Next we question whether the same\nSS-DQW can simulate dynamics of free Dirac particle with extra degrees of\nfreedom like colors, flavors besides the spin or chirality. One such example is\nNeutrino oscillation. By moving from the U(2) coined SS-DQW to the U(6) coined\nSS-DQW we have simulated the exact probability profile of Neutrino flavor\ntransitions. We further probe towards simulating single particle massive DH in\npresence of background potentials and space-time curvature.

{"id": "quant-ph/0506082", "contents": "Title: Between classical and quantum Abstract: The relationship between classical and quantum theory is of central\nimportance to the philosophy of physics, and any interpretation of quantum\nmechanics has to clarify it. Our discussion of this relationship is partly\nhistorical and conceptual, but mostly technical and mathematically rigorous,\nincluding over 500 references. On the assumption that quantum mechanics is\nuniversal and complete, we discuss three ways in which classical physics has so\nfar been believed to emerge from quantum physics, namely in the limit h -> 0 of\nsmall Planck's constant (in a finite system), in the limit of a large system,\nand through decoherence and consistent histores. The first limit is closely\nrelated to modern quantization theory and microlocal analysis, whereas the\nsecond involves methods of C*-algebras and the concepts of superselection\nsectors and macroscopic observables. In these limits, the classical world does\nnot emerge as a sharply defined objective reality, but rather as an approximate\nappearance relative to certain \"classical\" states and observables. Decoherence\nsubsequently clarifies the role of such states, in that they are \"einselected\",\ni.e. robust against coupling to the environment. Furthermore, the nature of\nclassical observables is elucidated by the fact that they typically define\n(approximately) consistent sets of histories. We make the point that\nclassicality results from the elimination of certain states and observables\nfrom quantum theory. Thus the classical world is not created by observation (as\nHeisenberg once claimed), but rather by the lack of it. \n\n"}

It is concluded that collapse of state\nis the only possible way of evolution of physical systems in this case. \n\n"}

Phase diagrams are\nmapped out for various values of the physical parameters. At sufficiently large\nvalues of the detuning, we find a ``twinkling'' mode of the micromaser system.\nA correlation length is used to study fluctuations close to the various phase\ntransitions. \n\n"}

Abstract: Highly excited many-particle states in quantum systems (nuclei, atoms,\nquantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers) can be ``chaotic''\nsuperpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants, products of\nspin or qubit states). This is a result of the very high energy level density\nof many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between\nparticles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A\ntime scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is\nthe qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1. At t <<\nt_c the entropy is small: S= n t^2 J^2 log_2(1/t^2 J^2), where J is the\ninter-qubit interaction strength. At t > t_c the number of ``wrong'' states\nincreases exponentially as 2^{S(t)} . Therefore, t_c may be interpreted as a\nmaximal time for operation of a quantum computer, since at t > t_c one has to\nstruggle against the second law of thermodynamics. At t >>t_c the system\nentropy approaches that for chaotic eigenstates. \n\n"}

It is shown\nthat the standard SU(1,1) and SU(2) coherent states are the unique states which\nminimize the second order characteristic inequality for the three generators. A\nset of states which minimize the Schroedinger inequality for the Hermitian\ncomponents of the su_q(1,1) ladder operator is also constructed.
