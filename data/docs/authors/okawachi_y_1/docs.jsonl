In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking\nin the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.\nThis formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical\nproblems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the\npermeability of the {\\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked\nobjects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\nthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\nself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\nequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the\ncoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the\nscattering operator is the identity.

We analyze the resolution of the image\nof a line source radiating in the Maxwell fisheye and the Veselago-Pendry slab\nlens. The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2. The latter is described by a homogeneous,\nbut negative, refractive index. It has been suggested that the fisheye makes a\nperfect lens without negative refraction [Leonhardt, Philbin\narxiv:0805.4778v2]. However, we point out that the definition of\nsuper-resolution in such a heterogeneous medium should be computed with respect\nto the wavelength in a homogenized medium, and it is perhaps more adequate to\ntalk about a conjugate image rather than a perfect image (the former does not\nnecessarily contains the evanescent components of the source). We numerically\nfind that both the Maxwell fisheye and a thick silver slab lens lead to a\nresolution close to lambda/3 in transverse magnetic polarization (electric\nfield pointing orthogonal to the plane). We note a shift of the image plane in\nthe latter lens. We also observe that two sources lead to multiple secondary\nimages in the former lens, as confirmed from light rays travelling along\ngeodesics of the virtual sphere. We further observe resolutions ranging from\nlambda/2 to nearly lambda/4 for magnetic dipoles of varying orientations of\ndipole moments within the fisheye in transverse electric polarization (magnetic\nfield pointing orthogonal to the plane). Finally, we analyse the Eaton lens for\nwhich the source and its image are either located within a unit disc of air, or\nwithin a corona 1<r<2 with refractive index $n(r)=\\sqrt{2/r-1}$.

Laser cooling of atoms and molecules largely relies on\nthe internal level structure of the species being cooled. As a result, only a\nsmall number of elements and a tiny number of molecules can be cooled this way.\nIn the case of micromirrors, the problem lies in the engineering of\nmicromirrors that need to satisfy a large number of constraints---these include\na high mechanical Q-factor, high reflectivity and very good optical quality,\nweak coupling to the substrate, etc.---in order to enable efficient cooling.\nDuring the course of this thesis, I will draw these two sides of laser cooling\ncloser together by means of a single, generically applicable scattering theory\nthat can be used to explain the interaction between light and matter at a very\ngeneral level.

This leads to larger overlap of the wavefunctions involved in a\nmolecule formation process such as photoassociation, rendering the process more\nefficient.

It is known that\nneglecting the quantum potential (QP) leads to a singular behavior of quantum\nand classical fluctuations in the vicinity of the Mach (sonic) horizon, which\nin turn gives rise to the Hawking radiation.

A primary objective is to generalize the Manakov\nequations, well known in the case of single-mode fibers. We first investigate a\nreference case where linear coupling among the spatial modes of the fiber is\nweak and after averaging over birefringence fluctuations, we obtain new Manakov\nequations for multimode fibers. Such an averaging reduces the number of\nintermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms average\nout. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their\neffectiveness is reduced. We then verify the accuracy of our new Manakov\nequations by transmitting multiple PDM-QPSK signals over different modes of a\nmultimode fiber and comparing the numerical results with those obtained by\nsolving the full stochastic equation. The agreement is excellent in all cases\nstudied. A great benefit of the new equations is to reduce the computation time\nby a factor of 10 or more. Another important feature observed is that\nbirefringence fluctuations improve system performance by reducing the impact of\nfiber nonlinearities. Finally multimode fibers with strong random coupling\namong all spatial modes are considered. Linear coupling is modeled using the\nrandom matrix theory approach. We derive new Manakov equations for multimode\nfibers in that regime and show that such fibers can perform better than\nsingle-modes fiber for large number of propagating spatial modes. \n\n"}

We discuss the magnetic moment\ncontribution to polarization radiation, which has never been experimentally\nobserved, and study how its visibility depends on the kinematical parameters\nand the medium permittivity. In particular, it is shown that this contribution\ncan, in principle, be detected in azimuthally non-symmetrical problems, for\nexample when vortex electrons obliquely cross a metallic screen (transition\nradiation) or move nearby it (diffraction radiation). We predict a left-right\nangular asymmetry of the transition radiation (in the plane where the charge\nradiation distributions would stay symmetric), which appears due to an\neffective interference between the charge radiation field and the magnetic\nmoment one. Numerical values of this asymmetry for vortex electrons with E_e =\n300keV and \\ell = O(100-1000) are O(0.1-1%), and we argue that this effect\ncould be detected with existing technology.

For applications in quantum communication, two metrics of this process\nare particularly important: heralding efficiency and total joint rate. Here, we\nderive expressions for both quantities for a variety of different beam\ngeometries and frequencies. We pay specific attention to the spectrum of both\nbiphotons and individual photons. We reveal the underlying mechanisms\nresponsible for the spectral shape and show they differ for different\ngeometries and frequencies. We then use these spectra to calculate heralding\nefficiency and joint count rate and examine how each of these metrics changes\nwith different geometries, frequencies, and spectral filtering and beam\nparameters. Interestingly, we find very high heralding efficiencies are\nachievable for collinear geometries, while noncollinear geometries require\nspectral filtering for high heralding efficiency, ultimately limiting the joint\ncount rate.

In ordinary waveguides, imperfections and disorder\ncause unwanted back-reflections, which hinder large-scale optical integration.\nTopological photonic structures, a new class of optical systems inspired by\nquantum Hall effect and topological insulators, can realize robust transport\nvia topologically-protected unidirectional edge modes. Such waveguides are\nrealized by the introduction of synthetic gauge fields for photons in a\ntwo-dimensional structure, which break time reversal symmetry and enable\none-way guiding at the edge of the medium. Here we suggest a different route\ntoward robust transport of light in lower-dimensional (1D) photonic lattices,\nin which time reversal symmetry is broken because of the {\\it non-Hermitian}\nnature of transport.

The barrier's\nstrength, epsilon, is the single free parameter of the scaled form of the\nmodel. It may be implemented in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear\noptics. The SSB bifurcation of the symmetric ground state (GS) is predicted\nanalytically in two limit cases, viz., for deep or weak splitting of the\npotential box by the barrier.

The\nspectral behavior of COTS, observed as reflection resonances, is described by\nthe temporal coupled-mode theory.

Cross-handed circularly polarized light\nfreely goes through the cholesteric layer and can excite COTS when reflected\nfrom the handedness-preserving mirror.
