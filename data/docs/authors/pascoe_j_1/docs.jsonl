Free analytic maps include\nvector-valued polynomials in free (noncommuting) variables and form a canonical\nclass of mappings from one noncommutative domain D in say g variables to\nanother noncommutative domain D' in g' variables.\n  Motivated by determining the possibilities for mapping a nonconvex\nnoncommutative domain to a convex noncommutative domain, this article focuses\non rigidity results for free analytic maps.

Such a representation, which characterizes the \"charge\" of \\rho in\nlocal quantum field theory, is determined by the Fock space structure of H_\\rho\nitself: Together with a \"basic\" representation of the group, all higher\nsymmetric or antisymmetric tensor powers thereof also appear. Hence \\rho is\nreducible unless it is an automorphism. It is further shown by the example of\nthe massless Dirac field in two dimensions that localization and\nimplementability of quasi-free endomorphisms are compatible with each other. \n\n"}
