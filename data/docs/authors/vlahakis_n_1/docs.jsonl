Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies).

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

Since our method\nallows us to spatially resolve the SF distribution within galaxies, we can\ncalculate the mean SFR of each galaxy as a function of radius. We find that on\naverage the mean SFR is dominated by SF in the central regions of galaxies, and\nthat the trend for suppression of SFR in high density environments is driven by\na reduction in this nuclear SF. We also find that the mean SFR in the outskirts\nis largely independent of environmental effects. This trend in the mean SFR is\nshared by galaxies which are highly star forming, while those which are weakly\nstar forming show no statistically significant correlation between their\nenvironment and the mean SFR at any radius. \n\n"}

Abstract: The prediction that (due to the limited amount of hydrogen available as fuel\nin the Sun) the future duration of our favourable terrestrial environment will\nbe short (compared with the present age of the Earth) has been interpreted as\nevidence for a hard step scenario. This means that some of the essential steps\n(such as the development of eukaryotes) in the evolution process leading to the\nultimate emergence of intelligent life would have been hard, in the sense of\nbeing against the odds in the available time, so that they are unlikely to have\nbeen achieved in most of the earth-like planets that may one day be discovered\nin nearby extra-solar systems.

Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU.

Although the IMOs reveal\nslightly higher virial-to-stellar mass ratios than lower mass GCs, this may\nsimply reflect our limited understanding of their IMF (and hence their stellar\nmass-to-light ratios) or structural properties. We argue that most of these\nintermediate mass objects are a natural extension of the GC sequence to higher\nmasses, i.e. IMOs are essentially massive star clusters. [Abridged]. \n\n"}

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

The estimated f(x,v) spans over four\ndecades at any radius. Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo. The power-law Q(r) profile likely reflects the\ndistribution of entropy (K = sigma^2/rho^{2/3} \\propto r^{1.2}), which dark\nmatter acquires as it is accreted onto a growing halo.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303.

AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to\nminimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination.

Abstract: The observations show that less massive the galaxies are, the higher on\naverage is their specific star formation rate (SSFR = SFR/Ms, Ms is the stellar\nmass). Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen\nfor local and high-z (back to z~1-2) galaxy samples. We use observational data\nrelated only to disc galaxies and explore the average SSFR change with z for\ndifferent masses. For Ms in the range ~10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun, the SSFR increases\nwith (1+z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller\ngalaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM\nhierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc\ngalaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc\nfeedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories\nare explored. The parameters of the outflow and re-accretion schemes are tuned\nto reproduce the z~0 Mh-Ms relation inferred from observations. In the case of\noutflows only, the SSFR of individual model galaxies is roughly proportional to\n(1+z)^2.2 for all the masses with a normalization factor that depends on mass\nas Ms^0.1, i.e more massive galaxies have slightly larger SSFRs, contrary to\nthe observed strong SSFR-DS trend.

We built a simple and fast non-hydrodynamic\nmodel, QWIND, where we assume that a wind is launched from the accretion disc\nat supersonic velocities of the order of a few 10^2 km/s and we concentrate on\nthe subsequent supersonic phase. We show that this model can produce a wind\nwith terminal velocities of the order of 10^4 km/s. There are three zones in\nthe wind, only the middle one of which can launch a wind: in the inner zone the\nwind is too ionized and so experiences only the Compton radiation force which\nis not effective in accelerating gas. This inner failed wind however plays an\nimportant role in shielding the next zone, lowering the ionization parameter\nthere. In the middle zone the lower ionization of the gas leads to a much\nlarger radiation force and the gas achieves escape velocity This middle zone is\nquite thin (about 100 gravitational radii).

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration. We confirm this finding and attribute the acceleration to the\nsideways expansion of the jet - the magnetic energy is converted into the\nkinetic one in the strong magnetosonic rarefaction wave, which is launched when\nthe jet loses its external support. This type of acceleration, the rarefaction\nacceleration, is specific to relativistic jets because their energy budget can\nstill be dominated by magnetic energy even in highly super-fast magnetosonic\nregime. Just like the collimation acceleration of externally confined\nmagnetized jets, it is connected with the geometry of magnetic flux sufaces. In\nboth cases, in the acceleration zone the poloidal field lines diverge faster\nthan in the monopolar configuration. On the other hand, whereas the collimation\nacceleration keeps the product of jet opening angle and Lorentz factor somewhat\nbelow unity, the rarefaction acceleration allows to make it significantly\nlarger, in agreement with the standard model of jet breaks in afterglow light\ncurves. \n\n"}

This is the first in-depth analysis of the X-ray\nspectral characteristics of this source. We found that the flux of 1ES 1210-646\nvaries by a factor of about 3 on a timescale of hundreds of seconds and by a\nfactor of at least 10 among observations acquired over a time span of several\nmonths. The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron.

In this paper, we analyze the\ndistribution of dark matter and semianalytical galaxies in the Millennium\nSimulation to investigate these problems. Applying the same density field\nreconstruction schemes as used for the overall matter distribution to the\nmatter locked in halos we study the mass contribution of halos to the total\nmass budget at various background field densities, i.e., the conditional halo\nmass function. In this context, we present a simple fitting formula for the\ncumulative mass function accurate to ~ 5% for halo masses between 10^{10} and\n10^{15}Msol/h. We find that in dense environments the halo mass function\nbecomes top heavy and present corresponding fitting formulae for different\nredshifts.

We show, however, that\nto the linear order in the small parameter - the quartic self-coupling - the\ninfrared effects are completely harmless, as they can be absorbed into field\nredefinition. We then evaluate the statistical anisotropy inherent in the model\ndue to the existence of the long-ranged radial perturbations. To the linear\norder in the quartic self-coupling the statistical anisotropy is free of the\ninfrared effects. The latter show up at the quadratic order in the\nself-coupling and result in the mild (logarithmic) enhancement of the\ncorresponding contribution to the statistical anisotropy.

Our tests\ndemonstrate that the global ionisation properties of the region are correctly\nreproduced by iVINE, hence validating further application of this code to the\nstudy of feedback in star forming regions. However we highlight potentially\nimportant discrepancies in the detailed temperature distribution. In particular\nwe show that in the case of highly inhomogenous density distributions the\ncommonly employed on-the-spot (OTS) approximation yields unrealistically sharp\nshadow regions which can affect the dynamical evolution of the system. We\nimplement a simple strategy to include the effects of the diffuse field in\nfuture calculations, which makes use of physically motivated temperature\ncalibrations of the diffuse-field dominated regions and can be readily applied\nto similar codes. We find that while the global qualitative behaviour of the\nsystem is captured by simulations with the OTS approximation, the inclusion of\nthe diffuse field in iVINE (called DiVINE) results in a stronger confinement of\nthe cold gas, leading to denser and less coherent structures. This in turn\nleads to earlier triggering of star formation.

Two bulge populations Abstract: [ABRIDGED] Based on high-resolution (R~42000 to 48000) and high\nsignal-to-noise (S/N~50 to 150) spectra obtained with UVES/VLT, we present\ndetailed elemental abundances (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y,\nand Ba) and stellar ages for 26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the\nGalactic bulge. The analysis is based on equivalent width measurements and\nstandard 1-D LTE MARCS model stellar atmospheres. We also present NLTE Li\nabundances based on line synthesis of the 7Li line at 670.8 nm. We show that\nthe bulge metallicity distribution (MDF) is double-peaked; one peak at [Fe/H]=\n-0.6 and one at [Fe/H]=+0.3, and with a dearth of stars around solar\nmetallicity. This is in contrast to the MDF derived from red giants in Baade's\nwindow, which peaks at this exact value. A simple significance test shows that\nit is extremely unlikely to have such a gap in the microlensed dwarf star MDF\nif the dwarf stars are drawn from the giant star MDF. To resolve this issue we\ndiscuss several possibilities, but we can not settle on a conclusive solution\nfor the observed differences. We further find that the metal-poor bulge dwarf\nstars are predominantly old with ages greater than 10\\,Gyr, while the\nmetal-rich bulge dwarf stars show a wide range of ages. The metal-poor bulge\nsample is very similar to the Galactic thick disk in terms of average\nmetallicity, elemental abundance trends, and stellar ages.

Also, recent claims of a flat IMF in the bulge\nbased on the MDF of giant stars may have to be revised based on the MDF and\nabundance trends probed by our microlensed dwarf stars. \n\n"}

When cold dark matter is present, the supersymmetron\nevolves to a matter dependent minimum where its energy density does not vanish.\nIn the early universe until the recent past of the Universe, the energy density\nof the supersymmetron is negligible compared to the cold dark matter energy\ndensity.

We find that\na magnetar-composed LS I +61 303-system would most likely be (i.e., for usual\nmagnetar parameters and mass-loss rate) subject to a flip-flop behavior, from a\nrotational powered regime (in apastron) to a propeller regime (in periastron)\nalong each of the LS I +61 303, eccentric orbital motion.

For the\nconversion from the angular to the spatial correlation function we used the\nLimber integral equation and the luminosity-dependent density evolution model\nof the AGN X-ray luminosity function. We have found significant angular\ncorrelations with the power-law parameters gamma = 1.81 +/- 0.02, theta_0 =\n1.3\" +/- 0.2\" for the soft, and gamma = 2.00 +/- 0.04, theta_0 = 7.3\" +/- 1.0\"\nfor the hard bands. The amplitude of the correlation function w(theta) is\nhigher in the hard than in the soft band for f_x < 10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and\nlower above this flux limit. We confirm that the clustering strength theta_0\ngrows with the flux limit of the sample, a trend which is also present in the\namplitude of the spatial correlation function, but only for the soft band. In\nthe hard band, it remains almost constant with r_0 = 10h^-1$ Mpc, irrespective\nof the flux limit. Our analysis of AGN subsamples with different hardness\nratios shows that the sources with a hard-spectrum are more clustered than\nsoft-spectrum ones. This result may be a hint that the two main types of AGN\npopulate different environments. Finally, we find that our clustering results\ncorrespond to an X-ray selected AGN bias factor of ~ 2.5 for the soft-band\nsources (at a median z = 1.1) and ~ 3.3 for the hard-band sources (at a median\nz = 1), which translates into a host dark matter halo mass of ~ 10^13 h^-1 M_o\nand ~ 10^13.7 h^-1 M_o for the soft and hard bands, respectively. \n\n"}

The criterion to enter the pair\ninstability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the\nmass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen\ncore mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and\nrotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to\ndetermine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability\neffects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged\npair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars\nwith no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective\ninstability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux\ncriterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,\nthe minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce\neffectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted\nalmost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. For this case, we find that the\nminimum main sequence mass is ~40 Msun to encounter PPISN and ~65 Msun to\nencounter a PISN.

We study\noptical/near-infrared (NIR) colour distributions of the GC systems in 14 E/S0\ngalaxies. We test whether the bimodal feature, generally present in optical\ncolour distributions, remains in the optical/NIR ones. The latter colour\ncombination is a better metallicity proxy than the former. We use KMM and GMM\ntests to quantify the probability that different colour distributions are\nbetter described by a bimodal, as opposed to a unimodal distribution. We find\nthat double-peaked colour distributions are more commonly seen in optical than\nin optical/NIR colours. For some of the galaxies where the optical (g-z)\ndistribution is clearly bimodal, the (g-K) and (z-K) distributions are better\ndescribed by a unimodal distribution. The two most cluster-rich galaxies in our\nsample, NGC4486 and NGC4649, show some interesting differences. The (g-K)\ndistribution of NGC4649 is better described by a bimodal distribution, while\nthis is true for the (g-K) distribution of NGC4486 GCs only if restricted to a\nbrighter sub-sample with small K-band errors (< 0.05 mag). Formally, the K-band\nphotometric errors cannot be responsible for blurring bimodal metallicity\ndistributions to unimodal (g-K) colour distributions. However, simulations\nincluding the extra scatter in the colour-colour diagrams (not fully accounted\nfor in the photometric errors) show that such scatter may contribute to the\ndisappearance of bimodality in (g-K) for the full NGC4486 sample.

The\napproximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the\ngaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc\nis completed within 1-10 million years. Building up the core by collisions\nbetween km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this time-scale constraint,\nespecially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are\ndetected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we\nnumerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles\nloosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses\nranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test\ndifferent particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our\nanalytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one\nset by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and\nthe other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere.\nIn the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass,\nwhile in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass.\nWe discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant\ncores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core\naccretion time-scale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in\nthe midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive\nplanetesimals or low radial pressure support.

We consider the formation of molecular cloud by\naccretion of the HI clouds as suggested in recent observations. The simulation\nshows that the initial HI medium is compressed and piled up behind the shock\nwaves induced by the accretion flows. Since the initial medium is highly\ninhomogeneous as a consequence of the thermal instability, the formed molecular\ncloud becomes very turbulent owing to the development of the Richtmyer-Meshkov\ninstability. The structure of the post shock region is composed of dense cold\ngas (T<100 K) and diffuse warm gas (T>1,000 K), which are spatially well mixed\nowing to the turbulence. Because the energy source of the turbulence is the\naccretion flows, the turbulence is highly anisotropic biased toward the\ndirection of accretion flows. The kinetic energy of the turbulence dominates\nthe thermal, magnetic, and gravitational energies in the total 10 Myr\nevolution. However, the kinetic energy measured by using the\nCO-fraction-weighted density is comparable to the other energies. This suggests\nthat the true kinetic energy of turbulence in molecular cloud as a hole can be\nmuch larger than the kinetic energy of turbulence estimated by line-width of\nmolecular emissions. The clumps in the molecular cloud show statistically\nhomogeneous evolution as follows: The typical plasma beta of the clumps is\nroughly constant <beta>~ 0.4.

The gas available translates\ninto a rate of star formation, which controls the generation of metals in the\nuniverse.

We find evidence for enhanced warm H2\nemission (i.e. above that associated with UV excitation in star-forming\nregions) in 14 galaxies (~20%), with 8 galaxies having extreme values of L(H2\nS(0)-S(3))/L(7.7micron PAH), in excess of 0.07. Such emission has been seen\npreviously in the compact group HCG 92 (Stephan's Quintet), and was shown to be\nassociated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with a\nlarge-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, with\ntidal debris in the intragroup medium. Similarly, shock excitation or turbulent\nheating is likely responsible for the enhanced H2 emission in the compact group\ngalaxies, since other sources of heating (UV or X-ray excitation from star\nformation or AGN) are insufficient to account for the observed emission.

The main contribution comes from z<2, where dark energy\nleads to a decay of potentials. As the same photons are gravitationally lensed\nby these decaying potentials, there exists a high degree of correlation between\nthe ISW effect and CMB lensing, leading to a non-zero three-point correlation\n(bispectrum) of the observed temperature anisotropy. This ISW-lensing\nbispectrum, whose shape resembles that of the so-called \"local-form\" primordial\nbispectrum parametrized by fNL, is known to be the largest contamination of\nfNL. In order to avoid a spurious detection of primordial non-Gaussianity, we\nneed to remove the ISW-lensing bias. In this work, we investigate three\ndebiasing methods: (I) subtraction of an expected, ensemble average of the\nISW-lensing bispectrum; (II) subtraction of a measured ISW-lensing bispectrum;\nand (III) direct subtraction of an estimated ISW signal from an observed\ntemperature map. One may use an estimation of the ISW map from external non-CMB\ndata or that from the CMB data themselves. As the methods II and III are based\non fewer assumptions about the nature of dark energy, they are preferred over\nthe method I. While the methods I and II yield unbiased estimates of fNL with\ncomparable error bars, the method III yields a biased result when the\nunderlying primordial fNL is non-zero and the ISW map is estimated from a\nlensing potential reconstructed from the observed temperature map. One of the\nsources of the bias is a lensing reconstruction noise bias which is independent\nof fNL and can be calculated precisely, but other fNL-dependent terms are\ndifficult to compute reliably. We thus conclude that the method II is the best,\nmodel-independent way to remove the ISW-lensing bias of fNL, enabling us to\ntest the physics of inflation with smaller systematic errors. \n\n"}

He calculated the work necessary to keep the\ncavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded\nthat the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that E =\n3/8 mc^2. Also in 1904, Hasenohrl achieved the same result by computing the\nforce necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early\n1905, he corrected the latter result to E = 3/4 mc^2. In this paper,\nHasenohrl's papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an\nattempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first\npaper was, ironically, that he didn't account for the loss of mass of the\nblackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking\nthis into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent\nof m = 4/3 E/c^2 or m = 5/3 E/c^2 depending on whether one equates the momentum\nor kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an\nequivalent mass.

Both of\nthese problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to\nbe relevant to the \"4/3 problem\" in classical models of the electron.

Compared to previous work, we improve the\ncalculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition\nto radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central\nAGN, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scattered\nand reprocessed photons. We find that the accretion flow properties change\nsignificantly due to this \"re-radiation\" effect.

This effect is more significant when the\ndensity at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as\nvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the\naccretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the\nradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far\nbelow the value of $\\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological\nsimulations.

For\nthe first time, this library provides the rate probability density at all\ntemperature grid points for convenient implementation in models of stellar\nphenomena. The recommended rate and its associated uncertainties are also\nincluded. Currently, uncertainties are absent from all other rate libraries,\nand, although estimates have been attempted in previous evaluations and\ncompilations, these are generally not based on rigorous statistical\ndefinitions. A common standard for deriving uncertainties is clearly warranted.\nSTARLIB represents a first step in addressing this deficiency by providing a\ntabular, up-to-date database that supplies not only the rate and its\nuncertainty but also its distribution. Because a majority of rates are\nlognormally distributed, this allows the construction of rate probability\ndensities from the columns of STARLIB. This structure is based on a recently\nsuggested Monte Carlo method to calculate reaction rates, where uncertainties\nare rigorously defined. In STARLIB, experimental rates are supplemented with:\n(i) theoretical TALYS rates for reactions for which no experimental input is\navailable, and (ii) laboratory and theoretical weak rates. STARLIB includes all\ntypes of reactions of astrophysical interest to Z = 83, such as (p,g), (p,a),\n(a,n), and corresponding reverse rates. Strong rates account for thermal target\nexcitations. Here, we summarize our Monte Carlo formalism, introduce the\nlibrary, compare methods of correcting rates for stellar environments, and\ndiscuss how to implement our library in Monte Carlo nucleosynthesis studies.

Several explanations have already been\nconsidered, but the existence of dual tracks is not yet fully understood.\n  We suggest that in the hard spectral state re-condensation of gas from the\ncorona into a cool, weak inner disk can provide additional soft photons for\nComptonization, leading to a higher X-ray luminosity in combination with rather\nunchanged radio emission, which presumably traces the mass accretion rate. As\nan example, we determined how much additional luminosity due to photons from an\nunderlying disk would be needed to explain the data from the representative\noutlier source H1743-322. From the comparison with calculations of Compton\nspectra with and without the photons from an underlying disk, we find that the\nrequired additional X-ray luminosity lies well in the range obtained from\ntheoretical models of the accretion flow.

This paper presents kinetic models of\nhow ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to\ninterplanetary space. It also derives a wide range of new solutions for the\nrelevant dispersion relations, marginal stability boundaries, and nonresonant\nvelocity-space diffusion rates. A phenomenological model containing both\ncyclotron damping and turbulent cascade is constructed to explain the\nsuppression of proton heating at low alpha-proton differential flow speeds.\nThese effects are implemented in a large-scale model of proton thermal\nevolution from the corona to 1 AU.

However, many observed cold fronts appear\nstable. This opens the possibility to place constraints on microphysical\nmechanisms that stabilize them, such as the ICM viscosity and/or magnetic\nfields. We performed exploratory high-resolution simulations of cold fronts\narising from subsonic gas sloshing in cluster cores using the grid-based Athena\nMHD code, comparing the effects of isotropic Spitzer and anisotropic Braginskii\nviscosity (expected in a magnetized plasma). Magnetized simulations with full\nBraginskii viscosity or isotropic Spitzer viscosity reduced by a factor f ~ 0.1\nare both in qualitative agreement with observations in terms of suppressing K-H\ninstabilities.

Such a scenario provides a constrained\nparameter space where both the issues of vacuum stability and high-scale\ninflation can be successfully accommodated. The threshold effect on the Higgs\nquartic coupling due to the presence of the heavy inflaton field plays an\nimportant role in keeping the electroweak vacuum stable. Furthermore, this\nscenario is also capable of reheating the universe at the end of inflation.\nThough the issues of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which dominate the late-time\nevolution of our universe, cannot be addressed within this framework, this\nmodel successfully describes the early universe dynamics according to the Big\nBang model. \n\n"}

This is usually provided by measuring the broadening of spectral\nlines, however this method has uncertainties as lines are also broadened by\nvelocity fields in the stellar photosphere known as macroturbulence. We have\nestimated accurate rotational velocity values from asteroseismic analyses of\nmain sequence stars observed by Kepler. The rotational frequency splittings of\nthe detected solar-like oscillations of these stars are determined largely by\nthe near-surface rotation. These estimates have been used to infer the\nmacroturbulence values for 28 Kepler stars. Out of this sample, 26 stars were\nused along with the Sun to obtain a new calibration between macroturbulence,\neffective temperature and surface gravity.

We first demonstrate that our AGN\nmodel is capable of reproducing the observed cluster pressure profile at\nredshift, z~0, once the AGN heating temperature of the targeted particles is\nmade to scale with the final virial temperature of the halo. This allows the\nejected gas to reach larger radii in higher-mass clusters than would be\npossible had a fixed heating temperature been used. Such a model also\nsuccessfully reduces the star formation rate in brightest cluster galaxies and\nbroadly reproduces a number of other observational properties at low redshift,\nincluding baryon, gas and star fractions; entropy profiles outside the core;\nand the X-ray luminosity-mass relation.

The time of quenching varies from ~2 Gyr before\naccretion (first crossing of r200,c) to >4 Gyr after, depending on satellite\nand host mass. Once begun, quenching is rapid (>~ 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies\n(M* < 10^10 M_Sun), but significantly more protracted for more massive\nsatellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by\nram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forming\ninterstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (M* ~ 10^9\nM_Sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and\nclusters. Immediately before quenching is complete, this fraction rises to ~80%\neven for Milky Way analogues (M* ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun) in groups (M_host ~ 10^13.5\nM_Sun).

In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find that as tides strip the galaxy the evolution of the\nhalf-light radius and the averaged velocity dispersion follows well-defined\ntracks that are mainly controlled by the amount of mass lost.

The\ndivergent evolution is particularly pronounced in galaxies whose stellar\ncomponent is strongly segregated within their DM halo and becomes more\ndisparate as the remnant mass decreases. Our analysis indicates that the DM\nprofile plays an important role in defining the internal dynamics of tidal\nstreams.

To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC\ncan indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are\nmade. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small.

Two mechanisms, i.e., Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism\nand neutrino annihilation process, are generally considered to power GRBs.\nUsing the analytic solutions from Xue et al.

The results show that,\nalthough the neutrino annihilation processes could account for most of GRBs,\nthe BZ mechanism is more effective, especially for long-duration GRBs.\nActually, if the energy of afterglows and flares of GRBs is included, the\ndistinction between these two mechanisms is more significant. Furthermore,\nmassive disk mass and high BH spin are beneficial to power high luminosities of\nGRBs.

We\npresent the formalism that enables one to compute the diffusion tensor from a\ngiven source of noise in the gravitational field when the system's dynamical\nresponse to that noise is included.

The investigated cases\nare guided by relativistic double neutron star (NS-NS) and NS-BH merger models,\nproducing ~3-6 Msun BHs with rotation parameters of A~0.8 and tori of 0.03-0.3\nMsun.

Observational evidence provides\nsupport to the idea that SGRBs originate from the merger of compact binaries,\nconsisting of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH).\nTheoretical models and numerical simulations seem to converge to an explanation\nin which the central engine of SGRBs is given by a spinning BH surrounded by a\nhot accretion torus. Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these\nafterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the\n$\\sim\\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,\nsuggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation. Yet, if the\nmerger results in a massive NS the conditions to generate a relativistic jet\nand thus the prompt SGRB emission are hardly met.

Effects of Disk\n  Mass and Self-Gravity Abstract: Previously we showed that a substantially misaligned viscous accretion disk\nwith pressure that orbits around one component of a binary system can undergo\nglobal damped Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations. These oscillations produce\nperiodic exchanges of the disk eccentricity with inclination. The disk KL\nmechanism is quite robust and operates over a wide range of binary and disk\nparameters. However, the effects of self-gravity, which are expected to\nsuppress the KL oscillations for sufficiently massive disks, were ignored.\nHere, we analyze the effects of disk self-gravity by means of hydrodynamic\nsimulations and compare the results with the expectations of analytic theory.\nThe disk mass required for suppression in the simulations is a few percent of\nthe mass of the central star and this roughly agrees with an analytical\nestimate. The conditions for suppression of the KL oscillations in the\nsimulations are close to requiring that the disk be gravitationally unstable.\nWe discuss some implications of our results for the dynamics of protoplanetary\ndisks and the related planet formation. \n\n"}

This\ntemperature anomaly is aligned with a huge large quasar group (HLQG), and for\nthis reason we call it HLQG anomaly. There are different physical phenomena by\nwhich the HLQG could have produced the observed temperature anomaly, such as\nfor example the Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ), the integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) or the\nRees Sciama (RS) effect. The goal of this paper it is not to explain the\nobserved alignment in terms of these effects, but to show the shape and\nposition of the HLQG anomaly, and estimate its statistical significance, i.e.\nthe probability that it could be just the result of primordial Gaussian\nfluctuations. We analyze the CMB Planck satellite temperature map of the region\nof sky corresponding to the angular position of the HLQG, and compute an inner\nand an outer temperature by averaging the CMB map over respectively the region\nsubtended by the HLQG on the sky, and over a region surrounding it. It turns\nout that the inner region is warmer than the outer one, with a measured\ntemperature difference of $\\Delta T^{obs} \\approx 43\\mu K$.

Its alignment with HLQG and suggests that\nthis could be due to the Rees-Sciama effect.

Thus the Harvard light curve\nprovides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light\ncurve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and\nthe day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for\nunique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects\nare very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not\nappear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must\nbe some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of\ndust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7\ntimes as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the\ncomet-family idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated 648,000\ngiant comets (each with 200 km diameter) all orchestrated to pass in front of\nthe star within the last century. \n\n"}

We use the new code 3D-Barolo, that models the\ngalaxy emission directly in the 3D observational space, without the need to\nextract kinematic maps.

An outstanding problem\nwith the existing migration models is that they invariably predict excessively\nlarge resonant populations, while observations show that the non-resonant\norbits are in fact common (e.g., the main belt population is 2-4 times larger\nthan Plutinos in the 3:2 resonance). Here we show that this problem can\nresolved if it is assumed that Neptune's migration was grainy, as expected from\nscattering encounters of Neptune with massive planetesimals. The grainy\nmigration acts to destabilize resonant bodies with large libration amplitudes,\na fraction of which ends up on stable non-resonant orbits. Thus, the\nnon-resonant--to--resonant ratio obtained with the grainy migration is higher,\nup to ~10 times higher for the range of parameters investigated here, than in a\nmodel with smooth migration. The grainy migration leads to a narrower\ndistribution of the libration amplitudes in the 3:2 resonance. The best fit to\nobservations is obtained when it is assumed that the outer planetesimal disk\nbelow 30 AU contained 1000-4000 Plutos, or ~1000 bodies twice as massive as\nPluto. We find that the probability for an outer disk object to end up on a\nstable orbit in the Kuiper belt is ~10^{-3}. Together, these results are\nconsistent with having only two (known) Pluto-mass bodies in the Kuiper belt\ntoday (Pluto and Eris).

We explain how radial metallicity gradients in stellar populations are\ndetermined by three factors: the radial metallicity profile of the star-forming\nISM, radial changes in the star-formation history (in particular inside-out\nformation), and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions,\ninside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but\ncontributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to inverting the\nmetallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This reconciles steep negative\nd[Fe/H]/dR in some high redshift galaxies to generally flatter gradients in\nlocal observations.\n  We discuss the evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive\nd[X/H]/dR) at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal\nvelocity and the metallicity (positive dV_{\\phi}/d[Fe/H]) of stars for the\nMilky Way's thick disc. The former can be achieved by high central gas-loss\nrates and re-distribution processes, e.g. re-accretion of enriched material in\nconjunction with inside-out formation, and near-disc galactic fountaining.

We study the\ninfluence of the turbulent expansion, chemical composition, and magnetic fields\non the stratification in the upper layers of the solar models in comparison\nwith solar observations. Furthermore, we test alternative <3D> averages for\nimproved results on the oscillation frequencies. We appended temporally and\nspatially averaged <3D> stratifications to 1D models to compute adiabatic\noscillation frequencies that we then tested against observations. We also\ndeveloped depth-dependent corrections for the solar 1D model, for which we\nexpanded the geometrical depth to match the pressure stratification of the\nsolar <3D> model, and we reduced the density that is caused by the turbulent\npressure. We obtain the same results with our <3D> models as have been reported\npreviously. Our depth-dependent corrected 1D models match the observations to\nalmost a similar extent as the <3D> model.

In this Letter, based on the standard accretion model we attempt\nto constrain the dipolar magnetic field of the pulsar in ULX M82 X-2. Our\ncalculations indicate that the accretion rate at the magnetospheric radius must\nbe super-Eddington during outbursts. To support such a super-Eddington\naccretion, a relatively high multipole field ($\\ga 10^{13}$ G) near the surface\nof the accretor is invoked to produce an accreting gas column. However, our\nconstraint shows that the surface dipolar magnetic field of the pulsar should\nbe in the range of $1.0-3.5\\times 10^{12}$ G. Therefore, our model supports\nthat the neutron star in ULX M82 X-2 could be a low magnetic field magnetar\n(proposed by Tong) with a normal dipolar field ($\\sim 10^{12}$ G) and\nrelatively strong multipole field. For the large luminosity variations of this\nsource, our scenario can also present a self-consistency interpretation. \n\n"}

This stands in contrast to the overall distribution of\nplanets out to ~100 days, which is dominated by low-density sub-Neptunes above\n2 Earth radii, which must have gaseous envelopes to explain their size.\nHowever, on ultra-short-period orbits, planets are bombarded by intense levels\nof photo-ionizing radiation and consequently gaseous sub-Neptunes are extremely\nvulnerable to losing their envelopes to atmospheric photo-evaporation. Using\nmodels of planet evolution, I show that the rocky USP planets can easily be\nproduced as the evaporated remnants of sub-Neptunes with H/He envelopes and\nthat we can therefore understand the observed dearth of USP sub-Neptunes as a\nnatural consequence of photo-evaporation. Critically however, planets on USP\norbits could often retain their envelopes if they formed with very\nhigh-metallicity water dominated envelopes.

The continuum emission is\nconsistent with an axisymmetric belt, with a mean radius of 152au and radial\nFWHM of 46au, which is too narrow compared to models of inward scattering of an\nLHB-like scenario. Instead, the hot dust could be explained as material passed\ninwards in a rather stable planetary configuration. We also report a 4sigma\ndetection of CO at ~ 20au.

We provide a self-consistent, unified treatment of TDEs by non-spinning\n(Schwarzschild) black holes, investigating several effects of general\nrelativity including changes to the boundary in phase space that defines the\nloss-cone orbits on which stars are tidally disrupted or captured. TDE rates\ndecrease rapidly at large black-hole masses due to direct stellar capture, but\nthis effect is slightly countered by the widening of the loss cone due to the\nstronger tidal fields in general relativity. We provide a new mapping procedure\nthat translates between Newtonian gravity and general relativity, allowing us\nto better compare predictions in both gravitational theories. Partial tidal\ndisruptions in relativity will strip more material from the star and produce\nmore tightly bound debris than in Newtonian gravity for a stellar orbit with\nthe same angular momentum.

We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a\nstar-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this\nevolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations.

However, there may be significant bias and\nscatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called\nmass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong\nlenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet\ntransformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting\nlenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5%\nwith an intrinsic scatter of 10%, confirming previous results performed on a\ndifferent simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing\nobservables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not\ndetect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or\nobservational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens\nconfiguration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate\nestimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased\nlow (high).

GW170817 was followed by a\nrange of EM counterparts, including a weak gamma-ray burst (GRB), kilonova (KN)\nemission from the radioactive decay of the merger ejecta, and X-ray/radio\nemission consistent with being the synchrotron afterglow of a more powerful\noff-axis jet.

For a soft EOS which supports a low $M_{\\rm max}$,\nthe merger undergoes a prompt collapse accompanied by a small quantity of\nshock-heated or disk wind ejecta, inconsistent with the large quantity $\\gtrsim\n10^{-2}M_{\\odot}$ of lanthanide-free ejecta inferred from the KN.

Here we use 800 dynamical simulations to show that an early\ninstability in the outer solar system strongly influences terrestrial planet\nformation and regularly yields properly sized Mars analogs. Our most successful\noutcomes occur when the terrestrial planets evolve an additional 1-10 million\nyears (Myr) following the dispersal of the gas disk, before the onset of the\ngiant planet instability. In these simulations, accretion has begun in the Mars\nregion before the instability, but the dynamical perturbation induced by the\ngiant planets' scattering removes large embryos from Mars' vicinity. Large\nembryos are either ejected or scattered inward toward Earth and Venus (in some\ncases to deliver water), and Mars is left behind as a stranded embryo. An early\ngiant planet instability can thus replicate both the inner and outer solar\nsystem in a single model. \n\n"}

II\n  Application to the solar atmosphere Abstract: Coupling between fast magneto-acoustic and Alfv\\'en waves can be observe in\nfully ionized plasmas mediated by stratification and 3D geometrical effects. In\nPaper I, Cally & Khomenko (2015) have shown that in a weakly ionized plasma,\nsuch as the solar photosphere and chromosphere, the Hall current introduces a\nnew coupling mechanism. The present study extends the results from Paper I to\nthe case of warm plasma. We report on numerical experiments where mode\ntransformation is studied using quasi-realistic stratification in thermodynamic\nparameters resembling the solar atmosphere. This redresses the limitation of\nthe cold plasma approximation assumed in Paper I, in particular allowing the\ncomplete process of coupling between fast and slow magneto-acoustic modes and\nsubsequent coupling of the fast mode to the Alfv\\'en mode through the Hall\ncurrent. Our results confirm the efficacy of the mechanism proposed in Paper I\nfor the solar case.

However, there is growing need for both a\nhigher-precision relation and a better understanding of systematic effects\n(e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical relationship between Mks and\nmass spanning $0.075M_\\odot<M<0.70M_\\odot$. The relation is derived from 62\nnearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a combination of Keck/NIRC2\nimaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their\norbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a\nprecision better than 1% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in\ncombination with resolved Ks magnitudes and system parallaxes, to calibrate the\nmass-Mks relation. The result can be used to determine masses of single stars\nwith a precision of 2-3%, which we confirm by a comparison to dynamical masses\nfrom the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit\nrelation beyond mass uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in\nthe mass-Mks relation or underestimated measurement errors.

Constraints on Galaxy Formation\n  Efficiency from Spatial Clustering Abstract: We study galaxy clustering using halo models, where gravitational clustering\nis described in terms of dark matter halos. At small scales, clustering\nstatistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales,\ncorrelations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory with\nhalo biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, and\ngalaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function of\nhalo mass. This approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy power\nspectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, and\nthe galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scales\nthan their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. We find\nthat requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the APM\ngalaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. The data at\nlarge scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at small\nmasses, m =10^10 Msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the number\nof galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-mass\nlimit. These constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosity\nfunction or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power spectrum,\nbispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. Although halo\nmodels agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higher\norder Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model assumption that halos are\nspherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of the\nbispectrum at small scales.

Up to now, in calculation of\nthe turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no the back\nreaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic\nenergy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the\nkinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of the kinematic dynamo\ntheory to protogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies\nthe temperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by ions. As the\nmagnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes shorter\nthan the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized. As a\nresult, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity. Thus, in\nprotogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field strengths much\nlower than the energy equipartition field strengths, and the turbulent dynamo\nbecomes what we call the magnetized turbulent dynamo. The purpose of this\nthesis is to lay the theoretical groundwork for the magnetized turbulent\ndynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy growth rate in the\nmagnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that in the kinematic\ndynamo theory.

In\nparticular, as the energy at which the GRB's $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectra is a maximum\n($E_{pk}$) decays through the four BATSE channels, the photon flux peak in each\nindividual channel will inevitably be offset producing what we measure as lag.\nWe test this hypothesis by measuring the rate of $E_{pk}$ decay ($\\Phi_{o}$)\nfor a sample of clean single peaked bursts with measured lag. We find a direct\ncorrelation between the decay timescale and the spectral lag, demonstrating the\nrelationship between time delay of the low energy photons and the decay of\n$E_{pk}$.

The\nISM is modeled as a two-phase medium in pressure equilibrium. The remnants of\nexploding type II SNe percolate into super-bubbles (SBs) that sweep the ISM,\nheating the hot phase (if the SB is adiabatic) or cooling it (in the snowplow\nstage, when the interior gas of the SB has cooled). The resulting feedback\nregimes occur in well-defined regions of the space defined by vertical\nscale-length and surface density of the structure. When SBs blow out in the\nadiabatic regime, the efficiency of SNe in heating the ISM is ~5 per cent, with\n\\~80 per cent of the energy budget injected into the external halo, and the\noutcoming ISM is self-regulated to a state similar to that found in the Milky\nWay. Feedback is most efficient when SBs are pressure-confined in the adiabatic\nregime. In some significant regions of the parameter space confinement takes\nplace in the snowplow stage; then the hot phase has a lower temperature and\nstar formation is quicker. In some critical cases, the hot phase is strongly\ndepleted and the cold phase percolates the whole volume, giving rise to a\nsudden burst of star formation. Strong galactic winds are predicted to happen\nonly in critical cases. This model provides a starting point for constructing a\nrealistic grid of feedback solutions to be used in galaxy formation codes.

Here we take into account the expectation that the hot\ngas in galactic halos is thermally unstable and prone to fragmentation during\ncooling and show that the implications are more far-reaching than previously\nexpected: allowing multi-phase cooling fundamentally alters expectations about\ngas infall in halos and naturally explains the bright-end cutoff in the galaxy\nluminosity function. We argue that cooling should proceed via the formation of\nhigh-density, 10^4 K clouds, pressure-confined within a hot gas background. The\nbackground medium has a low density, and can survive as a stable corona with a\nlong cooling time. The fraction of baryons contained in the residual hot core\ngrows with halo mass because the cooling density increases, and this leads to\nan upper-mass limit in quiescent, non-merged galaxies of ~10^11 Msun. In this\nscenario, galaxy formation is fueled by the infall of pressure-supported\nclouds.

The fraction of lensing by satellite galaxies (subhalos)\npeaks at ~1'' and decreases rapidly with increasing image separations. We\ncompute fractions of lenses which lie in groups and clusters, and find them to\nbe ~14% and ~4%, respectively: Nearly half of such lenses are expected to be\nproduced by satellite galaxies, rather than central parts of halos. We also\nstudy mass distributions of lensing halos and find that even at image\nseparations of ~3'' the deviation of lens mass distributions from isothermal\nprofiles is large: At or beyond ~3'' image separations are enhanced\nsignificantly by surrounding halos. Our model prediction agrees reasonably well\nwith observed image separation distributions from galaxy to cluster scales. \n\n"}

An immediate application of this result is that the tidal field\nand tidal truncation radii of million-star globular clusters and million-star\ndwarf galaxies (e.g., the Milky Way satellites NGC2419 and Carina) would be\nvery similar because of the one-to-one relation between gravity and baryon\ndistribution.

The JWST science\ngoals are divided into four themes. The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and\nReionization theme seeks to identify the first luminous sources to form and to\ndetermine the ionization history of the early universe. The Assembly of\nGalaxies theme seeks to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars,\nmetals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from\nthe epoch of reionization to the present day. The Birth of Stars and\nProtoplanetary Systems theme seeks to unravel the birth and early evolution of\nstars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary\nsystems.

The environments of post-starburst\n  galaxies Abstract: (abridged) There are good observational reasons to believe that the\nprogenitors of red galaxies have undergone starbursts, followed by a\npost-starburst phase. We investigate the environments of post-starburst\ngalaxies by measuring \\textsl{(1)} number densities in $8 h^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}$\nradius comoving spheres, \\textsl{(2)} transverse distances to nearest\nVirgo-like galaxy clusters, and \\textsl{(3)} transverse distances to nearest\nluminous-galaxy neighbors. We compare the post-starburst galaxies to currently\nstar-forming galaxies identified solely by A-star excess or $\\Halpha$ emission.\nWe find that post-starburst galaxies are in the same kinds of environments as\nstar-forming galaxies; this is our ``null hypothesis''. More importantly, we\nfind that at each value of the A-star excess, the star-forming and\npost-starburst galaxies lie in very similar distributions of environment. The\nonly deviations from our null hypothesis are barely significant: a slight\ndeficit of post-starburst galaxies (relative to the star-forming population) in\nvery low-density regions, a small excess inside the virial radii of clusters,\nand a slight excess with nearby neighbors. None of these effects is strong\nenough to make the post-starburst galaxies a high-density phenomenon, or to\nargue that the starburst events are primarily triggered by external tidal\nimpulses (e.g., from close passages of massive galaxies). The small excess\ninside cluster virial radii suggests that some post-starbursts are triggered by\ninteractions with the intracluster medium, but this represents a very small\nfraction of all post-starburst galaxies. \n\n"}

To address this\nquestion, I first put forward three general criteria for selecting the relevant\nastrophysical environments. Namely, reconnection should be: fast; energetically\nimportant; and observable. From this, I deduce that the gas density should be\nlow, so that the plasma is: collisionless; force-free; and optically thin.\nThus, for example, the requirement that reconnection is fast implies that\nPetschek's reconnection mechanism must be operating, which is possible,\napparently, only in the collisionless regime. Next, I argue that the force-free\ncondition implies that the magnetic field be produced in, and anchored by, a\nnearby dense massive object, e.g., a star or a disk, strongly stratified by\ngravity. I then stress the importance of field-line opening (e.g., by\ndifferential rotation) as a means to form a reconnecting current sheet.\nCorrespondingly, I suggest the Y-point helmet streamer as a generic\nprototypical magnetic configuration relevant to large-scale reconnection in\nastrophysics. Finally, I discuss several specific astrophysical systems where\nthe above criteria are met: stellar coronae, magnetically-interacting\nstar--disk systems, and magnetized coronae above turbulent accretion disks. In\nthe Appendix, I apply the ideas put forward in this talk to the solar coronal\nheating problem. \n\n"}

Recent studies of the carbon and nitrogen\nabundances in metal-poor stars have focused on the most carbon-rich stars,\nleading to a potential selection bias against stars that have been polluted by\nAGB stars that produced large amounts of nitrogen, and hence have small [C/N]\nratios. We call these stars Nitrogen-Enhanced Metal-Poor (NEMP) stars, and\ndefine them as having [N/Fe] > +0.5 and [C/N] < -0.5. In this paper, we report\non the [C/N] abundances of a sample of 21 carbon-enhanced stars, all but three\nof which have [C/Fe] < +2.0. If NEMP stars were made as easily as\nCarbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, then we expected to find between two\nand seven NEMP stars. Instead, we found no NEMP stars in our sample. Therefore,\nthis observational bias is not an important contributor to the apparent dearth\nof N-rich stars.

Our primary focus is\nthe halo mass function, a key probe of cosmology. By performing a large suite\nof nested-box N-body simulations with careful convergence and error controls\n(60 simulations with box sizes from 4 to 256 Mpc/h, we determine the mass\nfunction and its evolution with excellent statistical and systematic errors,\nreaching a few percent over most of the considered redshift and mass range.\nAcross the studied redshifts, the halo mass is probed over 6 orders of\nmagnitude (10^7 - 10^13.5 M_sun/h).

A galaxy model is made locally in\nwedges and subtracted to determine shell profiles and colours. We applied\nVoronoi binning to our data to get smoothed colour maps of the galaxies.\nComparison with N-body simulations from the literature gives more insight to\nthe origin of the shell features. Shell positions and dust characteristics are\ninferred from model galaxy subtracted images. RESULT: The ACS images reveal\nshells well within the effective radius in some galaxies (at 1.7 kpc in the\ncase of NGC 5982). In some cases, strong nuclear dust patches prevent detection\nof inner shells. Most shells have colours which are similar to the underlying\ngalaxy. Some inner shells are redder than the galaxy. All six shell galaxies\nshow out of dynamical equilibrium dust features, like lanes or patches, in\ntheir central regions. Our detection rate for dust in the shell ellipticals is\ngreater than that found from HST archive data for a sample of normal early-type\ngalaxies, at the 95% confidence level. CONCLUSIONS: The merger model describes\nbetter the shell distributions and morphologies than the interaction model. Red\nshell colours are most likely due to the presence of dust and/or older stellar\npopulations. The high prevalence and out of dynamical equilibrium morphologies\nof the central dust features point towards external influences being\nresponsible for visible dust features in early type shell galaxies.

The presence of bow shocks and ram pressure from material in\nthe cloud wake, developed during such evolution through the WIM, significantly\nalters these interactions with respect to the standard case of non-evolved\nclouds.\n  In general, in our adiabatic collisions the clouds are disrupted and convert\ntheir gas into a few low density contrast clumps.

On the other hand, for both adiabatic and\nradiative collisions, asymmetric collisions have a much greater tendency to\ndisrupt the two clouds.

This change in the speed of light is associated with a spontaneous\nbreaking of local Lorentz invariance in the early Universe, associated with a\nfirst order phase transition at a critical time $t=t_c$. This solves the\nhorizon problem, leads to a mechanism of monopole suppression in cosmology and\ncan resolve the flatness problem. it also offers the potential of solving the\ncosmological constant problem. After the critical time $t_c$, local Lorentz\ninvariance is restored and light travels at its presently measured speed. We\ninvestigate the field equations in the spontaneously broken phase and study\nfurther the flatness problem and the cosmological constant problem.

The model we consider is a supersymmetric abelian Higgs\nmodel with a D-term potential coupled to an axion-dilaton multiplet. The\nstrings in question are axionic D-term strings which we identify with the\nD-strings of type II string theory. In this picture the Higgs field represents\nthe open string tachyon of the D-Dbar pair and the axion is dual to a Ramond\nRamond form. The crucial term allowing the existence of non-singular BPS\nstrings is the Fayet-Iliopoulos term, which is related to the tensions of the\nD-string and of the parent branes. Despite the presence of the axion, the\nstrings are BPS and carry finite energy, due to the fact that the space gets\nvery slowly decompactified away from the core, screening the long range axion\nfield (or equivalently the theory approaches an infinitely weak 4D coupling).\nWithin our 4D effective action we also identify another class of BPS string\nsolutions (s-strings) which have no ten dimensional analog, and can only exist\nafter compactification. \n\n"}
