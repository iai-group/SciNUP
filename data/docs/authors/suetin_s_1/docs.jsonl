THEOREM: If every holomorphic map from a\ncompact convex set in a complex Euclidean space C^n to a certain complex\nmanifold Y is a uniform limit of entire maps of C^n to Y, then Y enjoys the\nparametric Oka property.

It\nprovides analytic description of expanding domains dynamics in the plane. Two\ncases have been developed in the classical theory, namely the {\\it radial} and\nthe {\\it chordal} Loewner evolutions, referring to the associated families of\nholomorphic self-mappings being normalized at an internal or boundary point of\nthe reference domain, respectively. Recently there has been introduced a new\napproach [arXiv:0807.1594v1, arXiv:0807.1715v1, arXiv:0902.3116v1] bringing\ntogether, and containing as quite special cases, radial and chordal variants of\nLoewner Theory.

After an overview\nof the results for O(m) and G, the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials\nrelated to Sp(2n) is obtained with respect to the Berezin integral.

The degeneracy of the mapping $f$ will\nbe characterized in terms of the ranks of the CR second fundamental form and\nits covariant derivatives. In 2004, the author, together with X. Huang and D.\nZaitsev, established a rigidity result for CR embeddings $f$ into spheres in\nlow codimensions. A key step in the proof of this result was to show that\ndegenerate mappings are necessarily contained a complex plane section of the\ntarget sphere (partial rigidity). In the 2004 paper, it was shown that if the\ntotal rank $d$ of the second fundamental form and all of its covariant\nderivatives is $<n$ (here, $n$ is the CR dimension of $M$), then $f(M)$ is\ncontained in a complex plane of dimension $n+d+1$.

As a result, PSWFs\nare becoming increasing popular in various areas in which such function occur -\nthis includes physics (e.g. wave phenomena, fluid dynamics), engineering (e.g.\nsignal processing, filter design), etc.\n  To use PSWFs as a computational tool, one needs fast and accurate numerical\nalgorithms for the evaluation of PSWFs and related quantities, as well as for\nthe construction of quadratures, interpolation formulas, etc. Even though, for\nthe last half a century, substantial progress has been made in design of such\nalgorithms, the complexity of many of the existing algorithms, however, is at\nleast quadratic in the band limit $c$. For example, the evaluation of the $n$th\neigenvalue of the prolate integral operator requires at least $O(c^2)$\noperations.

This is used to define the notion of a Moishezon\ntwistor space: this is a twistor space $\\Tw(X)$ admitting a holomorphic\nembedding to a Moishezon variety $M'$. We show that this property is local on\n$X$, and the variety $M'$ is unique up to birational transform. We prove that\nthe twistor spaces of hyperkahler manifolds obtained by hyperkahler reduction\nof flat quaternionic-Hermitian spaces by the action of reductive Lie groups\n(such as Nakajima's quiver varieties) are always Moishezon. \n\n"}

While simple formulations exist for the\nenergy of a deformed elastic rod, it is not clear whether or not they are also\nappropriate for a chain of spherical magnets.

We\nthen apply our differentiability results to prove Demailly's transcendental\nMorse inequality for these particular classes of K\\\"ahler manifolds. In the\nsecond part, we construct the convex body $\\Delta(\\alpha)$ for any big class\n$\\alpha$ with respect to a fixed flag by using positive currents, and prove\nthat this newly defined convex body coincides with the Okounkov body when\n$\\alpha\\in {\\rm NS}\\_{\\mathbb{R}}(X)$; such convex sets $\\Delta(\\alpha)$ will\nbe called generalized Okounkov bodies.

TDM is a composite made by cold forging a mix of\nrubber fibers and grains, obtained by grinding scrap tires, and polyurethane\nbinder. The mechanical properties are highly influenced by the presence of\nvoids associated with the granular composition and low tensile strength due to\nthe weak connection at the grain-matrix interface. For these reasons, TDM use\nis restricted to applications concerning a limited range of deformations.\nExperimental tests show that a central feature of the response is connected to\nhighly nonlinear behavior of the material under volumetric deformation which\nconventional hyperelastic models fail in predicting. The strain energy function\npresented here is a variant of the exponentiated Hencky strain energy proposed\nby Neff et al., which for moderate strains is as good as the quadratic Hencky\nmodel and in the large strain region improves several important features from a\nmathematical point of view. The proposed form of the exponentiated Hencky\nenergy possesses a set of parameters uniquely determined in the infinitesimal\nstrain regime and an orthogonal set of parameters to determine the nonlinear\nresponse. The hyperelastic model is additionally incorporated in a finite\ndeformation viscoelasticity framework that accounts for the two main\ndissipation mechanisms in TDMs, one at the microscale level and one at the\nmacroscale level. The model is capable of predicting different deformation\nmodes in a certain range of frequency and amplitude with a unique set of\nparameters with most of them having a clear physical meaning.

The said\nlattice eventually coincides with the lattice of all orthogonal projectors on a\nseparable Hilbert space over R, C, or over the algebra of quaternions H.\nQuantum states are $\\sigma$-additive probability measures on that non-Boolean\nlattice.

The extension of this result to quaternionic Hilbert\nspaces was obtained by Varadarajan in 1968. Unfortunately, even if the hard\npart of the proof is correct, the formulation of this extension is\nmathematically incorrect.

Solutions of such systems\nexist globally and are unique up until the first time they hit the origin, $t =\nt_b$, which we term `blowup'. However, infinitely many solutions may exist for\nlonger times. To study continuation past blowup, we introduce physically\nmotivated regularizations: they consist of smoothing the vector field in a\n$\\nu$--ball around the origin and then removing the regularization in the limit\n$\\nu\\to 0$. We show that this limit can be understood using a certain\nautonomous dynamical system obtained by a solution-dependent renormalization\nprocedure.

One reason for the interest in this notion is that\na measure has finite Assouad dimension if and only if it is doubling.\n  Motivated by recent progress on both the Assouad dimension of measures that\nsatisfy a strong separation condition and the quasi-Assouad dimension of metric\nspaces, we introduce the notion of the quasi-Assouad dimension of a measure. As\nwith sets, the quasi-Assouad dimension of a measure is dominated by its Assouad\ndimension. It dominates both the quasi-Assouad dimension of its support and the\nsupremal local dimension of the measure, with strict inequalities possible in\nall cases.\n  Our main focus is on self-similar measures in $\\mathbb{R}$ whose support is\nan interval and which may have `overlaps'.

The\ncharacterizations are done both in terms of the underlying elliptic curve and\ndivisors on it and in terms of polynomial functional equations, like Pell's\nequation. This new approach also sheds light on some classical results. In\nparticular we connect search for caustics which generate periodic trajectories\nwith three classical classes of extremal polynomials on two intervals,\nintroduced by Zolotarev and Akhiezer. The main classifying tool are winding\nnumbers, for which we provide several interpretations, including one in terms\nof numbers of points of alternance of extremal polynomials. The latter implies\nimportant inequality between the winding numbers, which as a consequence,\nprovides another proof of monotonicity of rotation numbers. A complete catalog\nof billiard trajectories with small periods is provided for $n=3, 4, 5, 6$\nalong with an effective search for caustics. As a byproduct, an intriguing\nconnection between Cayle type conditions and discriminantly separable\npolynomials has been observed for all those small periods. \n\n"}

The linear theory is based on the discrete\nCauchy-Riemann equations, the nonlinear one is based on the notion of circle\npatterns. We clarify the role of the rhombic condition in both theories: under\nthis condition the corresponding equations are integrable (in the sense of 3D\nconsistency, which yields also the existense of zero curvature representations,\nB\"acklund transformations etc.). We demonstrate that in some precise sense the\nlinear theory is a linearization of the nonlinear one: the tangent space to a\nset of integrable circle patterns at an isoradial point consists of discrete\nholomorphic functions which take real (imaginary) values on two sublattices.

This property is no longer valid\nfor other values of the parameters; in general, zeros are complex. In this\npaper we study the strong asymptotics of Jacobi polynomials where the real\nparameters $\\alpha_n,\\beta_n$ depend on $n$ in such a way that $$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{n}=A, \\quad\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\beta_{n}}{n}=B, $$ with $A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

As such, it may\nbe taken as an extension of the techniques given by Borwein's \"An efficient\nalgorithm for computing the Riemann zeta function\", to more general series. The\nalgorithm provides a rapid means of evaluating Li_s(z) for general values of\ncomplex s and the region of complex z values given by |z^2/(z-1)|<4.\n  Alternatively, the Hurwitz zeta can be very rapidly evaluated by means of an\nEuler-Maclaurin series. The polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta are related, in\nthat two evaluations of the one can be used to obtain a value of the other;\nthus, either algorithm can be used to evaluate either function. The\nEuler-Maclaurin series is a clear performance winner for the Hurwitz zeta,\nwhile the Borwein algorithm is superior for evaluating the polylogarithm in the\nkidney-shaped region. Both algorithms are superior to the simple Taylor's\nseries or direct summation.\n  The primary, concrete result of this paper is an algorithm allows the\nexploration of the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip, where fast algorithms\nare otherwise unavailable. A discussion of the monodromy group of the\npolylogarithm is included. \n\n"}

For fixed $\\nu\\in M^1([0,\\infty[)$ and each\ndimension p, we consider i.i.d. $R^p$-valued random variables $X_1^p,X_2^p,...$\nwith radial laws corresponding to $\\nu$ as above. We derive weak and strong\nlaws of large numbers as well as a large deviation principle for the Euclidean\nlength processes $S_k^p:=\\|X_1^p+...+X_k^p\\|$ as k,p\\to\\infty in suitable ways.\n  In fact, we derive these results in a higher rank setting, where $R^p$ is\nreplaced by the space of $p\\times q$ matrices and $[0,\\infty[$ by the cone\n$\\Pi_q$ of positive semidefinite matrices. Proofs are based on the fact that\nthe $(S_k^p)_{k\\ge 0}$ form Markov chains on the cone whose transition\nprobabilities are given in terms Bessel functions $J_\\mu$ of matrix argument\nwith an index $\\mu$ depending on p. The limit theorems follow from new\nasymptotic results for the $J_\\mu$ as $\\mu\\to \\infty$. Similar results are also\nproven for certain Dunkl-type Bessel functions. \n\n"}
