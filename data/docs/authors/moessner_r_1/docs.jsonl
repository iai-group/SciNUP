We consider\nthe simplest non-trivial quasi-2D and quasi-1D Fermi surfaces but allow for an\narbitrary elastic collision integral (i.e., a scattering probability with\narbitrary dependence on momentum-transfer) and obtain an expression for the\nresistivity which generalizes that previously found using a single\nrelaxation-time approximation. The dependence of the resistivity on the angle\nbetween the magnetic field and current changes depending on the\nmomentum-dependence of the scattering probability.

In this method,\nthe entire potential energy landscape (PEL) may be accessed simultaneously\nthrough a delocalized wave-function, in contrast to a classical search, where\nthe searcher has to visit different points in the landscape (i.e., individual\nclassical configurations) sequentially. Thus in such searches, the role of the\npotential energy might be significantly different in the two cases.

Unfortunately, due to the prohibitively large\ndynamic range required, it is impossible to self-consistently include these\nsystems in cosmological simulations. Using fast and versatile semi-numeric\nsimulations, we systematically explore the spatial distribution of absorption\nsystems during and following reionization. We self-calibrate the resulting\nnumber of absorbers to the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing ultraviolet\nbackground (UVB), and present results at a given mfp and neutral hydrogen\nfraction. We use a simple optical depth criterion to identify the locations of\nabsorbers. Our approach is fairly robust to uncertainties such as missing\nsubgrid structure. Unlike at lower redshifts where the UVB is relatively\nuniform, at higher redshifts the fluctuations in the UVB and the HII morphology\nof reionization can drive the large-scale distribution of absorption systems.\nSpecifically, we find that absorbers are highly correlated with the density\nfield on small scales, and then become anti-correlated with the UVB on large\nscales. After reionization, the large-scale power spectrum of the absorbers\ntraces the UVB power spectrum, which can be predicted with a simple analytic\nextension of the halo-model. During reionization, absorbers tend to\npreferentially lie inside overdensities (i.e. filaments) of the\nrecently-ionized intergalactic medium (IGM). Absorbers may also dominate the\nsmall-scale (k > 1/Mpc) 21-cm power during and after reionization. Conversely,\nthey smooth the contrast on moderate scales. Once the HII regions grow to\nsurpass the mfp, the absorbers add to the large-scale 21-cm power.

In\nthe conventional Stoner-Wohlfarth model, the ferromagnetic ordering of iron\nsets in so that the electrons can reduce their mutual Coulomb repulsion at the\nextra cost of some increase of electron kinetic energy. Density functional\ntheory within the spin polarized local density approximation (LDA) has long\nsupported that picture, showing that ferromagnetic alignment causes band\nnarrowing and a corresponding wavefunction localization, whence a kinetic\nenergy increase. However, because of its inadequate treatment of strong\nintra-site correlations for localized d orbitals, LDA cannot be relied upon,\nparticularly when it comes to separately describing fine potential and kinetic\nenergy imbalances. With ab-initio Gutzwiller+LDA, we indeed find that the\neffect of correlations is to dramatically reverse the balance, the\nferromagnetic ordering of Fe in fact causing a decrease of kinetic energy, at\nthe cost of some increase of potential energy. The underlying physical\nmechanism, foreshadowed long ago by Goodenough and others, and more recently\nsupported by LDA+DMFT calculations, is that correlations cause eg and t2g 3d\norbitals to behave very differently. Weakly dispersive eg states are\nspin-polarized and almost localized, while, more than half filled, the t2g are\nbroad band, fully delocalized states. Owing to intra-atomic Hund's rule\nexchange which aligns eg and t2g spins, the propagation of itinerant t2g holes\nis only allowed when different atomic spins are ferromagnetically aligned.

In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals\nof motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in\nthese systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local\nintegrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a\nlocal particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's\nHamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such\noperators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL\nsystem to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents\na density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes\nhow this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely\ndefined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for\ncharacterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and\nnumerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an\nextensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin chain model.

In this paper, using analytic arguments and numerical\nsimulations, we study the behaviour of local observables in an isolated MBL\nsystem following a quantum quench. For the case of a global quench, we find\nthat the local observables reach stationary, highly non-thermal values at long\ntimes as a result of slow dephasing characteristic of the MBL phase. These\nstationary values retain the local memory of the initial state due to the\nexistence of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase. The temporal\nfluctuations around stationary values exhibit universal power-law decay in\ntime, with an exponent set by the localization length and the diagonal entropy\nof the initial state. Such a power-law decay holds for any local observable and\nis related to the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement in the MBL phase.\nThis behaviour distinguishes the MBL phase from both the Anderson insulator\n(where no stationary state is reached), and from the ergodic phase (where\nrelaxation is expected to be exponential). For the case of a local quench, we\nalso find a power-law approach of local observables to their stationary values\nwhen the system is prepared in a mixed state.

Abstract: The blackbody theory of Planck played a seminal role in the development of\nquantum theory at the turn of the past century.

These photons arise from\nnon-interacting normal modes. Here we suggest that certain quantum critical\nstates when heated emit \"radiation\" at all wavelengths and satisfy all the\ncriteria of a blackbody. An important difference is that the \"radiation\" does\nnot necessarily consist of non-interacting photons, but also emergent\nrelativistic bosons or fermions. The examples we provide include emergent\nrelativistic fermions at a topological quantum critical point.

These results follow from the\nobservation that the spreading of operators in random circuits is described by\na `hydrodynamical' equation of motion, despite the fact that random unitary\ncircuits do not have locally conserved quantities (e.g., no conserved energy).\nIn this hydrodynamic picture quantum information travels in a front with a\n`butterfly velocity' $v_{\\text{B}}$ that is smaller than the light cone\nvelocity of the system, while the front itself broadens diffusively in time.\nThe OTOC increases sharply after the arrival of the light cone, but we do\n\\emph{not} observe a prolonged exponential regime of the form $\\sim\ne^{\\lambda_\\text{L}(t-x/v)}$ for a fixed Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_\\text{L}$.\nWe find that the diffusive broadening of the front has important consequences\nfor entanglement growth, leading to an entanglement velocity that can be\nsignificantly smaller than the butterfly velocity. We conjecture that the\nhydrodynamical description applies to more generic ergodic systems and support\nthis by verifying numerically that the diffusive broadening of the operator\nwavefront also holds in a more traditional non-random Floquet spin-chain.

Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved\nquantities (e.g., energy).

The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling\nsheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is\nreversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative\nprocess. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a\npower law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of\nthe conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator\n(OTOC) between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival\nof the ballistic front but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws,\nit develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only\nas a power of time instead of exponentially.

To prove this, we examine the generic band topology of two\ndimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$\nsymmetry. The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real\ntwo band systems.

Moreover, a two-band\nsystem with the Euler class $e_{2}$ has band crossing points whose total\nwinding number is equal to $-2e_2$. Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya\ntheorem fails in systems with a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the\ntopological phase transition between two insulators carrying distinct Euler\nclasses can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation of\nvortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings.

In the case of a singular flat\nband, its Bloch wave function possesses immovable discontinuities generated by\nthe band-crossing with other bands, and thus the vector bundle associated with\nthe flat band cannot be defined. This singularity precludes the compact\nlocalized states from forming a complete set spanning the flat band. Once the\ndegeneracy at the band crossing point is lifted, the singular flat band becomes\ndispersive and can acquire a finite Chern number in general, suggesting a new\nroute for obtaining a nearly flat Chern band. On the other hand, the Bloch wave\nfunction of a nonsingular flat band has no singularity, and thus forms a vector\nbundle. A nonsingular flat band can be completely isolated from other bands\nwhile preserving the perfect flatness. All one-dimensional flat bands belong to\nthe nonsingular class.

Notably, while the system generally favors d-wave pairing,\nthe absence of the particle-hole symmetry necessarily induces parasitic s-wave\npairing. Based on the Landau theory with $SO(3)$ symmetry, we demonstrate that\ntwo kinds of topological superconductors are energetically favored; uniaxial\nnematic phase with parasitic $s$ wave pairing ($d_{(3z^2-r^2)}\\!+\\!s$) and\ntime-reversal-symmetry broken phase with parasitic $s$ wave pairing\n($d_{(3z^2-r^2,xy)}\\!+\\!id_{x^2-y^2}\\!+\\!s$). These superconductors contain\neither nodal lines or Fermi pockets of gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles and\nmoreover exhibit topological winding numbers $\\pm2$, leading to non-trivial\nsurface states such as drumhead-like surface states or Fermi arcs. We discuss\napplications of our theory to relevant families of materials, especially\nhalf-heusler compound YPtBi, and suggest possible future experiments. \n\n"}

This follows from their tacit,\nintermediate result, whereby CDM halos of galaxies have a very nearly universal\nacceleration profile $a(r)\\approx v^2(r)/r\\approx A\\hat a(r/\\ell)$, where A is\nuniversal, and only the scale $\\ell$ varies from halo to halo.

The\nresults show a significant dependence with all these parameters. Though we note\nthat this degeneracy could be partially raised by considering two populations\nof sources, at different redshifts, computing the third moment is more\npromising since it is expected, in the quasi-linear regime and for Gaussian\ninitial conditions, to be only $\\Omega_0$ dependent (with a slight degeneracy\nwith Lambda) when it is correctly expressed in terms of the second moment.\n  More precisely we show that the variance of the convergence varies\napproximately as P(k) Omega_0^{1.5} z_s^{1.5}, whereas the skewness varies as\nOmega_0^{-0.8} z_s^{-1.35}, where P(k) is the projected power spectrum and z_s\nthe redshift of sources.

If one normalises to galaxy clustering, with $M/L$ fixed\nby small-scale galaxy dynamics, then low density models predict a much stronger\ndistortion.

We have calculated these terms and show that\nthey have only little influence on the value of T$_c$ obtained in the leading\norder O(1/N) in the optimal and overdoped region, i.e., for dopings larger than\nthe instability towards a flux phase. This result disagrees with recent\nspin-fluctuation mediated pairing theories. The discrepancies can be traced\nback to the fact that in our case the coupling between electrons and spins is\ndetermined by the t-J model and not adjusted and that the spin susceptibility\nis rather broad and structureless and not strongly peaked at low energies as in\nspin-fluctuation models.

Indeed, in this kind of crystals, any interaction between a charge\ncarrier and an elementary magnetic cell can breaks the RCS of this previous\ngiven cell by varying, in the simplest case, the continuous defining parameters\nof the initial RCS.

The\nobservation of a pseudogap, e.g. in ARPES experiments, is a familiar example of\nthis physics. One potential explanation for this behaviour involves preformed\npairs with finite lifetimes existing in the normal state above T$_c$. In this\nway two characteristic temperatures can be established. A higher one T$^*$ at\nwhich pairs begin to form and the actual T$_c$ at which a phase-coherent\nsuperconducting phase is established.\n  In order to test these ideas we have investigated the negative U Hubbard\nmodel in two dimensions in the fully self-consistent ladder approximation at\nlow electron densities.

{"id": "cond-mat/9911286", "contents": "Title: Gapped Phases of Quantum Wires Abstract: We investigate possible nontrivial phases of a two-subband quantum wire. It\nis found that inter- and intra-subband interactions may drive the electron\nsystem of the wire into a gapped state. If the nominal electron densities in\nthe two subbands are sufficiently close to each other, then the leading\ninstability is the inter-subband charge-density wave (CDW). For large density\nimbalance, the interaction in the inter-subband Cooper channel may lead to a\nsuperconducting instability. The total charge-density mode, responsible for the\nconductance of an ideal wire, always remains gapless, which enforces the\ntwo-terminal conductance to be at the universal value of 2e^2/h per occupied\nsubband. On the contrary, the tunneling density of states (DOS) in the bulk of\nthe wire acquires a hard gap, above which the DOS has a non-universal\nsingularity. This singularity is weaker than the square-root divergency\ncharacteristic for non-interacting quasiparticles near a gap edge due to the\n\"dressing\" of massive modes by a gapless total charge density mode. The DOS for\ntunneling into the end of a wire in a CDW-gapped state preserves the power-law\nbehavior due to the frustration the edge introduces into the CDW order.
