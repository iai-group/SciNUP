Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in\nluminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the\ncosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to\nbe associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material\nused to build galaxies.

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

There are a few lunar masses of optically thin hot\nH2 in the inner disk (~0.1 AU) of LkHa 264, and less than a tenth of a lunar\nmass of hot H2 in the inner disk of 49 Cet. The measured 1-0 S(0)/1-0 S(1) and\n2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) line ratios in LkHa 264 indicate that the H2 emitting gas is\nat T<1500 K and that the H2 is most likely thermally excited by UV photons.\nModeling of the shape of the line suggests that the disk should be seen close\nto face-on (i<35). A comparative analysis of the physical properties of CTTS in\nwhich the H2 1-0 S(1) line has been detected and non-detected indicates that\nthe presence of H2 emission is correlated with the magnitude of the UV excess\nand the strength of the Halpha line. The lack of H2 emission in the NIR spectra\nof 49 Cet and the absence of Halpha emission suggest that the gas in the inner\ndisk of 49 Cet has dissipated. The disk surrounding 49 Cet should have an inner\nhole. \n\n"}

The system typically\nevolves toward a \"standard\" steady state, with no sharp edge and SB \\propto\nr**-3.5 outside the birth ring. Deviations from this standard profile, in the\nform of a sharp outer edge and a steeper fall-off, occur only when two\nparameters take their extreme values: 1) When the birth ring is so massive that\nit becomes radially optically thick for the smallest grains.

In this situation,\nthe standard method used to determine the behavior of cosmological\nperturbations breaks down. We present a generic method, based on the uniform\napproximation, to analytically derive the power spectra of scalar and tensor\nperturbations. For this purpose, a simple hierarchy of parameters, related to\nthe sound speed of the cosmological fluctuations and its successive\nderivatives, is introduced in a k-inflation analogue of the Hubble flow\nfunctions. The scalar spectral index and its running are obtained up to next to\nnext to leading order for all k-inflationary models. This result relies on the\nexistence of a well-motivated initial state, which is not trivial in the\npresent context: having the wavelength of the Fourier mode smaller than the\nsonic horizon is indeed not enough and some conditions on the dynamics of the\nsound speed are also required.

Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side).

The\nmodel is applicable in simulations in which individual star forming regions -\nthe giant molecular complexes - can be identified (resolution of tens of pc)\nand their mean internal density estimated reliably, even if internal structure\nis not resolved. In agreement with previous studies, calculations based on our\nmodel show that the transition from atomic to fully molecular phase depends\nprimarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly related to the dust\nabundance, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium. The clumpiness simply\nboosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as a\ncatalyst of molecular hydrogen formation and as an additional shielding from\ndissociating UV radiation. The upshot is that it is difficult to form\nfully-shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low. However,\nonce the gas is enriched to Z ~ 0.01-0.1 solar, the subsequent star formation\nand enrichment can proceed at a much faster rate.

If one of such additional fields - a 'modulaton' - is light, then its\nfluctuations, acquired during the earlier stages of inflation, will induce a\nspatial modulation of the trapping, and thus of the end of inflation,\ncorresponding to a curvature perturbation. We calculate the power spectrum,\nbispectrum and trispectrum of the curvature perturbations generated by this\nmechanism, taking into account the perturbations due to the inflaton\nfluctuations as well.

From the simulation results, we confirm the expectations based on\nanalytic arguments that the Vainshtein mechanism does operate as anticipated,\nwith the density power spectrum approaching that of standard gravity within a\nmodified background evolution in the nonlinear regime. The transition is very\nbroad and there is no well defined Vainshtein scale, but roughly this\ncorresponds to k_*~ 2 at redshift z=1 and k_*~ 1 at z=0.

By comparing\nthe probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy density contrast delta_g\nto the lognormal approximation of the PDF of the mass density contrast delta,\nwe obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,R) between the galaxy and matter\noverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. Over\nthe redshift interval 0.4<z<1 the conditional mean function <delta_g|delta> =\nb(delta,z,R) delta is of the following characteristic shape.

Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the\ninertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered\ntogether. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there\nexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed.

The NEC\nis violated by upward fluctuations of the local Hubble rate, which occur with\nhigh probability in the fluctuation-dominated regime of inflation. These\nfluctuations lead at late times to the formation of black holes and thus limit\nthe observability of inflationary evolution.

We find that\nlarge-scale motions of cluster gas disrupt the AGN jets, causing energy to be\ndistributed throughout the centre of the cluster, rather than confined to a\nnarrow angle around the jet axis.

It exhibits some\napparent peculiarities in its detailed chemical composition, with the elements\nTi, Ni, and Zn being deficient relative to Fe by factors of 2-3. The [Zn/Fe]\nratio is lower than those measured in any other DLA or Galactic halo star,\npresumably reflecting somewhat unusual previous enrichment by stellar\nnucleosynthesis.

A timing error during calibration would not only induce\nan artificial quadrupole-like signal in the mean sky map, it would also add\nvariance per pixel.

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded.

We construct a quark equation of state, based on the\nbag model for strange quark matter. The transition between the hadronic and the\nquark phases is constructed applying Gibbs conditions. The resulting\nquark-hadron hybrid equations of state are used in core-collapse supernova\nsimulations, based on general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics and three\nflavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. The formation of a\nmixed phase reduces the adiabatic index, which induces the gravitational\ncollapse of the central protoneutron star. The collapse halts in the pure quark\nphase, where the adiabatic index increases. A strong accretion shock forms,\nwhich propagates towards the protoneutron star surface. Due to the density\ndecrease of several orders of magnitude, the accretion shock turns into a\ndynamic shock with matter outflow. This moment defines the onset of the\nexplosion in supernova models that allow for a quark-hadron phase transition,\nwhere otherwise no explosions could be obtained. The shock propagation across\nthe neutrinospheres releases a burst of neutrinos. This serves as a strong\nobservable identification for the structural reconfiguration of the stellar\ncore.

Our framework requires the\nmetric to be close to a \"background metric\", but allows arbitrarily large\nstress-energy fluctuations on small scales. We prove that, within our\nframework, if the matter stress-energy tensor satisfies the weak energy\ncondition (i.e., positivity of energy density in all frames), then the only\neffect that small scale inhomogeneities can have on the dynamics of the\nbackground metric is to provide an \"effective stress-energy tensor\" that is\ntraceless and has positive energy density---corresponding to the presence of\ngravitational radiation. In particular, nonlinear effects produced by small\nscale inhomogeneities cannot mimic the effects of dark energy. We also develop\n\"perturbation theory\" off of the background metric.

The magnetic-energy fraction can reach $epsilon_B \\sim$ 0.1\nbut depends on the initial magnetic field strength. We find that the magnetic\nenergy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic\nenergy immediately behind the shock. This minimum degree of the amplification\ndoes not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations, while the\ngrowth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of\ninhomogeneity in the density.

We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the \"Kanata\"\n1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited \"bluer-when-brighter\"\ntrends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to\n88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation\nunambiguously confirmed that the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is common in the\nemission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation\ncomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red\ncomponent. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color\ncorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of\npolarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and\nPKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714.

In ddition to luminosity fading of the stellar content of\nthe spheroids, we carefully consider the variation of the bulge-to-total\nluminosity ratio of the galaxy populations and the M_bh/M_sph ratio, which,\naccording to numerous recent studies, evolves rapidly with redshift. The SMBH\nmass functions derived from the galaxy luminosity and mass functions show very\ngood agreement, both in shape and in normalization. The resultant SMBH mass\nfunction and integrated mass density for the local epoch (z~0) match well those\nderived independently by other studies. Consistent with other evidence for\ncosmic downsizing, the upper end of the mass function remains roughly constant\nsince $z\\approx2$, while the space density of lower mass black holes undergoes\nstrong evolution. We carefully assess the impact of various sources of\nuncertainties on our calculations.

Abstract: (Abridged) We extend our previous studies aimed at modeling Lyman Alpha\nEmitters (LAEs) to the second population of high redshift sources, Lyman Break\nGalaxies (LBGs), with the final goal of investigating the physical relationship\nbetween them at 6 < z <8. We use a set of large (~10^6 Mpc^3) cosmological SPH\nsimulations that include a detailed treatment of star formation, feedback,\nmetal enrichment and supernova dust production; these same simulations have\nalready been shown to successfully reproduce a large number of observed\nproperties of LAEs (Dayal et al. 2010). We identify LBGs as galaxies with an\nabsolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitude M_{UV} <= -17, consistent with current\nobservational criteria. With no further parameter tuning, the model reproduces\nthe redshift evolution of the LBG UV luminosity function, stellar mass\nfunction, and star formation rate (SFR) density extremely well, compared to the\ndata at z~6-8. It predicts a z-independent average beta value of about -2.2,\nconsistent with the most recent observational results. The mean LBG specific\nSFR increases from 6.7 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 6 to 13.9 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 8, and is largest\nfor the smallest LBGs. From a comparison of the simulated LAE and LBG\npopulations, we find no appreciable differences between them in terms of the\nstellar masses, ages, SFR, and dust content; only the faintest LBGs with M_{UV}\n>= -18 (-19) at z ~ 6 (8) do not show an observable Lyman Alpha line. LAEs\nhence represent a luminous LBG subset, whose relative extent depends only on\nthe adopted equivalent width (EW) selection criteria. Further, in line with\ncurrent observations, we find that the fraction of LBGs showing a Lyman Alpha\nline decreases with increasing redshift due to the combined effects of dust and\nreionization. We conclude with a brief critical model discussion, which\nemphasizes the uncertainties inherent to theoretical EW determinations. \n\n"}

When going to\nvery small stellar populations, the stochastic sampling of the IMF will yield\nan inherent spread for the $M/L$ values, which will become probabilistic\nquantities. For the recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies,\nwith total luminosities dropping below 10^3 L_V/L_o, it is important to asses\nthe amplitude of the probabilistic spread in inherent $M/L$ values. The total\nbaryonic masses of these systems are usually estimated from their luminosities,\nassuming fixed, deterministic $M/L$ values, suitable for the infinite\npopulation limit. These total baryonic masses are crucial for the testing of\nstructure formation scenarios, as the local ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals\nrepresent the most extreme galactic scales known.

Giant\nclumps of 10^8-9 Msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-rich\ngalaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feed\nsupermassive black holes (BH). We use emission line diagnostics to compare a\nsample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disks\nat redshift z~0.7. The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high\nprobability of containing AGN. Their [OIII] emission line is strongly excited,\ninconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [NeIII] excitation is\nalso higher. Stable disks rarely have such properties. Stacking ultra sensitive\nChandra observations (4 Ms) reveals an X-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, which\ncannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of AGN. The\nclumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical of\ngas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the Main\nSequence of star formation. This suggests that our findings apply to the\nphysically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z>1.

In systems\naccreting at well below the Eddington rate, such as the central black hole in\nthe Milky Way (Sgr A*), the rate of Coulomb collisions between particles is\nvery small, making the disk evolve essentially as a collisionless plasma. We\npresent a nonlinear study of the collisionless MRI using first-principles\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. In this initial study we focus on\nlocal two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations, deferring more realistic\nthree-dimensional simulations to future work. For simulations with net vertical\nmagnetic flux, the MRI continuously amplifies the magnetic field until the\nAlfv\\'en velocity, v_A, is comparable to the speed of light, c (independent of\nthe initial value of v_A/c). This is consistent with the lack of saturation of\nMRI channel modes in analogous axisymmetric MHD simulations. The amplification\nof the magnetic field by the MRI generates a significant pressure anisotropy in\nthe plasma (with the perpendicular pressure being larger than the parallel\npressure). We find that this pressure anisotropy in turn excites mirror modes\nand that the volume averaged pressure anisotropy remains near the threshold for\nmirror mode excitation. Particle energization is due to both reconnection and\nviscous heating associated with the pressure anisotropy. Reconnection produces\na distinctive power-law component in the energy distribution function of the\nparticles, indicating the likelihood of non-thermal ion and electron\nacceleration in collisionless accretion disks.

As predicted by General Relativity, given their\nmasses, clusters strongly deform space-time in their vicinity. Clusters act as\nsome of the most powerful gravitational lenses in the Universe. Light rays\ntraversing through clusters from distant sources are hence deflected, and the\nresulting images of these distant objects therefore appear distorted and\nmagnified. Lensing by clusters occurs in two regimes, each with unique\nobservational signatures. The strong lensing regime is characterized by effects\nreadily seen by eye, namely, the production of giant arcs, multiple-images, and\narclets. The weak lensing regime is characterized by small deformations in the\nshapes of background galaxies only detectable statistically. Cluster lenses\nhave been exploited successfully to address several important current questions\nin cosmology: (i) the study of the lens(es) - understanding cluster mass\ndistributions and issues pertaining to cluster formation and evolution, as well\nas constraining the nature of dark matter; (ii) the study of the lensed objects\n- probing the properties of the background lensed galaxy population - which is\nstatistically at higher redshifts and of lower intrinsic luminosity thus\nenabling the probing of galaxy formation at the earliest times right up to the\nDark Ages; and (iii) the study of the geometry of the Universe - as the\nstrength of lensing depends on the ratios of angular diameter distances between\nthe lens, source and observer, lens deflections are sensitive to the value of\ncosmological parameters and offer a powerful geometric tool to probe Dark\nEnergy.

The unique spectral and temporal capabilities of the XRT\nWindowed Timing mode have allowed us to extend the GBM spectral coverage for\nthese events down to the X-ray domain (0.5-10 keV). Our earlier analysis of the\nGBM data found that the SGR J1550-5418 burst spectra were described equally\nwell with a Comptonized model or with two blackbody functions; the two models\nwere statistically indistinguishable. Our new broadband (0.5 - 200 keV)\nspectral fits show that, on average, the burst spectra are better described\nwith two blackbody functions than with the Comptonized model. Thus, our joint\nXRT/GBM analysis clearly shows for the first time that the SGR J1550-5418 burst\nspectra might naturally be expected to exhibit a more truly thermalized\ncharacter, such as a two-blackbody or even a multi-blackbody signal.

Rotating Radio Transients are radio pulsars which are best\ndetectable in single-pulse searches. The Lorimer burst is a highly dispersed\nisolated radio burst with properties suggestive of extragalactic origin.\nPerytons share the frequency-swept nature of the Rotating Radio Transients and\nLorimer burst, but unlike these events appear in all thirteen beams of the\nParkes Multibeam receiver and are probably a form of peculiar radio frequency\ninterference.

Since the observations are limited to the local\nUniverse (halo stars, globular clusters and satellites of the Milky Way) it is\npossible that certain physical processes may have led to the spatial separation\nof lithium and local reduction of [Li/H].

Large scattering cross sections on the rest of the ionized\ngas leads to strong coupling of lithium to protons and its initial direction of\ndiffusion coincides with that of H$^+$.

Here, we\ninvestigate the escape of Lya, non-ionizing UV-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600\nangstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l < 912 angstrom) from galaxies\nby combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensional\nmulti-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The galaxies are simulated in\na box of 5^3 h^-3 Mpc^3 with high resolutions using the Aquila initial\ncondition which reproduces a Milky Way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. We find\nthat the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complex\ndependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(Lya) and fesc(UV) appear to\nevolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxy\nproperties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, while\nfesc(Ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does not\nshow clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(Lya) correlates more strongly\nwith fesc(UV) than with fesc(Ion).

Nevertheless, density\nprofiles often rely either on the simplifying assumption of isothermality or on\nobservationally poorly constrained model temperature profiles. With the aim of\nbetter constraining the initial physical conditions in molecular cloud cores at\nthe onset of protostellar collapse, we initiated the Guaranteed Time Key\nProject (GTKP) \"The Earliest Phases of Star Formation\" (EPoS) with the Herschel\nsatellite.

For the centroid of the\ncyclotron line, the photon index and the flux of the 6.4 keV iron line, we have\nstudied the variation as a function of 35 d phase. We analyzed RXTE\nobservations of the Main-On of November 2002. Four different time intervals of\nabout 1 d duration were selected to provide a good coverage of a complete\nMain-On. The intervals are centered at 35 d phase 0.03, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20,\nrespectively. All spectral parameters show a strong modulation with pulse\nphase. While the centroid energy of the cyclotron line follows roughly the\nshape of the pulse profile, both the photon index and the iron line intensity\nexhibit distinct minima around the peak of the X-ray pulse.

Multi-planet\nevolved systems are particularly complex because of the mutual interactions\nbetween the planets. Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize\nmaps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and\nchaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape.

The HST-based CMDs are >2 magnitudes deeper than any from ground based\nobservations, and are particularly superior in high surface brightness regions,\ne.g., the LMC bar, which contain a significant fraction of star formation and\nare crowding limited from ground based observations. To minimize systematic\nuncertainties, we derive the SFH of each field using an identical maximum\nlikelihood CMD fitting technique.

We find that both galaxies lack a dominant burst\nof early star formation, which suggests either a suppression or an\nunder-fueling of early star formation.

Aims: This paper shows that the sensitivity of the IceCube\nneutrino telescope in its 40-string configuration (IC-40) is already at the\nlevel of constraining the parameter space of purely hadronic scenarios of\nactivity of blazars. Methods: Assuming that the entire source power originates\nfrom hadronic interactions, and assuming that the models describe the data, we\nestimate the expected neutrino flux from blazars based on the observed\ngamma-ray flux by Fermi, simultaneously with IC-40 observations. We consider\ntwo cases separately to keep the number of constrainable parameters at an\nacceptable level: proton-proton or proton-gamma interactions are dominant.\nComparing the IC-40 sensitivity to the neutrino flux expected from some of the\nbrightest blazars, we constrain model parameters characterizing the parent\nhigh-energy proton spectrum.

We are able to reproduce\nat best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-out\nformation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formation\nalong the disk and radial gas flows. It is particularly important the choice of\nthe velocity pattern for radial flows and the combination of this velocity\npattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo.

We derived global characteristics of the galaxies, such\nas their element abundances, luminosities, and stellar masses. The luminosities\nand stellar masses range within the sample over ~5 orders of magnitude, thereby\nlinking low-mass and low-luminosity blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies to\nluminous galaxies, which are similar to high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies\n(LBGs).

To increase the detection rate of jets in LLAGN, we analyze\nsubarcsecond resolution data of three low-ionization nuclear emission regions.\nThis yields the detection of extended jet-like radio structures in NGC\\,1097\nand NGC\\,2911 and the first resolved parsec-scale jet of NGC\\,4594 (Sombrero).\nThe three sources belong to a sample of nearby LLAGN for which\nhigh-spatial-resolution spectral energy distribution of their core emission is\navailable. This allows us to study their accretion rate and jet power\n($Q_\\mathrm{jet}$) without drawing on (most) of the ad hoc assumptions usually\nconsidered in large statistical surveys. We find that those LLAGN with\nlarge-scale radio jets ($>$100 pc) have $Q_\\mathrm{jet} > 10^{42}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, while the lowest $Q_\\mathrm{jet}$ correspond to those LLAGN with\nparsec-scale ($\\leq$100 pc) jets. The $Q_\\mathrm{jet}$ is at least as large as\nthe radiated bolometric luminosity for all LLAGN, in agreement with previous\nstatistical studies. Our detection of parsec-scale jets in individual objects\nfurther shows that the kinematic jet contribution is equally important in\nlarge- or parsec-scale objects. We also find that the Eddington-scaled\naccretion rate is still highly sub-Eddington ($<10^{-4}$) when adding the\n$Q_\\mathrm{jet}$ to the total emitted luminosity (radiated plus kinetic). This\nindicates that LLAGN are not only inefficient radiators but that they also\naccrete inefficiently or are very efficient advectors. \n\n"}

In this work, we\ntest this issue by exploring hard X-ray spectral evolution in four black-hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs) with multiple, quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray\nobservations.

Secondly and most importantly, we find that the\nradio-X-ray correlations are also clearly different when the X-ray fluxes are\nhigher and lower than the critical flux that defined by X-ray spectral\nevolution.

Such processes are generically present in\nmulti-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization\nsymmetries. As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal\nrelic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions\nwith the standard model and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds.\nInstead, its thermal relic abundance is set by annihilation into a subdominant\nlighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted channel via\nthe same annihilation process occurring today.

The slow rotators are much rounder, and are well\ndescribed with a Gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09.

We report\non a survey for X-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2)\nclusters of galaxies selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the\nSouth Pole Telescope data. Based on Chandra X-ray images, we find a total of 6\nclusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistent\nwith the picture of radio jets inflating X-ray cavities in the intracluster\nmedium. The majority of these detections are of relatively low significance and\nrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. Further, due to the\nlimitations of Chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (<10 kpc),\nunresolved X-ray cavities at high (z>0.5) redshift. Despite these limitations,\nour results suggest that the power generated by AGN feedback in brightest\ncluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of the\nUniverse (>7 Gyrs at z=0.8). On average, the detected X-ray cavities have\npowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.\nIntegrating over 7 Gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in the\nbrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9M_sun of\nmaterial to power these outflows. This level of accretion indicates that\nsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,\nin the quasar era, but at late times as well. We also find that X-ray cavities\nat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 keV per particle into the\nhot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.\nThis value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, break\nself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres. \n\n"}

For scalar-tensor theories that allow for spontaneous\nscalarization, the crust thickness can be significantly smaller than in general\nrelativity. We derive the perturbation equation describing torsional\noscillations in scalar-tensor theory, and we solve the corresponding eigenvalue\nproblem to find the oscillation frequencies.

Torsional oscillation frequencies may yield information on the\ncrust microphysics if microphysics effects are not degenerate with\nstrong-gravity effects, such as those due to scalarization. To address this\nissue, we consider two different models for the equation of state of the crust\nand we look at the effects of electron screening.

In cases where this process takes place it can be an alternative to the\nCE evolution where the secondary star is immerses in the giant's envelope. The\ngrazing envelope evolution (GEE) is made possible only if the companion manages\nto accrete mass at a high rate and launch jets that remove the outskirts of the\ngiant envelope, hence preventing the formation of a CE . The high accretion\nrate is made possible by the accretion disk that launches jets that efficiently\ncarry the excess angular momentum and energy from the accreted mass. The\norbital decay itself is caused by the gravitational interaction of the\nsecondary star with the envelope inward to its orbit, i.e., dynamical friction\n(gravitational tide).

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

As a first step to compute the tidal Love\nnumbers of a spinning compact star, here we extend powerful perturbative\ntechniques to compute the exterior geometry of a spinning object distorted by\nan axisymmetric tidal field to second order in the angular momentum. The spin\nof the object introduces couplings between electric and magnetic deformations\nand new classes of induced Love numbers emerge. For example, a spinning object\nimmersed in a quadrupolar, electric tidal field can acquire some induced mass,\nspin, quadrupole, octupole and hexadecapole moments to second order in the\nspin.

Although initially the jet is kinematically dominated, we have\nconsidered axial, toroidal and helical magnetic fields to investigate the\neffects of different magnetic-field topologies and strengths on the\nrecollimation structures.

The fractional contributions of stellar mass loss to the cosmic star\nformation rate (SFR) and stellar mass densities increase with time, reaching\n$35 \\%$ and $19 \\%$, respectively, at $z=0$. The importance of recycling\nincreases steeply with galaxy stellar mass for $M_{\\ast} < 10^{10.5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, and decreases mildly at higher mass. This trend arises from the\nmass dependence of feedback associated with star formation and AGN, which\npreferentially suppresses star formation fuelled by recycling. Recycling is\nmore important for satellites than centrals and its contribution decreases with\ngalactocentric radius. The relative contribution of AGB stars increases with\ntime and towards galaxy centers. This is a consequence of the more gradual\nrelease of AGB ejecta compared to that of massive stars, and the preferential\nremoval of the latter by star formation-driven outflows and by lock up in\nstellar remnants. Recycling-fuelled star formation exhibits a tight, positive\ncorrelation with galaxy metallicity, with a secondary dependence on the\nrelative abundance of alpha elements (which are predominantly synthesized in\nmassive stars), that is insensitive to the subgrid models for feedback. Hence,\nour conclusions are directly relevant for the origin of the mass-metallicity\nrelation and metallicity gradients.

The\nATIC-2 experiment has recently reported an unexpected spectral upturn in the\nelemental ratios involving iron, such as the C/Fe or O/Fe ratios, at energy\nabove 50 GeV per nucleon. It is recognized that the observed positron excess\ncan be explained by pion production processes during diffusive shock\nacceleration of cosmic-ray hadrons in nearby sources. Recently, it was\nsuggested that a scenario with nearby source dominating the GeV-TeV spectrum\nmay be connected with the change of slope observed in protons and nuclei, which\nwould be interpreted as a flux transition between the local component and the\nlarge-scale distribution of Galactic sources. Here I show that, under a\ntwo-component scenario with nearby source, the shape of the spectral transition\nis expected to be slightly different for heavy nuclei, such as iron, because\ntheir propagation range is spatially limited by inelastic collisions with the\ninterstellar matter. This enables a prediction for the primary/primary ratios\nbetween light and heavy nuclei. From this effect, a spectral upturn is\npredicted in the C/Fe and O/Fe ratios in good accordance with the ATIC-2 data. \n\n"}

We conduct a\nlarge population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational\npotential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar\nspin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar\nspin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking. We consider a range of\nplanet masses ($0.3-5\\,M_J$) and initial semi-major axes ($1-5$AU), different\nproperties for the host star, and varying tidal dissipation strengths. The\nfraction of systems that result in HJs depends on planet mass and stellar type,\nwith $f_{\\rm HJ} = 1-4\\%$ (depending on tidal dissipation strength) for\n$M_p=1\\,M_J$, and larger (up to $8\\%$) for more massive planets.

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally.

We perturb about the\nmaximally-rotating Kerr solution, the so-called extremal limit, and develop\nmathematical insight into the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions\nfor generic spin.

We\npost-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infrared\nwavebands using the TORUS code. We find that the outer edge of a wind bubble\nemits brightly at 24um through starlight absorbed by dust grains and\nre-radiated thermally in the infrared. This produces a bright arc of emission\nfor slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases where\nthere is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission.\nThe 24um intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasing\ndistance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance.\nThe size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative but\nnot qualitative effects on our results. Despite the simplifications of our\nmodel, we find good qualitative agreement with observations of the HII region\nRCW120, and can provide physical explanations for any quantitative differences.\nOur model produces an infrared arc with the same shape and size as the arc\naround CD -38 11636 in RCW120, and with comparable brightness. This suggests\nthat infrared arcs around O stars in HII regions may be revealing the extent of\nstellar wind bubbles, although we have not excluded other explanations. \n\n"}

Globular clusters are the best sites to\nexamine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership\nin the cluster and to identify the evolutionary state of each star. In 72 hours\nof Keck/DEIMOS exposures in 25 clusters, we found four Li-rich RGB and two\nLi-rich AGB stars. There were 1696 RGB and 125 AGB stars with measurements or\nupper limits consistent with normal abundances of Li. Hence, the frequency of\nLi-richness in globular clusters is (0.2 +/- 0.1)% for the RGB, (1.6 +/- 1.1)%\nfor the AGB, and (0.3 +/- 0.1)% for all giants. Because the Li-rich RGB stars\nare on the lower RGB, Li self-generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the\nluminosity function bump or He core flash cannot explain these four lower RGB\nstars. We propose the following origin for Li enrichment: (1) All luminous\ngiants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash. (2) All\npost-RGB stars with binary companions on the lower RGB will engage in mass\ntransfer.

{"id": "1601.06787", "contents": "Title: Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) Demographics Abstract: We survey the properties of stars destroyed in TDEs as a function of BH mass,\nstellar mass and evolutionary state, star formation history and redshift. For\nMbh<10^7Msun, the typical TDE is due to a M*~0.3Msun M-dwarf, although the mass\nfunction is relatively flat for $M*<Msun. The contribution from older main\nsequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From\nMbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a\nlarger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved\nstars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which\nis largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in\nany observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun\nBHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates. The typical fall back time is\nrelatively long, with 16% having Tfb<10^(-1) years (37 days), and 84% having\nlonger time scales. Many residual rate discrepancies can be explained if\nsurveys are biased against TDEs with these longer Tfb, which seems very\nplausible if Tfb has any relation to the transient rise time.

One such fundamental issue\nthat remains to be satisfactorily addressed is the transition of the primordial\nperturbations from their quantum origins to the LSS which can be characterized\ncompletely in terms of classical quantities. Classical bouncing universes\nprovide an alternative to the more conventional inflationary paradigm as they\ncan help overcome the horizon problem in a fashion very similar to inflation.\nWhile the problem of the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial\nperturbations has been investigated extensively in the context of inflation, we\nfind that there has been a rather limited effort towards studying the issue in\nclassical bouncing universes. In this work, we analyze certain aspects of this\nproblem with the example of tensor perturbations produced in classical matter\nand near-matter bouncing universes.

The outflow is observed\nas shallow HI absorption blueshifted ~1300 km/s with respect to the systemic\nvelocity and located against the inner kpc of the radio source.

Our results confirm the multiphase nature of the outflow in\nMrk231. Although effects of the interaction between the radio plasma and the\nsurrounding medium cannot be ruled out, the energetics and the lack of a clear\nkpc-scale jet suggest that the most likely origin of the HI outflow is a\nwide-angle nuclear wind, as earlier proposed to explain the neutral outflow\ntraced by NaI and molecular gas. Our results suggest that an HI component is\npresent in fast outflows regardless of the acceleration mechanism (wind vs jet\ndriven) and that it must be connected with common properties of the\npre-interaction gas. Considering the observed similarity of their column\ndensities, the HI outflow likely represents the inner part of the broad wind\nidentified on larger scales in NaI.

Using $N$-body simulations we investigate the\nformation and evolution of spiral arms in a Milky Way-like galaxy orbiting a\nVirgo-like cluster. The galaxy is placed on a few orbits of different size but\nsimilar eccentricity and its evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. The tidally\ninduced, two-armed, approximately logarithmic spiral structure forms on each of\nthem during the pericenter passages. The spiral arms dissipate and wind up with\ntime, to be triggered again at the next pericenter passage.

We address it here using\nscale-free models, for which self-similarity provides a powerful tool to\ncontrol resolution. Such models also provide a robust testing ground for the\nso-called stable clustering approximation, which gives simple predictions for\nthem. Studying large N-body simulations of such models with different force\nsmoothing, we find that these two issues are in fact very closely related: our\nconclusion is that the accuracy of two point statistics in the non-linear\nregime starts to degrade strongly around the scale at which their behaviour\ndeviates from that predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis. Physically\nthe association of the two scales is in fact simple to understand: stable\nclustering fails to be a good approximation when there are strong interactions\nof structures (in particular merging) and it is precisely such non-linear\nprocesses which are sensitive to fluctuations at the smaller scales affected by\ndiscretisation. Resolution may be further degraded if the short distance\ngravitational smoothing scale is larger than the scale to which stable\nclustering can propagate. We examine in detail the very different conclusions\nof studies by Smith et al. (2003) and Widrow et al. (2009} and find that the\nstrong deviations from stable clustering reported by these works are the\nresults of over-optimistic assumptions about scales resolved accurately by the\nmeasured power spectra, and the reliance on Fourier space analysis.

We utilize observations at X-ray,\nUV, optical, and radio wavelengths to infer the properties of two large flares.\nThe X-ray spectrum of the primary outburst can be described over the 0.3-100\nkeV bandpass by either a single very high temperature plasma or a nonthermal\nthick-target bremsstrahlung model, and we rule out the nonthermal model based\non energetic grounds.

The radio afterglow of GRB 111005A was an order of magnitude less\nluminous than those of local low-luminosity GRBs, and obviously than those of\ncosmological GRBs. The radio flux was approximately constant and then\nexperienced an unusually rapid decay a month after the GRB explosion.

Moreover, we\nmeasured twice solar metallicity for the GRB location. The low gamma-ray and\nradio luminosities, rapid decay, lack of a SN, and super-solar metallicity\nsuggest that GRB 111005A represents a different rare class of GRBs than typical\ncore-collapse events.

The threshold halo mass at which gas\nfirst collapses and cools increases with ionizing flux for intermediate values,\nand saturates at a value approximately an order of magnitude above the atomic\ncooling threshold for extremely high flux (e.g. $\\approx 5 \\times 10^8 ~\nM_\\odot$ at $z\\approx6$). This behavior can be understood in terms of\nphotoheating, ionization/recombination, and Ly$\\alpha$ cooling in the\npressure-supported, self-shielded gas core at the center of the growing dark\nmatter halo. We examine the spherically-averaged radial velocity profiles of\ncollapsing gas and find that a gas mass of up to $\\approx 10^{6}~ M_\\odot$ can\nreach the central regions within $3~{\\rm Myr}$, providing an upper limit on the\namount of massive Pop III stars that can form. The ionizing radiation increases\nthis limit by a factor of a few compared to strong Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation\nalone. We conclude that the bright HeII 1640 \\AA\\ emission recently observed\nfrom the high-redshift galaxy CR7 cannot be explained by Pop III stars alone.\nHowever, in some halos, a sufficient number of Pop III stars may form to be\ndetectable with future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). \n\n"}

The clusters are split into nine redshift and richness samples; in each\nof them we detect a positive alignment, showing that clusters point towards\ndensity peaks.

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1.

As a consequence, there\nare strict relationships between the frequency and damping time of the\ndifferent modes of a perturbed Kerr black hole. Testing the no-hair theorem has\nbeen a longstanding goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. The recent detection\nof gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests\nimminent. We investigate how constraints on black hole ringdown parameters\nscale with the loudness of the ringdown signal---subject to the constraint that\nthe post-merger remnant must be allowed to settle into a perturbative,\nKerr-like state. In particular, we require that---for a given detector---the\ngravitational waveform predicted by numerical relativity is indistinguishable\nfrom an exponentially damped sine after time $t^\\text{cut}$. By requiring the\npost-merger remnant to settle into such a perturbative state, we find that\nconfidence intervals for ringdown parameters do not necessarily shrink with\nlouder signals.

Modeling or\nparameterizing these effects is essential in order to extract valuable\nconstraints on cosmological parameters. In a recent paper, Eifler et al. (2015)\nsuggested a reduction technique for baryonic effects by conducting a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and removing the largest baryonic eigenmodes from the\ndata. In this article, we conducted the investigation further and addressed two\ncritical aspects. Firstly, we performed the analysis by separating the\nsimulations into training and test sets, computing a minimal set of principle\ncomponents from the training set and examining the fits on the test set. We\nfound that using only four parameters, corresponding to the four largest\neigenmodes of the training set, the test sets can be fitted thoroughly with an\nRMS $\\sim 0.0011$. Secondly, we explored the significance of outliers, the most\nexotic/extreme baryonic scenarios, in this method. We found that excluding the\noutliers from the training set results in a relatively bad fit and degraded the\nRMS by nearly a factor of 3. Therefore, for a direct employment of this method\nto the tomographic analysis of the weak lensing data, the principle components\nshould be derived from a training set that comprises adequately exotic but\nreasonable models such that the reality is included inside the parameter domain\nsampled by the training set. The baryonic effects can be parameterized as the\ncoefficients of these principle components and should be marginalized over the\ncosmological parameter space. \n\n"}

A key\nadvantage of the BAO as a standard ruler is that it is a sharp feature and\nhence is more robust against broadband systematic effects than other\ncosmological probes. However, if the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest transmission is\nsensitive to the initial streaming velocity of the baryons relative to the dark\nmatter, then the BAO peak position can be shifted.

Streaming velocities suppress small-scale\nstructure, leading to less violent relaxation after reionization.

In ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), can\ngenuine current singularities emerge from a smooth 3D line-tied magnetic field?\nTo numerically resolve this issue, the schemes employed must preserve magnetic\ntopology exactly to avoid artificial reconnection in the presence of singular\ncurrent densities. Structure-preserving numerical methods are favorable for\nmitigating numerical dissipation, and variational integration is a powerful\nmachinery for deriving them. In this thesis, we develop variational integrators\nfor ideal MHD in Lagrangian labeling by discretizing Newcomb's Lagrangian on a\nmoving mesh using discretized exterior calculus. With the built-in frozen-in\nequation, the schemes are free of artificial reconnection, hence optimal for\nstudying current singularity formation.\n  Using this method, we first study a fundamental prototype problem in 2D, the\nHahm-Kulsrud-Taylor (HKT) problem. It considers the effect of boundary\nperturbations on a 2D plasma magnetized by a sheared field, and its linear\nsolution is singular.

Furthermore, the lens-model fitted z_s's of the recent Kawamata\net al. reconstruction are biased systematically low compared to photometric\nz_s's, and the bias is a function of images' distance from the cluster center.\nWe argue that these mimic the effect of LoS.

Usually they are\nmotivated as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. In this case one of their most\nimportant features is that their coupling to other particles is suppressed by a\nlarge scale, the vacuum expectation value of the field breaking the symmetry\nthat gives rise to them. This naturally endows them with very weak interactions\nbut also restricts the maximal field value and therefore the regions where\nsufficient dark matter is produced. In this paper we investigate deviations\nfrom this simplest setup, where the potential and interactions are as expected\nfor a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, but the kinetic term has singularities.\nThis leads to a significantly increased area in parameter space where such\nparticles can be dark matter and can be probed by current and near future\nexperiments. We discuss cosmological limits and in the course of this give a\nsimple derivation of a formula for isocurvature fluctuations in models with\ngeneral anharmonic potentials. As an application of this formula we give an\nupdate of the isocurvature constraints for QCD axion dark matter models, using\nthe most recent results for the QCD topological susceptibility and the newest\nPlanck data. \n\n"}

We find that the observational\nproperties depend mainly on the mass of the exploding object, even if the\nangular momentum evolution after the end of the mass accretion phase and before\nthe onset of C-burning plays a non-negligible role. Just before the explosion\nthe magnitude M_V ranges between 9 and 11 mag, while the colour (F225W-F555W)\nis about -1.64 mag. The photometric properties remain constant for a few\ndecades before the explosion. During the last few months the luminosity\ndecreases very rapidly. The corresponding decline in the optical bands varies\nfrom few hundredths up to one magnitude, the exact value depending on both the\nWD total mass and the braking efficiency at the end of the mass transfer. This\nfeature is related to the exponentially increasing energy production which\ndrives the formation of a convective core rapidly extending over a large part\nof the exploding object.

Gravitational waves (GWs) from\ntheir mergers with other IMBHs or with stellar BHs in the cluster are mostly\nemitted in frequencies <10 Hz, which unfortunately is out of reach for current\nground-based observatories such as advanced LIGO (aLIGO).

Recently, some of the current authors proposed that the\nstochastic nature of the quantum vacuum can resolve this tension [Q, Wang, Z.\nZhu, and W. G. Unruh, Phys. Rev. D 95, 103504, 2017]. By treating the\nfluctuations in the vacuum seriously and allowing fluctuations up to some\nhigh-energy cutoff at which Quantum Field Theory is believed to break down, a\nparametric resonance effect arises that leads to a slow expansion and\nacceleration. In this work, we thoroughly examine the implications of this\nproposal by investigating the resulting dynamics. First, we improve upon\nnumerical calculations in the original work and show that convergence issues\nhad overshadowed some important effects.

In this paper, we focus on $\\omega$ Cen, a peculiar, massive\nGGC that hosts multiple stellar populations. We use non-LTE model atmospheres\nto derive atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g and N(He)/N(H)) and spectroscopic\nmasses for 152 EHB stars in the cluster.

We also search for close binaries among\nthese stars based on radial velocity variations. Our results show that the EHB\npopulation of $\\omega$ Cen is divided into three spectroscopic groups that are\nvery distinct in the Teff - helium abundance plane. The majority of our sample\nconsists of sdOB stars that have roughly solar or super-solar atmospheric\nhelium abundances.

Another major difference between the EHB stars in $\\omega$ Cen\nand the field is the fraction of close binaries. From our radial velocity\nsurvey we identify two binary candidates and estimate an EHB close binary\nfraction of ~5% in $\\omega$ Cen. This low fraction is in line with findings for\nother GGCs, but in sharp contrast to the situation in the field, where around\n50% of the sdB stars reside in close binaries. Finally, the mass distribution\nderived is very similar for all three spectroscopic groups, however the average\nmass (0.38 Msun) is lower than that expected from stellar evolution theory.\nWhile this mass conundrum has previously been noted for EHB stars in $\\omega$\nCen, it so far appears to be unique to that cluster. \n\n"}

Using collisionless\n$N$-body simulations of dwarf galaxy (DG) mergers, we examine how the orbital\ndecay of IMBHs and the efficiency of IMBH binary formation depend on the\ncentral dark matter (DM) density profile of the merging DGs.

Abstract: We performed sensitive observations of the N15ND+(1-0) and 15NND+(1-0) lines\ntoward the prestellar core L1544 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The lines are\nnot detected down to 3 sigma levels in 0.2 km/s channels of around 6 mK. The\nnon-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+ of\n~700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local\nISM of ~200-300. The result indicates that N2 is depleted in 15N in the central\npart of L1544, because N2D+ preferentially traces the cold dense gas, and\nbecause it is a daughter molecule of N2. In-situ chemistry is unlikely\nresponsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase\nchemistry nor isotope selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N\ndepletion; the former prefers transferring 15N to N2, while the latter requires\nthe penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center.

The\nmechanism is the most efficient at the chemical transition from atomic to\nmolecular nitrogen. In other words, our result suggests that the gas in the\ncentral part of L1544 already went trough the transition from atomic to\nmolecular nitrogen in the earlier evolutionary stage, and that N2 is currently\nthe primary form of gas-phase nitrogen. \n\n"}

Centaurs are icy objects in transition between the transneptunian\nregion and the inner solar system, orbiting the Sun in the giant planet region.\nSome Centaurs display cometary activity, which cannot be sustained by the\nsublimation of water ice in this part of the solar system, and has been\nhypothesized to be due to the crystallization of amorphous water ice.\n  Aims. In this work, we look at Centaurs discovered by the Outer Solar System\nOrigins Survey (OSSOS) and search for cometary activity. Tentative detections\nwould improve understanding of the origins of activity among these objects.\n  Methods. We search for comae and structures by fitting and subtracting both\nPoint Spread Functions (PSF) and Trailed point-Spread Functions (TSF) from the\nOSSOS images of each Centaur. When available, Col-OSSOS images were used to\nsearch for comae too.\n  Results. No cometary activity is detected in the OSSOS sample. We track the\nrecent orbital evolution of each new Centaur to confirm that none would\nactually be predicted to be active, and we provide size estimates for the\nobjects.\n  Conclusions. The addition of 20 OSSOS objects to the population of 250 known\nCentaurs is consistent with the currently understood scenario, in which drastic\ndrops in perihelion distance induce changes in the thermal balance prone to\ntrigger cometary activity in the giant planet region. \n\n"}

This work serves as a\nproof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the\nKepler long cadence lightcurves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly,\nBoyajian's Star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier\nidentification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are\nincluded among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to\nidentify known anomalies by identifying unusual behavior in Boyajian's Star, we\nreport the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a\nsample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects\nthat are rare in the Kepler field, and data artifacts. By identifying <4% of\neach quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection\nmethod can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel\nphenomena. \n\n"}

Abstract: Although only about 5 percent of the total baryonic mass in luminous\nelliptical galaxies is in the form of cooled interstellar gas, it is\nconcentrated within the optical effective radius r_e where it influences the\nlocal dynamical mass. The mass of cooled gas must be spatially distributed\nsince it greatly exceeds the masses of central black holes. We explore here the\nproposition that a population of low mass, optically dark stars is created from\nthe cooled gas. We consider a wide variety of radial distributions for the\ninterstellar cooling, but only a few are consistent with observed X-ray surface\nbrightness profiles. In a region of concentrated interstellar cooling, the\nX-ray emission can exceed that observed, suggesting the presence of additional\nsupport by magnetic stresses or non-thermal pressure. In general we find that\nthe mass of cooled gas contributes significantly to stellar dynamical mass to\nlight ratios which vary with galactic radius. If the stars formed from cooled\ninterstellar gas are optically luminous, their influence on the the mass to\nlight ratio would be reduced. The mass of cooled gas inside r_e is sensitive to\nthe rate that old stars lose mass, which is nearly independent of the initial\nmass function of the old stellar population. \n\n"}

The jets are formed at a large (0.15 pc) distance\nfrom its central star by collimation of an asymmetric stellar wind in a pair of\nconical shocks seen in Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC2) images. The jets\nconsist of several pairs of knots symmetrically distributed with respect to the\ncentral star, with most knots exhibiting a head-tail morphology. Large (up to\n650 km/s) radial velocity gradients are seen within the knots on subarcsec\nscales, with velocities decreasing from the knot heads toward their trailing\ntails. These large velocity gradients are a sign of efficient deceleration of\njets by a much slower bipolar outflow. The inclination angle of the bipolar\noutflow is equal to 40 degrees, based on Doppler shifts of the scattered\nstellar Halpha line. Its velocity is equal to 140 km/s at a distance of 0.23 pc\nfrom the star, and increases monotonically with the radial distance from the\nstar. A comparison of new WFPC2 [N II] 6584 images with older WFPC2 images\nreveals expansion of the jets.

The\nvertical magnetic field, its toroidal component B^tor at the disc surface (due\nto different rotation rates between disc and its magnetosphere), the turbulent\nmagnetic Prandtl number and the viscosity-alpha are the key parameters of our\nmodel. Inside the corotation radius for rather small B^tor the resulting\ninclination angle i of the magnetic field lines to the disc surface normal can\nexceed the critical value 30^\\circ (required to launch cold jets) even for\nsmall magnetic Prandtl numbers of order unity. The self-consistent\nconsideration of both magnetic field and accretion flow demonstrates a weak\ndependence of the inclination (``dragging'') angle on the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber for given surface density but a strong dependence on the toroidal field\ncomponent at the disc surface.\n  A magnetic disc is thicker than a nonmagnetic one for typical parameter\nvalues. The accretion rate can be strongly amplified by large B^tor and small\nmagnetic Prandtl number. On the other hand, for given accretion rate the\nmagnetised disc is less massive than the standard-alpha disc. The surface\nvalues of the toroidal magnetic fields which are necessary to induce\nconsiderably high values for the inclination angle are much smaller than\nexpected and are of order 10^-3 of the imposed vertical field.

Recently another subclass of outbursts in such binaries has\nbeen discovered, which are an order of magnitude fainter and last shorter than\ntypical hours to days. We discuss whether they constitute a separate subset of\nx-ray binaries.\n  A second class of x-ray transients are the x-ray bursts. Thermonuclear\nexplosions on a neutron star (type I x-ray bursts) usually last of order\nminutes or less. We discovered a second type (called super x-ray bursts) with a\nduration of several hours. They relate to thermonuclear detonations much deeper\nin the neutron star atmosphere, possibly burning on the nuclear ashes of normal\nx-ray bursts.\n  The third class are the enigmatic Fast X-ray Transients occurring at all\ngalactic latitudes. We found that the bright ones are of two types only: either\nnearby coronal sources (lasting hours) or the socalled x-ray flashes (lasting\nminutes). The new class, the X-ray flashes, may be a new type of cosmic\nexplosion, intermediate between supernovae and gamma ray bursts, or they may be\nhighly redshifted gamma ray bursts.\n  It thus appears that the three classes of x-ray transients each come in two\nflavors: long and short. \n\n"}

Calibrating the models on galactic globular\nclusters, we show that any population synthesis model being based on stellar\nlibraries of the Milky Way is intrinsically biased towards super-solar alpha/Fe\nratios at metallicities below solar. We correct for this bias, so that the\nmodels presented here reflect constant alpha/Fe ratios at all metallicities.\nThe use of such unbiased models is essential for studies of stellar systems\nwith sub-solar metallicities like (extragalactic) globular clusters or dwarf\ngalaxies.\n  For the galaxy sample investigated here, we find a clear correlation between\nalpha/Fe and velocity dispersion. Zero-point, slope, and scatter of this\ncorrelation turn out to be independent of the environment. Additionally, the\nalpha/Fe ratios and mean ages of elliptical galaxies are well correlated, i.e.\ngalaxies with high alpha/Fe ratios have also high average ages. This strongly\nreinforces the view that the alpha/Fe element enhancement in ellipticals is\nproduced by short star formation timescales rather than by a flattening of the\ninitial mass function. The more massive the galaxy, the shorter is its star\nformation timescale, and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of star\nformation, independent of the environmental density.

SBH masses, M_SBH,\nshould exhibit a tighter correlation with bulge velocity dispersions, sigma_B,\nthan with bulge masses, M_B, in accord with observations, if there is a\nsignificant scatter in the M_H-sigma_H relation for the halo.

Whereas the degree of polarization, $P$,\nwas found to vary in some sources, the position angle, $\\theta_p$, was roughly\nconstant in all cases. Until now, the polarization has been commonly attributed\nto synchrotron radiation from a jet with a tangled magnetic field that is\nviewed somewhat off axis. However, this model predicts either a peak in $P$ or\na $90^\\circ$ change in $\\theta_p$ around the ``jet break'' time in the\nlightcurve, for which there has so far been no observational confirmation. We\npropose an alternative interpretation, wherein the polarization is attributed,\nat least in part, to a large-scale, ordered magnetic field in the ambient\nmedium. The ordered component may dominate the polarization even if the total\nemissivity is dominated by a tangled field generated by postshock turbulence.\nIn this picture, $\\theta_p$ is roughly constant because of the uniformity of\nthe field, whereas $P$ varies as a result of changes in the ratio of the\nordered-to-random mean-squared field amplitudes. We point out that variable\nafterglow light curves should be accompanied by a variable polarization. The\nradiation from the original ejecta, which includes the prompt gamma-ray\nemission and the emission from the reverse shock (the `optical flash' and\n`radio flare'), could potentially exhibit a high degree of polarization (up to\n$\\sim 60%$) induced by an ordered transverse magnetic field advected from the\ncentral source. \n\n"}

The\nproperties of the galaxy populations in two clusters, one Virgo-like (T~3 keV)\nand one (sub) Coma-like (T~6 keV), are discussed. The global star formation\nrates of the cluster galaxies are found to decrease very significantly with\ntime from redshift z=2 to 0, in agreement with observations. The total K-band\nluminosity of the cluster galaxies correlates tightly with total cluster mass,\nand for models without additional AGN feedback, the zero point of the relation\nmatches the observed one fairly well.

Abstract: The collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts requires three essential\ningredients: a massive core, removal of the hydrogen envelope, and enough\nangular momentum in the core. We study current massive star evolution models of\nsolar metallicity to determine which massive star physics is capable of\nproducing these ingredients. In particular, we investigate the role of\nhydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass\nand angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating single stars\nand of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.\nNeglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can\nmaintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption that\nmean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary\nsystems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass\nreceiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,\nleading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely\ncompensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore\nthe resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present\nmodels that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we\nconsider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. We\ninvestigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angular\nmomentum into the cores of accreting stars.

In the highly-enriched central regions, the\nevolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here the\ngas is always dense enough to cool. A similar situation is found in\ncosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes which\ncould spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffuse\ngas. We demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adopt\nsuper-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar mass\nand in the metal distributions. We also find that the impact of metallicity on\nthe star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particular\nevolutionary history. Our results hence emphasise the importance of feedback\nprocesses for interpreting the cosmic metal enrichment. \n\n"}

A 3D calculation is also done to confirm the results of the 2D ones. We\nconsider an initially spherical cloud whose density distribution is flat near\nthe cloud center and has a power-law profile in the cloud envelope. When an\nincident shock is transmitted into a smooth cloud, velocity gradients in the\ncloud envelope steepen the smooth density profile at the upstream side,\nresulting in a sharp density jump having an arc-like shape. Such a ``slip\nsurface'' forms immediately when a shock strikes a cloud with a sharp boundary.\nFor smoother boundaries, the formation of slip surface and therefore the onset\nof hydrodynamic instabilities are delayed. Since the slip surface is subject to\nthe Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the shocked cloud is\neventually destroyed in $\\sim 3-10$ cloud crushing times. After complete cloud\ndestruction, small blobs formed by fragmentation due to hydrodynamic\ninstabilities have significant velocity dispersions of the order of 0.1 $v_b$,\nwhere $v_b$ is the shock velocity in the ambient medium. This suggests that\nturbulent motions generated by shock-cloud interaction are directly associated\nwith cloud destruction. The interaction of a shock with a cold HI cloud should\nlead to the production of a spray of small HI shreds, which could be related to\nthe small cold clouds recently observed by Stanimirovic & Heiles (2005).

Only one SMC supergiant, SK 191, shows a significant\ndegree of rotational broadening (\\vsini $\\simeq$ 90 \\kms). For the remaining\ntargets, the distribution of projected rotational velocities are similar in\nboth our Galactic and SMC samples with larger values being found at earlier\nspectral types. There is marginal evidence for the projected rotational\nvelocities in the SMC being higher than those in the Galactic targets but any\ndifferences are only of the order of 5-10 \\kms, whilst evolutionary models\npredict differences in this effective temperature range of typically 20 to 70\n\\kms. The combined sample is consistent with a linear variation of projected\nrotational velocity with effective temperature, which would imply rotational\nvelocities for supergiants of 70 \\kms at an effective temperature of 28 000 K\n(approximately B0 spectral type) decreasing to 32 \\kms at 12 000 K (B8 spectral\ntype).

Excellent agreement is found at z >~ 0.5, although the\nobserved luminosity density drops by a factor 2 compared with PCE by z=0: black\nhole growth appears to decouple from halo growth at low redshifts, and this may\nbe related to the phenomenon of `cosmic downsizing'.

If\nthese clusters both harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; 10^{2-4}\nMsun) in their center, they can become a strong source of gravitational waves\nwhen the black holes merge with each other. In order to understand the\ndynamical processes that operate in such a scenario, one has to study the\nevolution of the merger of two such young massive star clusters, and more\nspecifically, their respective IMBHs. We employ the direct-summation Nbody4\nnumerical tool on special-purpose GRAPE6 hardware to simulate a merger of two\nstellar clusters each containing 63,000 particles and a central IMBH. This\nallows us to study accurately the orbital evolution of the colliding clusters\nand the embedded massive black holes. Within ~7 Myr the clusters have merged\nand the IMBHs constitute a hard binary. The final coalescence happens in ~10^8\nyrs. The implication of our analysis is that intermediate-mass black holes\nmerging as the result of coalescence of young dense clusters could provide a\nsource for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space-based\ngravitational wave detector mission.

This is\nconsistent with the evolution of the morphology-density relationship, in which\nwe find ellipticals to be as abundant at z=0.5 as in clusters today, and\nalready well ensconced in the dense regions. In contrast, S0's are less\nplentiful and less well-concentrated compared to the present epoch, and spiral\ngalaxies everywhere more abundant. Combined with other spectroscopic and\nmorphological data, these observations suggest that most of these rapidly\nevolving systems are not likely to become bright ellipticals, which were more\nlikely formed at early epochs.

Abstract: New calculations of the Galactic contamination over microwave background\nradiation anisotropies are carried out. On one hand, when a frequency-dependent\ncontrast of molecular clouds with respect to the Galactic background of the\ndiffuse interstellar medium is taken into account, the anisotropic amplitude\nproduced by Galactic dust is increased with respect to previous calculations\nand this is of the same order as that of the data from the observations. On the\nother hand, if we take into account rotational dust emission, for instance, a\nfrequency independence of anisotropies in the microwave range may be obtained.\n  This leads to the possibility that under some particular, but not impossible,\nconditions all the microwave background radiation anisotropies may be due to\nGalactic foregrounds rather than cosmological in origin. Moreover, a suspected\ncoincidence between the typical angular sizes of the microwave background\nradiation anisotropies and those of nearby molecular clouds makes more\nplausible the hypothesis of a purely Galactic origin for these anisotropies.

The PSPC X-ray\nspectrum is fit by thermal plasma (kT=0.80+-0.17 keV) absorbed by only the\nGalactic foreground column density. We evaluate the relationship of the\nX-ray/H-alpha ridge to the M82 superwind. The main properties of the X-ray\nemission can all be explained as being due to shock-heating driven as the\nsuperwind encounters a massive ionized cloud in the halo of M82. This encounter\ndrives a slow shock into the cloud, which contributes to the excitation of the\nobserved H-alpha emission. At the same time, a fast bow-shock develops in the\nsuperwind just upstream of the cloud, and this produces the observed X-ray\nemission. This interpretation would imply that the superwind has an outflow\nspeed of roughly 800 km/s, consistent with indirect estimates based on its\ngeneral X-ray properties and the kinematics of the inner kpc-scale region of\nH-alpha filaments.

Abstract: We have investigated the effect of pressure from intracluster medium (ICM) on\ndisk galaxies in merging clusters.

On the other hand, the increase of SFR caused by compression of ISM\nis less significant. Thus, cluster merger does not trigger, but weakens star\nformation activity of the galaxies. In the central region of the colliding\nclusters, blue galaxies with high velocity should exist, although most of\ngalaxies become red. Following the decrease of blue galaxy fraction in the\nclusters, the fraction of post-starburst galaxies increases.

First it is shown that the carbon\nmass fraction X(C) in the C+O white dwarf SN Ia progenitors tends to be smaller\nfor lower metallicity and older the binary system age. It is then suggested\nthat the variation of X(C) causes the diversity in the brightness of SNe Ia: a\nsmaller X(C) leads to a dimmer SN Ia. Further studies of the propagation of the\nturbulent flame are necessary to confirm this relation. Our model for the SN Ia\nprogenitors then predicts that when the progenitors belong to an older\npopulation or to a low metallicity environment, the number of bright SNe Ia is\nreduced, so that the variation in brightness among the SNe Ia is also smaller.\nThus our model can explain why the mean SN Ia brightness and its dispersion\ndepend on the morphology of the host galaxies and on the distance of the SN\nfrom the center of the galaxy. It is further predicted that at higher redshift\n(z >~ 1) both the the mean brightness of SNe Ia and its variation should be\nsmaller in spiral galaxies than in elliptical galaxies.
