The model form factor is computed\nusing an exact covariant calculation of the lowest-order triangle diagram and\nshown to be the same as that obtained using light-front techniques. The meaning\nof transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables, allowing\nus to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form\nfactor. We show that the rest-frame charge distribution is generally not\nobservable because of the failure to uphold current conservation. Neutral\nsystems of two charged constituents are shown to obey the lore that the heavier\none is generally closer to the transverse origin than the lighter one. It is\nargued that the negative central charge density of the neutron arises, in\npion-cloud models, from pions of high longitudinal momentum. The\nnon-relativistic limit is defined precisely and the ratio of the binding energy\nto that of the mass of the lightest constituent is shown to govern the\ninfluence of relativistic effects. The exact relativistic formula for the form\nfactor reduces to the familiar one of the three-dimensional Fourier transform\nof a square of a wave function for a very limited range of parameters.

Previous measurements revealed a strong\nmodification to dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions with\nrespect to p+p and d+Au collisions. The modification increases with the\ncollision centrality, suggesting a path-length or energy density dependence to\nthe jet-quenching effect. This paper reports STAR measurements of dihadron\nazimuthal correlations in mid-central (20-60%) Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=200$ GeV as a function of the trigger particle's\nazimuthal angle relative to the event plane, $\\phi_s=|\\phi_t-\\psi_{\\rm EP}|$.\nThe azimuthal correlation is studied as a function of both the trigger and\nassociated particle $p_T$. The subtractions of the combinatorial background and\nanisotropic flow, assuming Zero Yield At Minimum (ZYAM), are described. The\ncorrelation results are first discussed with subtraction of the even harmonic\n(elliptic and quadrangular) flow backgrounds. The away-side correlation is\nstrongly modified, and the modification varies with $\\phi_s$, with a\ndouble-peak structure for out-of-plane trigger particles. The near-side ridge\n(long range pseudo-rapidity $\\Delta\\eta$ correlation) appears to drop with\nincreasing $\\phi_s$ while the jet-like component remains approximately\nconstant. The correlation functions are further studied with subtraction of odd\nharmonic triangular flow background arising from fluctuations. It is found that\nthe triangular flow, while responsible for the majority of the amplitudes, is\nnot sufficient to explain the $\\phi_s$-dependence of the ridge or the away-side\ndouble-peak structure. ... \n\n"}

If some fraction of solar neutrinos\noscillate into \\nu_b on their way to Earth, the coherently enhanced elastic\n\\nu_b-nucleus scattering can generate a strong signal in the dark matter\ndetectors.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark\ndistribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and\nother process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide\ndijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one. Since the CDF anomaly was\nobserved in the shoulder region of the dijet-mass distribution, a slight\nmodification of the distribution shape could explain at least partially the CDF\nexcess.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that\nthis approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation at $z\\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion\nmeasurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta).

Due to its\nshort lifetime, many QGP properties can only be inferred indirectly through a\ncomparison of the final state measurements with transport model calculations.\nAmong the current phenomena of interest are the interdependencies between two\ncollective flow phenomena, elliptic and triangular flow. The former is mostly\nrelated to the initial geometry and collective expansion of the system whereas\nthe latter is sensitive to the fluctuations of the initial state. For our\ninvestigation we use a hybrid transport model based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach using an ideal\nhydrodynamic expansion for the hot and dense stage. Using UrQMD initial\nconditions for an Au-Au collision, particles resulting from a collision are\nmapped into an energy density distribution that is evolved event-by-event with\na hydrodynamic calculation.

The average elliptic flow in non central\ncollisions is not sensitive to the granularity, while triangular flow is.

Since the\nstudy is mainly on the hadronization of partons at late time, the fluid picture\nis not used to trace the evolution of the system. The inclusive distributions\nat low $p_T$ are determined as the recombination products of thermal partons.\nThe $p_T$ dependencies of both pion and proton have a common exponential factor\napart from other dissimilar kinematic and resonance factors, because they are\ninherited from the same pool of thermal partons. Instead of the usual\ndescription based on hydrodynamics, the azimuthal anisotropy of the produced\nhadrons is explained as the consequence of the effects of minijets, either\nindirectly through the recombination of enhanced thermal partons in the\nvicinity of the trajectories of the semihard partons, or directly through\nthermal-shower recombination.

{"id": "1411.6005", "contents": "Title: BBN And The CMB Constrain Neutrino Coupled Light WIMPs Abstract: (abridged) In the presence of a light WIMP (mass m_chi < 30 MeV), there are\ndegeneracies among the WIMP's nature, its couplings to standard model\nparticles, its mass, and the number of equivalent (additional) neutrinos, Delta\nN_nu. These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper\nBBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and\nN_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons\nand/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1). This result is consistent with\nthe CMB constraint, N_eff = 3.30 +- 0.27, limiting \"new physics\" between BBN\nand recombination. Combining BBN and CMB data gives Delta N_nu = 0.35 +- 0.16\nand N_eff = 3.40 +- 0.16; while BBN and the CMB combined require Delta N_nu > 0\nat ~98% confidence, they disfavor Delta N_nu > 1 at > 99% confidence. Allowing\na neutrino-coupled light WIMP extends the allowed range slightly downward for\nDelta N_nu and slightly upward for N_eff simultaneously, leaving best-fit\nvalues unchanged. \n\n"}

The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well\nunderstood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion\ndynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the\norigin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy\ndissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of\nfusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation\nterm. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties\nof the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted\npotentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei\ndecreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of\nthe potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems\nand from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients\nshow sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which\nare rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these\nproperties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that\ncontribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger\nthan that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this\narticle. Conclusions: By the analysis of the origin of the fusion hindrance, we\nconclude that, as the system becomes heavier, the dynamical increase in\npotential at small relative distances plays a more important role than the\ndissipation during the fusion reaction for understanding the origin of the\nfusion hindrance. \n\n"}

This is the central question\nof ab initio nuclear structure theory.

In this work we present numerical evidence from ab initio lattice\nsimulations showing that nature is near a quantum phase transition, a\nzero-temperature transition driven by quantum fluctuations. Using lattice\neffective field theory, we perform Monte Carlo simulations for systems with up\nto twenty nucleons. For even and equal numbers of protons and neutrons, we\ndiscover a first-order transition at zero temperature from a Bose-condensed gas\nof alpha particles (4He nuclei) to a nuclear liquid.

We find that (1) emission\nfor the hypernucleus $^{211}_{\\Lambda}{\\rm Po}$ is larger than for normal\nnucleus $^{210}{\\rm Po}$, (2) difference between these spectra is small. We\npropose a way how to find hypernuclei, where role of hyperon is the most\nessential in emission of bremsstrahlung photons during $\\alpha$ decay. As\ndemonstration of such a property, we show that the spectra for the hypernuclei\n$^{107}_{\\Lambda}{\\rm Te}$ and $^{109}_{\\Lambda}{\\rm Te}$ are essentially\nlarger than the spectra for the normal nuclei $^{106}{\\rm Te}$ and $^{108}{\\rm\nTe}$. Such a difference is explained by additional contribution of emission to\nthe full bremsstrahlung, which is formed by magnetic moment of hyperon inside\nhypernucleus. The bremsstrahlung emission formed by such a mechanism, is of the\nmagnetic type. A new formula for fast estimations of bremsstrahlung spectra for\neven-even hypernuclei is proposed, where role of magnetic moment of hyperon of\nhypernucleus in formation of the bremsstrahlung emission is shown explicitly.\nSuch an analysis opens possibility of new experimental study of properties of\nhypernuclei via bremsstrahlung study. \n\n"}

To date, most\njet modification studies have been based on comparing the jet properties\nmeasured in heavy-ion collisions to a proton-proton baseline at the same\nreconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$).

The caloric curve for Kr exhibits back-bending (finite latent\nheat) while the caloric curves for Au and La are consistent with a continuous\nphase transition (nearly zero latent heat) and the values of the critical\nexponents $\\tau$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, both from data and SMM, are close to\nthose for a 'liquid-gas' system for Au and La.

For a given {\\rm L},\nnucleon resonances with spin {\\rm S}=3/2 are approximately degenerate in mass\nwith $\\Delta$ resonances. To which total angular momentum {\\rm L} and {\\rm S}\ncouple has no significant impact on the baryon mass. Nucleons with spin 1/2 are\nshifted in mass; the shift is - in units of squared masses - proportional to\nthe component in the wave function which is antisymmetric in spin and flavor.\nBased on these observations, a new baryon mass formula is proposed which\nreproduces nearly all known baryon masses. It is shown that the masses are\ncompatible with a quark-diquark picture while the richness of the\nexperimentally known states require three particles to participate in the\ndynamics. This conflict is resolved by proposing that quarks polarize the QCD\ncondensates and are surrounded by a polarization cloud shielding the color. A\nnew interpretation of constituent quarks as colored quark clusters emerges;\ntheir interaction is responsible for the mass spectrum. Fast flavor exchange\nbetween the colored quark clusters exhausts the dynamical richness of the\nthree-particle dynamics. The colored-quark-cluster model provides a mechanism\nin which the linear confinement potential can be traced to the increase of the\nvolume in which the condensates are polarized. The quark-spin magnetic moment\ninduces currents in the polarized condensates which absorb the quark-spin\nangular momentum: the proton spin is not carried by quark spins.

The incident momenta varied from 5.9 to 14.4 GeV/c,\ncorresponding to 4.8 < Q^2 < 12.7 (GeV/c)^2. First, we describe the\nmeasurements with the newer experiment, E850, which had more complete kinematic\ndefinition of quasielastic events. In E850 the angular dependence of the\nnuclear transparency near 90 Deg. c.m., and the nuclear transparency for\ndeuterons was studied. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier\nexperiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the\nCarbon data. E834 also determines the nuclear transparencies for Li, Al, Cu,\nand Pb nuclei as well as for C. We find for both E850 and E834 that the A(p,2p)\nnuclear transparency, unlike that for A(e,e'p) nuclear transparency, is\nincompatible with a constant value versus energy as predicted by Glauber\ncalculations. The A(p,2p) nuclear transparency for C and Al increases by a\nfactor of two between 5.9 and 9.5 GeV/c incident proton momentum. At its peak\nthe A(p,2p) nuclear transparency is about 80% of the constant A(e,e'p) nuclear\ntransparency. Then the nuclear transparency falls back to the Glauber level\nagain. This oscillating behavior is generally interpreted as an interplay\nbetween two components of the pN scattering amplitude; one short ranged and\nperturbative, and the other long ranged and strongly absorbed in the nuclear\nmedium. We suggest a number of experiments for further studies of nuclear\ntransparency effects. \n\n"}

We\nconcentrate on the effect of a possible finite width, $\\Delta T \\sim 0.1 T_c$,\nof the transition region between quark-gluon plasma and hadronic phase.\nAlthough slow deflagration solutions that act to stall the expansion do not\nexist for $\\Delta T > 0.08 T_c$, we find, nevertheless, that the equation of\nstate remains sufficiently soft in the transition region to delay the\npropagation of ordinary rarefaction waves for a considerable time.

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}

The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}.
