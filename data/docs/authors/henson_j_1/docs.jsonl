Abstract: One of the celebrated results of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is the\ndiscreteness of the spectrum of geometrical operators such as length, area and\nvolume operators. This is an indication that Planck scale geometry in LQG is\ndiscontinuous rather than smooth. However, there is no rigorous proof thereof\nat present, because the afore mentioned operators are not gauge invariant, they\ndo not commute with the quantum constraints. The relational formalism in the\nincarnation of Rovelli's partial and complete observables provides a possible\nmechanism for turning a non gauge invariant operator into a gauge invariant\none. In this paper we investigate whether the spectrum of such a physical, that\nis gauge invariant, observable can be predicted from the spectrum of the\ncorresponding gauge variant observables. We will not do this in full LQG but\nrather consider much simpler examples where field theoretical complications are\nabsent. We find, even in those simpler cases, that kinematical discreteness of\nthe spectrum does not necessarily survive at the gauge invariant level. Whether\nor not this happens depends crucially on how the gauge invariant completion is\nperformed. This indicates that ``fundamental discreteness at Planck scale in\nLQG'' is far from established. To prove it, one must provide the detailed\nconstruction of gauge invariant versions of geometrical operators. \n\n"}

Differentiating the master equation yields a new\nexpression for the tilt d(ln Omega_gw(f))/d(ln f). The relationship between r\nand Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early\nuniverse, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a\nmodel-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where\nnt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor\nspectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)\n(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon\nre-entry).

Abstract: Standard calculations suggest that the entropy of our universe is dominated\nby black holes, whose entropy is of order their area in Planck units, although\nthey comprise only a tiny fraction of its total energy.

Therefore, assuming unitarity in black hole evaporation, the\nstandard results suggest that the largest uncertainty in the future quantum\nstate of the universe is due to the Hawking radiation from evaporating black\nholes. However, the entropy of the matter precursors to astrophysical black\nholes is enormously less than that given by area entropy.

In analogy with fluid membranes, in this paper we allow for\ntemperature dependent brane tension, according to the corresponding law\nestablished by E\\\"otv\\\"os.

For\nexample, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not\nallow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be\nstronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be\ntransmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do\nnot single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share\nsuch traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum\ncorrelations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It\nstates that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown\nto him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be\ncorrelated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is\nbounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if\nAlice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains\nto her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to\nthe standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is\nrespected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all\nthe no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum\ncorrelations.

If only one bit\nis sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the\nvalue of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them).

The dependences of\nthe lateral force on the phase shift between the corrugations on both test\nbodies were measured at different separations in two sets of measurements with\ndifferent amplitudes of corrugations on the sphere. The maximum magnitude of\nthe lateral force as a function of separation was also measured in two\nsuccessive experiments. All measurement data were compared with the theoretical\napproach using the proximity force approximation and with the exact theory\nbased on Rayleigh expansions with no fitting parameters. In both cases real\nmaterial properties of the test bodies and nonzero temperature were taken into\naccount. The data were found to be in a good agreement with the exact theory\nbut deviate significantly from the predictions of the proximity force\napproximation approach. This provides the quantitative confirmation for the\nobservation of diffraction-type effects that are disregarded within the PFA\napproach.

In the case of the stabiliser theory this group is Z4 while for\nSpekkens's toy theory the group is Z2 x Z2.

Using LISA observations, we\nwill be able to measure the parameters of each EMRI system detected to very\nhigh precision.

In\nthis paper we explore, using Bayesian techniques, the constraints that LISA\nEMRI observations can place on the mass function of black holes at low\nredshift. We describe a general framework for approaching inference of this\ntype --- using multiple observations in combination to constrain a\nparameterised source population.

Then, based on a suggestion of Bennett and\nSmith, we explicitly show how a party assisted by P-CTCs can distinguish a set\nof linearly independent quantum states, and we prove that it is not possible\nfor such a party to distinguish a set of linearly dependent states. The power\nof P-CTCs is thus weaker than that of D-CTCs because the Holevo bound still\napplies to circuits using them regardless of their ability to conspire in\nviolating the uncertainty principle.

A design study for ET is currently underway, so it is\ntimely to assess the science that could be done with such an instrument. This\npaper is the first in a series that will carry out a detailed study of\nintermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) for ET. In the context of ET, an IMRI\nis the inspiral of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole into an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH). In this paper we focus on the development\nof IMRI waveform models for circular and equatorial inspirals. We consider two\napproximations for the waveforms, which both incorporate the inspiral, merger\nand ringdown phases in a consistent way. One approximation, valid for IMBHs of\narbitrary spin, uses the transition model of Ori and Thorne [1] to describe the\nmerger, and this is then matched smoothly onto a ringdown waveform. The second\napproximation uses the Effective One Body (EOB) approach to model the merger\nphase of the waveform and is valid for non-spinning IMBHs. In this paper, we\nuse both waveform models to compute signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for IMRI\nsources detectable by ET.

We revisit this\nexample here, using it as an entree to three central concepts in quantum\nfoundations: contextuality, Bell-nonlocality, and complementarity.\nSpecifically, we show that Specker's parable offers a narrative thread that\nweaves together a large number of results, including: the impossibility of\nmeasurement-noncontextual and outcome-deterministic ontological models of\nquantum theory (the Kochen-Specker theorem), in particular the proof of\nKlyachko; the impossibility of Bell-local models of quantum theory (Bell's\ntheorem), especially the proofs by Mermin and Hardy; the impossibility of a\npreparation-noncontextual ontological model of quantum theory; and the\nexistence of triples of positive operator valued measures (POVMs) that can be\nmeasured jointly pairwise but not triplewise.

As there may be many answers to this\nquestion, we isolate a necessary condition, the SPASs property, that should be\nsatisfied by any reasonable notion of SPASs. This requires that if two theories\nconform to a common notion of SPASs, with one a subtheory of the other, and are\nisomorphic in some particular spacetime, then they should be isomorphic in all\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes (of given dimension). The SPASs property is\nformulated in a functorial setting broad enough to describe general physical\ntheories describing processes in spacetime, subject to very minimal\nassumptions. By explicit constructions, the full class of locally covariant\ntheories is shown not to satisfy the SPASs property, establishing that there is\nno notion of SPASs encompassing all such theories.

The statistical theory of classical mechanics, which\nspecifies how probability distributions over phase space evolve under\nHamiltonian evolution and under measurements, is typically called Liouville\nmechanics, so the theory we explore here is Liouville mechanics with an\nepistemic restriction. The particular epistemic restriction we posit as our\nfoundational postulate specifies two constraints.

As an illustration of\nthe method we investigate massive vector (Proca) perturbations in the Kerr\nmetric, which do not appear to be separable in the standard Teukolsky\nformalism. Working in a perturbative scheme, we discuss two important effects\ninduced by rotation: a Zeeman-like shift of nonaxisymmetric quasinormal modes\nand bound states with different azimuthal number m, and the coupling between\naxial and polar modes with different multipolar index l. We explicitly compute\nthe perturbation equations up to second order in rotation, but in principle the\nmethod can be extended to any order. Working at first order in rotation we show\nthat polar and axial Proca modes can be computed by solving two decoupled sets\nof equations, and we derive a single master equation describing axial\nperturbations of spin s=0 and s=+-1. By extending the calculation to second\norder we can study the superradiant regime of Proca perturbations in a\nself-consistent way. For the first time we show that Proca fields around Kerr\nblack holes exhibit a superradiant instability, which is significantly stronger\nthan for massive scalar fields. Because of this instability, astrophysical\nobservations of spinning black holes provide the tightest upper limit on the\nmass of the photon: mv<4x10^-20 eV under our most conservative assumptions.\nSpin measurements for the largest black holes could reduce this bound to\nmv<10^-22 eV or lower. \n\n"}

In this paper, we shall study this novel\nmetric ansatz in detail, aiming at achieving some inspiration as to the\nconstruction of rotating charged AdS black holes with multiple charges in other\ngauged supergravity theories.

Abstract: We consider the nature of quantum properties in non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics (QM) and relativistic QFTs, and examine the connection between formal\nquantization schemes and intuitive notions of wave-particle duality. Based on\nthe map between classical Poisson brackets and their associated commutators,\nsuch schemes give rise to quantum states obeying canonical dispersion\nrelations, obtained by substituting the de Broglie relations into the relevant\n(classical) energy-momentum relation. In canonical QM, this yields a dispersion\nrelation involving $\\hbar$ but not $c$, whereas the canonical relativistic\ndispersion relation involves both. Extending this logic to the canonical\nquantization of the gravitational field gives rise to loop quantum gravity, and\na map between classical variables containing $G$ and $c$, and associated\ncommutators involving $\\hbar$. This naturally defines a \"wave-gravity duality\",\nsuggesting that a quantum wave packet describing {\\it self-gravitating matter}\nobeys a dispersion relation involving $G$, $c$ and $\\hbar$. We propose an\nansatz for this relation, which is valid in the semi-Newtonian regime of both\nQM and general relativity.

Welcome addition to the MOND lore as it\nis, this approach have reproduced, so far, only a small fraction of MOND\nphenomenology, and is still rather tentative, both in its theoretical\nfoundations and in its phenomenology. What Verlinde has extracted from this\napproach, so far, is a formula -- of rather limited applicability, and with no\nroad to generalization in sight -- for the effective gravitational field of a\nspherical, isolated, static baryonic system. This formula cannot be used to\ncalculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND\nphenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except\nasymptotically. It does not apply to the few-, or many-body problem; so, it\ncannot give, e.g., the two-body force between two galaxies, or be used to\nconduct N-body calculations of galaxy formation, evolution, and interactions.\nThe formula cannot be applied to the internal dynamics of a system embedded in\nan external field, where MOND predicts important consequences. etc. MOND is\nbacked by full-fledged, Lagrangian theories that can be, and are, routinely\napplied to all the above phenomena, and more.

Numerical simulations are a valuable tool for\nstudying the accretion-disk--magnetosphere interaction that is central to these\nproblems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond\npulsars.

While fault-tolerance requires relatively mild assumptions\nabout the nature of qubit errors, the overhead associated with coherent and\nnon-Markovian errors can be orders of magnitude larger than the overhead\nassociated with purely stochastic Markovian errors. One proposal to address\nthis challenge is to randomize the circuits of interest, shaping the errors to\nbe stochastic Pauli errors but leaving the aggregate computation unaffected.\nThe randomization technique can also suppress couplings to slow degrees of\nfreedom associated with non-Markovian evolution. Here we demonstrate the\nimplementation of Pauli-frame randomization in a superconducting circuit\nsystem, exploiting a flexible programming and control infrastructure to achieve\nthis with low effort. We use high-accuracy gate-set tomography to characterize\nin detail the properties of the circuit error, with and without the\nrandomization procedure, which allows us to make rigorous statements about\nMarkovianity as well as the nature of the observed errors.

Numerical simulations of the model provide\nevidence for the existence of a continuum limit. While studying this toy\ndynamics, a picture arises of how the dynamics can be generalized in such a way\nthat the theory could hope to produce more physically realistic causal sets. By\nthinking in terms of a stochastic growth process, and positing some fundamental\nprinciples, we are led almost uniquely to a family of dynamical laws\n(stochastic processes) parameterized by a countable sequence of coupling\nconstants.

Abstract: The equations of motion for matter fields are invariant under the shift of\nthe matter lagrangian by a constant.

In the conventional\napproach, gravity breaks this symmetry and the gravitational field equations\nare not invariant under such a shift of the energy momentum tensor. I argue\nthat until this symmetry is restored, one cannot obtain a satisfactory solution\nto the cosmological constant problem. I describe an alternative perspective to\ngravity in which the gravitational field equations are [G_{ab} -\\kappa T_{ab}]\nn^an^b =0 for all null vectors n^a. This is obviously invariant under the\nchange T^a_b --> T^a_b +\\rho \\delta^a_b and restores the symmetry under\nshifting the matter lagrangian by a constant. These equations are equivalent to\nG_{ab} = \\kappa T_{ab} + Cg_{ab} where C is now an integration constant so that\nthe role of the cosmological constant is very different in this approach.

Based on a\nparticular ansatz for the effective potential for the inflaton and radion\n(which may emerge in string theory), we show that the early expansion of the\nUniverse may proceed in three stages. First, the radion becomes trapped at a\nvalue much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions today. Second, the\nUniverse expands exponentially, but with a Planck mass smaller than its present\nvalue. Because the Planck mass during inflation is small, density fluctuations\nin agreement with observations can arise naturally. Third, when inflation ends,\nthe Universe reheats, and the radion becomes free to expand once more. During\nthe third phase the Universe is ``radiation-dominated'' and tends toward a\nfixed-point evolutionary model in which the radion grows but the temperature\nremains unchanged. Ultimately, the radion becomes trapped once again at its\npresent value, and a short period of exponential expansion, which we identify\nwith the electroweak phase transition, ensues. Once this epoch is over, the\nUniverse reheats to a temperature of order the electroweak scale, and the\nmature Universe evolves as in standard cosmological models.

One of these\nincludes states that can give rise to arbitrary non-signalling correlations,\nincluding the super-quantum correlations that have become known in the\nliterature as Nonlocal Machines or Popescu-Rohrlich boxes. By investigating\nthese correlations in the context of a theory with well-defined dynamics, I\nhope to make further progress with a question raised by Popescu and Rohrlich,\nwhich is, why does quantum theory not allow these strongly nonlocal\ncorrelations? The existence of such correlations forces much of the dynamics in\nthis theory to be, in a certain sense, classical, with consequences for\nteleportation, cryptography and computation. I also investigate another theory\nin which all states are local. Finally, I raise the question of what further\naxiom(s) could be added to the framework in order uniquely to identify quantum\ntheory, and hypothesize that quantum theory is optimal for computation. \n\n"}

The demonstrated hidden variables are precisely those needed\nfor the derivation of the Bell Inequalities. We thus refute the widespread view\nthat empirical violations of Bell Inequalities leave open a choice of whether\nto reject (i) locality or (ii) hidden variables. Both principles are indeed\nassumed in the derivation of the inequalities, but since, as we demonstrate\nhere, (ii) actually follows from (i), there is no choice but to blame the\nviolation of Bell's Inequality on (i). Our main conclusion is thus that no Bell\nLocal theory can be consistent with what is known from experiment about the\ncorrelations exhibited by separated particles.
