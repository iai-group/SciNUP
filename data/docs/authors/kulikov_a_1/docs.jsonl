Although the stability of the operator product expansion side seems\nto break down at T > 1.06Tc for the vector channel and T>1.04Tc for the\npseudoscalar channel, we find a sudden change of the spectral property across\nthe critical temperature Tc, which originates from an equally rapid change of\nthe scalar gluon condensate characterized by e-3p.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the complexity of syndromeless decoding for RS codes, and compare\nit to that of syndrome-based decoding. Aiming to provide guidelines to\npractical applications, our complexity analysis differs in several aspects from\nexisting asymptotic complexity analysis, which is typically based on\nmultiplicative fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques and is usually in big O\nnotation. First, we focus on RS codes over characteristic-2 fields, over which\nsome multiplicative FFT techniques are not applicable. Secondly, due to\nmoderate block lengths of RS codes in practice, our analysis is complete since\nall terms in the complexities are accounted for. Finally, in addition to fast\nimplementation using additive FFT techniques, we also consider direct\nimplementation, which is still relevant for RS codes with moderate lengths.\nComparing the complexities of both syndromeless and syndrome-based decoding\nalgorithms based on direct and fast implementations, we show that syndromeless\ndecoding algorithms have higher complexities than syndrome-based ones for high\nrate RS codes regardless of the implementation.

We find that the renormalized LO\ninteraction is characterized by an extraordinarily strong tensor force (from\none-pion exchange), which is the major cause for the lack of binding. The huge\ntensor force also leads to the unusually large wound integral of 40% in nuclear\nmatter, which implies a very slow convergence of the hole-line or\ncoupled-cluster expansion, rendering this interaction impractical for many-body\ncalculations. In view of the unusual properties of the renormalized LO\ninteraction and in view of the poor convergence of the nuclear many-body\nproblem with this interaction, there is doubt if this interaction and its\npredictions can serve as a reasonable and efficient starting point that is\nimproved by perturbative corrections. \n\n"}

Given bandwidth constraints, the goal is to minimize the\nnumber of rounds required to obtain a random walk sample. We first present a\nfast sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing random walks whose\ntime complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our algorithm performs\na random walk of length $\\ell$ in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\ell D})$ rounds (with high\nprobability) on an undirected network, where $D$ is the diameter of the\nnetwork. This improves over the previous best algorithm that ran in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\ell^{2/3}D^{1/3})$ rounds (Das Sarma et al., PODC 2009). We further\nextend our algorithms to efficiently perform $k$ independent random walks in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k\\ell D} + k)$ rounds. We then show that there is a\nfundamental difficulty in improving the dependence on $\\ell$ any further by\nproving a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ell}{\\log \\ell}} + D)$ under a\ngeneral model of distributed random walk algorithms.

This paper\ncloses the gap between theoretical representation and practical implementation.\nIn our previous work, we presented an efficient algorithm for finding a\nminimal-memory realization of a pearl-necklace encoder for\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) convolutional codes. This work extends our\nprevious work and presents an algorithm for turning a pearl-necklace encoder\nfor a general (non-CSS) quantum convolutional code into a realizable quantum\nconvolutional encoder. We show that a minimal-memory realization depends on the\ncommutativity relations between the gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.\nWe find a realization by means of a weighted graph which details the\nnon-commutative paths through the pearl-necklace. The weight of the longest\npath in this graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement\nthe encoder. The algorithm has a polynomial-time complexity in the number of\ngate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder. \n\n"}

They asked whether the hierarchical aTAM could allow a tile system\nto use the ability to form large assemblies in parallel before they attach to\nbreak the Omega(n) lower bound for assembly time. We show that there is a tile\nsystem with the optimal O(log n / log log n) tile types that assembles an n x n\nsquare using O(log^2 n) parallel \"stages\", which is close to the optimal\nOmega(log n) stages, forming the final n x n square from four n/2 x n/2\nsquares, which are themselves recursively formed from n/4 x n/4 squares, etc.\nHowever, despite this nearly maximal parallelism, the system requires\nsuperlinear time to assemble the square. We extend the definition of *partial\norder tile systems* studied by Adleman et al. in a natural way to hierarchical\nassembly and show that no hierarchical partial order tile system can build any\nshape with diameter N in less than time Omega(N), demonstrating that in this\ncase the hierarchical model affords no speedup whatsoever over the seeded\nmodel. We strengthen the Omega(N) time lower bound for deterministic seeded\nsystems of Adleman et al. to nondeterministic seeded systems. Finally, we show\nthat for infinitely many n, a tile system can assemble an n x n' rectangle,\nwith n > n', in time O(n^{4/5} log n), breaking the linear-time lower bound. \n\n"}

The diffusion process is\nsimulated using relativistic Fokker-Planck dynamics for elastic scattering in a\nhydrodynamic background. The heavy-quark transport coefficients in the medium\nare obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix interactions which build up\nresonant correlations close to the transition temperature. The latter also form\nthe basis for hadronization of heavy quarks into heavy-flavor mesons via\nrecombination with light quarks from the medium. The pertinent resonance\nrecombination satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping\nbetween quark and meson distributions. The recombination probability is derived\nfrom the resonant heavy-quark scattering rate. Consequently, recombination\ndominates at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and yields to fragmentation at\nhigh $p_T$. Our approach thus emphasizes the role of resonance correlations in\nthe diffusion and hadronization processes. We calculate the nuclear\nmodification factor and elliptic flow of $D$- and $B$-mesons for Au-Au\ncollisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and compare their\ndecay-electron spectra to available data.

For photonuclear reactions with a narrow gamma beam, the\nenergy deposition in the target can be reduced by using a stack of thin target\nwires, hence avoiding direct stopping of the Compton electrons and e^+e^-\npairs. The well-defined initial excitation energy of the compound nucleus leads\nto a small number of reaction channels and enables new combinations of target\nisotope and final radioisotope. The narrow-bandwidth gamma excitation may make\nuse of collective resonances in gamma-width, leading to increased cross\nsections. (gamma,gamma') isomer production via specially selected gamma\ncascades allows to produce high specific activity in multiple excitations,\nwhere no back-pumping of the isomer to the ground state occurs. The produced\nisotopes will open the way for completely new clinical applications of\nradioisotopes. For example ^195mPt could be used to verify the patient's\nresponse to chemotherapy with platinum compounds before a complete treatment is\nperformed. In targeted radionuclide therapy the short-range Auger and\nconversion electrons of ^195mPt and ^117mSn enable a very local treatment. The\ngenerator ^44Ti allows for a PET with an additional gamma-quantum (gamma-PET),\nresulting in a reduced dose or better spatial resolution. \n\n"}

For graphs with diameter 2 we provide the first\nsubexponential algorithm with complexity $2^{O(\\sqrt{n\\log n})}$, which is\nasymptotically the same as the currently best known time complexity for the\ngraph isomorphism (GI) problem. Moreover, we prove that the graph isomorphism\nproblem on 3-colorable graphs with diameter 2 is GI-complete. Furthermore we\npresent a subclass of graphs with diameter 2 that admits a polynomial algorithm\nfor 3-coloring. For graphs with diameter 3 we establish the complexity of\n3-coloring by proving that for every $\\varepsilon \\in [0,1)$, 3-coloring is\nNP-complete on triangle-free graphs of diameter 3 and radius 2 with $n$\nvertices and minimum degree $\\delta=\\Theta(n^{\\varepsilon})$.

Exploring high girth even\n  degree expanders in linear time Abstract: We consider a modified random walk which uses unvisited edges whenever\npossible, and makes a simple random walk otherwise.

In the simplest case, A is a uniform\nrandom choice over unvisited edges incident with the current walk position.\nHowever we do not exclude arbitrary choices of rule A. For example, the rule\ncould be determined on-line by an adversary, or could vary from vertex to\nvertex.\n  For even degree expander graphs, of bounded maximum degree, we have the\nfollowing result. Let G be an n vertex even degree expander graph, for which\nevery vertex is in at least one vertex induced cycle of length L. Any\nedge-process on G has cover time (n+ (n log n)/L). This result is independent\nof the rule A used to select the order of the unvisited edges, which can be\nchosen on-line by an adversary.\n  As an example, With high probability, random r-regular graphs, (r at least 4,\neven), are expanders for which L = Omega(log n). Thus, for almost all such\ngraphs, the vertex cover time of the edge-process is Theta(n).

The\ngoal is to reorder the requests in such a manner that the buffer constraint is\nsatisfied and the total travel cost of the server is minimized. The RBP arises\nin many applications that require scheduling with a limited buffer capacity,\nsuch as scheduling a disk arm in storage systems, switching colors in paint\nshops of a car manufacturing plant, and rendering 3D images in computer\ngraphics.\n  We study the offline version of RBP and develop bicriteria approximations.\nWhen the underlying metric is a tree, we obtain a solution of cost no more than\n9OPT using a buffer of capacity 4k + 1 where OPT is the cost of an optimal\nsolution with buffer capacity k.

Our approach introduces the\n{\\em Server model} and {\\em Quantum Simulation Theorem} which together provide\na connection between distributed algorithms and communication complexity. The\nServer model is the standard two-party communication complexity model augmented\nwith additional power; yet, most of the hardness in the two-party model is\ncarried over to this new model. The Quantum Simulation Theorem carries this\nhardness further to quantum distributed computing. Our techniques, except the\nproof of the hardness in the Server model, require very little knowledge in\nquantum computing, and this can help overcoming a usual impediment in proving\nbounds on quantum distributed algorithms. \n\n"}

The former feature leads to an extremely\nintensive gluon radiation and energy dissipation at the early stage of\nhadronization, either in vacuum or in a medium. As a result, a leading hadron\nmust be produced on a short length scale. Evaluation within a model of\nperturbative fragmentation confirms the shortness of the production length.\nThis result is at variance with the unjustified assumption of long production\nlength, made within the popular energy loss scenario. Thus we conclude that the\nmain reason of suppression of high-pT hadrons in heavy ion collisions is the\ncontrolled by color transparency attenuation of a high-pT dipole propagating\nthrough the hot medium.

While this is a basic question in PCPs community, the\nconnection between the parameters of PCPs and hardness of approximations is\nsometime obscure to approximation algorithm community. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the connection between the parameters of 2P1R and the hardness of\napproximating the class of so-called connectivity problems, which includes as\nsubclasses the survivable network design and (multi)cut problems. Based on\nrecent development on 2P1R by Chan (ECCC 2011) and several techniques in PCPs\nliterature, we improve hardness results of some connectivity problems that are\nin the form $k^\\sigma$, for some (very) small constant $\\sigma>0$, to hardness\nresults of the form $k^c$ for some explicit constant $c$, where $k$ is a\nconnectivity parameter. In addition, we show how to convert these hardness into\nhardness results of the form $D^{c'}$, where $D$ is the number of demand pairs\n(or the number of terminals).\n  Thus, we give improved hardness results of k^{1/2-\\epsilon} and\nk^{1/10-\\epsilon} for the root $k$-connectivity problem on directed and\nundirected graphs, k^{1/6-\\epsilon} for the vertex-connectivity survivable\nnetwork design problem on undirected graphs, and k^{1/6-\\epsilon} for the\nvertex-connectivity $k$-route cut problem on undirected graphs. \n\n"}

The verifier must work within the restrictive data streaming\nparadigm. The prover, who can annotate the data stream as it is read, must not\njust supply the answer but also convince the verifier of its correctness.\nIdeally, both the amount of annotation and the space used by the verifier\nshould be sublinear in the relevant input size parameters.\n  A rich theory of such algorithms -- which we call schemes -- has emerged.\nPrior work has shown how to leverage the prover's power to efficiently solve\nproblems that have no non-trivial standard data stream algorithms. However,\nwhile optimal schemes are now known for several basic problems, such optimality\nholds only for streams whose length is commensurate with the size of the data\nuniverse.

The connected\ndomatic number of a graph is the size of a largest connected domatic partition\nand it is a well-studied graph parameter with applications in the design of\nwireless networks. In this note, we consider the fractional counterpart of the\nconnected domatic partition problem in \\emph{node-capacitated} graphs. Let $n$\nbe the number of nodes in the graph and let $k$ be the minimum capacity of a\nnode separator in $G$. Fractionally we can pack at most $k$ connected\ndominating sets subject to the capacities on the nodes, and our algorithms\nconstruct packings whose sizes are proportional to $k$.

Indeed, nuclear matter\ntraditionally addressed by mean-field models is uniform while clusters are\nknown to exist in the dilute baryonic matter which constitutes the main\ncomponent of compact objects outer shells.

In particular, it should be valuable to\ninvestigate the high-energy exclusive processes which include generalized\nparton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs). The\nGPDs and GDAs contain momentum distributions of partons and form factors.

The running time of our\nalgorithms is upper bounded by $n^{O(k)}$, where $k$ is the number of onion\nlayers of $P$. In particular, for $k = O(1)$ our algorithms run in polynomial\ntime. In addition, we show that our algorithm for counting triangulations is\nnever slower than $O^{*}(3.1414^{n})$, even when $k = \\Theta(n)$. Given that\nthere are several well-studied configurations of points with at least\n$\\Omega(3.464^{n})$ triangulations, and some even with $\\Omega(8^{n})$\ntriangulations, our algorithm asymptotically outperforms any enumeration\nalgorithm for such instances.

Despite its\nsimple definition, the Subgraph Isomorphism problem turns out to be very broad,\nas it generalizes problems such as Clique, $r$-Coloring, Hamiltonicity, Set\nPacking and Bandwidth. However, for all of the mentioned problems\n$2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time algorithms exist, so a natural and frequently asked\nquestion in the past was whether there exists a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time\nalgorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism. In the monograph of Fomin and Kratsch\n[Springer'10] this question is highlighted as an open problem, among few\nothers.\n  Our main result is a reduction from 3-SAT, producing a subexponential number\nof sublinear instances of the Subgraph Isomorphism problem. In particular, our\nreduction implies a $2^{\\Omega(n \\sqrt{\\log n})}$ lower bound for Subgraph\nIsomorphism under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. This shows that there exist\nclasses of graphs that are strictly harder to embed than cliques or Hamiltonian\ncycles.\n  The core of our reduction consists of two steps. First, we preprocess and\npack variables and clauses of a 3-SAT formula into groups of logarithmic size.\nHowever, the grouping is not arbitrary, since as a result we obtain only a\nlimited interaction between the groups. In the second step, we overcome the\ntechnical hardness of encoding evaluations as permutations by a simple, yet\nfruitful scheme of guessing the sizes of preimages of an arbitrary mapping,\nreducing the case of arbitrary mapping to bijections. In fact, when applying\nthis step to a recent independent result of Fomin et al.[arXiv:1502.05447\n(2015)], who showed hardness of Graph Homomorphism, we can transfer their\nhardness result to Subgraph Isomorphism, implying a nearly tight lower bound of\n$2^{\\Omega(n \\log n / \\log \\log n)}$. \n\n"}

In the present work we offer a proof\nthat deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent is coNP-hard and provide\nthe first singly-exponential time algorithm for this problem, also producing a\ndynamic execution strategy whenever the input CSTN is dynamically-consistent.\nThe algorithm is based on a novel connection with Mean Payoff Games, a family\nof two-player combinatorial games on graphs well known for having applications\nin model-checking and formal verification.

These SRCs provide corrections to lepton- nucleus\ncross sections as computed in the impulse approximation (IA). Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to\nthe local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these\noperators can be truncated at a low order. Results: The model is compared with\nelectron-scattering data, and two-particle two-hole responses are presented for\nneutrino scattering.

As the amount of data\nis often huge, it is desirable to obtain sublinear time algorithms, and\nspecifically property testers, to understand local properties of the data.\n  We focus on the natural local problem of testing pattern freeness: given a\nlarge $d$-dimensional array $A$ and a fixed $d$-dimensional pattern $P$ over a\nfinite alphabet, we say that $A$ is $P$-free if it does not contain a copy of\nthe forbidden pattern $P$ as a consecutive subarray. The distance of $A$ to\n$P$-freeness is the fraction of entries of $A$ that need to be modified to make\nit $P$-free. For any $\\epsilon \\in [0,1]$ and any large enough pattern $P$ over\nany alphabet, other than a very small set of exceptional patterns, we design a\ntolerant tester that distinguishes between the case that the distance is at\nleast $\\epsilon$ and the case that it is at most $a_d \\epsilon$, with query\ncomplexity and running time $c_d \\epsilon^{-1}$, where $a_d < 1$ and $c_d$\ndepend only on $d$.\n  To analyze the testers we establish several combinatorial results, including\nthe following $d$-dimensional modification lemma, which might be of independent\ninterest: for any large enough pattern $P$ over any alphabet (excluding a small\nset of exceptional patterns for the binary case), and any array $A$ containing\na copy of $P$, one can delete this copy by modifying one of its locations\nwithout creating new $P$-copies in $A$.\n  Our results address an open question of Fischer and Newman, who asked whether\nthere exist efficient testers for properties related to tight substructures in\nmulti-dimensional structured data. They serve as a first step towards a general\nunderstanding of local properties of multi-dimensional arrays, as any such\nproperty can be characterized by a fixed family of forbidden patterns. \n\n"}

While perfect\nmatchings in planar graphs can be counted by a classical polynomial-time\nalgorithm, the problem of counting all matchings (possibly containing unmatched\nvertices, also known as defects) is known to be #P-complete on planar graphs.\nTo interpolate between the hard case of counting matchings and the easy case of\ncounting perfect matchings, we study the parameterized problem of counting\nmatchings with exactly k unmatched vertices in a planar graph G, on input G and\nk. This setting has a natural interpretation in statistical physics, and it is\na special case of counting perfect matchings in k-apex graphs (graphs that can\nbe turned planar by removing at most k vertices).\n  Starting from a recent #W[1]-hardness proof for counting perfect matchings on\nk-apex graphs, we obtain that counting matchings with k unmatched vertices in\nplanar graphs is #W[1]-hard.

As a by-product it is found that most\nrecent global alpha-nucleus potentials are able to describe the reaction cross\nsections for 64Zn around the Coulomb barrier.\n  Conclusions: Total reaction cross sections of alpha-induced reactions can be\nwell determined from elastic scattering angular distributions. The present\nstudy proves experimentally that the total cross section from elastic\nscattering is identical to the sum of non-elastic reaction cross sections.\nThus, the statistical model can reliably be used to distribute the total\nreaction cross section among the different open channels. \n\n"}

In particular, its only\nessential requirement on features is linear independence. Furthermore, the\nalgorithm uses ReLU to exploit the non-negativity for decoding the weights, and\nthus can tolerate adversarial noise that can potentially be as large as the\nsignal, and can tolerate unbiased noise much larger than the signal.

The energy and\nradial densities for these systems are calculated in different external\nWoods-Saxon potentials.

The key idea behind our proposed\nSF-sketch is to maintain two separate sketches: a small sketch called\nSlim-subsketch and a large sketch called Fat-subsketch.

(For\nexample, a statistical query (SQ) gives an estimate of $Ex_{x \\sim D}[q(x)]$\nfor any choice of the query function $q$ mapping $X$ to the reals, where $D$ is\nan unknown data distribution over $X$.) Yet some data analysis algorithms rely\non properties of functions that depend on multiple samples. Such algorithms\nwould be naturally implemented using $k$-wise queries each of which is\nspecified by a function $q$ mapping $X^k$ to the reals. Hence it is natural to\nask whether algorithms using $k$-wise queries can solve learning problems more\nefficiently and by how much.\n  Blum, Kalai and Wasserman (2003) showed that for any weak PAC learning\nproblem over a fixed distribution, the complexity of learning with $k$-wise SQs\nis smaller than the (unary) SQ complexity by a factor of at most $2^k$. We show\nthat for more general problems over distributions the picture is substantially\nricher. For every $k$, the complexity of distribution-independent PAC learning\nwith $k$-wise queries can be exponentially larger than learning with\n$(k+1)$-wise queries. We then give two approaches for simulating a $k$-wise\nquery using unary queries. The first approach exploits the structure of the\nproblem that needs to be solved. It generalizes and strengthens (exponentially)\nthe results of Blum et al.. It allows us to derive strong lower bounds for\nlearning DNF formulas and stochastic constraint satisfaction problems that hold\nagainst algorithms using $k$-wise queries. The second approach exploits the\n$k$-party communication complexity of the $k$-wise query function. \n\n"}

Our hypothesis was based on\nexperimental data, which raised the idea of a finite formation time for the\nproduced medium. At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time\nreaches about 2 fm/c. All observed high p_t particles are produced in the\ncorona region and have a chance to escape during this 2 fm/c. After that, the\nformed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the\nnuclear modification factor R_{AA} should be independent on particle momentum\nand be flat versus p_t. At the same time, we describe the finite azimuthal\nanisotropy of high p_t particles, v_2. A separate prediction held that, at LHC\nenergy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller,\nabout 1 fm/c. New data at LHC show that R_{AA} is not flat and is rising with\np_t. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton\ntraversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift\nof about 7 GeV (I would call it as a parton binding energy) from the original\npower law p^{-6} production cross section in pp explains well all the observed\nR_{AA} dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV is also valid at RHIC energy,\nwhere the cross section follows a power law with about p^{-8} and this shift\nexplains a very slow rise of R_{AA} seen for neutral pions with p_t above 15\nGeV/c.

We focus on the\nsetting in which all agents involved in some matching problem can be\npartitioned into k different types, where the type of an agent determines his\nor her preferences, and agents have preferences over types (which may be\nrefined by more detailed preferences within a single type). This situation\nwould arise in practice if agents form preferences solely based on some small\ncollection of agents' attributes.

A relative distance comparison is a\nstatement of the form \"item A is closer to item B than to item C\". However,\nmany existing clustering algorithms that use relative distances are rather\ncomplex. They are often based on a two-step approach, where the relative\ndistances are first used to learn either a distance matrix, or an embedding of\nthe items, and then some standard clustering method is applied in a second\nstep. In this paper we argue that it should be possible to compute a clustering\ndirectly from relative distance comparisons.

There is a large literature on graph sampling,\nwhere the goal is to estimate properties (especially the degree distribution)\nof a large graph through a small, random sample. The degree distribution\nestimation poses a significant challenge, due to its heavy-tailed nature and\nthe large variance in degrees.\n  We design a new algorithm, SADDLES, for this problem, using recent\nmathematical techniques from the field of sublinear algorithms. The SADDLES\nalgorithm gives provably accurate outputs for all values of the degree\ndistribution. For the analysis, we define two fatness measures of the degree\ndistribution, called the $h$-index and the $z$-index. We prove that SADDLES is\nsublinear in the graph size when these indices are large. A corollary of this\nresult is a provably sublinear algorithm for any degree distribution bounded\nbelow by a power law.\n  We deploy our new algorithm on a variety of real datasets and demonstrate its\nexcellent empirical behavior. In all instances, we get extremely accurate\napproximations for all values in the degree distribution by observing at most\n$1\\%$ of the vertices. This is a major improvement over the state-of-the-art\nsampling algorithms, which typically sample more than $10\\%$ of the vertices to\ngive comparable results. We also observe that the $h$ and $z$-indices of real\ngraphs are large, validating our theoretical analysis. \n\n"}

In the classic $d$-hypercube bin packing problem, we\nare given a sequence of $d$-dimensional hypercubes and we have an unlimited\nnumber of bins, each of which is a $d$-dimensional unit hypercube. The goal is\nto pack (orthogonally) the given hypercubes into the minimum possible number of\nbins, in such a way that no two hypercubes in the same bin overlap. The bounded\nspace online $d$-hypercube bin packing problem is a variant of the\n$d$-hypercube bin packing problem, in which the hypercubes arrive online and\neach one must be packed in an open bin without the knowledge of the next\nhypercubes. Moreover, at each moment, only a constant number of open bins are\nallowed (whenever a new bin is used, it is considered open, and it remains so\nuntil it is considered closed, in which case, it is not allowed to accept new\nhypercubes).

Specifically, we use PD\ntechniques to decompose a target molecular system into smaller subsystems\nrequiring fewer computational resources. In our framework, there are two levels\nof hybridization. At the first level, we use a classical algorithm to decompose\na target molecule into subsystems, and utilize a quantum algorithm to simulate\nthe quantum nature of the subsystems. The second level is in the quantum\nalgorithm. We consider the quantum--classical variational algorithm that\niterates between an expectation estimation using a quantum device and a\nparameter optimization using a classical device. We investigate three popular\nPD techniques for our hybrid approach: the fragment molecular-orbital (FMO)\nmethod, the divide-and-conquer (DC) technique, and the density matrix embedding\ntheory (DMET). We examine the efficacy of these techniques in correctly\ndifferentiating conformations of simple alkane molecules.

FSM has numerous applications ranging from biology to network\nscience, as it provides a compact summary of the characteristics of the graph.\nHowever, the task is challenging, even more so for evolving graphs due to the\nstreaming nature of the input and the exponential time complexity of the\nproblem.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of the approximate FSM problem in both\nincremental and fully-dynamic streaming settings, where arbitrary edges can be\nadded or removed from the graph. For each streaming setting, we propose\nalgorithms that can extract a high-quality approximation of the frequent\n$k$-vertex subgraphs for a given threshold, at any given time instance, with\nhigh probability. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art solutions that\nrequire iterating over the entire set of subgraphs for any update, our\nalgorithms operate by maintaining a uniform sample of $k$-vertex subgraphs with\noptimized neighborhood-exploration procedures local to the updates.

The axion is a hypothesized new fundamental particle\nwhich can resolve the strong charge-parity problem and be a prominent dark\nmatter candidate. This experiment utilizes an atomic magnetometer as both a\nsource of optically polarized electron spins and a magnetic-field sensor. The\ninteraction of the axion field, oscillating at a frequency equal to the axion\nmass, with an electron spin induces a sizable OEDM of the electron at the same\nfrequency as the axion field. When the alkali vapor is subjected to an electric\nfield and a magnetic field, the electron OEDM interacts with the electric\nfield, resulting in an electron spin precession at the spin's Larmor frequency\nin the magnetic field.

In pp collisions,\nthe measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides a reference for\nheavy-ion studies, and allows also testing perturbative QCD calculations in a\nwide range of collision energies. Similar studies in p--Pb collisions help in\ndisentangling cold nuclear matter effects from modifications induced by the\npresence of a QGP medium, and are also useful to investigate the possible\nexistence of collective phenomena also in this system.

To\ninvestigate the origin of this large theoretical uncertainty, a systematic\ncomparison of heavy-quark transport coefficients is carried out between various\ntransport models.

However,\nin other settings such as intensional query evaluation on databases, we obtain\nBoolean circuits that satisfy some width bounds, e.g., they have bounded\ntreewidth or pathwidth. In this work, we give a systematic picture of many\ncircuit classes considered in knowledge compilation and show how they can be\nsystematically connected to width measures, through upper and lower bounds. Our\nupper bounds show that bounded-treewidth circuits can be constructively\nconverted to d-SDNNFs, in time linear in the circuit size and singly\nexponential in the treewidth; and that bounded-pathwidth circuits can similarly\nbe converted to uOBDDs. We show matching lower bounds on the compilation of\nmonotone DNF or CNF formulas to structured targets, assuming a constant bound\non the arity (size of clauses) and degree (number of occurrences of each\nvariable): any d-SDNNF (resp., SDNNF) for such a DNF (resp., CNF) must be of\nexponential size in its treewidth, and the same holds for uOBDDs (resp.,\nn-OBDDs) when considering pathwidth. Unlike most previous work, our bounds\napply to any formula of this class, not just a well-chosen family. Hence, we\nshow that pathwidth and treewidth respectively characterize the efficiency of\ncompiling monotone DNFs to uOBDDs and d-SDNNFs with compilation being singly\nexponential in the corresponding width parameter. We also show that our lower\nbounds on CNFs extend to unstructured compilation targets, with an exponential\nlower bound in the treewidth (resp., pathwidth) when compiling monotone CNFs of\nconstant arity and degree to DNNFs (resp., nFBDDs). \n\n"}

To address this controversy, and to connect the resolution to\nthe underlying physical processes, we build an independent simulation pipeline\nfor neutrino events in liquid argon, combining the public tools GENIE and\nFLUKA. Using this pipeline, we first characterize the channels of\nnon-hermeticity of DUNE, including subthreshold particles, charge\nrecombination, and nuclear breakup. Particular attention is paid to the role of\nneutrons, which are responsible for a large fraction of missing energy in all\nchannels. Next, we determine energy resolution, by quantifying event-to-event\nstochastic fluctuations in missing energy. This is done for several sets of\nassumptions about the reconstruction performance, including those available in\nthe literature. The resulting migration matrices, connecting true and\nreconstructed neutrino energies, are presented. Finally, we quantify the impact\nof different improvements on the experimental performance. For example, we show\nthat dropping particle identification information degrades the resolution by a\nfactor of two, while omitting charge deposits from de-excitation gammas worsens\nit by about 25%.

Can we use light-by-light scattering in heavy-ion\ncollisions to do precision tests of QED and measure the magnetic field of the\nQGP? How are quark jets modified by the presence of the QGP?

The\ndata-analysis procedure was developed to determine with highest accuracy the\nmass values and the corresponding uncertainties for the most challenging\nconditions: down to a few events in a spectrum and overlapping distributions,\ncharacterized only by a broader common peak shape. With this procedure, the\nresolution of low-lying isomers is increased by a factor of up to three\ncompared to standard data analysis. The ground-state masses of 31 short-lived\nnuclides of 15 different elements with half-lives down to 17.9~ms and count\nrates as low as 11 events per nuclide were determined.

In addition, our bounds give the first separation between polynomial\nand near linear space. Such a separation is inherently impossible by\ncommunication complexity.\n  Using our lower bound technique and new upper bound constructions, we obtain\ntight bounds for searching predecessors among a static set of integers. Given a\nset Y of n integers of l bits each, the goal is to efficiently find\npredecessor(x) = max{y in Y | y <= x}, by representing Y on a RAM using space\nS.\n  In external memory, it follows that the optimal strategy is to use either\nstandard B-trees, or a RAM algorithm ignoring the larger block size.

A physical content of\nthe semiclassical approximation is that the quantum fluctuations effects are\nsuppressed and vanish asymptotically. The chiral as well as $U(1)_A$ breakings\nin QCD result from quantum fluctuations. Hence these breakings must be\nsuppressed high in the spectrum and the spectrum of high-lying hadrons must\nexhibit $U(2)_L \\times U(2)_R$ symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian.

Within reggeon field theory,\neach color-excited nucleon is associated with the unitarity cut of the pomeron\nexchanged between the projectile and nucleus. In this communication we derive\nthe unitarity rules for the multiplicity of excited nucleons, alias cut\npomerons, alias topological cross sections, for typical hard dijet production\nprocesses. We demonstrate how the coupled-channel non-Abelian intranuclear\nevolution of color dipoles, inherent to pQCD, gives rise to the reggeon field\ntheory diagrams for final states in terms of the uncut, and two kinds of cut,\npomerons. Upon the proper identification of the uncut and cut pomeron\nexchanges, the topological cross sections for dijet production follow in a\nstraightforward way from the earlier derived nonlinear k_t - factorization\nquadratures for the inclusive dijet cross sections. The concept of a coherent\n(collective) nuclear glue proves extremely useful for the formulation of\nreggeon field theory vertices of multipomeron - cut and uncut - couplings to\nparticles and between themselves.

When properly\nparameterized, the correlation strength appears to be independent of the\ncollision centrality - it is the same in p-p and central A-A collisions.\nHowever, the correlation is strongly suppressed by the centrality fluctuations. \n\n"}

The advantages of electron\nscattering over other electromagnetic probes is explored. The response\nfunctions for direct breakup are studied with few-body models.

If matter is close to the softest point of\nthe equation of state, this ellipsoid expands predominantly orthogonal to the\ndirection given by Theta.

Both processes alter\nthe ions charged to mass ratio by well defined amounts, creating beams of\nparticles with altered magnetic rigidity. These beams will deposit their energy\nin a localized region of the accelerator, causing localized heating, The size\nof the target region depends on the collider optics. For medium and heavy ions,\nat design luminosity at the Large Hadron Collider, local heating may be more\nthan an order of magnitude higher than expected. This could cause magnet\nquenches if the local cooling is inadequate. The altered-rigidity beams will\nalso produce localized radiation damage. The beams could also be extracted and\nused for fixed target experiments. \n\n"}

In addition, the Delta J\n= 1 staggering effect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels with even\nangular momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J) is\nstudied in molecular bands free from Delta J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from\ninterband interactions/bandcrossings). Bands of YD offer evidence for the\nabsence of any Delta J = 1 staggering effect due to the disparity of nuclear\nmasses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD demonstrate that Delta J\n= 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational behaviour,\ndue in this particular case to the spin-rotation and spin-spin interactions. \n\n"}
