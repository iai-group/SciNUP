Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

Kes 75 is likely at distance of 5.1 to 7.5 kpc because\nthe highest HI absorption velocity is at 95 km/s and no absorption is\nassociated with a nearby HI emission peak at 102 km/s in the direction of Kes\n75. This distance to Kes 75 gives a reasonable luminosity of PSR J1846-0258 and\nits PWN, and also leads to a much smaller radius for Kes 75. So the age of the\nSNR is consistent with the spin-down age of PSR J1846-0258, confirming this\npulsar as the second-youngest in the Galaxy. \n\n"}

Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs.

Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo.

Such discs\nshould arise frequently, but should be observed infrequently, precisely because\nthey fragment rapidly. By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

Here we extend this study to Galactic and\nSMC metallicities with the analysis of ~50 Galactic and ~100 SMC early B-type\nstars with rotational velocities up to ~300km/s. The surface nitrogen\nabundances are utilised as a probe of the mixing process.\n  In the SMC, we find a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars\namongst the early B type core-hydrogen burning stars, similar to the LMC. In\nthe Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the core\nhydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectation\nfrom both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. However, only\na small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce a\nsignificant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enriched\nrapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally, in each metallicity\nregime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is observed, which cannot\nbe the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning stars. Their abundances\nare, however, compatible with them having gone through a previous red\nsupergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex picture of the\nnitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant stellar\natmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether rotational\nmixing is required to understand our results remains an open question at this\ntime, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction in those\ngroups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models\n(abridged). \n\n"}

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies. We conclude that the\nrecently measured, substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can be\nexplained by the combined effect of the continuous emergence of galaxies as\nearly types and their subsequent growth through dry merging. \n\n"}

Methods: To study the environment of a\ngrowing black hole we seek descriptions of steady `cusps' that may contain a\nblack hole and that retain at least a memory of self-similarity. We refer to\nthe environment in brief as the `bulge' and on smaller scales, the `halo'.\nResults: We find simple descriptions of the simulations of collisionless matter\nby comparing predicted densities, velocity dispersions and distribution\nfunctions with the simulations.

The morphology-colour class of galaxies strongly depends on\nthe local density, with the approximate order of high-density preference: red\nearly-type galaxies (REGs) -- red late-type galaxies (RLGs) -- blue early-type\ngalaxies (BEGs) -- blue late-type galaxies (BLGs).

First, a\nkinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the\nmain features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)\nlate-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain\nthe observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively\nhigh density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a\nrelatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically\ndistributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the\ndirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the\nemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For\nthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the\nimplications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the\ncentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some\nlines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at\n4700A) will not show this effect. By examining optical nebular spectra of 12\nSNe Ia, we have found that such a variation indeed exists.

At least half of this gas is lost\npermanently to the intracluster medium, as the tail extends beyond the tidal\nradius of the galaxy. We also detect a hot (400-550 K) component in the tail\nthat is approximately 1% of the mass. The large H_2 line to IR continuum\nluminosity ratio in the tail indicates that star formation is not a major\nexcitation source and that the gas is possibly shock-heated. This discovery\nconfirms that the galaxy is currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, as\nalso indicated by its X-ray and Halpha tails found previously. We estimate the\ngalaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The\ntrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and\natomic gas. We predict that the galaxy will lose most of its gas in a single\npass through the core and place a strong upper limit on the ram-pressure\ntimescale of 1 Gyr. We also study the star-forming properties of the galaxy and\nits tail. We identify most of the previously discovered external Halpha sources\nwithin the tail in our 8 um data but not in our 3.6 um data; IRS spectroscopy\nof the region containing these Halpha sources also reveals aromatic features\ntypically associated with star formation.

The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron. Although the X-ray spectral description we find for the 1ES\n1210-646 emission is quite atypical for a high-mass X-ray binary, the\nmultiwavelegth information available for this object leads us to confirm this\nclassification.

Given the limitations imposed by the data, we were unable to\ndetermine the physical origin of the wind structure inferred for the OB\nsupergiants, although the inhomogineities in the winds of the Wolf Rayets are\nlikely driven by binary interactions and, conversely, by pulsations in at least\none of the cool hypergiants.

Motivated by recent detection of\nemission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock\nbreakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying\nspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal\nequilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We\nfind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs)\nand possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation\nis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,\nbefore the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical\nphase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher\ntemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. When thermal\nequilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and its\ntemporal evolution. Our results are useful for interpretation of early SN light\ncurves.

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed.

Moreover, we show that\nthey are the only solitons which are at the same level of agreement with the\nobservations as in general relativity.

Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs. Here, magnetic\nenergy density is so high that its dissipation heats the plasma to MeV\ntemperatures.

The optimization is performed by\nminimizing several volume integrals which would vanish for an exact\nRobertson-Walker metric. Covariance is automatic. Foliation of space-time is\npart of the optimization procedure. Only the metric is involved in the\nprocedure, no assumptions about the origin of the energy-momentum tensor are\nneeded. A scale factor does not show up during the optimization process, the\noptimal scale factor is determined at the end. The general formulation is non\nperturbative. An explicit perturbative treatment is possible. The shifts which\nlead to the optimal coordinates obey Euler-Lagrange equations which are\nformulated and solved in first order of the perturbation. The extension to\nsecond order is sketched, but turns out to be unnecessary. The only freedom in\nthe choice of coordinates which finally remains are the rigid transformations\nwhich keep the form of the Robertson-Walker metric intact, i.e. translations in\nspace and time, spatial rotations, and spatial scaling. Spatial averaging\nbecomes trivial. In first order of the perturbation there is no backreaction. A\nsimplified second order treatment results in a very small effect, excluding the\npossibility to mimic dark energy from backreaction.

These data are used to identify the physical conditions\ngiving rise to the H2O emission and infer any dependence with velocity. These\nobservations provide evidence that the observed water lines probe a warm\n(T_kin~400-600 K) and very dense (n 10^6 - 10^7 cm^-3) gas, not traced by other\nmolecules, such as low-J CO and SiO, but rather traced by mid-IR H2 emission.\nIn particular, H2O shows strong differences with SiO in the excitation\nconditions and in the line profiles in the two observed shocked positions,\npointing to chemical variations across the various velocity regimes and\nchemical evolution in the different shock spots. Physical and kinematical\ndifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. At the R4 position, two\nvelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with the\ncomponent at higher velocity (R4-HV) being less extended and less dense than\nthe low velocity component (R4-LV). H2O column densities of about 2 10^13 and 4\n10^14 cm^-2 have been derived for the R4-LV and the R4-HV components,\nrespectively. The conditions inferred for the B2 position are similar to those\nof the R4-HV component, with H2O column density in the range 10^14 - 5 10^14\ncm^-2, corresponding to H2O/H2 abundances in the range 0.5 - 1 10^-5.

One of the key questions is how\nthese disks form so close to their host black holes and under what condition\nthey form stars in a tidally stressed environment.

Our non-rotating models become redder than the previous\nmodels in the literature, given the larger overshooting parameter adopted in\nthis study. In particular, convective dredge-up of the helium core material\ninto the hydrogen envelope is observed in our non-rotating very massive star\nmodels (>~200 Msun), which is potentially important for the chemical yields. On\nthe other hand, the stars become bluer and more luminous with a higher\nrotational velocity. With the Spruit-Tayler dynamo, our models with a\nsufficiently high initial rotational velocity can reach the critical rotation\nearlier and lose more mass as a result, compared to the previous models without\nmagnetic fields. The most dramatic effect of rotation is found with the\nso-called chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), which is observed for a\nlimited mass and rotational velocity range.

Previous candidate flares have\nhad declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor\nconstraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because\nthe rising emission was not observed. Recently, two `relativistic' candidate\ntidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity\nand synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a\nrelativistic jet.

We detect the host\ngalaxies for 80 % of the GRBs in the sample, although only 42 % have Ks-band\ndetections, which confirms that GRB-selected host galaxies are generally blue.\nThe sample is not uniformly blue, however, with two extremely red objects\ndetected.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons.

For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF.

MOND introduces a new universal constant of nature with\nthe dimensions of acceleration, a0, such that the pre-MONDian dynamics is valid\nfor accelerations a >> a0, and the deep MONDian regime is obtained for a << a0,\nwhere space-time scale invariance is invoked. Remaining challenges for MOND are\n(i) explaining fully the observed mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters, and\n(ii) the development of a relativistic theory of MOND that will satisfactorily\naccount for cosmology. The universal constant a0 turns out to have an\nintriguing connection with cosmology: \\bar a0 == 2 pi a0 \\approx c H_0 \\approx\nc^2(Lambda/3)^{1/2}. This may point to a deep connection between cosmology and\ninternal dynamics of local systems. \n\n"}

Several commonly employed size\nmeasurement techniques are used, including single Sersic fits, two-component\nSersic models, and a non-parametric method. Through simple simulations, we show\nthat the non-parametric and two-component Sersic methods provide the most\nrobust effective radius measurements, while those based on single Sersic\nprofiles are often overestimates, especially for massive red/early-type\ngalaxies. Using our robust sizes, we show for all sub-samples that the\nmass-size relations are shallow at low stellar masses and steepen above ~ 3-4 x\n10^{10}\\msun. The mass-size relations for galaxies classified as late-type,\nlow-n, and star-forming are consistent with each other, while blue galaxies\nfollow a somewhat steeper relation. The mass-size relations of early-type,\nhigh-n, red, and quiescent galaxies all agree with each other but are somewhat\nsteeper at the high-mass end than previous results.

The sizes of these galaxies before and\nafter redshifting are consistent and we conclude that systematic effects in\nsizes and the size-mass relation at z ~ 1 are negligible.

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This\nvariability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that\nreasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak\ncorrelations between SFR and L_AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the\ngeneral trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and\nmeasurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR. These results\nimply there may be a tight connection between AGN activity and SFR over galaxy\nevolution timescales, and that the apparent similarities in rest-frame colors,\nmerger rates, and clustering of AGNs compared to \"inactive\" galaxies may be due\nprimarily to AGN variability.

The predicted SFR\ndensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellar\nmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. The model\npredicts a modest evolution of the HI density at z<3, which is also in\nagreement with the observations. The HI density is predicted to be always\ndominated by galaxies with SFR<1Msun/yr. This contrasts with the H2 density,\nwhich is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with SFR>10Msun/yr.

Due to the substantial\nangular momentum from the binary, such a remnant is born rapidly rotating and\nlikely acquires a strong magnetic field (a `millisecond magnetar'). Magnetic\nspin-down deposits a large fraction of the rotational energy from the magnetar\nbehind the small quantity of mass ejected during the merger. This has the\npotential for creating a bright transient that could be useful for determining\nwhether a NS or black hole was formed in the merger. We investigate the\nexpected signature of such an event, including for the first time the important\nimpact of electron/positron pairs injected by the millisecond magnetar into the\nsurrounding nebula. These pairs cool via synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission, producing a pair cascade and hard X-ray spectrum. A fraction of these\nX-rays are absorbed by the ejecta walls and re-emitted as thermal radiation,\nleading to an optical/UV transient peaking at a luminosity of ~1e43-1e44 erg/s\non a timescale of several hours to days. This is dimmer than predicted by\nsimpler analytic models because the large optical depth of electron/positron\npairs across the nebula suppresses the efficiency with which the magnetar spin\ndown luminosity is thermalized. Nevertheless, the optical/UV emission is more\nthan two orders of magnitude brighter than a radioactively powered `kilonova.'\nIn some cases nebular X-rays are sufficiently luminous to re-ionize the ejecta,\nin which case non-thermal X-rays escape the ejecta unattenuated with a similar\npeak luminosity and timescale as the optical radiation.

One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid.

Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc.

Results\n  from scaling the ISM opacity Abstract: The opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates the\naccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of\nplanets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3. The\nobservational result lies between these values, pointing to core accretion as\nthe formation mechanism. \n\n"}

Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these\nafterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the\n$\\sim\\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,\nsuggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'. The new tools are demonstrated here with application to five\ngalaxies, chosen to be representative case-studies for several areas where this\ntechnique makes it possible to gain new scientific insight.

A\nwell-characterized stellar sample suggests at least two different relationships\nbetween rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long and\nshort cycles simultaneously.

Recent observations of long-lasting X-ray\nafterglows of SGRBs challenge standard paradigms and indicate that in a large\nfraction of events a long-lived neutron star (NS) may be formed rather than a\nblack hole. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these afterglows is\nnecessary in order to address the open questions concerning the nature of SGRB\ncentral engines. However, recent theoretical progress has been hampered by the\nfact that the timescales of interest for the afterglow emission are\ninaccessible to numerical relativity simulations. Here we present a detailed\nmodel to bridge the gap between numerical simulations of the merger process and\nthe relevant timescales for the afterglows, assuming that the merger results in\na long-lived NS.

In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF.

This method has important implications for multi-epoch\nseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and\ndiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations.

There is\nconsiderable interest in searching for their faint and rapidly fading\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterparts, though GW position uncertainties are as\ncoarse as hundreds of square degrees. Because LIGO's sensitivity to binary\nneutron stars is limited to the local universe, the area on the sky that must\nbe searched could be reduced by weighting positions by mass, luminosity, or\nstar formation in nearby galaxies. Since GW observations provide information\nabout luminosity distance, combining the reconstructed volume with positions\nand redshifts of galaxies could reduce the area even more dramatically.

In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample.

For this, we focused on the so-called\nChevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy EOS and\nimplemented the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to efficiently sample\nthe space of cosmological parameters. Our analysis shows once more that the\n$E_{p, i}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation has no significant redshift dependence.\nTherefore the high-redshift GRBs can be used as a cosmological tool to\ndetermine the basic cosmological parameters and to test different models of\ndark energy in the redshift region ($z\\geqslant 3$), which is unexplored by the\nSNIa and baryonic acoustic oscillations data. Our updated calibrated Hubble\ndiagram of GRBs provides some marginal indication (at $1\\sigma$ level) of an\nevolving dark energy EOS. \n\n"}

We used the host galaxies of the Swift/BAT6\nsample of LGRBs. We considered the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and\nmetallicity determined from the host galaxy photometry and spectroscopy up to z\n= 2 and used them to compare the distribution of host galaxies to that of field\ngalaxies in the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relation plane. We\nfind that although LGRBs also form in galaxies with relatively large stellar\nmasses, the large majority of host galaxies have metallicities below\nlog(O=H)~8.6. The extension to z = 2 results in a good sampling of stellar\nmasses also above Log(Mstar/Msun)~9.5 and provides evidence that LGRB host\ngalaxies do not follow the fundamental metallicity relation. As shown by the\ncomparison with dedicated numerical simulations of LGRB host galaxy population,\nthese results are naturally explained by the existence of a mild (~0.7 Zsun)\nthreshold for the LGRB formation. The present statistics does not allow us to\ndiscriminate between different shapes of the metallicity cutoff, but the\nrelatively high metallicity threshold found in this work is somewhat in\ndisagreement to most of the standard single-star models for LGRB progenitors. \n\n"}

Using the properties of radially quantized conformal\nfield theories and the operator-state correspondence, we glean information on\nsome points. The Higuchi bound on the masses of spin-s states in de Sitter is a\ndirect consequence of reflection positivity in radially quantized CFT$_3$ and\nthe fact that scaling dimensions of operators are energies of states. The\npartial massless states appearing in de Sitter correspond from the boundary\nCFT$_3$ perspective to boundary states with highest weight for the conformal\ngroup. We discuss inflationary consistency relations and the role of asymptotic\nsymmetries which transform asymptotic vacua to new physically inequivalent\nvacua by generating long perturbation modes. We show that on the CFT$_3$ side,\nasymptotic symmetries have a nice quantum mechanics interpretation. For\ninstance, acting with the asymptotic dilation symmetry corresponds to evolving\nstates forward (or backward) in \"time\" and the charge generating the asymptotic\nsymmetry transformation is the Hamiltonian itself. Finally, we investigate the\nsymmetries of anisotropic inflation and show that correlators of\nfour-dimensional free scalar fields can be reproduced in the dual picture by\nconsidering an isotropic three-dimensional boundary enjoying dilation symmetry,\nbut with a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the boundary stress-energy\nmomentum tensor. \n\n"}

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution.

The dynamics of dark and luminous matter in the massive\n  cluster collision MACSJ0553.4$-$3342 Abstract: We present the results of a multiwavelength investigation of the very X-ray\nluminous galaxy cluster MACSJ0553.4-3342 ($z = 0.4270$; hereafter MACSJ0553).\nCombining high-resolution data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the\nChandra X-ray Observatory with ground-based galaxy spectroscopy, our analysis\nestablishes the system unambiguously as a binary, post-collision merger of\nmassive clusters. Key characteristics include perfect alignment of luminous and\ndark matter for one component, a separation of almost 650 kpc (in projection)\nbetween the dark-matter peak of the other subcluster and the second X-ray peak,\nextremely hot gas (k$T > 15$ keV) at either end of the merger axis, a potential\ncold front in the east, an unusually low gas mass fraction of approximately\n0.075 for the western component, a velocity dispersion of $1490_{-130}^{+104}$\nkm s$^{-1}$, and no indication of significant substructure along the line of\nsight.

In contrast to studies of\nnearby systems, we do not find a separation between cooling flow clusters and\nnon-cooling flow clusters based on the radio luminosity of the central radio\nsource.

In particular, observations of novae support the origin of the\noptical continuous emission in the outburst ejecta, mass-based segregation and\nclump formation in the ejecta, origin of the Orion, diffuse enhanced lines and\ndust in the clumps, prompt Fe II line formation in swept-up material,\nenergising of electrons to relativistic velocities by the explosion and the\nexistence of a large cool envelope around the accreting white dwarf in\nquiescence. The rapid transfer of thermonuclear energy should be adiabatic\nwhich energises and ejects all the particles in the overlying layers. Our study\nresults in the following conclusions which are relevant for novae and other\nastrophysical systems: (1) Electrons are instantaneously energised to\nrelativistic velocities in the explosion alongside the heavier atoms and ions.\nNo post-ejection shock acceleration needs to be invoked. (2) Rotation of an\nincompressible spherical accreting object leads to a latitude-dependent\npotential such that the accretion rate is maximum at the poles and minimum at\nthe equator. This will form a prolate-shaped envelope. Energetic expulsion of\nthis envelope will result in a bipolar ejecta/outflow. Such outflows cannot be\nejected from non-rotating spherical objects. (3) The latitude-dependent\naccretion rates in a rotating accreting object will also lead to accumulation\nof the infalling matter outside the object in the non-polar regions thus\nforming an accretion disk.

In fact, the detection of such a\nrelic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nperiod, an epoch from which we have no data, and could even hint at\ninflationary physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion rate of the\nUniverse after inflationary is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field\n$\\phi$, in the so-called \"kination\" model.

We explore the parameter space of this theory with the requirement\nthat the present WIMP abundance provides the correct DM relic budget.

Within the supermassive black hole's\ngravitational sphere of influence, the hot gas is multiphase and spans\ntemperatures from 0.2 to 1 keV. The radiative cooling time of the lowest\ntemperature gas drops to only 0.1-0.5 Myr, which is comparable to its free fall\ntime.

The\npredicted size distributions are frequently bimodal and irregular in shape.\nThere is a negative correlation between total cloud mass and equilibrium\ntemperature as well as a positive correlation between total cloud mass and\natmospheric mixing. The cloud properties on the east and west limbs show\ndistinct differences that increase with increasing equilibrium temperature.\nCloud opacities are roughly constant across a broad wavelength range with the\nexception of features in the mid-infrared. Forward scattering is found to be\nimportant across the same wavelength range. Using the fully resolved size\ndistribution of cloud particles as opposed to a mean particle size has a\ndistinct impact on the resultant cloud opacities. The particle size that\ncontributes the most to the cloud opacity depends strongly on the cloud\nparticle size distribution.

By using both the tracer variable and virtual particle\nmethods, and additionally following the gas metallicity evolution, we show that\nmetal-rich gas initially located in central regions can indeed be uplifted by\nthe AGN bubble to large distances, a phenomenon called Darwin drift in fluid\nmechanics, and forming a filamentary trailing outflow extending beyond $100$\nkpc behind the bubble.

It\nproduced four X class flares, more than 20 CMEs and an intense geomagnetic\nstorm, for which the peak value of the Dst index reached up to -142nT at 2017\nSeptember 8 02:00 UT. In this work, we check the interplanetary and solar\nsource of this intense geomagnetic storm. We find that this geomagnetic storm\nwas mainly caused by a shock-ICME complex structure, which was formed by a\nshock driven by the 2017 September 6 CME propagating into a previous ICME which\nwas the interplanetary counterpart of the 2017 September 4 CME. To better\nunderstand the role of this structure, we conduct the quantitative analysis\nabout the enhancement of ICME's geoeffectiveness induced by the shock\ncompression. The analysis shows that the shock compression enhanced the\nintensity of this geomagnetic storm by a factor of two. Without shock\ncompression, there would be only a moderate geomagnetic storm with a peak Dst\nvalue of -79 nT. In addition, the analysis of the proton flux signature inside\nthe shock-ICME complex structure shows that this structure also enhanced the\nsolar energetic particles (SEPs) intensity by a factor of ~ 5.

For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

We measure\nthe non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the\nhalo mass function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and in other models with damped matter\nfluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered here produce\nmeasurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\\Lambda$CDM at\nredshifts $z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all\nredshifts. The halo mass function at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an\nenhancement of around $\\sim 20\\%$ w.r.t. $\\Lambda$CDM and a damping at lower\nhalo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of the\nfree parameter in the model.

The\nconnection with ram-pressure stripping is further confirmed by a series of\nfindings: jellyfish galaxies are more frequent at intermediate and large\ncluster-centric distances ($r/R_{\\rm 200c}\\gtrsim 0.25$); they move through the\nICM with larger bulk velocities and Mach numbers than the general cluster\npopulation, typically orbiting supersonically and experiencing larger ram\npressures.

If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution.

Wavelet-based analyses have been\nable to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation\nrate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical\ntools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave\nactually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at\n1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.\nFurthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave\npatterns with 6, 7, 8 and 9 spiral arms rotating around the planet at 1538.2\ndegrees/day, 1492.5 degrees/day, 1454.2 degrees/day and 1421.8 degrees/day,\nrespectively.

Drag forces and accretion rates dictate how these systems are\ntransformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term\nevolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing\nof the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic\npredictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the\ntimescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the\n$0.19 \\pm 0.01$ power.

In this\npaper we show that this can be understood by challenging the accepted wisdom\nthat the result of helium core burning in a massive star is independent of\nwhether the core is covered by a hydrogen envelope, or \"naked\" while it burns.\nThe latter case occurs in binaries when the envelope of the more massive star\nis transferred to the companion by Roche Lobe overflow while in either main\nsequence or red giant stage. For solar metallicity, whereas the helium cores\nwhich burn while naked essentially never go into high-mass black holes, those\nthat burn while clothed do so, beginning at ZAMS mass $\\sim 20\\msun$, the\nprecise mass depending on the $^{12}C(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}$O rate as we outline.\nIn this way the SXTs can be evolved, provided that the H envelope of the\nmassive star is removed only following the He core burning.

The\nassociated accretion torque could potentially counteract any gravitational-wave\ninduced spin-down, and accretion heating could affect the viscous damping rates\nand hence the instability. We discuss the effects of various external agents on\nthe r-mode instability scenario within a simple model of supernova fallback on\nto a hot young magnetized neutron star.

We use the formalism\nintroduced by Mo, Mao, & White to compute the observable properties of galaxies\nin a number of model populations, varying assumptions about which physical\nparameters determine structural quantities and star formation histories. We\nthen apply PCA to these model populations. Our baseline model assumes that halo\nmass, spin parameter, and formation redshift are the governing input parameters\nand that star formation is determined by surface density through a Schmidt law.\n  In all cases, the first principal component is primarily a measure of the\nshape of the spectral energy distribution (SED), and it is usually driven by\nvariations in the spin parameter, which influences star formation through the\ndisk surface density.

This hysteresis effect\nrules out the propeller mechanism as the sole cause of state transitions in Aql\nX-1. Assuming the propeller mechanism only operates at a luminosity equal to or\nbelow that of the observed soft-to-hard transition requires that the magnetic\nfield of Aql X-1 be less than $7\\times 10^7$ Gauss, the lowest neutron star\nfield known to date. To compare the state transition behavior of Aql X-1 with\nthat found in transient black hole systems, we use RXTE ASM data to compute\nhardness-intensity diagrams for four black hole candidate transients where the\nASM data should also give us state information throughout much of the outburst\ncycles. In all four systems, we find evidence for a hard-to-soft state\ntransition during the rising outburst phase and for the source staying in a\nsoft state down to much lower luminosities during the declining phase, i.e., a\nhysteresis effect. This similarity suggests a common origin for state\ntransitions in low magnetic field neutron star and black hole systems, and the\nhysteresis effect rules out the ``Strong ADAF Principle'' for determining the\nstate of an accretion disc.

The presence of substructure exterior to the lens has\nbeen invoked by several authors in the context of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models\nin order to explain the anamolous magnification ratios. We emphasize that the\nanomalous magnification ratios may be an artifact of the simple one-component\nmass models currently in use; the inclusion of a misaligned disk may be able to\nmimic the effect of substructure. These slight spatial offsets between the dark\nmatter halo and the disk, which are likely to occur during or as a consequence\nof interactions or mergers, lead to complex image configurations and\nnon-standard magnification ratios.

These events manifest themselves in form of luminous flares\npowered by accretion of debris from the disrupted star into the black hole.\n  Candidate events among optically non-active galaxies emerged in the past few\nyears.

We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic\nalignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to\nthe tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as\nsuggested by tidal torque theory.

There is accumulating evidence that the H beta profile is dominated by\ngravity, and thus provides a useful estimate of the black hole mass in AGN. The\nshift and asymmetry commonly seen in C IV suggest that non gravitational\neffects, such as obscuration and radiation pressure, may affect the line\nprofile. We explore the relation between the H beta and C IV profiles using UV\nspectra available for 81 of the 87 z < 0.5 PG quasars in the Boroson & Green\n(BG92) sample. We find the following: (1) Narrow C IV lines (FWHM < 2000 km/s)\nare rare (~2 per cent occurrence rate) compared to narrow H beta lines (~20 per\ncent). (2) In most objects where the H beta FWHM <4000 km/s the C IV line is\nbroader than H beta, but the reverse is true when the H beta FWHM > 4000 km/s.\nThis argues against the view that C IV generally originates closer to the\ncenter, compared to H beta.\n  (3) C IV appears to provide a significantly less accurate, and possibly\nbiased estimate of the black hole mass in AGN, compared with H beta. (4) All\nobjects where C IV is strongly blueshifted and asymmetric have a high L/L_Edd,\nbut the reverse is not true.

Fold Lenses Abstract: When the source in a 4-image gravitational lens lies close to a \"fold\"\ncaustic, two of the lensed images lie close together. If the lens potential is\nsmooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, then the\ndifference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, Rfold =\n(F1-F2)/(F1+F2) \\approx 0. Violations of this \"fold relation\" in observed\nlenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than\nthe separation between the close images. We study the fold relation and find it\nto be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which\nRfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on the\ndistance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the\ncaustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. Thus, it is\nimpossible to say from Rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalous\nor not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of Rfold values that\ncan be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation between\nthe two close images and the distance to the next nearest image. We analyze the\ngeneric and specific features of this distribution, and then show that 5 of the\n12 known lenses with fold configurations have flux ratio anomalies: B0712+472,\nSDSS 0924+0219, PG 1115+080, B1555+375, and B1933+503.

The\nearly X-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadly\nconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay\n(t^{-alpha} with 3<alpha_1<5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay\n(0.2<alpha_2<0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1<alpha_3<1.5).\nThese power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,\n300s<t_{break,1}<500s and 10^3s<t_{break,2}<10^4s. On top of this canonical\nbehavior of the early X-ray light curve, many events have superimposed X-ray\nflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lasting\nsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the GRB.

From a subsample of 56 galaxies, for which metallicity of the\ninterstellar medium is also measured, we identified a strong correlation\nbetween mass and metallicity, for the first time in the distant Universe. This\nwas possible because of the larger base line spanned by the sample in terms of\nmetallicity (a factor of 7) and mass (a factor of 400) than in previous works.\nThis correlation is much stronger and tighter than the luminosity-metallicity,\nconfirming that stellar mass is a more meaningful physical parameter than\nluminosity. We find clear evidence for temporal evolution in the M-Z relation\nin the sense that at a given mass, a galaxy at z=0.7 tends to have lower\nmetallicity than a local galaxy of similar mass. We use the z=0.1 SDSS M-Z\nrelation, and a small sample of z=2.3 Lyman break galaxies with known mass and\nmetallicity, to propose an empirical redshift-dependent M-Z relation, according\nto which the stellar mass and metallicity in small galaxies evolve for a longer\ntime than in massive galaxies. This relation predicts that the generally metal\npoor damped Lyman-alpha galaxies have stellar masses of the order of 10^8.8\nM_sun (with a dispersion of 0.7 dex) all the way from z=0.2 to z=4. The\nobserved redshift evolution of the M-Z relation can be reproduced remarkably\nwell by a simple closed-box model where the key assumption is an e-folding time\nfor star formation which is higher or, in other words, a period of star\nformation that lasts longer in less massive galaxies than in more massive\ngalaxies.

As lower limits on this normalisation, we consider\nthe evolution in stellar mass density, metal mass density, and supernova rate\ndensity, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalisation is much lower than\nindicated by our direct fit. Additionally, predictions from the SFH for\nsupernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of ~3 Gyr.

The models show how the two\nfeedback mechanisms compete in the disruption of clouds and lead to two\ndifferent hydrodynamic solutions: The storage of clouds into a long lasting\nragged shell that inhibits the expansion of the thermalized wind, and the\nsteady filtering of the shocked wind gas through channels carved within the\ncloud stratum. Both solutions are claimed to be concurrently at work in giant\nHII regions and HII galaxies, causing their detailed inner structure.

First, such a hot plasma should not be bound to the Galactic plane\nand the power needed to sustain the escaping matter would be higher then any\nknown source. Second, there is no known mechanism able to heat the plasma to\nmore than a few keV. Recently we have suggested that, hydrogen having escaped,\nthe hot plasma could be a helium plasma, heavy enough to be gravitationally\nconfined. In this case, the required power is much more reasonable. We present\nhere a possible heating mechanism which taps the gravitational energy of the\nmolecular clouds. We note that the 8 keV plasma is highly viscous and we show\nhow viscous friction of molecular clouds flowing within the hot phase can\ndissipate energy in the gas and heat it.

The\nshear-current effect is associated with the ${\\bf W} {\\bf \\times} {\\bf J}$ term\nin the mean electromotive force, where ${\\bf W}$ is the mean vorticity due to\nthe large-scale shear motions and ${\\bf J}$ is the mean electric current.

Abstract: The diffuse galactic EGRET gamma ray data show a clear excess for energies\nabove 1 GeV in comparison with the expectations from conventional galactic\nmodels.

From the spectral shape of the excess the WIMP mass\nis estimated to be between 50 and 100 GeV, while from the intensity the halo\nprofile is reconstructed, which is shown to explain the peculiar change of\nslope in the rotation curve at about 11 kpc (due to the ring of DM at 14 kpc).\n  Recently it was claimed by Bergstrom et al. that the DM interpretation of the\nEGRET gamma ray excess is excluded by the antiproton fluxes, since in their\npropagation model with isotropic diffusion the flux of antiprotons would be far\nbeyond the observed flux. However, the propagation can be largely anisotropic,\nbecause of the convection of particles perpendicular to the disc and\ninhomogeneities in the local environment.

We detect and characterize these\nresonances in N-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radial\nfrequencies of individual orbits. We found narrow peaks in the distribution of\norbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. We\nfound five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.\nThe corotation resonance and the inner and outer Lindblad resonances are the\nmost populated. The spatial distributions of particles near resonances are\nwide. For example, the inner Lindblad resonance is not localized at a given\nradius. Particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar and\nspan a wide range of radii. On the other hand, particles near the corotation\nresonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable Lagrange\npoints. The distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.\nResonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. Our analysis\nof orbits in both N-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicates\nthat resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trapped\nmaterial.

We have been\nable to improve significantly on previous studies by carefully choosing pairs\nof well matched reddened and unreddened stars. In addition, we benefited from\nthe improved S/N of the NEWSIPS IUE data and the larger sample of SMC stars now\navailable. Searching the IUE Final Archive, we found only four suitable\nearly-type stars that were significantly reddened and had well matched\ncomparison stars. The extinction for three of these stars is remarkably\nsimilar. The curves are roughly linear with 1/lambda and have no measurable\n2175 A bump. The fourth star has an extinction curve with a significant 2175 A\nbump and weaker far-UV extinction. The dust along all four sightlines is\nthought to be local to the SMC. There is no significant Galactic foreground\ncomponent. The first three stars lie in the SMC Bar and the line-of-sight for\neach of them passes through regions of recent star formation. The fourth star\nbelongs to the SMC Wing and its line-of-sight passes though a much more\nquiescent region. Thus, the behavior of the dust extinction in the SMC supports\na dependence of dust properties on star formation activity. However, other\nenvironmental factors (such as galactic metallicity) must also be important.\nDust in the 30 Dor region of the LMC, where much more active star formation is\npresent, does not share the extreme extinction properties seen in SMC dust. \n\n"}

These effects naturally depend on the precise shape of the extinction\nlaw and on the redshift of the lens. By means of numerical Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, using a least-squares fitting method and assuming an extinction\nlaw similar to that observed in the Galaxy, we show how accurate photometric\nobservations of multiply imaged quasars obtained in several spectral bands\ncould lead to the estimate of the lens redshift, irrespective of the visibility\nof the deflector.

We explore the early\nafterglow emission. For short GRBs the peak of the afterglow will be delayed,\ntypically, by few dozens of seconds after the burst. For long GRBs the early\nafterglow emission will overlap the GRB signal.

These characteristics provide a way to discriminate\nbetween late internal shocks emission (part of the GRB) and the early afterglow\nsignal.

Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV. The decay will become allowed only after the flat directions\nstart oscillating, and once the flat direction VEV is sufficiently redshifted.\nFor models with weak scale supersymmetry, this generically happens at a Hubble\nexpansion rate: $H \\simeq (10^{-3}-10^{-1}) {\\rm TeV}$, at which time the\ninflaton decays in the perturbative regime.

Using generalized zeta regularization, the one-loop\neffective action is explicitly obtained off-shell, what allows to study in\ndetail the possibility of (de)stabilization of the de Sitter background by\nquantum effects. The one-loop effective action maybe useful also for the study\nof constant curvature black hole nucleation rate and it provides the plausible\nway of resolving the cosmological constant problem. \n\n"}

We find that cosmological constant of our universe has to be\nfine-tuned at the level of the action itself, as in KKLT string\ncompactification.

The ``singularity'' is viewed in five dimensions as a smooth bubble of\n``nothing'' which eats up a portion of spacetime as it expands.
