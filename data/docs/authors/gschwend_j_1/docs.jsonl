An Empirical Consistency\n  Test of Dark Energy Models Abstract: We apply the technique of parameter-splitting to existing cosmological data\nsets, to check for a generic failure of dark energy models. Given a dark energy\nparameter, such as the energy density Omega_Lambda or equation of state w, we\nsplit it into two meta-parameters with one controlling geometrical distances,\nand the other controlling the growth of structure. Observational data spanning\nType Ia Supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering,\nand weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the two\nmeta-parameters to be equal. This technique checks for inconsistency between\ndifferent data sets, as well as for internal inconsistency within any one data\nset (e.g., CMB or lensing statistics) that is sensitive to both geometry and\ngrowth. We find that the cosmological constant model is consistent with current\ndata. Theories of modified gravity generally predict a relation between growth\nand geometry that is different from that of general relativity.\nParameter-splitting can be viewed as a crude way to parametrize the space of\nsuch theories. Our analysis of current data already appears to put sharp limits\non these theories: assuming a flat universe, current data constrain the\ndifference Omega_Lambda(geom) - Omega_Lambda(grow) to be -0.0044 +/- 0.0058\n(68% C.L.); allowing the equation of state w to vary, the difference w(geom) -\nw(grow) is constrained to be 0.37 +/- 0.37 (68% C.L.).

We find w(grow) < -0.80 at 2 sigma.

Statistical and systematic errors are now sufficiently\nsmall, and the redshift leverage sufficiently large for the mass function\nevolution to be used as a useful growth of structure based dark energy probe.\nIn this paper, we present cosmological parameter constraints obtained from\nChandra observations of 36 clusters with <z>=0.55 derived from 400deg^2 ROSAT\nserendipitous survey and 49 brightest z=~0.05 clusters detected in the All-Sky\nSurvey. Evolution of the mass function between these redshifts requires\nOmega_Lambda>0 with a ~5sigma significance, and constrains the dark energy\nequation of state parameter to w0=-1.14+-0.21, assuming constant w and flat\nuniverse.

For DM particles decoupling NR, sqrt{m T_d} results in the keV scale (T_d\nis the decoupling temperature) and the m value is consistent with the keV\nscale. In all cases, DM turns to be cold DM (CDM). Also, lower and upper bounds\non the DM annihilation cross-section for NR decoupling are derived.

This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes.

We predict that a higher number of E+A galaxies in the\nearly universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher number of starburst, but\nis a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to more gas\ncontent of the galaxies in the early universe.

The time-dependent solutions of this equation is crucial to the\nestimation of the effect of the Wouthuysen-Field (WF) coupling in relation to\nthe 21 cm emission and absorption at the epoch of reionization. The resonant\nscattering leads to the photon distribution in the frequency space to be\npiecewise smooth containing sharp changes. The weighted essentially\nnonoscillatory (WENO) scheme is suitable to handle this problem, as this\nalgorithm has been found to be highly stable and robust for solving Boltzmann\nequation. We test this numerical solver against analytic solutions of the\nevolution of the photon distribution in rest background, analytic solution in\nexpanding background without resonant scattering and formation of local\nBoltzmann distribution around the resonant frequency with the temperature same\nas that of atom for recoil. We find that evolution of photon distribution\nundergoes three phases; profile is similar to the initial one, a flat plateau\n(without recoil) or local Boltzmann distribution (with recoil) forms around the\nresonant frequency, and finally the distribution around the resonant frequency\nis saturated when the photons from the source is balanced by the redshift of\nthe expansion. This result indicates that the onset of the W-F coupling should\nnot be determined by the third phase, but by the time scale of the second\nphase.

GCs beginning their\nformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their\nsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during\nformation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the\nmass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (\"blue tilt\") appears in the\nmetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies.

While coupling\nuniversally to matter, the brane-bending mode has self-interactions that become\nimportant as soon as the density field becomes non-linear.

We also report a correlation between the mass of a\nsubhalo and the area of its corresponding 2D detection; such a correlation,\nonce calibrated, could provide a useful estimator for substructure mass.\nComparing our 2D mass and X-ray substructures, we find a surprising number of\ncases where the matching fails: around one third of galaxy-sized substructures\nhave no X-ray counterpart. Some interesting cases are also found at larger\nmasses, in particular the cores of merging clusters where the situation can be\ncomplex. Finally, we degrade our mass maps to what is currently achievable with\nweak-lensing observations (~100 h^-1 kpc at z=0.2). While the completeness mass\nlimit increases by around an order of magnitude, a mass-area correlation\nremains. Our paper clearly demonstrates that the next generation of lensing\nsurveys should start to reveal a wealth of information on cluster substructure.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

The\nuncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates the\nsystematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the dark\nenergy equation of state. The photometric calibration of the SNLS requires\nobtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science field\nstars in each survey band (SDSS-like ugriz bands) with respect to standards\nwith known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the UBVRI\nLandolt standards used to calibrate the nearby SNe from the literature\nnecessary to produce cosmological constraints.

This poses a major\nchallenge for cosmological models of galaxy formation. Galaxies form at the\ncentre of dark matter halos through a combination of hierarchical merging and\ngas accretion along cold streams, and should rapidly grow their bulge through\nmergers and instabilities. Cosmological simulations predict galaxies to have\nmost of their mass in the central bulge, and therefore an angular momentum much\nbelow the observed level, except in dwarf galaxies. We propose that the\ncontinuous return of fresh gas by stellar populations over cosmic times could\nsolve this issue. A population of stars formed at a given instant typically\nreturns half of its initial mass in the form of gas over 10 billion years, and\nthe process is not dominated by rapid supernovae explosions but by the\nlong-term mass-loss from low- and intermediate-mass stars.

In so doing, we provide an\napproximate blueprint for computing the influence of specific outlier\npopulations on dark energy constraints.

In the\ncomplementary limit, a subset of imaged galaxies with uncalibrated photometric\nredshifts distributed over a broad range must be limited to fewer than a\nper-galaxy error rate of <~ a few times 10^-4. Additionally, we explore the\nrelative importance of calibrating the photo-z's of a core set of relatively\nwell-understood galaxies as compared to the need to identify potential\ncatastrophic photo-z outliers.

Conventional methods average over a single\nquantity per galaxy to estimate each shear component. We show that any such\nshear estimators must reduce to a highly nonlinear form when the galaxy image\nis described by three parameters (pure ellipse), even in the absence of the\npoint spread function (PSF). In the presence of the PSF, we argue that this\nclass of shear estimators do not likely exist. Alternatively, we propose a new\nway of measuring the cosmic shear: instead of averaging over a single value\nfrom each galaxy, we average over two numbers, and then take the ratio to\nestimate the shear component. In particular, the two numbers correspond to the\nnumerator and denominators which generate the quadrupole moments of the galaxy\nimage in Fourier space, as proposed in Zhang (2008).

The size of the differential effect is on the order of 0.6 dex across\n2 < n < 10. The apparent n-dependence of Mstar/Mdyn is similar to expectations\nfrom simple models, indicating that assuming homology gives the wrong dynamical\nmass. We have also derived dynamical mass estimates that explicitly account for\ndifferences in galaxies' profiles. Using this `structure-corrected' dynamical\nmass estimator, M(dyn,n), the best fit relation is Mstar = M(dyn,n)**(0.92 +-\n0.08) with an observed scatter of 0.13 dex. While the data are thus consistent\nwith a linear relation, they do prefer a slightly shallower slope. Further, we\nsee only a small residual trend in Mstar/M(dyn,n) with n.

Assuming that the clusters have secure redshift estimates, we\nshow that the joint experiment enables a self-calibration of important\nsystematic errors including the source redshift uncertainty and the cluster\nmass-observable relation, by adopting a single population of background source\ngalaxies for the lensing analysis. It allows us to use the relative strengths\nof stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating the\nsource redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements of\nthe mean cluster mass in each bin. In addition, our formulation of stacked\nlensing signals in Fourier space simplifies the Fisher matrix calculations, as\nwell as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the most\nsignificant uncertainty in stacked lensing. We show that upcoming wide-field\nsurveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including dark\nenergy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that model\nsystematic uncertainties. Specifically, the stacked lensing information\nimproves the dark energy FoM by a factor of 4, compared to that from the\ncluster observables alone.

Inefficient fueling (and/or\nfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we\nargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of\nthese effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of\nBH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale\ncorresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local\ndynamical times).

As such, they\ncan be thought as one of the most efficient engines of Nature, perhaps even\nmore efficient than accretion. We are starting to disclose these features\nthrough a detailed study of their properties, made possible by the analysis of\nthe energy band where they emit most of their electromagnetic output, namely\nthe gamma-ray band. That is why the observations by the Fermi satellite and by\nthe ground based Cherenkov telescopes are crucial to understand extragalactic\njets. At the start, we believe they are magnetically dominated. And yet, on the\nscale where they emit most of their luminosity, their power is already in the\nform of kinetic energy of particles. The spectral properties of bright sources\nshow a trend, controlled mainly by the bolometric apparent luminosity. With\nimproved sensitivity, and the detection of weaker sources, we can explore the\nidea that the spectral trends are a result of the same physical quantities\ncontrolling the emission of non-jetted sources: the black hole mass and the\naccretion rate. This is based on recent results on sources showing a thermal\ncomponent in their spectrum, besides a non-thermal continuum. That the jet\npower should be linked to accretion is intriguing. Most of the apparent\ndiversity of extragalactic radio sources can then be understood on the basis of\nthe viewing angle, controlling the relativistic Doppler boosting of the\nemission, the black hole mass and the accretion rate. \n\n"}

The sample spans\na wide range in luminosity (0.02-4 L*) and extends from the cluster core to\nnear the virial radius. We find a clear distinction in the observed trends of\nthe giant and dwarf galaxies. The ages of red-sequence giants are primarily\ndetermined by galaxy mass, with only weak modulation by environment, in the\nsense that galaxies at larger cluster-centric distance are slightly younger.\nFor red-sequence dwarfs (with mass <10^10 Msun), the roles of mass and\nenvironment as predictors of age are reversed: there is little dependence on\nmass, but strong trends with projected cluster-centric radius are observed. The\naverage age of dwarfs at the 2.5 Mpc limit of our sample is approximately half\nthat of dwarfs near the cluster centre. The gradient in dwarf galaxy ages is a\nglobal cluster-centric trend, and is not driven by the ongoing merger of the\nNGC 4839 group to the south west of Coma.

We use a set of large (~10^6 Mpc^3) cosmological SPH\nsimulations that include a detailed treatment of star formation, feedback,\nmetal enrichment and supernova dust production; these same simulations have\nalready been shown to successfully reproduce a large number of observed\nproperties of LAEs (Dayal et al. 2010). We identify LBGs as galaxies with an\nabsolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitude M_{UV} <= -17, consistent with current\nobservational criteria. With no further parameter tuning, the model reproduces\nthe redshift evolution of the LBG UV luminosity function, stellar mass\nfunction, and star formation rate (SFR) density extremely well, compared to the\ndata at z~6-8. It predicts a z-independent average beta value of about -2.2,\nconsistent with the most recent observational results. The mean LBG specific\nSFR increases from 6.7 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 6 to 13.9 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 8, and is largest\nfor the smallest LBGs. From a comparison of the simulated LAE and LBG\npopulations, we find no appreciable differences between them in terms of the\nstellar masses, ages, SFR, and dust content; only the faintest LBGs with M_{UV}\n>= -18 (-19) at z ~ 6 (8) do not show an observable Lyman Alpha line. LAEs\nhence represent a luminous LBG subset, whose relative extent depends only on\nthe adopted equivalent width (EW) selection criteria.

We construct phenomenological models of\nlarge-scale outflows which consist of cold clumps that are in pressure\nequilibrium with a constant-velocity hot wind. First we consider models in\nwhich the cold clumps are distributed symmetrically around the galaxy, and in\nwhich the clumps undergo a continuous acceleration in its 'circumgalactic'\nmedium (CGM). We constrain the properties of the cold clumps (radius, velocity,\nHI column density, & number density) by matching the observed Lya absorption\nstrength of the CGM in the spectra of background galaxies. We then insert a Lya\nsource in the center of this clumpy outflow, which consists of 1e5-1e6 clumps,\nand compute observable properties of the scattered Lya photons. In these\nmodels, the scattered radiation forms halos that are significantly more\nconcentrated than is observed. In order to simultaneously reproduce the\nobserved Lya absorption line strengths and the Lya halos, we require -\npreferably bipolar - outflows in which the clumps decelerate after their\ninitial acceleration.

Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our\nsample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true\nelliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of\nvarying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude\nthat the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the IGM, probably\nin a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk\nbuildup.

They are\nthought to correspond to early formative stages of disk galaxies. On the other\nhand, halo objects, such as old globular clusters and halo stars, are likely to\nconsist of the oldest stars in a galaxy (age>10 Gyr), therefore the clumpy disk\nformation can be presumed to take place in a pre-existing halo system. Aims:\nGiant clumps are orbiting in the same direction in a premature disk and so\nmassive that they may be expected to interact gravitationally with halo objects\nand exercise influence on kinematic state of the halo. Accordingly, I\nscrutinize the possibility that the clumps leave a kinematic imprint of the\nclumpy disk formation on a halo system. Methods: I perform a restricted N-body\ncalculation with a toy-model to study the kinematic influence on a halo by\norbital motions of clumps, examine dependence of the results on masses\n(mass-loss), number and orbital radii of the clumps. Results: I will show that\nhalo objects can catch clump motions and acquire disky rotation in a dynamical\nfriction time-scale of the clumps, ~0.5 Gyr. The influence of clumps is limited\nwithin a region around the disk, the halo system shows vertical gradients of\nnet rotation velocity and orbital eccentricity. The significance of the\nkinematic influence strongly depends on the clump masses, the lower limit of\npostulated clump mass would be 5x10^8 solar masses. The result depends also on\nwhether the clumps are subjected to rapid mass-loss or not, which is an open\nquestion under debate in recent studies. The existence of such massive clumps\nis not unrealistic, I therefore suggest that there could remain the imprints of\npast clumpy disk formation in current galactic halos. \n\n"}

We find\nthat the mean density within the scale radius, r_{-2} (where the halo density\nprofile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical density\nof the Universe at the time when the main progenitor's virial mass equals the\nmass enclosed within r_{-2}. Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and\ndensity, the mean MAH, expressed in terms of the critical density of the\nUniverse, M(\\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,\nM(<\\rho >), at z=0. Both follow closely the NFW profile, suggesting that the\nsimilarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo\nMAHs. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whose\naccretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show\ncorrelated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles.\nFitting both M(<\\rho >) and M(\\rho_{crit}) with either NFW or Einasto profiles\nyield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and\nextending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretion\nhistory. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to\ninitial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly from\nthe NFW shape show noticeable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a\nresult, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,\nwhich do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than\nCDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass\nprofile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong\nsupport for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose\nhere. \n\n"}

The method computes the effect of multiple radiative sources using\nthe same tree algorithm used for gravity, so it is computationally efficient\nand well resolved. The method foregoes calculating absorption and scattering in\nfavour of a constant escape fraction for young stars to keep the calculation\nefficient enough to simulate the entire evolution of a galaxy in a cosmological\ncontext to the present day. This allows us to quantify the effect of the local\nphotoionisation feedback through the whole history of a galaxy`s formation.

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the\nmulti-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar\nfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly\nfrom stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero\nadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo\nmass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and\nsmall groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the\nstellar mass function for M_star<10^11 M_sun. We predict weak redshift\nevolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to\nz>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only\nsupernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly\nin dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and\nradiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt GMCs and enable efficient coupling\nof later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates agree well with the\nobserved Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt\nrelation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas\ninto stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation via\nstellar feedback.

It is typically\nfound that there will be many well-constrained degrees of freedom. However, not\nall and, probably most, of these degrees of freedom were physical if the\nparametrization had allowed for an arbitrary $k$-dependence. In this paper, we\nrestrict the $k$-dependence to that allowed in local theories of gravity under\nthe quasi-static approximation, i.e. ratios of polynomials in $k$, and identify\nthe best constrained features in the ($z$,$k$)-dependence of the commonly\nconsidered functions $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ as measured by an LSST-like weak\nlensing survey.

The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r ~ R200m, and its\nabsolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate,\nreaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost\ndensity profiles at r > R200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are\nrescaled by R200m.

Based on spectral\nclassifications derived from broad- and narrow-band photometry, we define four\ndistinct galaxy populations representing different evolutionary stages: red\nsequence (RS) galaxies, blue cloud (BC) galaxies, green valley (GV) galaxies,\nand luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs).

We find that RS, BC, and GV galaxies in these clusters have\nsimilar velocity distributions, but that BC and GV galaxies tend to avoid the\ncore of the two z~0.55 clusters.

If these anomalies are in fact\nprimordial, then understanding their origin is fundamental to either validate\nthe standard model of cosmology or to explore new physics. We investigate three\nother possible issues: 1) the trade-off between minimising systematics due to\nforeground contamination (with a conservative mask) and minimising systematics\ndue to masking, 2) astrophysical secondary effects (the kinetic Doppler\nquadrupole and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect), and 3) secondary\ncosmological signals (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect). We address the\nmasking issue by considering new procedures that use both WMAP and Planck to\nproduce higher quality full-sky maps using the sparsity methodology (LGMCA\nmaps). We show the impact of masking is dominant over that of residual\nforegrounds, and the LGMCA full-sky maps can be used without further processing\nto study anomalies.

In the absence of magnetic fields, the\nfragmentation timescale in our model decreases by a factor of ~10 at the\ntransition from Z=0 to Z>0, with subsequently only a weak dependence on\nmetallicity. Similarly, the accretion timescale of the cluster is set by the\nlarge-scale dynamics rather than the local thermodynamics.

A characteristic\nfeature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but\nopposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General\nRelativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure.\nTherefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be\nresponsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity. We test this possibility in the\ncontext of the \\textit{Gravitational Aether} proposal, using current\ncosmological observations, which probe the gravity of relativistic pressure in\nthe radiation era. Interestingly, we find that the best fit for anomalous\npressure coupling is about half-way between General Relativity (GR), and\nGravitational Aether (GA), if we include \\textit{Planck} together with\n\\textit{WMAP} and BICEP2 polarization cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nobservations. Taken at face value, this data combination excludes both GR and\nGA at around the 3-sigma level. However, including higher resolution CMB\nobservations (\"highL\") or baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) pushes the best\nfit closer to GR, excluding the Gravitational Aether solution to the\ncosmological constant problem at the 4--5-sigma level.

In this\nreview we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for\nanticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding\nprinciples for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and\ndiscuss the prospects for empirical tests. We begin by reviewing attempts to\nconsistently modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion\nthat additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must screen\nthemselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize screening mechanisms into\nthree broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of high\nNewtonian potential, those in which first derivatives become important, and\nthose for which second derivatives are important.

We do not\ndetect any rotational spectral variations within the signal-to-noise, which\nallow us to constrain the extent of any existing surface heterogeneity.\n  For each observed spectrum of a longitudinal segment of an asteroid, we\nestimate the maximal size of an un-detected \"spot\" with a spectral signature\ndifferent than the average. For 5 asteroids the maximal diameter of such a spot\nis smaller by a factor of two than the diameter of the secondary member.\nTherefore, the site of the fission is larger than any area with a unique\nspectral parameters and the site of the fission does not have a unique\nspectrum. In the case of an S-complex asteroid, where the site of fission is\nexpected to present non-weathered spectra, a lack of a fission spot can be\nexplained if the rotational-fission process is followed by the spread of dust\nthat re-accumulates on the primary asteroid and covers it homogeneously. This\nis demonstrated for the young asteroid 6070 that presents an Sq-type spectrum\nwhile its inner material, that is presumably revealed on the surface of its\nsecondary member, 54827, has a fresher, Q-type spectrum. The spread of dust\nobserved in the disruption event of asteroid P/2013 R3, might be an example of\nsuch a process and an indication that it was indeed formed in a\nrotational-fission event. \n\n"}

Its unbiased and optimal estimation is therefore of\ngreat importance. In this paper we generalise the framework of Feldman et al.\n(1994) to take into account the fact that galaxies are not simply a Poisson\nsampling of the underlying dark matter distribution. Besides finite\nsurvey-volume effects and flux-limits, our optimal estimation scheme\nincorporates several of the key tenets of galaxy formation: galaxies form and\nreside exclusively in dark matter haloes; a given dark matter halo may host\nseveral galaxies of various luminosities; galaxies inherit part of their\nlarge-scale bias from their host halo. Under these broad assumptions, we prove\nthat the optimal weights \"do not\" explicitly depend on galaxy luminosity, other\nthan through defining the maximum survey volume and effective galaxy density at\na given position. Instead, they depend on the bias associated with the host\nhalo; the first and second factorial moments of the halo occupation\ndistribution; a selection function, which gives the fraction of galaxies that\ncan be observed in a halo of mass M at position r in the survey; and an\neffective number density of galaxies. If one wishes to reconstruct the matter\npower spectrum, then, provided the model is correct, this scheme provides the\nonly unbiased estimator.

However, detection of this faint monopole is challenging\ndue to high precision required in instrumental calibration and modeling of\nsubstantially brighter foregrounds and instrumental systematics.

The observing strategy\nhas been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts for\nthousands of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with the goal of measuring dark energy\nparameters. The essential DiffImg functions are to align each search image to a\ndeep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine the\nsubtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects.\nThe vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selection\nrequirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are\n130 detections per deg^2 per observation in each band, of which only 25% are\nartifacts. Of the 7500 transients discovered by DES-SN in its first observing\nseason, each requiring a detection on at least 2 separate nights, Monte Carlo\nsimulations predict that 27% are expected to be supernova. Another 30% of the\ntransients are artifacts, and most of the remaining transients are AGN and\nvariable stars. Fake SNe Ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluate\ndetection efficiencies, and to understand the DiffImg performance.

The models we adopt\nhere fully take into account velocity anisotropy of tracer stars confined\nwithin a flattened dark halo. Applying our models to the available kinematic\ndata of the 12 bright dSphs, we find that these galaxies associate with, in\ngeneral, elongated dark halos, even considering the effect of this velocity\nanisotropy of stars. We also find that the best-fit parameters, especially for\nthe shapes of dark halos and velocity anisotropy, are susceptible to both the\navailability of velocity data in the outer regions and the effect of the lack\nof sample stars in each spatial bin. Thus, to obtain more realistic limits on\ndark halo structures, we require photometric and kinematic data over much\nlarger areas in the dSphs than previously explored. The results obtained from\nthe currently available data suggest that the shapes of dark halos in the dSphs\nare more elongated than those of $\\Lambda$CDM subhalos.

Using relativistic numerical\nsimulations, we examine the possibility of observationally determining if our\nobservable universe resulted from a classical transition. We find that\nclassical transitions produce spatially infinite, approximately open\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker universes. The leading set of observables in the\naftermath of a classical transition are negative spatial curvature and a\ncontribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature quadrupole.

As part of the process of achieving this aim, a \"Data Challenge\"\nhas been conducted, providing international teams the opportunity to test a\nvariety of source finders on a set of simulated images. The aim is to quantify\nthe accuracy of existing automated source finding and measurement approaches,\nand to identify potential limitations. The Challenge attracted nine independent\nteams, who tested eleven different source finding tools. In addition, the\nChallenge initiators also tested the current ASKAPsoft source-finding tool to\nestablish how it could benefit from incorporating successful features of the\nother tools. Here we present the results of the Data Challenge, identifying the\nsuccesses and limitations for this broad variety of the current generation of\nradio source finding tools. As expected, most finders demonstrate completeness\nlevels close to 100% at 10sigma dropping to levels around 10% by 5sigma. The\nreliability is typically close to 100% at 10sigma, with performance to lower\nsensitivities varying greatly between finders.

The dependence of the constraints\non the intrinsic scatter of the luminosity relation and the redshift\ndistribution of the standard candles is specifically investigated. The results,\nespecially for the constraints on the components of the universe, clearly show\nthat constraints from standard candles at different redshifts have different\ndegeneracy orientations, thus standard candles with a wide redshift\ndistribution can self break the degeneracy and improve the constraints\nsignificantly.

{"id": "1509.07877", "contents": "Title: A Constrained-Gradient Method to Control Divergence Errors in Numerical\n  MHD Abstract: In numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a major challenge is maintaining\nzero magnetic field-divergence (div-B). Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

The precision of such measurements will dramatically increase\nwith ongoing and future wide-field galaxy surveys. However, these are also\nincreasingly sensitive to observational and astrophysical contaminants. Here,\nwe study the statistical properties of three methods proposed for controlling\nsuch systematics -- template subtraction, basic mode projection, and extended\nmode projection -- all of which make use of externally supplied template maps,\ndesigned to characterise and capture the spatial variations of potential\nsystematic effects. Based on a detailed mathematical analysis, and in agreement\nwith simulations, we find that the template subtraction method in its original\nformulation returns biased estimates of the galaxy angular clustering.

The computation entails a subtle interplay between\nthe near (or potential) and far (or radiation) zones. In particular, we find\nthat the tail contribution to the effective action is non-local in time, and\nfeatures both a dissipative and a `conservative' term. The latter includes a\nlogarithmic ultraviolet (UV) divergence, which we show cancels against an\ninfrared (IR) singularity found in the (conservative) near zone. The origin of\nthis behavior in the long-distance EFT is due to the point-particle limit\n-shrinking the binary to a point- which transforms a would-be infrared\nsingularity into an ultraviolet divergence. This is a common occurrence in an\nEFT approach, which furthermore allows us to use renormalization group (RG)\ntechniques to resum the resulting logarithmic contributions.

Past surveys\nhave achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar\nphotometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in\nmultiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only\nconsider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal\nplane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the\nsource color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the\natmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source\ncolor-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be\nconsidered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,\nwe examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES\nand calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system.

Similarly, a direct\ncross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an\nanomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or\nWMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential\nexplanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS\ngalaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred. Simulations are used\nin the CFHTLenS pipeline to calibrate such biases, but no data-driven\nconstraints have been presented to date. In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al. (2013). We analyze three magnitude-limited galaxy samples, finding\n2-4sigma evidence for m<1 using the deepest sample (i<24), while the others are\nconsistent with m=1 (no bias). This matches the expectation that the shapes of\nfaint galaxies are the most prone to measurement biases. Our results for m are\nessentially independent of the assumed cosmology, and only weakly sensitive to\nassumptions about the galaxy bias. We consider three galaxy bias models,\nfinding in all cases that the best-fit multiplicative shear bias is less than\nunity. A value of m~0.9 would suffice to reconcile the amplitude of density\nfluctuations inferred from the CFHTLenS shear two-point statistics with that\ninferred from Planck CMB temperature data.

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored. We use this \"drift and\nshift\" (DASH) method in the Cycle 23 COSMOS-DASH program, which will obtain 456\nWFC3 $H_{160}$ pointings in 57 orbits, covering an area of 0.6 degree$^2$ in\nthe COSMOS field down to $H_{160} = 25$.

Cosmic voids\nare usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information\nabout the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an\nincreasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void\nstudies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position\nerrors of $\\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable. In\nthis paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys,\nvalidate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-$z$\nredMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV)\ndata. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding\nvoids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the\nline-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-$z$ scatter,\nthe number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic\nand photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20% for all transverse void sizes,\nand indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius $\\sim 70$ Mpc/$h$ and\nlarger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric\nvoids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample.

The simulation procedure\nis based exclusively on empirical prescriptions -- rather than first principles\n-- to provide the most accurate match with observations at 0<z<7. In\nparticular, we consider that galaxies can be either quiescent or star-forming,\nand use their stellar mass (M*) and redshift (z) as the fundamental properties\nfrom which all the other observables can be statistically derived. Drawing z\nand M* from the observed galaxy stellar mass functions, we associate a star\nformation rate (SFR) to each galaxy from the tight SFR-M* main sequence, while\ndust attenuation, optical colors and morphologies (including bulge-to-total\nratios, sizes and aspect ratios) are obtained from empirical relations that we\nestablish from the high quality Hubble and Herschel observations available in\nthe CANDELS fields. Random scatter is introduced in each step to reproduce the\nobserved distributions of each parameter. Based on these observables, a\npanchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) is selected for each galaxy and\nsynthetic photometry is produced by integrating the redshifted SED in common\nbroad-band filters. Finally, the mock galaxies are placed on the sky at random\npositions with a fixed angular two-point correlation function to implement\nbasic clustering. The resulting flux catalogs reproduce accurately the observed\nnumber counts in all broad bands from the ultraviolet up to the sub-millimeter,\nand can be directly fed to image simulators such as Skymaker. The images can\nthen be used to test source extraction softwares and image-based techniques\nsuch as stacking. EGG is open-source, and is made available to the community\ntogether with a set of pre-generated catalogs and images. \n\n"}

At $z = 0.1$ it declines from 0.25 dex at $M_{200, \\rm DMO} \\approx\n10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ to 0.12 dex at $M_{200, \\rm DMO} \\approx 10^{13}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, but the trend is weak above $10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. For $M_{200,\n\\rm DMO} < 10^{12.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to\nscatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass\ncorresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher\nconcentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion\nand star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with\nhigher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, $V_{\\rm max, DMO}$, and\nbinding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass,\nmeaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide\nfitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass.

The first BBC fitting stage uses a\nposterior distribution that includes multiple SN likelihoods, a Monte Carlo\nsimulation to bias-correct the fitted SALT-II parameters, and CC probabilities\ndetermined from a machine learning technique. The BBC fit determines 1) a\nbin-averaged HD (average distance vs. redshift), and 2) the nuisance parameters\nalpha and beta, which multiply the stretch and color (respectively) to\nstandardize the SN brightness. In the second stage, the bin-averaged HD is fit\nto a cosmological model where priors can be imposed. We perform high precision\ntests of the BBC method by simulating large (150,000 event) data samples\ncorresponding to the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Our tests include\nthree models of intrinsic scatter, each with two different CC rates. In the BBC\nfit, the SALT-II nuisance parameters alpha and beta are recovered to within 1%\nof their true values. In the cosmology fit, we determine the dark energy\nequation of state parameter w using a fixed value of Omega_matter as a prior:\naveraging over all six tests based on 6 x 150,000 = 900,000 SNe, there is a\nsmall w-bias of 0.006 +- 0.002.

The level of this discrepancy significantly exceeds the\nmaximum halo assembly bias signal predicted by LCDM. In this study, we explore\nwhether some of the clustering bias differences could be caused by biases in\n$R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ due to projection effects from other systems along the\nline-of-sight. We thoroughly investigate the halo assembly bias of the\nphotometrically-detected redMaPPer clusters in SDSS, by defining a new variant\nof the average membership distance estimator $\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ that is\nmore robust against projection effects in the cluster membership\nidentification. Using the angular mark correlation functions of clusters, we\nshow that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by $R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$\ncan be largely attributed to such projection effects. After splitting by\n$\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a\nratio of $1.02\\pm0.14$ between the two clustering biases as measured from weak\nlensing. Using a realistic mock cluster catalog, we predict that the bias ratio\nbetween two $\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$-split subsamples should be $<1.10$,\nwhich is at least 60% weaker than the maximum halo assembly bias signal (1.24)\nwhen split by halo concentration.

Using data\nfrom SDSS, we explore the evidence for such a feature in the density profiles\nof galaxy clusters and investigate the connection between this feature and a\npossible phase space boundary.

The CNN is currently\noptimized to recognize lenses with Einstein radii $\\gtrsim 1.4$ arcsec, about\ntwice the $r$-band seeing in KiDS. In a sample of $21789$ colour-magnitude\nselected Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG), of which three are known lenses, the CNN\nretrieves 761 strong-lens candidates and correctly classifies two out of three\nof the known lenses. The misclassified lens has an Einstein radius below the\nrange on which the algorithm is trained. We down-select the most reliable 56\ncandidates by a joint visual inspection. This final sample is presented and\ndiscussed. A conservative estimate based on our results shows that with our\nproposed method it should be possible to find $\\sim100$ massive LRG-galaxy\nlenses at $z\\lsim 0.4$ in KiDS when completed. In the most optimistic scenario\nthis number can grow considerably (to maximally $\\sim$2400 lenses), when\nwidening the colour-magnitude selection and training the CNN to recognize\nsmaller image-separation lens systems. \n\n"}

The red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation\n(redMaPPer) estimates the probability that each member galaxy is central from\nphotometric information rather than specifying one central galaxy.

Due to the rarity of galaxy-scale\nstrongly lensed systems, fast and reliable automated lens finding methods will\nbe essential in the era of large surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST.

An envelope of scatterers like\nfree-electrons, atoms/molecules, or haze/clouds affects the Stokes-vector of\nradiation emitted by oblate bodies. Due to high rotation rates, BDs can be\nconsiderably oblate. We present a conics-based radiative transfer (RT) scheme\nfor computing the disc-resolved and disc-integrated polarized emission of an\noblate BD or extrasolar giant planet (EGP) bearing homogenous or patchy clouds.\nAssuming a uniform grey atmosphere, we theoretically examine the\nphotopolarimetric sensitivity to its scattering properties like cloud optical\nthickness and grain-size, concurrently with BD properties, like oblateness,\ninclination and effective temperature, which are all treated as free\nparameters. Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the\nresulting polarization.\n  Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination.\nThe degree-of-polarization (DoP) increases in response to both, making it\npotentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD. Under our\nmodel assumptions, increasing droplet size in optically thick clouds causes a\nblue-ward shift in near-infrared (NIR) colors of BDs --- interesting in view of\nthe observed J-K brightening in L/T transition. For large cloud grains,\npolarization decreases sharply, while transmitted intensity shows a steady\nincrease. BD polarization is thus a potential indicator not only of the\npresence of clouds but also provides information on cloud grain size. \n\n"}

In this work, we investigate a bias to CMB lensing reconstruction\nfrom temperature anisotropies due to the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ)\neffect, that is, the Doppler shift of CMB photons induced by Compton-scattering\noff moving electrons. The kSZ signal yields biases due to both its own\nintrinsic non-Gaussianity and its non-zero cross-correlation with the CMB\nlensing field (and other fields that trace the large-scale structure). This\nkSZ-induced bias affects both the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum and its\ncross-correlation with low-redshift tracers. Furthermore, it cannot be removed\nby multifrequency foreground separation techniques because the kSZ effect\npreserves the blackbody spectrum of the CMB. While statistically negligible for\ncurrent datasets, we show that it will be important for upcoming surveys, and\nfailure to account for it can lead to large biases in constraints on neutrino\nmasses or the properties of dark energy. For a Stage 4 CMB experiment, the bias\ncan be as large as $\\approx$ 15% or 12% in cross-correlation with LSST galaxy\nlensing convergence or galaxy overdensity maps, respectively, when the maximum\ntemperature multipole used in the reconstruction is $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 4000$,\nand about half of that when $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 3000$.

It adopts a mean bias relation based on a quadratic bias\nmodel to relate the log-densities of dark matter to those of mass-weighted dark\nhaloes in real and redshift space. The validity of the parametrised bias model\nis established using a parametrisation-independent extraction of the bias\nfunction. This average bias model is then combined with the dark matter PDF,\nneglecting any scatter around it: it nevertheless yields an excellent model for\ndensities-in-cells statistics of mass tracers that is parametrised in terms of\nthe underlying dark matter variance and three bias parameters.

We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters.

Comparing these results with observations at\nsimilar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature\nand scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are\ngenerally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance.\nConsidering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to\ntentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous\nspreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be\nruled out. \n\n"}

For simulated data, the reconstructions achieve an\naccuracy of $3-7\\%$ (68\\% confidence level) over the above $k$-range for a\nsurvey area and a typical depth of contemporary ground-based surveys.\nRealistically the accuracy is, however, probably reduced to about $10-15\\%$,\nmainly by systematic uncertainties in the assumed intrinsic source alignment,\nthe fiducial cosmology, and the redshift distributions of lens and source\ngalaxies (in that order). Furthermore, our reconstruction technique employs\nphysical templates for $b(k)$ and $r(k)$ that elucidate the impact of central\ngalaxies and the halo-occupation statistics of satellite galaxies on the\nscale-dependence of galaxy bias, which we discuss in the paper.

Here we use our new population-synthesis code MOBSE,\nan upgraded version of BSE (Hurley et al. 2002), to investigate the demography\nof merging BHBs. MOBSE includes metallicity-dependent prescriptions for mass\nloss of massive hot stars. It also accounts for the impact of the\nelectron-scattering Eddington factor on mass loss. We perform >10^8 simulations\nof isolated massive binaries, with 12 different metallicities, to study the\nimpact of mass loss, core-collapse supernovae and common envelope on merging\nBHBs.

However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses <40 Msun.\nWe find merging BHBs with mass ratios in the 0.1 - 1.0 range, even if mass\nratios >0.6 are more likely.

Simulations of low-Z massive stars (M$_{\\rm i}\\sim$ 150$-$600\nM$_{\\odot}$) show that both core-hydrogen-burning cool supergiants and hot\nionizing stellar sources are expected to be present simulaneously in young\nglobular clusters. Under these conditions, photoionization-confined shells form\naround the supergiants. We find that the shell is gravitationally unstable on a\ntimescale that is shorter than the lifetime of the supergiant, and the\nBonnor-Ebert mass of the overdense regions is low enough to allow star\nformation. Since the low-mass stellar generation formed in this shell is made\nup of the material lost from the supergiant, its composition necessarily\nreflects the composition of the supergiant wind. We show that the wind contains\nhot-hydrogen-burning products, and that the shell-stars therefore have very\nsimilar abundance anomalies that are observed in the second generation stars of\nglobular clusters. Considering the mass-budget required for the second\ngeneration star-formation, we offer two solutions. Either a top-heavy initial\nmass function is needed with an index of $-$1.71..$-$2.07.

We\ndivide the groups into four halo mass bins, and measure the signals around four\ndifferent halo-center tracers: brightest central galaxy (BCG),\nluminosity-weighted center, number-weighted center and X-ray peak position. For\nX-ray and SDSS DR7 cross identified groups, we further split the groups into\nlow and high X-ray emission subsamples, both of which are assigned with two\nhalo-center tracers, BCGs and X-ray peak positions. The galaxy-galaxy lensing\nsignals show that BCGs, among the four candidates, are the best halo-center\ntracers. We model the lensing signals using a combination of four\ncontributions: off-centered NFW host halo profile, sub-halo contribution,\nstellar contribution, and projected 2-halo term. We sample the posterior of 5\nparameters i.e., halo mass, concentration, off-centering distance, sub halo\nmass, and fraction of subhalos via a MCMC package using the galaxy-galaxy\nlensing signals.

The behavior of\ndensity and temperature contrasts are analyzed for the hard-sphere model in\ndetail. In the small wavelengths regime, increasing the amount of shear\nviscosity into the system forces the harmonic perturbations to damp faster,\nhowever, in the opposite limit larger values of shear viscosity lead to smaller\nvalues of density and temperature contrasts. For the hyperbolic case, the\ndispersion relation becomes a polynomial in the frequency with two orders\nhigher in relation to the five-field theory, indicating that the effects\nassociated with the shear viscosity and heat flux are non-trivial.

But the role of magnetic fields and charged dust has not\nyet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas which obeys ideal MHD and\nis coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external\nacceleration (e.g., gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas.

Dust charge and magnetic fields do not\nsuppress instabilities, but give rise to a large number of new instability\n'families,' each with distinct behavior.

We evolve our\nmodels, where possible, until they have produced a first hydrostatic core.\nModels with $\\zeta_\\text{cr}\\gtrsim10^{-13}$ s$^{-1}$ are indistinguishable\nfrom ideal MHD models and the evolution of the model with\n$\\zeta_\\text{cr}=10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ matches the evolution of the ideal MHD\nmodel within one per cent when considering maximum density, magnetic energy,\nand maximum magnetic field strength as a function of time; these results are\nindependent of $a_\\text{g}$. Models with very low ionisation rates\n($\\zeta_\\text{cr}\\lesssim10^{-24}$ s$^{-1}$) are required to approach\nhydrodynamical collapse, and even lower ionisation rates may be required for\nlarger $a_\\text{g}$. Thus, it is possible to reproduce ideal MHD and purely\nhydrodynamical collapses using non-ideal MHD given an appropriate cosmic ray\nionisation rate.

Our bounds for a fermion coupled to a dark photon constrain small\ncouplings and masses <200 MeV, and do not decouple for low fermion masses.

For these systems, we measure a slope in the SFR-dM/dt relation\ngreater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores\nare also cooling more efficiently. We propose that this may be related to, on\naverage, higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which\ncould influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and\ndominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback.

We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo\nconnection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches.

Gravitational wave observations of stellar-mass binary black holes are\nnot expected to be accompanied by any electro-magnetic event that may help in\naccessing their redshifts. We address this deficiency by using an optical\ncatalog to get the distribution of galaxies in redshift.

As in the case of inflation, the conformal\ninvariance of the electromagnetic action needs to be broken in bouncing\nscenarios in order to generate primordial magnetic fields which correspond to\nobserved strengths today. The non-minimal coupling, which typically depends on\na scalar field that possibly drives the homogeneous background, leads to a\ncross-correlation at the level of the three-point function between the\nperturbation in the scalar field and the magnetic fields. This has been studied\nin some detail in the context of inflation and, specifically, it has been\nestablished that the three-point function satisfies the so-called consistency\nrelation in the squeezed limit. In this work, we study the cross-correlation\nbetween the magnetic fields and the perturbation in an auxiliary scalar field\nin a certain class of bouncing scenarios. We consider couplings that lead to\nscale invariant spectra of the magnetic field and evaluate the corresponding\ncross-correlation between the magnetic field and the perturbation in the scalar\nfield. We find that, when compared to de Sitter inflation, the dimensionless\nnon-Gaussianity parameter that characterizes the amplitude of the\ncross-correlations proves to be considerably larger in bouncing scenarios.

First, in each cluster, averaged\nover the spread of age, we investigate how disk lifetime is dependent on\nstellar mass.

Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and\ncentrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a\nprolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation.

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength.

We concentrate on the projected correlation\nfunction w(r_p), which is directly related to the real space \\xi(r). The\namplitude of w(r_p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeply\nabove the characteristic luminosity L_*. Redder galaxies exhibit a higher\namplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation\namplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the\nluminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red\ngalaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies more\nstrongly clustered at small scales. We interpret these results using halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) models assuming concordance cosmological\nparameters. For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits\nthe w(r_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r_p ~ 1-3\nMpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of \\xi(r).

Combined with previous SN Ia datasets, we\nmeasured H(z) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty of\nH(z>1) from 50% to under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk--the\ntransition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present.

With even crude redshift\ninformation (say from broad band colours) it should be possible to constrain\nthe cosmological world model.

If one normalises to galaxy clustering, with $M/L$ fixed\nby small-scale galaxy dynamics, then low density models predict a much stronger\ndistortion.

This is\ndone via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden-\nDwingeloo map of H_I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a\nsuitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no\nsignificant CIB is detected.
