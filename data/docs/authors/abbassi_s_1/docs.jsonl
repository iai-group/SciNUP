Simple arguments show that the location of the\nlength-scale r_c, marking the transition from positive to negative\ncorrelations, is the same for any class of objects as for the full matter\ndistribution, i.e. it is invariant under biasing. This scale is predicted by\nmodels to be at about the same distance of the scale signaling the baryonic\nacoustic oscillation scale r_{bao}.

We\nfurther explore mechanisms responsible for their formation and show that a\nlarge fraction of clouds originate as a consequence of late-time filamentary\n\"cold mode\" accretion. Here, filaments that are still colder and denser than\nthe surrounding halo gas, are not able to connect directly to galaxies, as they\ndo at high redshift, but are instead susceptible to the combined action of\ncooling and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at intermediate radii within the halo\nleading to the production of cold, dense pressure-confined clouds, without an\nassociated dark matter component. This process is aided through the compression\nof the incoming filaments by the hot halo gas and expanding shocks during the\nhalo buildup.

Binary black hole merger effects on\n  accretion disks Abstract: The merger process of a binary black hole system can have a strong impact on\na circumbinary disk. In the present work we study the effect of both central\nmass reduction (due to the energy loss through gravitational waves) and a\npossible black hole recoil (due to asymmetric emission of gravitational\nradiation). For the mass reduction case and recoil directed along the disk's\nangular momentum, oscillations are induced in the disk which then modulate the\ninternal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosities. On the other hand, when the\nrecoil direction has a component orthogonal to the disk's angular momentum, the\ndisk's dynamics are strongly impacted, giving rise to relativistic shocks. The\nshock heating leaves its signature in our proxies for radiation, the total\ninternal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosity. Interestingly, for cases where\nthe kick velocity is below the smallest orbital velocity in the disk (a likely\nscenario in real AGN), we observe a common, characteristic pattern in the\ninternal energy of the disk. Variations in kick velocity simply provide a phase\noffset in the characteristic pattern implying that observations of such a\nsignature could yield a measure of the kick velocity through electromagnetic\nsignals alone. \n\n"}

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail. Escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take place\nimmediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over the\norbit of the cluster. All observable overdensities are therefore of the\nmentioned two types. In particular, we note that substructured tidal tails do\nnot imply the existence of dark-matter sub-structures in the haloes of\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

In this paper, we present the first spectroscopic\nstudy of individual red giant branch stars in And X, as a part of the SPLASH\nSurvey (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo).\nUsing the Keck II telescope and multiobject DEIMOS spectrograph, we target two\nspectroscopic masks over the face of the galaxy and measure radial velocities\nfor ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. The velocity\nhistogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sight\nline: foreground Milky Way dwarfs at small negative velocities, M31 halo red\ngiants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike''\nconsisting of 22 stars belonging to And X with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s.

Such a large instantaneous inflow\ncannot have persisted over a Hubble time. The central constant-entropy\ntemperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by\ncompressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since\nthe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the\nmost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which\nthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core\nexceeds the total mass observed there. This paradox can be resolved by\nintermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy released\nnear the black hole. Inflowing gas is also required at intermediate kpc radii\nto explain the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes due to spin-up by mass ejected by\nstars that rotate with the galaxy and to explain local density and temperature\nprofiles.

In hierarchical formation scenarios, SMBHs are expected to\nform binaries following the merger of their host galaxies. If these binaries do\nnot coalesce before the merger with a third galaxy, the formation of a black\nhole triple system is possible. Numerical simulations of the dynamics of\ntriples within galaxy cores exhibit phases of very high eccentricity (as high\nas $e \\sim 0.99$). During these phases, intense bursts of gravitational\nradiation can be emitted at orbital periapsis. This produces a gravitational\nwave signal at frequencies substantially higher than the orbital frequency. The\nlikelihood of detection of these bursts with pulsar timing and the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna ({\\it LISA}) is estimated using several population\nmodels of SMBHs with masses $\\gtrsim 10^7 {\\rm M_\\odot}$. Assuming a fraction\nof binaries $\\ge 0.1$ in triple system, we find that few to few dozens of these\nbursts will produce residuals $>1$ ns, within the sensitivity range of\nforthcoming pulsar timing arrays (PTAs).

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration. We confirm this finding and attribute the acceleration to the\nsideways expansion of the jet - the magnetic energy is converted into the\nkinetic one in the strong magnetosonic rarefaction wave, which is launched when\nthe jet loses its external support. This type of acceleration, the rarefaction\nacceleration, is specific to relativistic jets because their energy budget can\nstill be dominated by magnetic energy even in highly super-fast magnetosonic\nregime. Just like the collimation acceleration of externally confined\nmagnetized jets, it is connected with the geometry of magnetic flux sufaces. In\nboth cases, in the acceleration zone the poloidal field lines diverge faster\nthan in the monopolar configuration.

It is shown that even without a detailed calculation of the\npressure anisotropy or the heat fluxes, one finds the macroscale dynamics to be\ngenerically unstable to microscale Alfvenically polarized fluctuations. Two\ninstabilities are considered in detail: the parallel firehose instability\n(including the finite-Larmor-radius effects that determine the fastest growing\nmode) and the gyrothermal instability (GTI). The latter is a new result - it is\nshown that a parallel ion heat flux destabilizes Alfvenically polarized\nfluctuations even in the absence of the negative pressure anisotropy required\nfor the firehose.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds.

The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background.

In this paper, we\nstudy the dynamics within virialized structures in the context of two modified\ngravity models, f(R) gravity and DGP. The non-linear mechanisms to restore GR,\nwhich f(R) and DGP implement in very different ways, have a strong impact on\nthe dynamics in bound objects; they leave distinctive signatures in the\ndynamical mass-lensing mass relation as a function of mass and radius. We\npresent measurements from N-body simulations of f(R) and DGP, as well as\nsemi-analytical models which match the simulation results to surprising\naccuracy in both cases.

Here we investigate a\nprevious report that there may be a large population of sub-arcsecond\ncompanions to Be stars.

The separations that\ncan be probed range from 0.1 to 8 arcsec (corresponding to 20-1000 AU), and\nmagnitude differences up to 10 magnitudes can in principle be covered. We\ndetect 11 binaries out of 37 Be targets (corresponding to a binary fraction of\n30 +/- 8%) and 10 binaries out of 36 B targets (29 +/- 8%). Further tests\ndemonstrate that the B and Be binary systems are not only similar in frequency\nbut also remarkably similar in terms of binary separations, flux differences\nand mass ratios. We find that any hypotheses invoking binary companions as\nresponsible for the formation of a disk need the companions to be closer than\n20 AU. Close companions are known to affect the circumstellar disks of Be\nstars, but as not all Be stars have been found to be close binaries, the data\nsuggest that binarity can not be responsible for the Be phenomenon in all Be\nstars. Finally, the similarities of the binary parameters themselves also shed\nlight on the Be formation mechanism.

Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

Briefly\nreviewing jets properties from these objects and from the Sun, we point out\nsome characteristics they share and indicate research areas where\ncross-breeeding between astrophysical and solar research is likely to be\nproductive. Preliminary results of this study suggest, for instance, that there\nmay be an analogy between blobs created by tearing instability in current\nsheets (CSs) associated with solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and quasi\nperiodic ejections of plasma associated with large radio outbursts in\nmicroquasars. \n\n"}

The CMD of Be 20 is best reproduced by stellar models with a\nmetallicity about half of solar (Z=0.008 or 0.01), in perfect agreement with\nhigh resolution spectroscopic estimates. Its age is between 5 and 6 Gyr from\nstellar models with overshooting and between 4.3 and 4.5 Gyr from models\nwithout it. The distance modulus from the best fitting models is always\n(m-M)0=14.7 (corresponding to a Galactocentric radius of about 16 kpc), and the\nreddening E(B-V) ranges between 0.13 and 0.16.

This instability is an inevitable outcome of\ninteractions between shock and ambient density fluctuations. We find that the\nmagnetic energy grows exponentially in a few eddy turnover times, and then,\nfollowing the decay of kinetic turbulence, decays with a temporal power-law\nexponent of -0.7. The magnetic-energy fraction can reach $epsilon_B \\sim$ 0.1\nbut depends on the initial magnetic field strength. We find that the magnetic\nenergy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic\nenergy immediately behind the shock. This minimum degree of the amplification\ndoes not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations, while the\ngrowth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of\ninhomogeneity in the density. The transition from Kolmogorov cascade to MHD\ncritical balance cascade occurs at $\\sim$ 1/10th the initial inhomogeneity\nscale, which limits the maximum synchrotron polarization to less than 2%. New\nresults include the avoidance of electron cooling with RMI turbulence, the\nturbulent photosphere model via RMI, and the shallow decay of the early\nafterglow from RMI. We also performed a simulation of freely decaying\nturbulence with relativistic velocity dispersion.

In this work we study its spectral and timing\nproperties during the 2009 outburst based on Swift and RXTE data. Our spectral\nanalysis of the source indicates only slight spectral shape evolution during\nthe entire outburst. The equivalent width of the iron line and the apparent\narea of the blackbody emission associated with the hotspot at the stellar\nsurface both decrease significantly during the outburst. This is consistent\nwith a gradual receding of the accretion disc as the accretion rate drops. The\npulse profile analysis shows absence of dramatic shape evolution with a\nmoderate decrease in pulse amplitude. This behaviour might result from a\nmovement of the accretion column footprint towards the magnetic pole as the\ndisc retreats.

The majority (7 out of\n11) of the heavily obscured AGNs have excess IR emission over that expected\nfrom star formation (termed \"IR-excess galaxies\"). However, we find that X-ray\ndetected heavily obscured AGNs only comprise ~25% of the IR-excess galaxy\npopulation, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured AGNs and\nstarburst galaxies. We find that the typical X-ray spectrum of the heavily\nobscured AGNs is better characterized by a pure reflection model than an\nabsorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme Compton-thick absorption in some\nsystems.

The stellar stream is confirmed in additional images\ntaken with the 0.5 m of the BlackBird Remote Observatory and the 0.8 m of the\nMcDonald Observatory. This low surface brightness structure around the disk of\nthe galaxy extends ~29 kpc from its center, with a projected width of 3.3 kpc.\nThe stream's morphology is consistent with that of the visible part of a\n\"great-circle\" stellar stream originating from the accretion of a ~10^8 M_sun\ndwarf satellite in the last few Gyr.

The temperature,\nderived from K-alpha line ratios of H-like and He-like Fe, agree with those\nderived from the single-temperature model. Because the line ratio is a steep\nfunction of temperature, the consistency supports the accuracy of temperature\nmeasurements conducted with Suzaku.

In this paper, we positionally associate the recent\nunambiguously short-hard Swift GRB 100206A with a disk galaxy at redshift\nz=0.4068 that is rapidly forming stars at a rate of ~30 M_sun/yr, almost an\norder of magnitude higher than any previously identified short GRB host. Using\nphotometry from Gemini, Keck, PAIRITEL, and WISE, we show that the galaxy is\nvery red (g-K = 4.3 AB mag), heavily obscured (A_V ~ 2 mag), and has the\nhighest metallicity of any GRB host to date (12 + log[O/H]_KD02 = 9.2): it is a\nclassical luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), with L_IR ~ 4 x 10^11 L_sun. While\nthese properties could be interpreted to support an association of this GRB\nwith very recent star formation, modeling of the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution also indicates that a substantial stellar mass of mostly older\nstars is present. The current specific star-formation rate is modest (specific\nSFR ~ 0.5 Gyr^-1), the current star-formation rate is not substantially\nelevated above its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign of\nrecent merger activity. Our observations are therefore equally consistent with\nan older progenitor, similar to what is inferred for other short-hard GRBs.\nGiven the precedent established by previous short GRB hosts and the significant\nfraction of the Universe's stellar mass in LIRG-like systems at z >~0.3, an\nolder progenitor represents the most likely origin of this event. \n\n"}

Such a trend requires neutron fluences larger than\nthose so far assumed, as these last would have too few neutrons per iron seed.\nWe suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in\nAGB stars of low mass (M < 1.5M\\odot), if they release neutrons from the\n^{13}C({\\alpha},n)^{16}O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of 4 than\nassumed in more massive AGBs (M > 1.5M\\odot).

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains. \n\n"}

This result relies on the assumption that the\namplitude of the optical component's measured radial velocity curve is not\nseriously affected by the interactions in the system. In this paper we explore\nthe effect on the radial velocity curve caused by surface motions excited by\ntidal interactions. We use a calculation from first principles that involves\nsolving the equations of motion of a Lagrangian grid of surface elements. The\nvelocities on the visible surface of the star are projected along the\nline-of-sight to the observer to obtain the absorption-line profile in the\nobserver's reference frame.

Models\nare run for the \"standard\" (vsini=116 km/s) and \"slow\" (56 km/s) supergiant\nrotation velocities. We find that the surface velocity field is complex and\nincludes fast, small-spatial scale structures. It leads to strong variability\nin the photospheric line profiles which, in turn, causes significant deviations\nfrom a Keplerian RV curve. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of model RV curves are\nin all cases larger than the amplitude of the orbital motion. Keplerian fits to\nRV curves obtained with the \"standard\" rotation velocity imply a neutron star\n>1.7 Mo. However, a similar analysis of the \"slow\" rotational velocity models\nallows for m_ns ~ 1.5 Mo. Thus, the stellar rotation plays an important role in\ndetermining the characteristics of the perturbed RV curve.

In systems\naccreting at well below the Eddington rate, such as the central black hole in\nthe Milky Way (Sgr A*), the rate of Coulomb collisions between particles is\nvery small, making the disk evolve essentially as a collisionless plasma. We\npresent a nonlinear study of the collisionless MRI using first-principles\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. In this initial study we focus on\nlocal two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations, deferring more realistic\nthree-dimensional simulations to future work. For simulations with net vertical\nmagnetic flux, the MRI continuously amplifies the magnetic field until the\nAlfv\\'en velocity, v_A, is comparable to the speed of light, c (independent of\nthe initial value of v_A/c). This is consistent with the lack of saturation of\nMRI channel modes in analogous axisymmetric MHD simulations. The amplification\nof the magnetic field by the MRI generates a significant pressure anisotropy in\nthe plasma (with the perpendicular pressure being larger than the parallel\npressure).

It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and\nintense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus\nmaking the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the\nenergy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor\n~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of\nthe swept-up material.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the formation mechanism of MSPs by considering the pulsar recycling\nprocess in both intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) and low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). The IMXBs mainly lead to the formation of binary MSPs with a\nmassive carbon-oxygen (CO) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD)\ncompanion, whereas the LMXBs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf\n(He WD) companion. We discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up line\nin the PPdot-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquely\ndefined. We derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass needed\nfor any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explain\nthe observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars with\ndifferent types of companions. From numerical calculations we present further\nevidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting X-ray MSPs in\nLMXBs during the Roche-lobe decoupling phase (Tauris 2012) and demonstrate that\nthe same effect is negligible in IMXBs. We examine the recycling of pulsars\nwith CO WD companions via Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) of naked helium\nstars in post common envelope binaries.

Our results show that the\nmotion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the\nfarthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities. We confirm that\nthe observed wiggling of the jet and counterjet arises from the orbital motion\nof the jet source in a binary system. Precession is of secondary importance in\nshaping the jet.

Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in\nthese cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115.

The X-ray eclipse time delays calculated with\nrespect to a constant orbital period model display a clear parabolic trend,\nconfirming that the orbital period of this source constantly increases at a\nrate of $\\dot{P}_{\\rm{orb}} =1.51(7) \\times 10^{-10}$ s/s.

This birth of a relativistic jet may have\nbeen observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs), which\nwere discovered in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet no transient radio emission has\nbeen detected from the tens of TDF candidates that were discovered at optical\nto soft X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up at radio\nfrequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by Doppler boosting,\nwhich reduces the jet flux for off-axis observers. And since the existing\nfollow-up observation are mostly within ~10 months of the discovery, the\nnon-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with respect to\nthe time of disruption. To test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets, we\nobtained 5 GHz follow-up observations with the Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs.\nTo avoid missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8 years since\nthe estimated time of disruption.

Compact objects such as\nstellar black holes on a capture orbit with a very high eccentricity have been\nwrongly assumed to be lost for the system after an intense burst of radiation,\nwhich has been described as a \"direct plunge\". We prove that these very\neccentric capture orbits spend actually a similar number of cycles in a\nLISA-like detector as those with lower eccentricities if the central MBH is\nspinning. Although the rates are higher for high-eccentricity EMRIs, the spin\nalso enhances the rates of lower-eccentricity EMRIs. This last kind have\nreceived more attention because of the fact that high-eccentricity EMRIs were\nthought to be direct plunges and thus negligible.

The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable.

Thanks to\nthe unprecedented data quality obtained by space missions, particularly CoRoT\nand Kepler, invaluable information is extracted from the high-precision stellar\noscillation frequencies, which provide very strong constraints on possible\nstellar models for a given set of classical observations.

Individual clusters with short relaxation times are candidates for the\nproduction of intermediate-mass black holes of a few hundred solar masses, via\nrunaway stellar collisions prior to the first supernovae in a cluster. It is\ntherefore possible that a cluster complex hosts multiple intermediate-mass\nblack holes that may be ejected from their individual clusters due to mergers\nor binary processes, but bound to the complex as a whole.

In the outer gap model, most pairs inside the gap\nare created around the null charge surface and the gap's electric field\nseparates the two charges to move in opposite directions. Consequently, the\nregion from the null charge surface to the light cylinder is dominated by the\noutflow current while that from the null charge surface to the star is\ndominated by the inflow current. We suggest that the viewing angle of PSR\nB1509-58 only receives the inflow radiation. The incoming curvature photons are\nconverted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the star. The X-rays and\nsoft gamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these\npairs. Magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes the\npulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the curvature\nradiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron radiation\nwith different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the light\ncurves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of the\nsecondary pairs, and that the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the\nregion near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows pair creation to\nhappen with a smaller pitch angle. \n\n"}

The\nanomalies, observed in the data of recent experiments (possible bump in the\nelectron spectrum and the PAMELA anomaly in the positron fraction) are\ndiscussed through the systematic use of simple analytical solutions of the\ntransport equations for cosmic ray electrons. Three main ways of explaining the\norigin of the anomalies are considered: the conservative way supposing the\npositrons to be pure secondary particles; the nearby sources like pulsars\norigin; and the dark matter origin. This review discusses, also, the inability\nto select the pulsars model or the dark matter model to explain the electron\nanomalies on the basis of the electron spectra with the usual large energy\nbinning ($\\gtrsim15%$). It is argued that the signature of nearby pulsars\norigin of the anomalies against the dark matter origin could be the fine\nstructure of the cosmic ray electron spectrum predicted in the Malyshev et al.\npaper (2009) and which was observed in the data from the high-resolution ATIC\nexperiment (2009-2011).

The instantaneous frequency and the\ncorresponding phase of the superorbital modulation can be obtained by a\nrecently developed time-frequency analysis technique, the Hilbert-Huang\ntransform (HHT). We present a phase-resolved analysis of both the spectra and\nthe orbital profiles with the superorbital phase derived from the HHT. The\nX-ray spectra observed by the Proportional Counter Array onboard the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer are fitted well by a blackbody plus a Comptonized\ncomponent. The plasma optical depth, which is a good indicator of the\ndistribution of material along the line of sight, is significantly\nanti-correlated with the flux detected at 2.5-25 keV. However, the relationship\nbetween the plasma optical depth and the equivalent width of the iron line is\nnot monotonic: there is no significant correlation for fluxes higher than ~35\nmCrab but clear positive correlation when the intensity is lower than ~20\nmCrab.

The width\nof the broad Balmer line is a direct indicator of the downstream plasma\ntemperature. In case of efficient particle acceleration an appreciable fraction\nof the total kinetic energy of the plasma is channeled into CRs, therefore the\ndownstream temperature decreases and so does the broad Balmer line width. This\nwidth also depends on the level of thermal equilibration between ions and\nneutral hydrogen atoms in the downstream. Since in general in young SNR shocks\nonly a few charge exchange (CE) reactions occur before ionization,\nequilibration between ions and neutrals is not reached, and a kinetic\ndescription of the neutrals is required in order to properly compute Balmer\nemission.\n  We provide a method for the calculation of Balmer emission using a\nself-consistent description of the shock structure in the presence of neutrals\nand CRs.

New high-bandwidth and\nhigh-resolution data of the RCW49 field were obtained to survey the radio\nemission at arcsec scale and investigate the small-scale features and nature of\nthe HII region.- Data were collected with the new 2-GHz bandwidth receivers and\nthe CABB correlator of the ATCA, at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz. In addition, archival\nobservations at 1.4 and 2.4 GHz have been re-reduced and re-analyzed, together\nwith optical, IR, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.- The CABB data result in\nthe most detailed radio continuum images of RCW49 to date. The radio emission\nclosely mimics the near-IR emission observed by Spitzer, showing pillars and\nfilaments. The brightest continuum emission comes from the region known as the\nbridge. The overall flattish spectral index is consistent with a free-free\nemission mechanism. However, hints of nonthermal components are also present in\nthe bridge. A jet-like structure surrounded by a bubble feature whose nature is\nstill unclear has been discovered close to the Westerlund~2 core. Two apparent\nbow shocks and a number of discrete sources have been detected as well in the\nsurroundings of RCW49.

We combine the distribution of 56Ni inferred from observations of SNe\nIa with the results of both sub-Chandrasekhar detonation models and direct\ncollision calculations to estimate what mass WDs should be exploding in each\nscenario to reproduce the observations. These WD mass distributions are then\ncompared with the observed Galactic WD mass distribution and Monte Carlo\nsimulations of WD-WD binary populations. For collisions, we find that the\naverage mass of the individual components of the WD-WD binary must be peaked at\n~0.75Msun, significantly higher than the average WD mass in binaries or in the\nfield of ~0.55-0.60Msun. Thus, if collisions produce a large fraction of SNe\nIa, then a mechanism must exist that favors large mass WDs. On the other hand,\nin an old stellar population, collisions would naturally result in a class of\nlow luminosity SNe Ia, and we suggest these may be related to 1991bg-like\nevents. For sub-Chandrasekhar detonations, we find that the average mass of the\nexploding WDs must be peaked at ~1.1Msun. This is interestingly similar to the\naverage sum of the masses in WD-WD binaries, but it is not clear (and should be\nfurther explored) whether double degenerate mergers would be sufficiently\nefficient at synthesizing 56Ni to match the observed yields. If not, then\nactual ~1.1Msun WDs would be needed for sub-Chandrasekhar detonations. Since\nsuch high mass WDs are produced relatively quickly in comparison to the age of\nthe environments where SNe Ia are found, this would require either accretion\nonto lower mass WDs prior to ignition or a long timescale between formation of\nthe ~1.1Msun WD and ignition (such as set by gravitational wave emission or\nbinary interactions). \n\n"}

The eclipse\nfraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the Roche lobe size\ninferred for the companion. The timing behavior is significantly affected by\nunmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital period\nderivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations.\nWe have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archival\nultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry.\nDoppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association with\nthe pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.5,\ncorresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 Msun and an orbital\ninclination angle range of between 30 and 41 degrees, assuming a pulsar mass\nrange of 1.4-2.0 Msun.

Denser starbursts are too overpressured for hot wind formation, but\nsupernovae still stir up the ISM.

Supernovae can drive turbulence with speeds\nof ~1000 km/s in the hot wind and ~20 km/s in the cold molecular gas, depending\non the outer scale.

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions.

Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism. \n\n"}

These SN explosions are likely to be preceded by strong\ninteraction of the WD with the giant secondary's core, leading to an\nIntermediate-Luminosity Optical Transient (ILOT; Red Transient; Red Nova)\nevent, weeks to years before the explosion. The common envelope phase of the WD\nand the giant ends with a merger that forms an ILOT, or an envelope ejection\nthat leads, after a CCSN of the giant's core, to a NS-NS or WD-NS surviving\nbinary. The WD could suffer a thermonuclear explosion, that might be observed\nas a Type Ia SN. Most of these CCSN and thermonuclear explosions will be\npeculiar.

These\nswing provided the strongest confirmation of the pulsar recycling scenario\navailable so far. During the two XMM-Newton observations that were carried out\nwhile the source was in outburst in April 2013, IGR J18245-2452 displayed a\nunique and peculiar variability of its X-ray emission. In this work, we report\non a detailed analysis of the XMM- Newton data and focus in particular on the\ntiming and spectral variability of the source. IGR J18245-2452 continuously\nswitches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in\nflux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These\nvariations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic\nspectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source\nchanges from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different\ncount rates and energies show a complex variability. These phenomena are not\nusually observed in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, at least not on such a\nshort time scale. Fast variability was also found in the ATCA radio\nobservations carried out for about 6 hours during the outburst at a frequency\nof 5.5 and 9 GHz. We interpret the variability observed from IGR J18245-2452 in\nterms of a \"hiccup\" accretion phase, during which the accretion of material\nfrom the inner boundary of the Keplerian disk is reduced by the onset of\ncentrifugal inhibition of accretion, possibly causing the launch of strong\noutflows.

Abstract: X-ray surveys have revealed a new class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with\na very low observed fraction of scattered soft X-rays, f_scat < 0.5%. Based on\nX-ray modeling these \"X-ray new-type\", or low observed X-ray scattering\n(hereafter:\"low-scattering\") sources have been interpreted as deeply-buried AGN\nwith a high covering factor of gas. In this paper we address the questions\nwhether the host galaxies of low-scattering AGN may contribute to the observed\nX-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high covering\nfactors from the infrared (IR) emission. We find that X-ray low-scattering AGN\nare preferentially hosted by highly-inclined galaxies or merger systems as\ncompared to other Seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that the\nline-of-sight toward the AGN intersects with high columns of host-galactic gas\nand dust. Moreover, while a detailed analysis of the IR emission of\nlow-scattering AGN ESO 103-G35 remains inconclusive, we do not find any\nindication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample of\nlow-scattering AGN based on their IR emission. For ESO 103-G35, we constrained\nthe temperature, mass and location of the IR emitting dust which is consistent\nwith expectations for the dusty torus. However, a deep silicate absorption\nfeature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorber\non larger scales within the host galaxy. Taking these findings together, we\npropose that the low f_scat observed in low-scattering AGN is not necessarily\nthe result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference of\nhost-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 10^22 cm^-2 with the\nline-of-sight. We discuss implications of this hypothesis for X-ray models,\nhigh-ionization emission lines, and observed star-formation activity in these\nobjects. \n\n"}

Abstract: The detectors of the UltraViolet Spectrographs (UVS) on Voyager 1/2 are\nrecording a background that was earlier assigned to disintegrations in the RTG.\nWe show that it arises instead from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). We show the\n1992-2013 GCR flux measured by UVS on V1 and, by comparing with data from the\nGCR dedicated detectors, we estimate the energy range responsible for this UVS\nsignal, around 300 MeV, and the response of UVS to the GCR anisotropy. After\nthe abrupt jumps of May and August 2012 the count rate has been fluctuating\nonly slightly around a constant value, but comparing with data from the LECP\nand the CRS instruments shows that those small variations are only responses to\na varying anisotropy and not to a flux change. Taking advantage of the\nsimilarity in energy range to one of the products of the CRS instrument suite,\nwe use the ratio between the two independent signals as a proxy for the\ntemporal evolution of the GCR spectral slope around the 300 MeV range. We show\nthat this slope has remained unchanged since Aug 2012 and find strong evidence\nthat it will no longer vary, implying the end of the modulation at those\nenergies and that V1 at this date is near or past the heliopause. The origin of\nthis narrow and stagnating inner heliosheath is still unclear, and we discuss\nthe potential effects of low solar wind speed episodes and subsequent\nself-amplified charge-exchange with interstellar neutrals, as a source of\ndeceleration and collapse. We suggest that the quasi-static region encountered\nby V1 may be related to such effects, triggered by the strong post\nsolar-maximum variability. This did not happen for V2 due to its trajectory at\nan angle further from the heliosphere axis and a later termination shock\ncrossing. The existence on the upwind side of a mixing layer formed by charge\ntransfer instead of a pure plasma contact discontinuity could explain various\nobservations. \n\n"}

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to be excellent laboratories for determining\nthe equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests\nthat they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius\n(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs\ncannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A\nmeasurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The\nassumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general\nrelativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We\ncalculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the\nfull contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not\nprobed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere\nof radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders\nof magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is\nbeyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of\nmagnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of\nmagnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our\nresults suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from\nthe regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger\nignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains\ngravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon\nscattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity\nmodels either. Near the surface the curvature and compactness attain their\nlargest values, while EoS in this region is fairly well known. This renders the\ncrust as the best site to look for deviations from GR. \n\n"}

A search for (active) SMBH\nbinaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of the merger remnants is currently ongoing.\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is to identify the inactive SMBHBs, which might\nbe the most abundant, but are also the most difficult to identify. Liu et al.\npredicted characteristic drops in the light curves of tidal disruption events\n(TDEs), caused by the presence of a secondary SMBH. Here, we apply that model\nto the light curve of the optically inactive galaxy SDSS J120136.02+300305.5,\nwhich was identified as a candidate TDE with XMM-Newton. We show that the deep\ndips in its evolving X-ray light curve can be well explained by the presence of\na SMBHB at its core. A SMBHB model with a mass of the primary of M_BH = 10^7\nM_sun, a mass ratio q=0.08, and a semimajor axis a_b = 0.6 mpc is in good\nagreement with the observations. Given that primary mass, introducing an\norbital eccentricity is needed, with e_b = 0.3. Alternatively, a lower mass\nprimary of M_BH = 10^6 M_sun in a circular orbit fits the light curve well.\nTight binaries like this one, which have already overcome the \"final parsec\nproblem,\" are prime sources of gravitational wave radiation once the two SMBHs\ncoalesce. Future transient surveys, which will detect TDEs in large numbers,\nwill place tight constraints on the SMBHB fraction in otherwise non-active\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

The\nskeleton highlights the separatrix surfaces that divide the field into\ntopologically distinct regions, allowing open-field regions on the solar\nsurface to be located. Furthermore, separatrix surfaces and their intersections\n(separators) are important likely energy release sites. This paper\ninvestigates, throughout the solar cycle, the nature of coronal magnetic-field\ntopologies that arise under the potential-field source-surface approximation.\nIn particular, we characterise the typical global fields at solar maximum and\nminimum. Global magnetic fields are extrapolated from observed Kitt Peak and\nSOLIS synoptic magnetograms, from Carrington rotations 1645 to 2144, using the\npotential-field source-surface model. Hence, variations in the coronal skeleton\nare studied over three solar cycles.

These three indicators generally agree in\nvelocity and direction, and are consistent with a simple picture in which the\ngas is stationary or slowly outflowing at a few hundred km/s from the embedded\ngalaxies. The absence of stronger outflows is not a projection effect: the\ncovering fraction for our sample is limited to <1/8 (13%). The outflow\nvelocities exclude models in which star formation or AGN produce \"super\" or\n\"hyper\" winds of up to ~1000km/s. The Dv_Lya offsets here are smaller than\ntypical of LBGs, but similar to those of compact LAEs. The latter suggests that\noutflow speed cannot be a dominant factor in driving extended Lya emission. For\none Lya blob (CDFS-LAB14), whose Lya profile and metal absorption line offsets\nsuggest no significant bulk motion, we use a simple radiative transfer model to\nmake the first column density measurement of gas in an embedded galaxy, finding\nit consistent with a DLA system. Overall, the absence of clear inflow\nsignatures suggests that the channeling of gravitational cooling radiation into\nLya is not significant over the radii probed here. However, one peculiar system\n(CDFS-LAB10) has a blueshifted Lya component that is not obviously associated\nwith any galaxy, suggesting either displaced gas arising from tidal\ninteractions among blob galaxies or gas flowing into the blob center.

Among these observations is the weak\ngravitational lensing of galaxies, e.g., cosmic shear that measures the minute\ndistortions of background galaxy images by intervening cosmic structure. Weak\nlensing and cosmic shear promise to be a powerful probe of astrophysics and\ncosmology, constraining models of dark energy, measuring the evolution of\nstructure in the universe, and testing theories of gravity on cosmic scales.\nHowever, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies -- their shape and orientation\nbefore being lensed -- may pose a great challenge to the use of weak\ngravitational lensing as an accurate cosmological probe, and has been\nidentified as one of the primary physical systematic biases in cosmic shear\nstudies.

The dust temperature\nvariations are caused by rotation of hot and dense material of the spiral shock\nwave in the disk central gap. The aim of this work is to show how different can\nbe the Class II methanol maser brightness in the disk during the Moment of\nMaximum Illumination by the Spiral Shock material (hereafter MMISS) and the\nMoment when the disk is Illuminated by the Stars Only (MISO). We used the code\nCLOUDY (v13.02) to estimate physical conditions in the flat disk in the MISO\nand the MMISS.

In the intermediate regime,\nkinematically inferred masses experience an additional radial dependence with\nrespect to the underlying distribution of matter, which is caused by the\nincrement of gravitational forces with increasing distance from the Milky Way\ncenter. The same effect can influence the internal kinematics of subhalos and\ncause cuspy matter distributions to appear core-like. Specializing to the\nchameleon model as a worked example, we demonstrate this effect by tracing the\nscalar field from the outskirts of the Milky Way halo to its interior,\nsimultaneously fitting observed velocity dispersions of chemo-dynamically\ndiscriminated red giant populations in the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf\nspheroidals. Whereas in standard gravity these observations suggest that the\nmatter distribution of the dwarfs is cored, we find that in the presence of a\nchameleon field the assumption of a cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White profile becomes\nperfectly compatible with the data. Importantly, chameleon models also predict\nthe existence of slopes between two stellar subcomponents that in Newtonian\ngravity would be interpreted as a depletion of matter in the dwarf center.\nHence, an observation of such an apparently pathological scenario may serve as\na smoking gun for the presence of a chameleon field or a similar modification\nof gravity, independent of baryonic feedback effects. In general, measuring the\ndynamic mass profiles of the Milky Way dwarfs provides stronger constraints\nthan those inferred from the screening scale of the Solar System since these\nare located at greater distances from the halo center. \n\n"}

The resulting abundances are very\nsimilar to each other and reproduce the general features of the observed\nr-process abundance (the second and third peaks, the rare-earth peak and the\nlead peak) for all mass models as they are mainly determined by the fission\nyields. We find distinct differences in the abundance yields at and just above\nthe third peak, which can be traced back to different predictions of neutron\nseparation energies for r-process nuclei around neutron number $N=130$. The\nremaining trajectories, which contribute 10% by mass to the total integrated\nabundances, follow such a fast expansion that the r process does not use all\nthe neutrons.

We report\non a survey for X-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2)\nclusters of galaxies selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the\nSouth Pole Telescope data.

At least some optical emission is produced in all disk wind models,\nwhich should enhance the detectability of electromagnetic counterparts to\ngravitational wave sources. However, the presence of even a small amount\n(10^{-4} Msun) of overlying, neutron-rich dynamical ejecta will act as a\n\"lanthanide-curtain\", obscuring the optical wind emission from certain viewing\nangles. Because the disk outflows have moderate velocities (~10,000 km/s),\nnumerous resolved line features are discernible in the spectra, distinguishing\ndisk winds from fast-moving dynamical ejecta, and offering a potential\ndiagnostic of the detailed composition of freshly produced r-process material. \n\n"}

A popular observable is the angular\npower spectrum; we present a detailed study applicable to any unbinned source\nskymap S(n) from which N random, independent events are observed. Its exact\nvariance, which is due to the finite statistics, depends only on S(n) and N; we\nalso derive an unbiased estimator of the variance from the data. First-order\neffects agree with previous analytic estimates. Importantly, heretofore\nunidentified higher-order effects are found to contribute to the variance and\nmay cause the uncertainty to be significantly larger than previous analytic\nestimates---potentially orders of magnitude larger. Neglect of these\nhigher-order terms, when significant, may result in a spurious detection of the\npower spectrum. On the other hand, this would indicate the presence of\nhigher-order spatial correlations, such as a large bispectrum, providing new\nclues about the sources.

In this paper, we continue our study by investigating the\ndetailed properties of wind, such as mass flux and poloidal speed, and the\nmechanism of wind production. For this aim, we make use of a three dimensional\nGRMHD simulation of hot accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. The\nsimulation is designed so that the magnetic flux is not accumulated\nsignificantly around the black hole. To distinguish real wind from turbulent\noutflows, we track the trajectories of the virtual Largrangian particles from\nsimulation data. We find two types of real outflows, i.e., a quasi-relativistic\njet close to the axis and a sub-relativistic wind subtending a much larger\nsolid angle. Most of the wind originates from the surface layer of the\naccretion flow. The poloidal wind speed almost remains constant once they are\nproduced, but the flux-weighted wind speed roughly follows $v_{\\rm p,\nwind}(r)\\approx 0.25 v_k(r)$. The mass flux of jet is much lower but the speed\nis much higher, $v_{\\rm p,jet}\\sim (0.3-0.4) c$. Consequently, both the energy\nand momentum fluxes of the wind are much larger than those of the jet. We find\nthat the wind is produced and accelerated primarily by the combination of\ncentrifugal force and magnetic pressure gradient, while the jet is mainly\naccelerated by magnetic pressure gradient. Finally, we find that the wind\nproduction efficiency $\\epsilon_{\\rm wind}\\equiv\\dot{E}_{\\rm wind}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nBH}c^2\\sim 1/1000$, in good agreement with the value required from large-scale\ngalaxy simulations with AGN feedback. \n\n"}

Red timing noise - the stochastic wandering of\npulse arrival times with a red spectrum - is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars\nand has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by\ncalculating minimum observation times, $T_{\\rm min}(f_c)$, over which the\ngravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau.

This misalignment is reduced\nto 25-30 degrees in the most massive haloes ($13 < log_{10}(M_{200}/\n[h^{-1}M_\\odot ]) < 15$). Half of the disc galaxies in the EAGLE simulations\nhave a misalignment angle with respect to their host haloes larger than 40\ndegrees. We present fitting functions and tabulated values for the probability\ndistribution of galaxy-halo misalignment to enable a straightforward inclusion\nof our results into models of galaxy formations based on purely collisionless\nN-body simulations. \n\n"}

The broad emission lines in the optical and UV bands and steep\nradio spectrum indicate a possible classification as an intermediate object\nbetween broad-line radio galaxies (BLRG) and steep spectrum radio quasars\n(SSRQ).

This component, often associated with the GRB\njet's photosphere, is usually subdominant compared to a much stronger\nnon-thermal one. The prompt emission of Fermi GRB 131014A provides a unique\nopportunity to study this thermal-like component. Indeed, the thermal emission\nin GRB 131014A is much more intense than in other GRBs and a pure thermal\nepisode is observed during the initial 0.16 s. The thermal-like component cools\nmonotonically during the first second while the non-thermal emission kicks off.\nThe intensity of the non-thermal component progressively increases until being\nenergetically dominant at late time. This is a perfect scenario to disentangle\nthe thermal component from the non-thermal one. A low-energy spectral index of\n+0.6 better fit the thermal component than the typical index value +1\ncorresponding to a pure Planck function. The non-thermal component is\nadequately fitted with a Band function whose low and high energy power law\nindices are ~-0.7 and <~-3, respectively; this is also statistically equivalent\nto a cutoff power law with a ~-0.7 index. This is in agreement with our\nprevious results. Finally, a strong correlation is observed between the\ntime-resolved luminosity of the non-thermal component, L$_i^{nTh}$, and its\ncorresponding rest frame spectral peak energy, E$_{peak,i}^{rest,nTh}$, with a\nslope similar to the one reported in our previous articles. Assuming this\nrelation to be universal for all GRBs we estimate a redshift of ~1.55 for GRB\n131014A that is a typical value for long GRBs. These observational results are\nconsistent with the models in which the non-thermal emission is produced well\nabove the GRB jet photosphere but they may also be compatible with other\nscenarios (e.g., dissipative photosphere) that are not discussed in this\narticle. \n\n"}

The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars.

The light curves are variable and\nsignificantly correlated between wavebands. Using cross-correlation analysis,\nwe compute the time lag between the X-ray and lower energy bands. These lags\nare thought to be associated with the light travel time between the central\nX-ray emitting region and areas further out on the accretion disc. The computed\nlags support a thermal reprocessing scenario in which X-ray photons heat the\ndisc and are reprocessed into lower energy photons. Additionally, we fit the\nlightcurves using CREAM, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code for a standard disc.\nThe best-fitting standard disc model yields unreasonably high super-Eddington\naccretion rates. Assuming more reasonable accretion rates would result in\nsignificantly under-predicted lags. If the majority of the reprocessing\noriginates in the disc, then this implies the UV/optical emitting regions of\nthe accretion disc are farther out than predicted by the standard thin disc\nmodel. Accounting for contributions from broad emission lines reduces the lags\nin B and V by approximately 25% (less than the uncertainty in the lag\nmeasurements), though additional contamination from the Balmer continuum may\nalso contribute to the larger than expected lags. This discrepancy between the\npredicted and measured interband delays is now becoming common in AGN where\nwavelength-dependent lags are measured. \n\n"}

In this paper we use Monte Carlo models of dense star\nclusters to identify all triple systems formed dynamically and we compute their\nevolution using a highly accurate three-body integrator which incorporates\nrelativistic and tidal effects. We find that a large fraction of these triples\nevolve through a non-secular dynamical phase which can drive the inner binary\nto higher eccentricities than predicted by the standard secular perturbation\ntheory (even including octupole-order terms). We place constraints on the\nimportance of Lidov-Kozai-induced mergers for producing: (i) gravitational wave\nsources detectable by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), for triples with an inner pair of\nstellar black holes; and (ii) blue straggler stars, for triples with\nmain-sequence-star components.

The origin of\nthe thermal component and the relation between ULSs and standard (broad-band\nspectrum) ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are still controversial. We\nre-examined the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the M101 ULS using\narchival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations.

We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays injected by supernovae,\nand specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of\ncosmic rays along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects\ncan have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors\ndepending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the cosmic ray streaming\ninstability, cosmic rays propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on\nself-excited Alfven waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to\nthe streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as the\nturbulent damping, the cosmic ray coupling to the gas is weaker and their\neffective propagation speed faster than the Alfven speed. Alternatively, cosmic\nrays could scatter from \"extrinsic turbulence\" that is driven by another\nmechanism.

X-ray and optical spectroscopy Abstract: The long-period, highly eccentric O-star binary 9 Sgr, known for its\nnon-thermal radio emission and its relatively bright X-ray emission, went\nthrough its periastron in 2013. Such an event can be used to observationally\ntest the predictions of the theory of colliding stellar winds over a broad\nrange of wavelengths. We have conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign\nof 9 Sgr around the 2013 periastron. In this paper, we focus on X-ray\nobservations and optical spectroscopy. The optical spectra allow us to revisit\nthe orbital solution of 9 Sgr and to refine its orbital period to 9.1 years.\nThe X-ray flux is maximum at periastron over all energy bands, but with clear\ndifferences as a function of energy. The largest variations are observed at\nenergies above 2 keV, whilst the spectrum in the soft band (0.5 - 1.0 keV)\nremains mostly unchanged indicating that it arises far from the collision\nregion, in the inner winds of the individual components. The level of the hard\nemission at periastron clearly deviates from the 1/r relation expected for an\nadiabatic wind interaction zone, whilst this relation seems to hold at the\nother phases covered by our observations. The spectra taken at phase 0.946\nreveal a clear Fe xxv line at 6.7 keV, but no such line is detected at\nperiastron (phi = 0.000) although a simple model predicts a strong line that\nshould be easily visible in the data. The peculiarities of the X-ray spectrum\nof 9 Sgr could reflect the impact of radiative inhibition as well as a\nphase-dependent efficiency of particle acceleration on the shock properties. \n\n"}

While progresses have been made in understanding\ntheir formation and growth, their observational signatures remain largely\nunexplored. As a result, no detection of such sources has been confirmed so\nfar. Supported by numerical simulations, we present a novel photometric method\nto identify black hole seed candidates in deep multi-wavelength surveys.

A distinguishing characteristic between the two scenarios is that\ndark matter particles can produce a gravitational effect, in principle, without\nthe need of baryons while this is not the case for the modified gravity\nscenario where such an effect must be correlated with the amount of baryonic\nmatter.

The\nsmallest, unresolved scales and the interactions between small and large scales\nare introduced by means of a subgrid-scale (SGS) model. We propose and verify a\nnew set of nonlinear SGS closures for future application as an SGS model in LES\nof compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We use 15 simulations (without\nexplicit SGS model) of forced, isotropic, homogeneous turbulence with varying\nsonic Mach number $\\mathrm{M_s} = 0.2$ to $20$ as reference data for the most\nextensive \\textit{a priori} tests performed so far in literature. In these\ntests we explicitly filter the reference data and compare the performance of\nthe new closures against the most widely tested closures. These include\neddy-viscosity and scale-similarity type closures with different\nnormalizations. Performance indicators are correlations with the turbulent\nenergy and cross-helicty flux, the average SGS dissipation, the topological\nstructure and the ability to reproduce the correct magnitude and direction of\nthe SGS vectors. We find that only the new nonlinear closures exhibit\nconsistently high correlations (median value \\textgreater$0.8$) with the data\nover the entire parameter space and outperform the other closures in all tests.\nMoreover, we show that these results are independent of resolution and chosen\nfilter scale.

While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated. In\nthis paper, we study four recently-constructed \"unified\" NS EoSs, as well as\nthree developed strange quark star (QS) EoSs within the new confinement\ndensity-dependent mass model. All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent\nobservational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely\nmeasured. We construct sequences of rigidly rotating NS/QS configurations with\nincreasing spinning frequency $f$, from non-rotating ($f = 0$) to the Keplerian\nfrequency ($f = f_{\\rm K}$), and provide convenient analytical parametrizations\nof the results.

Since the\nR index varies slightly with the Teff for values larger than 40 kK, the R index\ncan be used to derive the Teff in 30-40 kK range. A large fraction of the\nionization parameter variation is due to differences in the temperature of the\nionizing stars and then the use of the (relatively) low Teff dependent S2=[S\nII](6717+31)/Ha emission-line ratio to derive the ionization parameter is\npreferable over others in the literature.

Two scenarios have been\nsuggested for both phenomena: one of them involves rapid rotation and\nquasi-chemical homogeneous evolution (CHE), the other invokes classical\nevolution through mass loss in single and binary systems. WR spin rates might\nenable us to test these two scenarios. In order to obtain empirical constraints\non black hole progenitor spin, we infer wind asymmetries in all 12 known WR\nstars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at Z = 1/5 Zsun, as well as within a\nsignificantly enlarged sample of single and binary WR stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC at Z = 1/2 Zsun), tripling the sample of Vink (2007).\nThis brings the total LMC sample to 39, making it appropriate for comparison to\nthe Galactic sample. We measure WR wind asymmetries with VLT-FORS linear\nspectropolarimetry.

Over millions of years, the binary evolves to a\nperiod minimum before reversing course and migrating outwards. Because the time\ninterval between consecutive EMRIs is comparable to the mass-transfer\ntimescale, the semi-major axes of two consecutive mass-transferring EMRIs will\ncross on a radial scale < few AU. We show that such EMRI crossing events are\ninevitably accompanied by a series of mildly relativistic, grazing physical\ncollisions between the stars. Each collision strips a small quantity of mass,\nprimarily from the more massive star, which generally increases their radial\nseparation to set up the next collision after a delay of decades to centuries\n(or longer) set by further gravitational radiation. Depending on the mass of\nthe SMBH, this interaction can result in N ~ 1-1e4 gas production events of\nmass Msun/N, thus powering a quasi-periodic sequence of SMBH accretion-powered\nflares over a total duration of thousands of years or longer.

The importance of this radial\nmigration in shaping galactic light distributions is still unclear.

Aims:\nWe investigate the role of radial migration on the light distribution and the\nradial stellar content by comparing the inner colour, age and metallicity\ngradients for galaxies with different SB profiles. We define these inner parts\navoiding the bulge and bar regions and up to around three disc scale-lengths\n(type I, pure exponential) or the break radius (type II, downbending; type III,\nupbending).

The model is used to explain the\nnear- to mid-infrared (NIR-MIR) excess found in such clusters and usually\nmodeled as a blackbody with temperature $\\sim (400-1000)$ K. In our approach,\ndust grains are efficiently produced in the clumpy ejecta of core-collapse\nsupernovae, fragmented into small pieces ($\\lesssim 0.05$ $\\mu$m) as they are\nincorporated into the hot and dense ISM, heated via frequent collisions with\nelectrons and the absorption of energetic photons. Grains with small sizes can\nmore easily acquire the high temperatures ($\\sim 1000$ K) required to produce a\nNIR-MIR excess with respect to the emission of foreground PAHs and starlight.\nHowever, the extreme conditions inside young massive clusters make difficult\nfor these small grains to have a persistent manifestation at NIR-MIR\nwavelengths as they are destroyed by efficient thermal sputtering.\nNevertheless, the chances for a persistent manifestation are increased by\ntaking into account that small grains become increasingly transparent to their\nimpinging ions as their size decreases.

Using kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\nexplore the impact of three-dimensional reconnection dynamics on the efficiency\nof particle acceleration. In two-dimensional systems, Alfv\\'enic outflows expel\nenergetic electrons into flux ropes where they become trapped and disconnected\nfrom acceleration regions. However, in three-dimensional systems these flux\nropes develop axial structure that enables particles to leak out and return to\nacceleration regions. This requires a finite guide field so that particles may\nmove quickly along the flux rope axis. We show that greatest energetic electron\nproduction occurs when the guide field is of the same order as the reconnecting\ncomponent: large enough to facilitate strong transport, but not so large as to\nthrottle the dominant Fermi mechanism responsible for efficient electron\nacceleration. This suggests a natural explanation for the envelope of electron\nacceleration during the impulsive phase of eruptive flares. \n\n"}

Since its discovery in 2013, it\nhas experienced two outbursts, the second of which started in November 2014 and\nlasted until February 2017. We use high- and low-resolution spectroscopy and\ntime-resolved photometry from the ASAS-SN survey, the LCOGT and the Beacon\nObservatory to study the lightcurve and the dynamical and physical properties\nof the accretion flow. The 2014-2017 outburst lasted for nearly 800 days. A\n4.15d period in the lightcurve likely corresponds to rotational modulation of a\nstar with hot spot(s). The spectra show multiple emission lines with variable\ninverse P-Cygni profiles and a highly variable blueshifted absorption below the\ncontinuum. Line ratios from metallic emission lines (Fe I/Fe II, Ti I/Ti II)\nsuggest temperatures of $\\sim$5800-6000 K in the accretion flow.\nPhotometrically and spectroscopically, the 2014-2017 event displays an\nintermediate behavior between EXors and FUors. The accretion rate\n(\\.{M}=1-3$\\times$10$^{-7}$M$_\\odot$/yr), about 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan the accretion rate in quiescence, is not significantly different from the\naccretion rate observed in 2013.

The properties\nof ASASSN-13db suggest that temperatures lower than those for solar-type stars\nare needed for modeling accretion in very low-mass systems. Finally, the\nrotational modulation during the outburst reveals that accretion-related\nstructures settled after the begining of the outburst and can be relatively\nstable and long-lived.

Modeling a line-driven\nstellar wind from the companion by two-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations,\nwe investigate the processes of wind capture by and accretion onto the black\nhole. We assume that the wind acceleration is terminated at the He II\nionization front because ions responsible for line-driven acceleration are\nionized within the front, i.e. He III region. It is found that the mass\naccretion rate inferred from the luminosity is remarkably smaller than the\ncapture rate. Considering the difference, we construct a model for the state\ntransition based on the accretion flow being controlled by magneto-rotational\ninstability. The outer flow is torus like, and plays an important role to\ntrigger the transition. The model can explain why state transition does occur\nin Cyg X-1, while not in LMC X-1. Cyg X-1 exhibits a relatively low luminosity,\nand then the He II ionization front is located and can move between the\ncompanion and black hole, depending on its ionizing photon flux. On the other\nhand, LMC X-1 exhibits too high luminosity for the front to move considerably;\nthe front is too close to the companion atmosphere. The model also predicts\nthat each state of high-soft or low-hard would last fairly long because the\nluminosity depends weakly on the wind velocity.

In addition, the white dwarf was\nobserved with the Chandra X-ray Observatory for 10-ksec on each of four\ndifferent occasions, separated by about a month each. The upper limit on the\naverage X-ray flux from WD 1145+017 is ~5 x 10^{-15} ergs/cm^2/s (unabsorbed\nover the range 0.1-100 keV), which translates to an upper limit on the X-ray\nluminosity, Lx, of ~2 x 10^{28} ergs/s.

In order\nthat deviations from commensurability become significant only on $Gy$ time\nscales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the\nplanets has to be such that $Q' > \\sim 10^{2-3}.$ At the same time, if we start\nwith two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one,\n$Q'$ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly\nexceeding) $10^{2-3}$ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the\nobserved configuration. This scenario is also supported by modelling of the\nevolution through disk migration which indicates that the whole system cannot\nhave migrated inwards together. Also in order to avoid large departures from\ncommensurabilities, the system cannot have stalled at a disk inner edge for\nsignificant time periods. We discuss the habitability consequences of the tidal\ndissipation implied by our modelling, concluding that planets d, e and f are\npotentially in habitable zones. \n\n"}

However, the number\nof illuminating events as well as their ages and durations are still unresolved\nquestions. We aim to reconstruct parts of the history of Sgr A* by studying\nthis reflection phenomenon in the molecular complex Sgr C and by determining\nthe line-of-sight positions of its main bright substructures. Using\nobservations made with XMM-Newton and Chandra between 2000 and 2014, we\ninvestigated the variability of the reflected emission. We carried out an\nimaging and a spectral analysis. We also used a Monte Carlo model of the\nreflected spectra to constrain the line-of-sight positions of the brightest\nclumps, and hence to assign an approximate date to the associated illuminating\nevents. We show that the emission from Sgr C exhibits significant variability\nin both space and time, which confirms its reflection origin. The most likely\nilluminating source is Sgr A*. We report two distinct variability timescales,\nas one clump undergoes a sudden rise and fall in about 2005, while two others\nvary smoothly throughout the whole 2000-2014 period.

These two independent approaches provide a consistent picture of\nthe past activity of Sgr A*, since the two slowly varying clumps are located on\nthe same wavefront, while the rapidly varying clump corresponds to a different\nwavefront, that is, to a different illuminating event.

Structure of the Inner Disk as Implied\n  by the MRI Abstract: The large population of Earth to super-Earth sized planets found very close\nto their host stars has motivated consideration of $in$ $situ$ formation\nmodels. In particular, Inside-Out Planet Formation is a scenario in which\nplanets coalesce sequentially in the disk, at the local gas pressure maximum\nnear the inner boundary of the dead zone. The pressure maximum arises from a\ndecline in viscosity, going from the active innermost disk (where thermal\nionization of alkalis yields high viscosities via the magneto-rotational\ninstability (MRI)) to the adjacent dead zone (where the MRI is quenched).\nPrevious studies of the pressure maximum, based on $\\alpha$-disk models, have\nassumed ad hoc values for the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ in the active zone,\nignoring the detailed physics of the MRI. Here we explicitly couple the MRI\ncriteria to the $\\alpha$-disk equations, to find steady-state (constant\naccretion rate) solutions for the disk structure. We consider the effects of\nboth Ohmic and ambipolar resistivities, and find solutions for a range of disk\naccretion rates ($\\dot{M}$ = $10^{-10}$ - $10^{-8}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$/yr),\nstellar masses ($M_{\\ast}$ = 0.1 - 1 ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), and fiducial values of\nthe $non$-MRI $\\alpha$-viscosity in the dead zone ($\\alpha_{\\rm {DZ}} =\n10^{-5}$ - $10^{-3}$).

Yet\nthe physical nature of these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein\nsuggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses,\nwhich drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting\nstructures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the\nreasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By\nreconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests\nthat both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The\nmodel is a modified $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that\ncontinuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and\ncan flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic\nuniverse with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing\ncompatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological\nmeasurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative\nmass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms\nhaloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are\nnot cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the\nobserved distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles.

The galaxy model in MOG has the\nsame initial conditions as in galaxy models with dark matter halo.

We show that the evolution and growth of the\nbar in MOG is substantially different from the standard cases including dark\nmatter halo.

It is shown that although the live\ndark matter halo may support the bar instability, MOG has stabilizing effects.\nFurthermore, we show that MOG supports fast pattern speeds, and unlike in the\ndark matter halo models pattern speed does not decrease with time.

Abstract: The latest observations of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) appear to indicate, prima facie, a\ntransition to heavy primaries at the highest energies. However, this\ninterpretation, which is based on extrapolations of the Standard Model (SM) to\nultra-LHC energies, is strained from both astrophysical and particle\nphenomenology perspectives. We consider the alternative that after some energy\nthreshold, the first collision of the primary in the atmosphere results in a\nstate, the decay of which leads to a considerably increased shower particle\nmultiplicity, so that light-primary EAS appear heavy-like. We show that a\nminimal implementation of such a model yields predictions for the average EAS\ndepth and shower-to-shower fluctuations that are consistent with each other,\nand an excellent fit to Auger data. If such an effect indeed takes place, we\npredict that: (a) the center-of-momentum (CM) energy threshold for the effect\nis of order 50 TeV; (b) the probability with which the effect occurs is high,\nand it will be detected easily by next-generation accelerators; (c) the\nincrease in multiplicity compared to the SM prediction grows with CM energy\nroughly as $\\sim E_{\\rm CM}$; (d) the cosmic-ray composition at the highest\nenergies is light.

In our framework, the variability features observed in\ndifferent AGN at different timescales may be explained as realisations of the\nsame underlying statistical properties. In this context, we propose a model to\nsimulate the evolution of AGN light curves with time based on the probability\ndensity function (PDF) and power spectral density (PSD) of the Eddington ratio\n($L/L_{\\rm Edd}$) distribution.

The approaching stars from the star cluster to the\nblack hole can take three types of orbit: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic\norbits. Since the mass fallback rate shows a different variability depending on\nthese orbital types, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three\nmain categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs. Respective TDEs are\ncharacterized by two critical values of the orbital eccentricity: the lower\ncritical eccentricity is the one below which the stars on eccentric orbits\ncause the finite, intense accretion, and the higher critical eccentricity above\nwhich the stars on hyperbolic orbits cause no accretion. Moreover, we find that\nthe parabolic TDEs are divided into three subclasses: precisely parabolic,\nmarginally eccentric, and marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We analytically derive\nthat the mass fallback rate of the marginally eccentric TDEs can be flatter and\nslightly higher than the standard fallback rate proportional to $t^{-5/3}$,\nwhereas it can be flatter and lower for the marginally hyperbolic TDEs. We\nconfirm by N-body experiments that only few eccentric, precisely parabolic, and\nhyperbolic TDEs can occur in a spherical stellar system with a single\nintermediate-mass to supermassive black hole.

Galaxy-galaxy strong\ngravitational lensing provides a unique opportunity to probe the sub-galactic\nmass structure in lens galaxies beyond the Local Group. Here, we demonstrate\nthe first application of a novel methodology to observationally constrain the\nsub-galactic matter power spectrum in the inner regions of massive elliptical\nlens galaxies on 1-10 kpc scales from the power spectrum of surface-brightness\nanomalies in highly magnified galaxy-scale Einstein rings and gravitational\narcs. The pilot application of our approach to Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST/WFC3/F390W) observations of the SLACS lens system SDSS J0252+0039 allows\nus to place the following observational constraints (at the 99 per cent\nconfidence level) on the dimensionless convergence power spectrum\n$\\Delta^{2}_{\\delta\\kappa}$ and the standard deviation in the aperture mass\n$\\sigma_{\\rm AM}$: $\\Delta^{2}_{\\delta\\kappa}<1$ ($\\sigma_{\\rm AM}< 0.8 \\times\n10^8 M_\\odot$) on 0.5-kpc scale, $\\Delta^{2}_{\\delta\\kappa}<0.1$ ($\\sigma_{\\rm\nAM}< 1 \\times 10^8 M_\\odot$) on 1-kpc scale and\n$\\Delta^{2}_{\\delta\\kappa}<0.01$ ($\\sigma_{\\rm AM}< 3 \\times 10^8 M_\\odot$) on\n3-kpc scale. These first upper-limit constraints still considerably exceed the\nestimated effect of CDM subhaloes. However, future analysis of a larger sample\nof galaxy-galaxy strong lens systems can substantially narrow down these limits\nand possibly rule out dark-matter models that predict a significantly higher\nlevel of density fluctuations on the critical sub-galactic scales. \n\n"}

During\nand after these flares the surrounding gas is out of chemical and thermal\nequilibrium. We introduce a new implementation of X-ray radiative transfer\ncoupled to a time-dependent chemical network for use in 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations. A static fractal molecular cloud is\nirradiated with X-rays of different intensity, and the chemical and thermal\nevolution of the cloud are studied. For a simulated $10^5$ M$_\\odot$ fractal\ncloud an X-ray flux $<0.01$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ allows the cloud to remain\nmolecular, whereas most of the CO and H$_2$ are destroyed for a flux of $>1$\nerg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The effects of an X-ray flare, which suddenly increases\nthe X-ray flux by $10^5 \\times$ are then studied. A cloud exposed to a bright\nflare has 99% of its CO destroyed in 10-20 years, whereas it takes $>10^3$\nyears for 99% of the H$_2$ to be destroyed. CO is primarily destroyed by\nlocally generated far-UV emission from collisions between non-thermal electrons\nand H$_2$; He$^+$ only becomes an important destruction agent when the CO\nabundance is already very small. After the flare is over, CO re-forms and\napproaches its equilibrium abundance after $10^3-10^5$ years. This implies that\nmolecular clouds close to Sgr A$^*$ in the Galactic Centre may still be out of\nchemical equilibrium, and we predict the existence of clouds near flaring X-ray\nsources in which CO has been mostly destroyed but H is fully molecular. \n\n"}

Here, we explore the thermal evolution of primordial gas,\ncollapsing to form Population III (Pop III) stars, when this energy transfer is\nincluded. Performing a series of one-zone calculations, we find that the\nevolution results in stars more massive than in the standard model, provided\nthat the dark matter is described by the best-fit parameters inferred from the\n21-cm observation. On the other hand, a significant part of the dark matter\nparameter space can be excluded by the requirement to form massive Pop III\nstars sufficiently early in cosmic history. Otherwise, the radiation background\nneeded to bring about the strong Wouthuysen-Field coupling at z >~ 17, inferred\nto explain the 21-cm absorption feature, could not be builtup.

As the rate\nof astrophysical sources increases, the probability that a signal will occur at\nthe same time as a glitch also increases. This has occurred previously in the\ngravitational wave binary neutron star detection GW170817. In the case of\nGW170817, the glitch in the Livingston detector was easy to identify, and much\nshorter than the total duration of the signal, making it possible for the\nglitch to be removed. In this paper, we examine the effect of glitches on the\nmeasurement of signal parameters and Bayes factors used for model selection for\nmuch more difficult cases, where it may not be possible to determine that the\nglitch is present or to remove it.

Knowledge of such offsets is\nimportant for estimate the uncertainties when using clusters as cosmological\nprobes. In this paper, we study the centre offsets $r_{\\rm off}$ between the\ngas and that of all the matter within halo systems in $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations. We focus on two kinds of centre offsets: one is the\nthree-dimensional PB offsets between the gravitational potential minimum of the\nentire halo and the barycentre of the ICM, and the other is the two-dimensional\nPX offsets between the potential minimum of the halo and the iterative centroid\nof the projected synthetic X-ray emission of the halo. Halos at higher\nredshifts tend to have larger values of rescaled offsets $r_{\\rm off}/r_{200}$\nand larger gas velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{v}^{\\rm gas}/\\sigma_{200}$. For\nboth types of offsets, we find that the correlation between the rescaled centre\noffsets $r_{\\rm off}/r_{200}$ and the rescaled 3D gas velocity dispersion,\n$\\sigma_v^{\\rm gas}/\\sigma_{200}$ can be approximately described by a quadratic\nfunction as $r_{{\\rm off}}/r_{200} \\propto (\\sigma_{v}^{\\rm gas}/\\sigma_{200} -\nk_2)^{2}$.

With high precision of position,\nvelocity, and metallicity, the rotation of the local stellar halo is presented\nusing the K giant stars with [Fe/H]$<-1$ dex within 4 kpc from the Sun. By\nfitting the rotational velocity distribution with three Gaussian components,\nstellar halo, disk, and a counter-rotating hot population, we find that the\nlocal halo progradely rotates with $V_T=+27^{+4}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$ providing\nthe local standard of rest velocity of $V_{LSR}=232$ km s$^{-1}$.

Although the rotational velocity strongly depends on the choice of\n$V_{LSR}$, the trend of prograde rotation is substantial even when $V_{LSR}$ is\nset at as low as 220 km s$^{-1}$.

The WL effect depends on the lensing potential (LP) caused by matter\nperturbations, the distribution of which at cosmological scales is given by the\nmatter power spectrum (MPS). Therefore, the WL effect on the CMB $B$ mode is\naffected by the MPS. Considering the effect of the ensemble average energy\ndensity of the PMF, which we call \"the background PMF,\" on the MPS, the\namplitude of MPS is suppressed in the wave number range of $k>0.01~h$\nMpc$^{-1}$.The MPS affects the LP and the WL effect in the CMB $B$ mode;\nhowever, the PMF can damp this effect. Previous studies of the CMB $B$ mode\nwith the PMF have only considered the vector and tensor modes. These modes\nboost the CMB $B$ mode in the multipole range of $\\ell > 1000$, whereas the\nbackground PMF damps the CMB $B$ mode owing to the WL effect in the entire\nmultipole range. The matter density in the Universe controls the WL effect.\nTherefore, when we constrain the PMF and the matter density parameters from\ncosmological observational data sets, including the CMB $B$ mode, we expect\ndegeneracy between these parameters. The CMB $B$ mode also provides important\ninformation on the background gravitational waves, inflation theory, matter\ndensity fluctuations, and the structure formations at the cosmological scale\nthrough the cosmological parameter search. If we study these topics and\ncorrectly constrain the cosmological parameters from cosmological observations\nincluding the CMB $B$ mode, we need to correctly consider the background PMF. \n\n"}

In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation\nof relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray\nemission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late\nafterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission\nalone can explain late afterglows. We find that collision between a mildly\nrelativistic outflow from the merger with a Lorentz factor of $\\sim 1.2-3$ and\nthe ISM/circumburst material can explain observations, if the synchrotron\nself-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are\ntaken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary\nto explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here\nand can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its\nencounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly\nmagnetized. The origin for optical extinction could be a dust rich old faint\nstar cluster surrounding the BNS, which had also helped its formation and\nmerger. Such environment evades present observational constraints and is\nconsistent with our conclusions about properties and evolution of the\nprogenitor neutron stars obtained from the prompt gamma-ray. If the synchrotron\nemission was produced by collision between density shells, the extinction might\nhave occurred inside the outflow itself rather than externally. A plausible\nsource of additional X-ray is decay of medium and heavy isotopes produced by\nthe kilonova, including r-processes, and recombination of cooled electrons.\nContribution of these processes should be quantified in future works. \n\n"}

Abstract: It remains unclear whether massive star evolution is facilitated by mass loss\nthrough stellar winds only, or whether episodic mass loss during an eruptive\nluminous blue variable (LBV) phase is also significant. LBVs exhibit unique\nphotometric and spectroscopic variability (termed S Dor variables). This may\nhave tremendous implications for our understanding of the first stars,\ngravitational wave events, and supernovae. A key question here is whether all\nevolved massive stars passing through the blue supergiant phase are dormant S\nDor variables transforming during a brief period, or whether LBVs are truly\nunique objects. By investigating the OGLE light-curves of 64 B supergiants\n(Bsgs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) on a timescale of three years with a\ncadence of one night, the incidence of S Dor variables amongst the Bsgs\npopulation is investigated.

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary\nsystems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those\nfound around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to\nbe extremely rare in such environments. \n\n"}

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs. This analysis shows that stripped\nnuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day galaxy\nnuclei. We estimate the local SMBH number density in stripped nuclei to\n$3-8\\times10^{-3}Mpc^{-3}$, which represents a significant fraction (10-40\\%)\nof the SMBH density in the local Universe. These SMBHs hidden in stripped\nnuclei will increase expected event rates for tidal disruption events and\nSMBH-SMBH and SMBH-BH mergers. The existence of numerous stripped nuclei with\nSMBHs are a direct consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation, but until now\ntheir impact on the SMBH density had not been quantified. \n\n"}

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

Using 1 kpc-scale spaxels, we compute the relationships between\nthe star formation rate and stellar mass surface densities, i.e. the spatially\nresolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS), and between the gas metallicity\nand the stellar mass surface density, i.e. the spatially resolved\nmass-metallicity relation (rMZR).

EAGLE reproduces the slope\nof the local ($z\\approx0.1$) rSFMS well, but with a $\\approx-0.15$ dex offset,\nclose to that found for the galaxy-integrated relation. The shape of the rMZR\nagrees reasonably well with observations, replicating the characteristic\nturnover at high surface density, which we show is due to AGN feedback.

We have searched the\nrecently-released North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves\n(NANOGrav) 11-year data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits.\nAs we did not find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95\\% upper\nlimits on the strength of GWs from such sources as a function of GW frequency\nand sky location.

Using this BH mass,\nthe existing upper limits of both X-ray, and radio emissions in the nucleus of\nNGC 205 suggest an accretion rate $\\lesssim$$10^{-5}$ of the Eddington rate. We\nalso discuss the color--\\mleff~relations in our nuclei and find that the slopes\nof these vary significantly between nuclei. Nuclei with significant young\nstellar populations have steeper color--\\mleff~relations than some previously\npublished galaxy color--\\mleff~relations. \n\n"}

Using the\nwell-established, computationally efficient Santa Cruz semi-analytic model,\nwith recently implemented multiphase gas partitioning and H2-based star\nformation recipes, we make predictions for a wide variety of galaxy properties\nfor galaxy populations at $z$ = 4-10. In this work, we provide forecasts for\nthe physical properties of high-redshift galaxies and links to their\nphotometric properties. With physical parameters calibrated only to $z\\sim0$\nobservations, our model predictions are in good agreement with current\nobservational constraints on stellar mass and star formation rate distribution\nfunctions up to $z \\sim 8$. We also provide predictions representing wide,\ndeep, and lensed JWST survey configurations. We study the redshift evolution of\nkey galaxy properties and the scaling relations among them. Taking advantage of\nour models' high computational efficiency, we study the impact of\nsystematically varying the model parameters.

We created 5 deg times 6 deg images of the\n70-1200 um dust continuum, gas column density, and dust temperature of Cygnus\nX. A spatial relation between the dense regions (Av > 15) and the developed HII\nregions was found, indicating the impact of the latter on the global structures\nof Cygnus X. With a 35-Msun mass threshold implied by HMSF signposts, we\nidentified 151 MDCs with sizes of ~0.1 pc, masses of 35-1762 Msun, and\ntemperatures of 8-35 K. Our MDC sample is statistically complete in Cygnus X\nand is three times larger than that in Motte et al. (2007). The MDCs were\nclassified into IR-bright/IR-quiet ones based on their mid-infrared fluxes and\na large \"IR-quiet\" proportion (90%) was found in our sample. Two possible\nscenarios were proposed to interpret this: accelerated HMSF and the\nincapability of HMSF of the IR-quiet MDCs. We also found 26 starless MDCs by\ntheir lack of compact emissions at 21-70 um wavelengths, of which the most\nmassive ones are probably the best candidates of initial HMSF sites in Cygnus\nX. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.11442", "contents": "Title: Ca line formation in late-type stellar atmospheres: I. The model atom Abstract: Context. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) distort the\ncalcium abundance derived from stellar spectra in various ways, depending on\nthe lines used and the stellar atmospheric parameters. The collection of atomic\ndata adopted in non-LTE (NLTE) calculations must be sufficiently complete and\naccurate. Aims. We derive NLTE abundances from high-quality observations and\nreliable stellar parameters using a model atom built afresh for this work, and\ncheck the consistency of our results over a wide wavelength range with\ntransitions of atomic and singly ionised calcium. Methods. We built and tested\nCa i and Ca ii model atoms with state-of-the-art radiative and collisional\ndata, and tested their performance deriving the Ca abundance in three benchmark\nstars: Procyon, the Sun, and Arcturus. We have excellent-quality observations\nand accurate stellar parameters for these stars. Two methods to derive the LTE\n/ NLTE abundances were used and compared. The LTE / NLTE centre-to-limb\nvariation (CLV) of Ca lines in the Sun was also investigated. Results. The two\nmethods used give similar results in all three stars. Several discrepancies\nfound in LTE do not appear in our NLTE results; in particular the agreement\nbetween abundances in the visual and infra-red (IR) and the Ca i and Ca ii\nionisation balance is improved overall, although substantial line-to-line\nscatter remains. The CLV of the calcium lines around 6165 Angs can be partially\nreproduced. We suspect differences between our modelling and CLV results are\ndue to inhomogeneities in the atmosphere that require 3D modelling. \n\n"}
