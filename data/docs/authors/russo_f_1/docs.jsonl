This question was posed in \\cite{rat0903} who\nshowed that the more complex the learner the higher the possibility that his\nmistakes deviate from a true random sequence. In the current paper we report on\nan empirical investigation of this problem. We investigate two characteristics\nof randomness, the stochastic and algorithmic complexity of the binary sequence\nof mistakes. A learner with a Markov model of order $k$ is trained on a finite\nbinary sequence produced by a Markov source of order $k^{*}$ and is tested on a\ndifferent random sequence. As a measure of learner's complexity we define a\nquantity called the \\emph{sysRatio}, denoted by $\\rho$, which is the ratio\nbetween the compressed and uncompressed lengths of the binary string whose\n$i^{th}$ bit represents the maximum \\emph{a posteriori} decision made at state\n$i$ of the learner's model.

Classical Monte Carlo simulations do, however, not suffer from\nthis divergence behavior of Euler's method because this divergence behavior\nhappens on rare events. Indeed, for such nonlinear SDEs the classical Monte\nCarlo Euler method has been shown to converge by exploiting that the Euler\napproximations diverge only on events whose probabilities decay to zero very\nrapidly. Significantly more efficient than the classical Monte Carlo Euler\nmethod is the recently introduced multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method. The main\nobservation of this article is that this multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method\ndoes - in contrast to classical Monte Carlo methods - not converge in general\nin the case of such nonlinear SDEs. More precisely, we establish divergence of\nthe multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method for a family of SDEs with superlinearly\ngrowing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficients. In\nparticular, the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method diverges for these\nnonlinear SDEs on an event that is not at all rare but has probability one. As\na consequence for applications, we recommend not to use the multilevel Monte\nCarlo Euler method for SDEs with superlinearly growing nonlinearities.

It is well known\nthat this model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the\ninteraction strength parameter K, in the limit of the number N of rotators\ngoing to infinity. A Fokker-Planck PDE captures the evolution of the empirical\nmeasure of the system as N goes to infinity, at least for finite times and when\nthe empirical measure of the system at time zero satisfies a law of large\nnumbers. The phase transition is reflected in the fact that the PDE for K above\nthe critical value has a stable manifold of stationary solutions, that are\nequivalent up to rotations. These stationary solutions are actually unimodal\ndensities parametrized by the position of their maximum (the synchronization\nphase or center). We characterize the dynamics on times of order N and we show\nsubstantial deviations from the behavior of the solutions of the PDE. In fact,\nif the empirical measure at time zero converges as N goes to infinity to a\nprobability measure (which is away from a thin set that we characterize) and if\ntime is speeded up by N, the empirical measure reaches almost instantaneously a\nsmall neighborhood of the stable manifold, to which it then sticks and on which\na non-trivial random dynamics takes place.

Abstract: High order and fractional PDEs have become prominent in theory and in\nmodeling many phenomena. Here, we focus on the regularizing effect of a large\nclass of memoryful high-order or time-fractional PDEs---through their\nfundamental solutions---on stochastic integral equations (SIEs) driven by\nspace-time white noise. Surprisingly, we show that maximum spatial regularity\nis achieved in the fourth-order-bi-Laplacian case; and any further increase of\nthe spatial-Laplacian order is entirely translated into additional temporal\nregularization of the SIE. We started this program in (Allouba 2013, Allouba\n2006), where we introduced two different stochastic versions of the fourth\norder memoryful PDE associated with the Brownian-time Brownian motion (BTBM):\n(1) the BTBM SIE and (2) the BTBM SPDE, both driven by space-time white noise.\nUnder wide conditions, we showed the existence of random field locally-H\\\"older\nsolutions to the BTBM SIE with striking and unprecedented time-space H\\\"older\nexponents, in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$. In particular, we proved that the\nspatial regularity of such solutions is nearly locally Lipschitz in $d=1,2$.\nThis gave, for the first time, an example of a space-time white noise driven\nequation whose solutions are smoother than the corresponding Brownian sheet in\neither time or space. In this paper, we introduce the $2\\beta^{-1}$-order\n$\\beta$-inverse-stable-L\\'evy-time Brownian motion ($\\beta$-ISLTBM) SIEs,\ndriven by space-time white noise. We show that the BTBM SIE spatial regularity\nand its random field third spatial dimension limit are maximal among all\n$\\beta$-ISLTBM SIEs. Furthermore, we show that increasing the order of the\nLaplacian $\\beta^{-1}$ beyond the BTBM bi-Laplacian manifests entirely as\nincreased temporal regularity of our random field solutions that asymptotically\napproaches the temporal regularity of the Brownian sheet as $\\beta\\searrow0$. \n\n"}

The SST\nmini-array will be able to study in great detail relatively bright sources (a\nfew x 10E-12 erg/cm2/s at 10 TeV) with angular resolution of a few arcmin and\nenergy resolution of about 10-15%.

We make no particular probabilistic assumptions on the\ntype of noise appearing in these recursions.

Our main theorem assumes a weak limit theorem on the\nnoise process appearing in the random recursions and lifts it to diffusion\napproximation for the recursion itself.

Here Xcan is the complement of an anticanonical\ndivisor in a Langlands dual quadric. The superpotential W is a regular function\non Xcan and is written in terms of coordinates which are naturally identified\nwith a cohomology basis of the original quadric. This superpotential is shown\nto extend the earlier Landau-Ginzburg model of Givental, and to be isomorphic\nto the Lie-theoretic mirror introduced by Rietsch. We also introduce a Laurent\npolynomial superpotential which is the restriction of W to a particular torus\nin Xcan.

This marginal stability has traditionally been understood in\nterms of isostaticity, the equality of the number of mechanical contacts and\nthe number of degrees of freedom. Quasicontacts, pairs of spheres on the verge\nof coming in contact, are irrelevant for static stability, but they come into\nplay when considering dynamic stability, as does the distribution of contact\nforces. We show that the effects of marginal dynamic stability, as manifested\nin the distributions of quasicontacts and weak contacts, are consequential and\nnontrivial. We study these ideas first in the context of MRJ packing of\nd-dimensional spheres, where we show that the abundance of quasicontacts grows\nat a faster rate than that of contacts. We reexamine a calculation of Jin et\nal. (Phys. Rev. E 82, 051126, 2010), where quasicontacts were originally\nneglected, and we explore the effect of their inclusion in the calculation.\nThis analysis yields an estimate of the asymptotic behavior of the packing\ndensity in high dimensions. We argue that this estimate should be reinterpreted\nas a lower bound. The latter part of the paper is devoted to Bravais lattice\npackings that possess the minimum number of contacts to maintain mechanical\nstability. We show that quasicontacts play an even more important role in these\npackings. We also show that jammed lattices are a useful setting for studying\nthe Edwards ensemble, which weights each mechanically stable configuration\nequally and does not account for dynamics.

Its 2500\nscintillator strips have a Gd loaded reflective cover. Light is collected with\n3 wave length shifting fibers per strip and read out with 50 PMTs and 2500\nSiPMs. The DANSS will be installed under the industrial 3GW$_{th}$ reactor of\nthe Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant at distances varying from 9.7m to 12.2m from\nthe reactor core. PMTs and SiPMs collect about 30 photo electrons per MeV\ndistributed approximately equally between two types of the readout. Light\ncollection non-uniformity across and along the strip is about $\\pm13\\%$ from\nmaximum to minimum. The resulting energy resolution is modest, $\\sigma/E=15\\%$\nat 5MeV. This leads to a smearing of the oscillation pattern comparable with\nthe smearing due to the large size of the reactor core. Nevertheless because of\nthe large counting rate ($\\sim 10000$ / day), small background ($<1\\%$) and\ngood control of systematic uncertainties due to frequent changes of positions,\nthe DANSS is quite sensitive to reactor antineutrino oscillations to\nhypothetical sterile neutrinos with a mass in eV ballpark suggested recently to\nexplain a so-called \"reactor anomaly\".

This allows us\nto obtain limit theorems concerning the block structure of simply generated\nnon-crossing partitions.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV. Several array geometries, the shape of the energy\nerror distributions and the uncertainties due to the unknown composition of the\nprimary flux have been analyzed as well. \n\n"}

The next step\nis the reconstruction of the mass composition and the energy spectrum of cosmic\nrays. One of the main problems appearing within this task is to estimate the\ndetection efficiency of the instrument, and the exposure of the observations.\nThe detection efficiency depends on properties of the primary cosmic rays, such\nas energy and arrival direction, as well as on many parameters of the\ninstrument: density of the array, efficiency of the receiving antennas,\nsignal-detection threshold, data-acquisition acceptance, and trigger\nproperties. More than that, the configuration of detector changes with time.\nDuring the measurements some parts of the detector can provide corrupted data\nor sometimes do not operate.

Drawdown and drawup refer to the differences between\nthe historical maximum and minimum of the asset price and its current value,\nrespectively. We consider four contracts.

The former occurs for $p$ smaller than a critical rate $p_c$,\nand is characterized by volume-law entanglement in the steady-state and\n`ballistic' entanglement growth after a quench. By contrast, for $p > p_c$ the\nsystem can sustain only area-law entanglement. At $p = p_c$ the steady state is\nscale-invariant and, in 1+1D, the entanglement grows logarithmically after a\nquench.\n  To obtain a simple heuristic picture for the entangling-disentangling\ntransition, we first construct a toy model that describes the zeroth R\\'{e}nyi\nentropy in discrete time.

We establish that\nthis model goes through a phase transition at $p_c=1/4$ between a subcritical\nregime where every particle eventually annihilates, and a supercritical regime\nwhere a positive density of static particles is never hit, confirming 1990s\npredictions of Droz et al. for the particular case of a Poisson process.

When $T(t) > c_{M_2}/\\log(t+1)$ follows the\nlogarithmic cooling schedule, our proposed algorithm is strongly ergodic both\nin total variation and in relative entropy, and converges to the set of global\nminima, where $c_{M_2}$ is a constant that we explicitly identify.
