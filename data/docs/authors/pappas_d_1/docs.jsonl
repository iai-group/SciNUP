We demonstrate that the cascade term\nnaturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the\nvicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical\ncorrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the\nLorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up\nto which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss\nthe role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the\ntwo-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of\ncosmological hydrogen recombination.

While $T_c$ increases\nmonotonically with doping, the SDW order is rapidly suppressed, suggesting a\nQCP around $x \\sim$0.14. As manifestations, a linear temperature dependence of\nthe resistivity shows up at high temperatures in the $x<0.14$ regime, but at\nlow temperatures just above $T_c$ in the $x>0.14$ regime; a drop in carrier\ndensity evidenced by a pronounced rise in Hall coefficient are observed, which\nmimic the high-$T_c$ cuprates.

The dephasing rate depends\nperiodically on the external magnetic flux applied to the SQUID, where the\nlargest rate is obtained at half integer values (in units of the flux quantum).\nTo account for our result we compare our findings with theory and find good\nagreement.

It is straightforward to port a standard adiabatic algorithm to an\nanholonomic adiabatic one, except an introduction of a parameter |v>, which is\navailable to adjust the gaps of the quasienergies to control the running time\nsteps. In Grover's database search problem, the costs to prepare |v> for the\nqualitatively different, i.e., power or exponential, running time steps are\nshown to be qualitatively different. Curiously, in establishing the equivalence\nbetween the standard quantum computation based on the circuit model and the\nanholonomic adiabatic quantum computation model, it is shown that the cost for\n|v> to enlarge the gaps of the eigenvalue is qualitatively negligible. \n\n"}

We first formulate a recipe which determines the Bloch\nstates of a one-dimensional (1D) ring from the Bloch states of an infinite 1D\ncrystal created by the periodic repetition of the ring. Using the recipe, we\nderive an expression for the persistent current in a 1D ring made of an\ninsulator with an arbitrary valence band E(k). To find an exact result for a\nspecific insulator, we consider a 1D ring represented by a periodic lattice of\nN identical sites with a single value of the on-site energy. If the Bloch\nstates in the ring are expanded over a complete set of N on-site Wannier\nfunctions, the discrete on-site energy splits into the energy band. At full\nfilling, the band emulates the valence band of the band insulator and the ring\nis insulating. It carries a persistent current equal to the product of N and\nthe derivative of the on-site energy with respect to the magnetic flux. This\ncurrent is not zero if one takes into account that the on-site Wannier function\nand consequently the on-site energy of each ring site depend on magnetic flux.\nTo derive the current analytically, we expand all N Wannier functions of the\nring over the infinite basis of Wannier functions of the constituting infinite\n1D crystal and eventually determine the crystal Wannier functions by a method\nof localized atomic orbitals.

The use of\neasily controllable and stable microwave sources instead of complex laser\nsystems on the other hand promises to remove obstacles to scalability.\nImportant remaining drawbacks in this approach are the use of magnetic field\nsensitive states, which shorten coherence times considerably, and the\nrequirement to create large stable magnetic field gradients.

Limiting the confusion from Galactic and Extragalactic foregrounds is\ncritical to the success of these telescopes. Instrumental response or the Point\nSpread Function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently 3 dimensional with\nfrequency mapping to the Line of Sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will\nnecessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists;\ntherefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so\nthat the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper\naims to understand the 3 dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the\nsame framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination\nalong frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship\nbetween foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on\nthe Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground\ncontamination-'PSF contamination' and 'gridding contamination'. We show that\n'PSF contamination' is localized in LOS wavenumber space, beyond which there\npotentially exists an 'EoR window' with negligible foreground contamination\nwhere we may focus our efforts to detect EoR. 'PSF contamination' in this\nwindow may be substantially reduced by judicious choice of a frequency window\nfunction. Gridding and imaging algorithms create additional 'gridding\ncontamination' and we propose a new imaging algorithm using the Chirp Z\nTransform (CZT) that significantly reduces this contamination.

We evaluate the consequences of the lossy compression\nalgorithm of Bernstein et al. (2010) for the high-precision measurement of\nweak-lensing galaxy ellipticities. This square-root algorithm compresses each\npixel independently, and the information discarded is by construction less than\nthe Poisson error from photon shot noise. For simulated space-based images\n(without cosmic rays) digitized to the typical 16 bits per pixel, application\nof the lossy compression followed by image-wise lossless compression yields\nimages with only 2.4 bits per pixel, a factor of 6.7 compression. We\ndemonstrate that this compression introduces no bias in the sky background.

The ellipticity measurement method is biased by the addition\nof noise, so the additional digitization noise is expected to induce a\nmultiplicative bias on the galaxies' measured ellipticities.

From a user's perspective, an ideal\namplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a\nhigh dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little\ndistortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these\ncharacteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer\nmulti-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise\nremains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of\nquantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers\nand are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power\nfrom a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely\nreactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the\nquantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson\nparametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow\nband and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a\nsuperconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations.

In the end, the only way to be sure is to test\npredictions of inhomogeneous cosmological theories, such as timescape\ncosmology, against observational data. If these theories provide a valid\ndescription of the universe, one expects aside other effects, that there is a\ndependence of the Hubble parameter on the line of sight matter distribution.\nThe redshift of a galaxy, which is located at a certain distance, is expected\nto be smaller if the environment in the line of sight is mainly high density\n(clusters), rather than mainly low density environment (voids).

In\nparticular, occupation measures of state and control variables do not appear in\nthis formulation.

We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing\nstate-of-the-art combinatorial algorithms and convex optimization techniques.\nOn small problems the iterative convex methods match the combinatorial max-flow\nalgorithms, while on larger problems they offer other flexibility and important\ngains: (a) their memory footprint is small; (b) their straightforward\nparallelizability fits multi-core platforms; (c) they can easily be\nwarm-started; and (d) they quickly reach approximately good solutions, thereby\nenabling faster \"inexact\" solutions. A key consequence of our approach based on\nsubmodularity and convexity is that it is allows to combine any arbitrary\ncombinatorial or convex methods as subroutines, which allows one to obtain\nhybrid combinatorial and convex optimization algorithms that benefit from the\nstrengths of both. \n\n"}

This has implications for\ntools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in\npower system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for\nthis uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance\nConstrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation\nto a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are\nnot immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for\ngeneration control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal. On\nthe other hand, the standard CC-OPF formulations do not distinguish between\nlarge and small violations, although those might carry significantly different\nrisk. In this paper, we introduce the Weighted CC-OPF (WCC-OPF) that can handle\ngeneral control policies while preserving convexity and allowing for efficient\ncomputation.

Since inside each molecule, individual\natoms conserve their identity, the intermolecular potential energy can be\nexpanded as the sum of pairwise atomic potential energies. In the case of\nEr$_2$ Feshbach molecules, we show that the interaction between atomic magnetic\ndipoles gives rise to the usual $R^{-3}$ term of the multipolar expansion, with\n$R$ the intermolecular distance, but also to additional terms scaling as\n$R^{-5}$, $R^{-7}$, and so on.

Similarly the atomic pairwise van\nder Waals interaction results in $R^{-6}$, $R^{-8}$, ... terms in the\nintermolecular potential energy.

These properties make\nscreening of the electron-hole interaction much weaker than for coupled\nelectron-hole monolayers, thus boosting the pairing strength and enhancing the\nsuperfluid properties.

The simplicity of the model ensures highly\nefficient computations, enabling an comprehensive study: a large range of hard\nphase volume fractions and yield stress ratios, for wide range of applied\nstress states. Each combination of these parameters is analyzed using a large\nset of (random) microstructures.

This transition is strongly\ndependent on microstructural parameters. If the hard phase volume fraction is\nsmall, the fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase even at high\nphase contrast.

Although the conventional single-site\nmean-field (MF) approach successfully predicts the emergence of QPTs, it fails\nto include any entanglement. Here, for the first time, in the framework of a\ncluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of\ninteracting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement\nthe cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping. In addition to\nsuperfluid and integer insulator phases, we find that fractional insulator\nphases appear when the tunneling is dominated by the intra-trimer part.

The\nsuccession of such cost functions provides the information for the storage to\ndetermine how to behave over time, forming the basis of the appropriate\noptimisation problem.

In this work, we\nattempt to address many of the problems that the smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) technique has when dealing with subsonic hydrodynamical\ninstabilities or shocks. To that aim we built a new SPH code named SPHYNX, that\nincludes many of the recent advances in the SPH technique and some other new\nones, which we present here. SPHYNX is of Newtonian type and grounded in the\nEuler-Lagrange formulation of the SPH technique. Its distinctive features are:\nthe use of an integral approach to estimating the gradients; the use of a\nflexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels, which suppress pairing\ninstability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which\nprovides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations,\nwhich consider volume elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice\nrelies on density.

In most CPTs of atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs), the universality of spontaneous defect generations has been\nexplained by the divergent relaxation time associated with the nontrivial\ngapless Bogoliubov excitations. However, for atomic BECs in synthetic gauge\nfields, their spontaneous superfluidity breakdown is resulted from the\ndivergent correlation length associated with the zero Landau critical velocity.\nHere, by considering an atomic BEC ladder subjected to a synthetic magnetic\nfield, we reveal that the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown obeys the KZM.\nThe Kibble-Zurek scalings are derived from the Landau critical velocity which\ndetermines the correlation length.

For $^{87}$Rb\natoms, with $N=10^{6}$, for example, the intereference would occur at a Compton\nfrequency of $\\sim$ $2 \\times 10^{31}$ Hz. Under this scheme, the signal is\nfound to depend critically on the parity of $N$. We present two variants of the\nprotocol.

Analytically computed covariances are\nnoise-free and hence straightforward to invert, however the model\napproximations might be insufficient for the statistical precision of future\ncosmological data. Estimating covariances from numerical simulations improves\non these approximations, but the sample covariance estimator is inherently\nnoisy, which introduces uncertainties in the error bars on cosmological\nparameters and also additional scatter in their best fit values. For future\nsurveys, reducing both effects to an acceptable level requires an unfeasibly\nlarge number of simulations.\n  In this paper we describe a way to expand the true precision matrix around a\ncovariance model and show how to estimate the leading order terms of this\nexpansion from simulations. This is especially powerful if the covariance\nmatrix is the sum of two contributions, $\\smash{\\mathbf{C} =\n\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}}$, where $\\smash{\\mathbf{A}}$ is well understood\nanalytically and can be turned off in simulations (e.g. shape-noise for cosmic\nshear) to yield a direct estimate of $\\smash{\\mathbf{B}}$.

It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should\nstrive for; it is not a descriptive \"law of nature\" in the usual sense. 2) All\nprobabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they\nnever tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum\nstates thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world. 3) Quantum measurement outcomes\njust are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Particularly,\nquantum measurement outcomes are not, to paraphrase Bohr, instances of\n\"irreversible amplification in devices whose design is communicable in common\nlanguage suitably refined by the terminology of classical physics.\" Finally, an\nexplicit comparison is given between QBism and Bohr with regard to three\nsubjects: a) The issue of the \"detached observer\" as it arose in a debate\nbetween Pauli and Bohr, b) Bohr's reply to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, and\nc) Bohr's mature notion of \"quantum phenomena.\" At the end, we discuss how\nBohr's notion of phenomena may have something to offer the philosophy of\nWilliam James: A physics from which to further develop his vision of the\nworld---call it an ontology if you will---in which \"new being comes in local\nspots and patches.\" \n\n"}

We study both 1+1D\nand higher dimensions, and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to\noperator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that\nthe out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation,\nwhich gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC, and the\nbutterfly speed $v_{B}$. We find that in 1+1D the `front' of the OTOC broadens\ndiffusively, with a width scaling in time as $t^{1/2}$. We address fluctuations\nin the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that\nthey are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front. Turning to\nhigher D, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a\nremarkable correspondence with a classical droplet growth problem. This implies\nthat the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as $t^{1/3}$ in 2+1D\nand $t^{0.24}$ in 3+1D (KPZ exponents). We support our analytic argument with\nsimulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in a lattice model, the late time shape\nof the spreading operator is in general not spherical. However when full\nspatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact\nasymptotic form for the OTOC in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution.

As a result of special structure arising from\nunitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which\ncan be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for\nentanglement growth in 1+1D circuits. \n\n"}

We show that, in practice, the gain,\nquantum efficiency, and output field squeezing of these devices are limited by\nusually neglected higher-order corrections to the idealized model. To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms. In all cases, we find\nthat the corrections are detrimental to squeezing. In addition, we show that\nthe Kerr correction leads to a strongly phase-dependent reduction of the\nquantum efficiency of a phase-sensitive measurement. Finally, we quantify the\ndeparture from ideal Gaussian character of the filtered output field from\nnumerical calculation of third and fourth order cumulants. Our results show\nthat, while a Gaussian output field is expected for an ideal Josephson\nparametric amplifier, higher-order corrections lead to non-Gaussian effects\nwhich increase with both gain and nonlinearity strength.

Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+\nloss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild\nconditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex,\nor even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical\nexperiments on shortest path and portfolio optimization problems show that the\nSPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the\npredict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular when the prediction model being\ntrained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss\ntend to dominate random forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly\nnonlinear. \n\n"}

The next step\nis the reconstruction of the mass composition and the energy spectrum of cosmic\nrays. One of the main problems appearing within this task is to estimate the\ndetection efficiency of the instrument, and the exposure of the observations.\nThe detection efficiency depends on properties of the primary cosmic rays, such\nas energy and arrival direction, as well as on many parameters of the\ninstrument: density of the array, efficiency of the receiving antennas,\nsignal-detection threshold, data-acquisition acceptance, and trigger\nproperties. More than that, the configuration of detector changes with time.\nDuring the measurements some parts of the detector can provide corrupted data\nor sometimes do not operate. All these features should be taken into account\nfor an estimation of the detection efficiency. For each energy and arrival\ndirection we estimate the detection probability and effective area of the\ninstrument.

The need for a robust optimization procedure\noriginates from the fact that optimization parameters have deviations.

We study a single hole described by the t-Jz\nmodel with Ising interactions between the spins in 2D. This situation can be\nexperimentally realized in quantum gas microscopes. When the hole hopping is\nmuch larger than couplings between the spins, we find strong evidence that\nmagnetic polarons can be understood as bound states of two partons, a spinon\nand a holon carrying spin and charge quantum numbers respectively. We introduce\na microscopic parton description which is benchmarked by comparison with\nresults from advanced numerical simulations. Using this parton theory, we\npredict a series of excited states that are invisible in the spectral function\nand correspond to rotational excitations of the spinon-holon pair.

It is shown here that the same experiment can be viewed in two\ndifferent ways, depending on which basis of the which-way detector states one\nchooses to look at. In one view, the loss of interference arises due to the\nentanglement of the two paths of the particle with two orthogonal states of the\nwhich-way detector.

Importantly, NMR found early that\nnuclear relaxation is much faster than what one expects from coupling to\nfermionic excitations above the critical temperature for superconductivity\n($T_{\\rm c}$), i.e. what one estimates from the Knight shift with the Korringa\nlaw. As a consequence, special electronic spin fluctuations have been invoked.\nHere, based on literature relaxation data it is shown that the electronic\nexcitations, to which the nuclei couple with a material and doping dependent\nanisotropy, are rather ubiquitous and Fermi liquid-like. A suppressed NMR spin\nshift rather than an enhanced relaxation leads to the failure of the Korringa\nlaw for most materials.

Indeed, it was shown\nrecently that Pb/Co/Si(111) could be used as a platform for generating 2D\ntopological superconductivity with a strong immunity to local disorder. While\n2D systems exhibit dispersive chiral edge states, they can also host Majorana\nzero modes located on local topological defects.

The\nfirst idea is a new parameterization of the optimality condition which allows\nus to develop a class of homotopy proximal variable-metric methods. We show\nthat under appropriate assumptions such as strong convexity-type and\nsmoothness, or self-concordance, our new schemes can achieve finite global\niteration-complexity bounds. Our second idea is a primal-dual-primal framework\nfor proximal-Newton methods which can lead to some useful computational\nfeatures for a subclass of nonsmooth composite convex optimization problems.\nStarting from the primal problem, we formulate its dual problem, and use our\nhomotopy proximal Newton method to solve this dual problem. Instead of solving\nthe subproblem directly in the dual space, we suggest to dualize this\nsubproblem to go back to the primal space. The resulting subproblem shares some\nsimilarity promoted by the regularizer of the original problem and leads to\nsome computational advantages. As a byproduct, we specialize the proposed\nalgorithm to solve covariance estimation problems. Surprisingly, our new\nalgorithm does not require any matrix inversion or Cholesky factorization, and\nfunction evaluation, while it works in the primal space with sparsity\nstructures that are promoted by the regularizer. Numerical examples on several\napplications are given to illustrate our theoretical development and to compare\nwith state-of-the-arts. \n\n"}

To study the\npressure-dependence of this superconducting phase we have calculated the phonon\nfrequencies and the electron-phonon coupling in hcp Fe as a function of the\nlattice parameter, using the linear response (LR) scheme and the full potential\nlinear muffin-tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method. Calculated phonon spectra and the\nEliashberg functions $\\alpha^2 F$ indicate that conventional s-wave\nelectron-phonon coupling can definitely account for the appearance of the\nsuperconducting phase in hcp Fe. However, the observed change in the transition\ntemperature with increasing pressure is far too rapid compared with the\ncalculated results. For comparison with the linear response results, we have\ncomputed the electron-phonon coupling also by using the rigid muffin-tin (RMT)\napproximation. From both the LR and the RMT results it appears that\nelectron-phonon interaction alone cannot explain the small range of volume over\nwhich superconductivity is observed.

We describe how qubits are realized\nand controlled with RF pulses, their internal interactions, and gradient\nfields. A peculiarity of NMR is that the internal interactions (given by the\ninternal Hamiltonian) are always on. We discuss how they can be effectively\nturned off with the help of a standard NMR method called ``refocusing''. Liquid\nstate NMR experiments are done at room temperature, leading to an extremely\nmixed (that is, nearly random) initial state. Despite this high degree of\nrandomness, it is possible to investigate QIP because the relaxation time (the\ntime scale over which useful signal from a computation is lost) is sufficiently\nlong. We explain how this feature leads to the crucial ability of simulating a\npure (non-random) state by using ``pseudopure'' states. We discuss how the\n``answer'' provided by a computation is obtained by measurement and how this\nmeasurement differs from the ideal, projective measurement of QIP. We then give\nimplementations of some simple quantum algorithms with a typical experimental\nresult.

Abstract: Probabilities may be subjective or objective; we are concerned with both\nkinds of probability, and the relationship between them.

That further, on the Everett interpretation, we\nhave a clear statement of what probabilities are, in terms of purely\ncategorical physical properties; and finally, along lines recently laid out by\nDeutsch and Wallace, that there is a clear basis in the axioms of decision\ntheory as to why subjective probabilities should track these objective ones.\n  These results hinge critically on the absence of hidden-variables or any\nother mechanism (such as state-reduction) from the physical interpretation of\nthe theory.\n  The account of probability has traditionally been considered the principal\nweakness of the Everett interpretation; on the contrary it emerges as one of\nits principal strengths. \n\n"}
