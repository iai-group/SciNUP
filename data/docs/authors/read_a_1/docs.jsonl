Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen.

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses.

We use a\nstatistical code to follow the evolution of a collisional population, ranging\nfrom dust grains (submitted to radiation pressure) to planetesimals and\ninitially confined within a belt (the 'birth ring'). The system typically\nevolves toward a \"standard\" steady state, with no sharp edge and SB \\propto\nr**-3.5 outside the birth ring. Deviations from this standard profile, in the\nform of a sharp outer edge and a steeper fall-off, occur only when two\nparameters take their extreme values: 1) When the birth ring is so massive that\nit becomes radially optically thick for the smallest grains. However, the\nrequired disc mass is here probably too high to be realistic. 2) When the\ndynamical excitation of the dust-producing planetesimals is so low (<e> <0.01)\nthat the smallest grains, which otherwise dominate the total optical depth, are\npreferentially depleted.

The Case of SuperGiant\n  Fast X-Ray Transients Abstract: In this paper we survey the theory of wind accretion in high mass X-ray\nbinaries hosting a magnetic neutron star and a supergiant companion.\n  We concentrate on the different types of interaction between the inflowing\nwind matter and the neutron star magnetosphere that are relevant when accretion\nof matter onto the neutron star surface is largely inhibited; these include the\ninhibition through the centrifugal and magnetic barriers. Expanding on earlier\nwork, we calculate the expected luminosity for each regime and derive the\nconditions under which transition from one regime to another can take place. We\nshow that very large luminosity swings (~10^4 or more on time scales as short\nas hours) can result from transitions across different regimes.\n  The activity displayed by supergiant fast X-ray transients, a recently\ndiscovered class of high mass X-ray binaries in our galaxy, has often been\ninterpreted in terms of direct accretion onto a neutron star immersed in an\nextremely clumpy stellar wind. We show here that the transitions across the\nmagnetic and/or centrifugal barriers can explain the variability properties of\nthese sources as a results of relatively modest variations in the stellar wind\nvelocity and/or density. According to this interpretation we expect that\nsupergiant fast X-ray transients which display very large luminosity swings and\nhost a slowly spinning neutron star are characterized by magnetar-like fields,\nirrespective of whether the magnetic or the centrifugal barrier applies.\n  Supergiant fast X-ray transients might thus provide a new opportunity to\ndetect and study magnetars in binary systems. \n\n"}

We solve the continuity\nequation for SMBH mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary\ncondition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth\nrate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric\ncorrection and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous\nsemi-analytic and numerical models, we do not assume any specific distribution\nof Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass\nand luminosity functions. SMBH show a very broad accretion rate distribution,\nand we discuss the consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed\nAGN fractions in galaxies. We confirm previous results and demonstrate that, at\nleast for z<1.5, SMBH mass function evolves anti-hierarchically, i.e. the most\nmassive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first\ntime, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts\nabove the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z~2).

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present\nresults for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to\n20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for\ncylindrical versus conical jet models.

When the jet\nruns into a denser medium, we find a clear distinction in the decelaration of\nhigh energy jets depending on the encountered density jump. For fairly high\ndensity contrast, the jet becomes destabilised and compressed, decelerates\nstrongly (up to subrelativistic speeds) and can form knots.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass.

The data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), covering 2008 July 7\n- October 6, indicate strong, highly variable gamma-ray emission with an\naverage flux of ~3 x 10^{-6} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, for energies above 100\nMeV. The gamma-ray flux is variable, with strong, distinct,\nsymmetrically-shaped flares for which the flux increases by a factor of several\non a time scale of about three days. This variability indicates a compact\nemission region, and the requirement that the source is optically thin to\npair-production implies relativistic beaming with Doppler factor delta > 8,\nconsistent with the values inferred from VLBI observations of superluminal\nexpansion (delta ~ 25). The observed gamma-ray spectrum is not consistent with\na simple power-law, but instead steepens strongly above ~2 GeV, and is well\ndescribed by a broken power-law with photon indices of ~2.3 and ~3.5 below and\nabove the break, respectively. This is the first direct observation of a break\nin the spectrum of a high luminosity blazar above 100 MeV, and it is likely\ndirect evidence for an intrinsic break in the energy distribution of the\nradiating particles. Alternatively, the spectral softening above 2 GeV could be\ndue to gamma-ray absorption via photon-photon pair production on the soft X-ray\nphoton field of the host AGN, but such an interpretation would require the\ndissipation region to be located very close (less than 100 gravitational radii)\nto the black hole, which would be inconsistent with the X-ray spectrum of the\nsource. \n\n"}

Radio halos provide one of the\nmost important pieces of evidence for non-thermal components in large scale\nstructure. Statistics of their properties can be used to discriminate among\nvarious models for their origin. Therefore, theoretical predictions of the\noccurrence of radio halos are important as several new radio telescopes are\nabout to begin to survey the sky at low frequencies with unprecedented\nsensitivity. In this paper we carry out Monte Carlo simulations to model the\nformation and evolution of radio halos in a cosmological framework. We extend\nprevious works on the statistical properties of radio halos in the context of\nthe turbulent re-acceleration model. First we compute the fraction of galaxy\nclusters that show radio halos and derive the luminosity function of radio\nhalos. Then, we derive differential and integrated number count distributions\nof radio halos at low radio frequencies with the main goal to explore the\npotential of the upcoming LOFAR surveys. By restricting to the case of clusters\nat redshifts <0.6, we find that the planned LOFAR all sky survey at 120 MHz is\nexpected to detect about 350 giant radio halos. About half of these halos have\nspectral indices larger than 1.9 and substantially brighten at lower\nfrequencies. If detected they will allow for a confirmation that turbulence\naccelerates the emitting particles. We expect that also commissioning surveys,\nsuch as MSSS, have the potential to detect about 60 radio halos in clusters of\nthe ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample and its extension (eBCS). These surveys will\nallow us to constrain how the rate of formation of radio halos in these\nclusters depends on cluster mass. \n\n"}

Access\nto this treasure, impossible from the ground, is one of the scientific aims of\nthe space mission CoRoT, developed and operated by CNES.

The frequency analysis of the\nCoRoT timeseries revealed hundreds of terms in the frequency range 0--30\nd^{-1}. The initial guess that Delta Sct stars have a very rich frequency\ncontent is confirmed. The spectroscopic mode identification gives theoretical\nsupport since very high--degree modes (up to ell=14) are identified.

Here we improve constraints on the source population(s) and\ncompositions of UHECRs by accounting for UHECR deflections within existing\nGalactic magnetic field models (GMFs). We used Monte Carlo simulations for\nUHECRs detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory and AGASA in order to determine\ntheir outside-the-Galaxy arrival directions, and compared these with Galactic\nand extragalactic sources. The simulations, which used UHECR compositions from\nprotons to Iron and seven models of the ordered GMF, include uncertainties in\nthe GMF and a turbulent magnetic field. The correlation between UHECRs and\nnearby extended radiogalaxies (Nagar & Matulich 2008) remains valid, even\nstrengthened, within several GMF models. Both the nearest radiogalaxy CenA, and\nthe nearest radio-extended BL Lac, CGCG 413-019, are likely sources of multiple\nUHECRs. The correlation appears to be linked to the presence of the extended\nradio source rather than a tracer of an underlying population. It is possible,\nbut unlikely, that all UHECRs originate in the nearby radiogalaxy CenA. For\nlight UHECRs about a third of UHECRs can be \"matched\" to nearby galaxies with\nextended radio jets.

Weak\nK, Na, and FeH features as well as strong VO absorption in the integrated-light\nJ-band spectrum indicate a young age for the system. From spatially resolved\nK-band spectra we determine spectral types of L3 and L5 for components A and B,\nrespectively. SDSS J2249+0044A is spectrally very similar to G196-3B, an L3\ncompanion to a young M2.5 field dwarf.

By comparison to G196-3B, we estimate a distance to SDSS\nJ2249+0044AB of 54 +- 16 pc and infer a projected separation of 17 +- 5 AU for\nthe binary. Comparison of the luminosities to evolutionary models at an age of\n100 Myr yields masses of 0.029 and 0.022 Msun for SDSS J2249+0044A and B,\nrespectively. Over the possible ages of the system (12-790 Myr), the mass of\nSDSS J2249+0044A could range from 0.011 to 0.070 Msun and the mass of SDSS\nJ2249+0044B could range from 0.009 to 0.065 Msun.

The radio halo spectrum of Coma is well fitted only\nin the $b{\\bar b}$ or light and intermediate mass DM models. The heating\nproduced by DM annihilation in the center of Coma is always larger than the\nintracluster gas cooling rate for an NFW DM density profile and it is\nsubstantially smaller than the cooling rate only for a cored DM density profile\nin DM model with 9 GeV. We conclude that the possibility of interpreting the\norigin of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters with DM annihilation models\nrequires a low neutralino mass and a cored DM density profile. If we then\nconsider the multimessenger constraints to the neutralino annihilation\ncross-section, it turns out that such scenario would also be excluded unless we\nintroduce a substantial boost factor due to the presence of DM substructures. \n\n"}

We populate a rich\nparameter space by obtaining independent measurements of density on different\nscales for each galaxy, avoiding the implicit assumptions involved, e.g., in\nthe construction of group catalogues. As the first application of this method,\nwe study how the bimodality in galaxy colour distribution (u-r) depends on\nmultiscale density. The u-r galaxy colour distribution is described as the sum\nof two gaussians (red and blue) with five parameters: the fraction of red\ngalaxies (f_r) and the position and width of the red and blue peaks (mu_r,\nmu_b, sigma_r and sigma_b). Galaxies mostly react to their smallest scale (<\n0.5 Mpc) environments: in denser environments red galaxies are more common\n(larger f_r), redder (larger mu_r) and with a narrower distribution (smaller\nsigma_r), while blue galaxies are redder (larger mu_b) but with a broader\ndistribution (larger sigma_b). There are residual correlations of f_r and mu_b\nwith 0.5 - 1 Mpc scale density, which imply that total or partial truncation of\nstar formation can relate to a galaxy's environment on these scales. Beyond 1\nMpc (0.5 Mpc for mu_r) there are no positive correlations with density. However\nf_r (mu_r) anti-correlates with density on >2 (1) Mpc scales at fixed density\non smaller scales. We examine these trends qualitatively in the context of the\nhalo model, utilizing the properties of haloes within which the galaxies are\nembedded, derived by Yang et al, 2007 and applied to a group catalogue.

In this paper we extend this study with the goal of finding the\noptimal mass-dependent halo weighting and use $N$-body simulations to perform a\ngeneral analysis of halo stochasticity and its dependence on halo mass.

A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature\nprofiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is that\nfour vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. In particular, two of the\nzones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small\nparticles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale\nnear and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles\ngrow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks. Older discs prefer to\ncapture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time,\na phenomenon we term \"vortex aging\".

We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

In addition, we are able\nto determine the large-scale bias and the mean M_h more accurately. We explore\nthe behavior of three simple HOD models. Our first model (Model A) is a\ntruncated power-law HOD model in which all AGNs are satellites. With this\nmodel, we find an upper limit to the slope (\\alpha) of the AGN HOD that is far\nbelow unity. The other two models have a central component, which has a step\nfunction form, where the HOD is constant above a minimum mass, without (Model\nB) or with (Model C) an upper mass cutoff, in addition to the truncated\npower-law satellite component, similar to the HOD that is found for galaxies.\nIn these two models we find the upper limits of \\alpha < 0.95 and \\alpha < 0.84\nfor Model B and C respectively. Our analysis suggests that the satellite AGN\noccupation increases slower than, or may even decrease with, M_h, in contrast\nto the satellite's HODs of luminosity-threshold samples of galaxies, which, in\ncontrast, grow approximately as \\propto M_h^\\alpha with \\alpha\\approx 1.

It is strictly valid only in the weak-field and\nslow-motion approximation. For the first time, we apply GW extraction methods\nin core collapse that are fully curvature-based and valid for strongly\nradiating and highly relativistic sources. We employ three extraction methods\ncomputing (i) the Newman-Penrose (NP) scalar Psi_4, (ii)\nRegge-Wheeler-Zerilli-Moncrief (RWZM) master functions, and (iii)\nCauchy-Characteristic Extraction (CCE) allowing for the extraction of GWs at\nfuture null infinity, where the spacetime is asymptotically flat and the GW\ncontent is unambiguously defined. The latter technique is the only one not\nsuffering from residual gauge and finite-radius effects. All curvature-based\nmethods suffer from strong non-linear drifts. We employ the fixed-frequency\nintegration technique as a high-pass waveform filter. Using the CCE results as\na benchmark, we find that finite-radius NP extraction yields results that agree\nnearly perfectly in phase, but differ in amplitude by ~1-7% at core bounce,\ndepending on the model.

We find the\noptical/IR time variability properties of these blazars to be remarkably\nsimilar to those at the gamma-ray energies. The power spectral density (PSD)\nfunctions of the R-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple\npower-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude\nvariability on longer timescales. No clear break is identified in the PSD of\nany of the sources. The average slope of the PSD of R-band variability of these\nblazars is similar to what was found by the Fermi team for the gamma-ray\nvariability of a larger sample of bright blazars. This is consistent with\nleptonic models where the optical-IR and gamma-ray emission is generated by the\nsame population of electrons through synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes,\nrespectively.

However, until now there has been no\nastrophysical motivation for considering a source highly enriched in heavy\nelements. Here we demonstrate that the outflows from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)\nmay indeed be composed primarily of nuclei with masses A ~ 40-200, which are\nsynthesized as hot material expands away from the central engine. In\nparticular, if the jet is magnetically-dominated (rather than a\nthermally-driven fireball) its low entropy enables heavy elements to form\nefficiently. Adopting the millisecond proto-magnetar model for the GRB central\nengine, we show that heavy nuclei are both synthesized in proto-magnetar winds\nand can in principle be accelerated to energies >1e20 eV in the shocks or\nregions of magnetic reconnection that are responsible for powering the GRB.\nSimilar results may apply to accretion-powered GRB models if the jet originates\nfrom a magnetized disk wind.

The present properties of the star imply that the star maintained a\nsubstantial envelope mass of 0.3Mo, raising the question of how the planet\nsurvived the common envelope before the envelope itself was lost? If such a\nplanet enters the envelope of an RGB star, it is expected to spiral-in to the\nvery inner region within <100yr, and be evaporated or destructed by the core.\nWe speculate that the planet was engulfed by the star as a result of the core\nhelium flash that caused this metal poor star to swell by a factor of ~3-4.

If the magnetic\nflux threading the cores is dragged into the stars, the stellar field would be\norders of magnitude stronger than observed. This well-known \"magnetic flux\nproblem\" demands that most of the core magnetic flux be decoupled from the\nmatter that enters the star. We carry out the first exploration of what happens\nto the decoupled magnetic flux in 3D, using an MHD version of the ENZO adaptive\nmesh refinement code. The field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sink\nparticle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phase\nof star formation. We find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near the\naccreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. The high pressure is\nreleased anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. It drives a\nlow-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled.\nThis decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3D MHD\nsimulations of star formation. It generates a strong asymmetry in the\nprotostellar accretion flow, potentially giving a kick to the star. In the\npresence of an initial core rotation, the structure presents an obstacle to the\nformation of a rotationally supported disk, in addition to magnetic braking, by\nacting as a rigid magnetic wall that prevents the rotating gas from completing\na full orbit around the central object.

It constructs a HEALPix sphere at any\ndesired location and accumulates the column density by walking the tree and by\nadding up the contributions from all tree nodes whose line of sight contributes\nto the pixel under consideration. In particular when combined with widely-used\ntree-based gravity solvers the new scheme requires little additional\ncomputational cost. In a simulation with $N$ resolution elements, the\ncomputational cost of TreeCol scales as $N \\log N$, instead of the $N^{5/3}$\nscaling of most other radiative transfer schemes. TreeCol is naturally\nadaptable to arbitrary density distributions and is easy to implement and to\nparallelize. We discuss its accuracy and performance characteristics for the\nexamples of a spherical protostellar core and for the turbulent interstellar\nmedium. We find that the column density estimates provided by TreeCol are on\naverage accurate to better than 10 percent. In another application, we compute\nthe dust temperatures for solar neighborhood conditions and compare with the\nresult of a full-fledged Monte Carlo radiation-transfer calculation. We find\nthat both methods give very similar answers. We conclude that TreeCol provides\na fast, easy to use, and sufficiently accurate method of calculating column\ndensities that comes with little additional computational cost when combined\nwith an existing tree-based gravity solver. \n\n"}

We estimate\nthe biases in the cosmological parameter constraints from weak lensing and\nderive requirements on the spectroscopic follow-up for three different photo-z\nalgorithms chosen to broadly span the range of algorithms available. We find\nthat sample variance is much more relevant for the photo-z error calibration\nthan for photo-z training, implying that follow-up requirements are similar for\ndifferent algorithms. We demonstrate that the spectroscopic sample can be used\nfor training of photo-zs and error calibration without incurring additional\nbias in the cosmological parameters. We provide a guide for observing proposals\nfor the spectroscopic follow-up to ensure that redshift calibration biases do\nnot dominate the cosmological parameter error budget. For example, assuming\noptimistically (pessimistically) that the weak lensing shear measurements from\nthe Dark Energy Survey could obtain 1-sigma constraints on the dark energy\nequation of state w of 0.035 (0.055), implies a follow-up requirement of 150\n(40) patches of sky with a telescope such as Magellan, assuming a 1/8^2 deg\neffective field of view and 400 galaxies per patch.

The\naccretion flow thus depends on the geometry of the magnetic field. This paper\nextends previous work by constructing a collection of orthogonal coordinate\nsystems, including the corresponding differential operators, where one\ncoordinate traces the magnetic field lines. This formalism allows for an\n(essentially) analytic description of the geometry and the conditions required\nfor the flow to pass through sonic points. Using this approach, we revisit the\nproblem of magnetically controlled accretion flow in a dipole geometry, and\nthen generalize the treatment to consider magnetic fields with multiple\ncomponents, including dipole, octupole, and split monopole contributions. This\napproach can be generalized further to consider more complex magnetic field\nconfigurations. Observations indicate that accreting young stars have\nsubstantial dipole and octupole components, and that accretion flow is\ntransonic. If the effective equation of state for the fluid is too stiff, the\nflow cannot pass smoothly through the sonic points in steady state. For a\nmultipole field of order \\ell, we derive a constraint on the polytropic index,\nn>\\ell+3/2, required for steady transonic flow to reach free-fall velocities.\nFor octupole fields, inferred on surfaces of T Tauri stars, n>9/2, so that the\nflow must be close to isothermal. The inclusion of octupole field components\nproduces higher densities at the stellar surface and smaller hot spots, which\noccur at higher latitudes; the magnetic truncation radius is also modified.\nThis contribution thus increases our understanding of magnetically controlled\naccretion for young stellar objects and can be applied to a variety of\nadditional astrophysical problems. \n\n"}

GROND provided\nexcellent photometric data in six filter bands covering a wavelength range from\napprox. 350 to 1800 nm, significantly expanding the pre-existing data set for\nthis event. Combining GROND and Swift data, the early broad-band SED is\nmodelled with a blackbody and afterglow component attenuated by dust and gas\nabsorption.

However, current parametrized mass models can often only reproduce\nthe observed positions to within one or a few arcsec which is worse than the\npositional measurement uncertainty. One suggested explanation for this\ndiscrepancy is the additional perturbations of the path of the light ray caused\nby matter density fluctuations along the line of sight. We investigate this by\ncalculating the statistical expectation value for the angular deflections\ncaused by density fluctuations, which can be done given the matter power\nspectrum. We find that density fluctuations can, indeed, produce deflections of\na few arcsec. We also find that the deflection angle of a particular image is\nexpected to increase with source redshift and with the angular distance on the\nsky to the lens. Since the light rays of neighbouring images pass through much\nthe same density fluctuations, it turns out that the images' expected\ndeflection angles can be highly correlated. This implies that line-of-sight\ndensity fluctuations are a significant and possibly dominant systematic for\nstrong lensing mass modeling and set a lower limit to how well a cluster mass\nmodel can be expected to replicate the observed image positions.

Highly excited H2O emission in spatially unresolved\nSpitzer/IRS spectra of a low-mass Class 0 object, NGC 1333 IRAS 4B, has\npreviously been attributed to the envelope-disk accretion shock but could\ninstead be produced in an outflow. As part of the survey of low-mass sources in\nthe Water in Star Forming Regions with Herschel (WISH-LM) program, we used\nHerschel/PACS to obtain a far-IR spectrum and several Nyquist-sampled spectral\nimages with to determine the origin of excited H2O emission from NGC 1333 IRAS\n4B. The spectrum has high signal-to-noise in a rich forest of H2O, CO, and OH\nlines, providing a near-complete census of far-IR molecular emission from a\nClass 0 protostar. The excitation diagrams for the three molecules all require\nfits with two excitation temperatures, indicating the presence of two physical\ncomponents. The highly excited component of H2O emission is characterized by\nsubthermal excitation of 1500 K gas with a density of 10^5 - 10^7 cm-3,\nconditions that also reproduce the mid-IR H2O emission detected by Spitzer. On\nthe other hand, a high density, low temperature gas can reproduce the H2O\nspectrum observed by Spitzer but underpredicts the H2O lines seen by Herschel.\nNyquist-sampled spectral maps of several lines show two spatial components of\nH2O emission, one centered at 1200 AU south of the central source at the\nposition of the blueshifted outflow lobe and a second centered on-source. Both\nspatial components of the far-IR H2O emission are consistent with emission from\nthe outflow.

Multiple\nbinary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these old\nstellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. In the first\npaper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsing\nbinaries in the old open cluster NGC6791 sets tighter constraints on the\nproperties of stellar models than has previously been possible, thereby\npotentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. Here\nwe add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison to\ndetermine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employing\nas many observational constraints as possible. We improve our photometry and\ncorrect empirically for differential reddening effects. We then perform an\nextensive comparison of the CMDs and eclipsing binary measurements to Victoria\nand DSEP isochrones to estimate cluster parameters. We also reanalyse a\nspectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [Fe/H] constraints. We find a best\nestimate of the age of ~8.3 Gyr while demonstrating that remaining age\nuncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the CNO abundances.

While the redshift\nof the absorption can in general not be constrained from current X-ray\nobservations, it has been assumed that the absorption is due to metals in the\nhost galaxy of the GRB. The large sample of X-ray afterglows and redshifts now\navailable allows the construction of statistically meaningful distributions of\nthe metal column densities. We construct such a sample and show, as found in\nprevious studies, that the typical absorbing column density (N_HX) increases\nsubstantially with redshift, with few high column density objects found at low\nto moderate redshifts. We show, however, that when highly extinguished bursts\nare included in the sample, using redshifts from their host galaxies, high\ncolumn density sources are also found at low to moderate redshift. We infer\nfrom individual objects in the sample and from observations of blazars, that\nthe increase in column density with redshift is unlikely to be related to\nmetals in the intergalactic medium or intervening absorbers. Instead we show\nthat the origin of the apparent increase with redshift is primarily due to dust\nextinction bias: GRBs with high X-ray absorption column densities found at\n$z\\lesssim4$ typically have very high dust extinction column densities, while\nthose found at the highest redshifts do not.

Here we present the first observations made with\nthe new Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) of M87 at frequencies down to 20 MHz.\nImages of M87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before at\nthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. To disentangle different\nsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age and\nenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of M87 extended\nradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. We do not find\nany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears well\nconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. A continuous\ninjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, and\nprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativistic\nparticles from the active galactic nuclei. We suggest that the discrepancy\nbetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the halo\nimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves the\ncore area.

III. 47 Tuc and M 5 Abstract: To check the impact of the multiple population scenario for globular clusters\non their HB, we present an analysis of the composition of 110 red HB (RHB)\nstars in 47 Tucanae and of 61 blue HB (BHB) and 30 RHB stars in M5. In 47 Tuc\nwe found tight relations between the colours of the stars and their abundances\nof p-capture elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content -\nwhich is expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture\nelements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age) that\ndetermines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He abundance must be\nsmall (Delta Y<0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our observations; this agrees with\nprevious analyses. There is possibly a correlation between the abundances of p-\nand n-capture elements in 47 Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that AGB\nstars of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation\nstars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which does not\ninclude stars warmer than 11000 K and RR Lyrae variables) is important to\nunderstand our results for M5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB\nstars are Na-poor and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population.\nThere is a clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour\nalong the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low\nvalue of Y=0.22\\pm 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a putative\nHe-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11000 K, and would\naccordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However, we need some\nadditional source of scatter in the total mass loss of stars climbing up the\nRGB to reproduce our results for M5. Finally, we found a C-star on the HB of 47\nTuc and a Ba-rich, fast-rotating, likely binary star on the HB of M5. These\nstars are among the brightest and coolest HB stars. \n\n"}

We find that the latter model fits the\nintegrated burst spectrum significantly better than the former, and that their\nrespective spectral parameters are dramatically different: when fit with a Band\nfunction only, the Epeak of the event is unusually soft for a short GRB, while\nadding a thermal component leads to more typical short GRB values. Our\ntime-resolved spectral analysis produces similar results. We argue here that\nthe two-component model is the preferred interpretation for GRB 120323A, based\non: (i) the values and evolution of the Band function parameters of the two\ncomponent scenario, which are more typical for a short GRB, and (ii) the\nappearance in the data of a significant hardness-intensity correlation,\ncommonly found in GRBs, when we employee two-component model fits; the\ncorrelation is non-existent in the Band-only fits.

Only\nthree confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters\n(GCs) of any galaxy so far, of which one nova and two SSSs (including the nova)\nwere found in M 31 GCs.

An\nautomated spectral analysis of data on 2,403 giant stars in twelve fields in\nthe bulge obtained during APOGEE commissioning yielded five stars with low\nmetallicity([Fe/H]$\\le-1.7$), including two that are very metal-poor\n[Fe/H]$\\sim-2.1$ by bulge standards.\n  Luminosity-based distance estimates place the five stars within the outer\nbulge, where other 1,246 of the analyzed stars may reside.

Though very popular and robust, this conjecture still needs a\nconclusive proof. The strongest support to this idea is probably the fact that\nsupernova remnants are observed in gamma-rays, which are indeed expected as the\nresult of the hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays accelerated at the\nshock and the ambient gas. However, also leptonic processes can, in most cases,\nexplain the observed gamma-ray emission. This implies that the detections in\ngamma rays do not necessarily mean that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic\nray protons. To overcome this degeneracy, the multi-wavelength emission (from\nradio to gamma rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and in\na few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one of\nthe two processes (hadronic or leptonic). Here we adopt a different approach\nand, instead of a case-by-case study we aim for a population study and we\ncompute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in TeV\ngamma rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeed\nare the sources of cosmic rays. The predictions found here match well with\ncurrent observational results, thus providing a novel consistency check for the\nsupernova remnant paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Moreover,\nhints are presented for the fact that particle spectra significantly steeper\nthan E^-2 are produced at supernova remnants. Finally, we expect that several\nof the supernova remnants detected by H.E.S.S. in the survey of the galactic\nplane should exhibit a gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic processes (i.e.\nneutral pion decay). The fraction of the detected remnants for which the\nleptonic emission dominates over the hadronic one depends on the assumed values\nof the physical parameters and can be as high as roughly a half. \n\n"}

In order to explain the bursts exceptional longevity, a low metallicity\nblue supergiant progenitor has been invoked. In this work, we further\ninvestigate this peculiar burst by performing a multi-band temporal and\nspectral analysis of both the prompt and the afterglow emission. We use\nproprietary and publicly available data from Swift, Konus Wind, XMM-Newton,\nTAROT as well as from other ground based optical and radio telescopes. We find\nsome peculiar properties that are possibly connected to the exceptional nature\nof this burst, namely: i) an unprecedented large optical delay of 410+/-50 s is\nmeasured between the peak epochs of a marked flare observed also in gamma-rays\nafter about 2 ks from the first Swift/BAT trigger; ii) if the optical and\nX-ray/gamma-ray photons during the prompt emission share a common origin, as\nsuggested by their similar temporal behavior, a certain amount of dust in the\ncircumburst environment should be introduced, with rest frame visual dust\nextinction of AV=0.3-1.5 mag; iii) at the end of the X-ray \"steep decay phase\"\nand before the start of the X-ray afterglow, we detect the presence of a hard\nspectral extra power law component never revealed so far. On the contrary, the\noptical afterglow since the end of the prompt emission shows more common\nproperties, with a flux power law decay with index alpha=1.6+/-0.1 and a late\nre-brightening feature at 1.1 day.

This reflects a more centrally concentrated\npopulation of massive stars in IR-bright galaxies. Furthermore, this\ncentralisation is dominated by a central excess of type Ibc/IIb SNe. This may\nbe due to a top-heavy initial mass function and/or an enhanced close binary\nfraction in regions of enhanced star formation. Type Ic SNe are most strongly\ncorrelated with Ha light and NUV-bright regions, reflecting the shortest\nlifetime and thus highest mass for type Ic progenitors. Previous studies with\nsamples dominated by normal spiral galaxies have indicated a lower Ibc-Ha\ncorrelation than our results do, which may be due to the central excess of type\nIbc/IIb SNe in our sample. The difference between types II and Ib is minimal,\nsuggesting that progenitor mass is not the dominant factor in determining if a\nSN is of type Ib or II. Similar differences in correlation can be seen in the\nKs-band, with type Ibc/IIb SNe tracing the Ks-band light better than type II in\nour sample. \n\n"}

A\nbasic challenge in the program to compute the GSF for orbits around a Kerr\nblack hole is that the standard procedure for reconstructing the perturbation\nis formulated in a class of radiation gauges, in which the particle singularity\nis non-isotropic and extends away from the particle's location. Here we present\ntwo practical schemes for calculating the GSF using a radiation-gauge\nreconstructed metric as input. The schemes are based on a detailed analysis of\nthe local structure of the particle singularity in the radiation gauges. We\nidentify 3 types of radiation gauges: two containing a radial string-like\nsingularity emanating from the particle, either in one direction (\"half-string\"\ngauges) or both directions (\"full-string\" gauges); and a third type containing\nno strings but with a jump discontinuity across a surface intersecting the\nparticle. Based on a flat-space example, we argue that the standard\nmode-by-mode reconstruction procedure yields the \"regular half\" of a\nhalf-string solution, or (equivalently) either of the regular halves of a\nno-string solution. For the half-string case, we formulate the GSF in a locally\ndeformed radiation gauge that removes the string singularity near the particle.\nWe derive a mode-sum formula for the GSF in this gauge, analogous to the\nstandard Lorenz-gauge formula but with modified regularization parameters. For\nthe no-string case, we formulate the GSF directly, without a local deformation,\nand we derive a mode-sum formula that requires no correction to the parameters\nbut involves a certain averaging procedure.

Due to the substantial\nangular momentum from the binary, such a remnant is born rapidly rotating and\nlikely acquires a strong magnetic field (a `millisecond magnetar'). Magnetic\nspin-down deposits a large fraction of the rotational energy from the magnetar\nbehind the small quantity of mass ejected during the merger. This has the\npotential for creating a bright transient that could be useful for determining\nwhether a NS or black hole was formed in the merger. We investigate the\nexpected signature of such an event, including for the first time the important\nimpact of electron/positron pairs injected by the millisecond magnetar into the\nsurrounding nebula. These pairs cool via synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission, producing a pair cascade and hard X-ray spectrum. A fraction of these\nX-rays are absorbed by the ejecta walls and re-emitted as thermal radiation,\nleading to an optical/UV transient peaking at a luminosity of ~1e43-1e44 erg/s\non a timescale of several hours to days. This is dimmer than predicted by\nsimpler analytic models because the large optical depth of electron/positron\npairs across the nebula suppresses the efficiency with which the magnetar spin\ndown luminosity is thermalized. Nevertheless, the optical/UV emission is more\nthan two orders of magnitude brighter than a radioactively powered `kilonova.'\nIn some cases nebular X-rays are sufficiently luminous to re-ionize the ejecta,\nin which case non-thermal X-rays escape the ejecta unattenuated with a similar\npeak luminosity and timescale as the optical radiation.

However, no\nco-orbital systems have been found within the thousands of Kepler planets and\ncandidates. Here we study the orbital evolution of co-orbital planets embedded\nin a protoplanetary disk using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. We show that\npairs of similar-mass planets in co-orbital resonance are disrupted during\nlarge-scale orbital migration. Destabilization occurs when one or both planets\nis near the critical mass needed to open a gap in the gaseous disk. A confined\ngap is opened that spans the 60 degree azimuthal separation between planets.\nThis alters the torques imparted by the disk on each planet -- pushing the\nleading planet outward and the trailing planet inward -- and disrupts the\nresonance. The mechanism applies to systems in which the two planets' masses\ndiffer by a factor of two or less.

Soon\nafter these stars are formed, the other halo reaches the cooling threshold and\ndue to its small distance from the newly formed galaxy, is exposed to the\ncritical LW intensity required to form a DCBH. The main advantage of this\nscenario is that synchronization can potentially prevent photoevaporation and\nmetal pollution in DCBH-forming halos.

We find that, depending on\nthe ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in\nGR.

Field\nline helicity offers further advantages because it preserves all topological\ninformation and can distinguish between different magnetic fields with the same\ntotal helicity. Magnetic reconnection changes field connectivity and field line\nhelicity reflects these changes; the goal of this paper is to characterize that\nevolution.

The main result, which we support\nusing kinematic examples, is that during localized reconnection in a complex\nmagnetic field, the evolution of field line helicity is dominated by a\nwork-like term that is evaluated at the field line endpoints, namely the scalar\nproduct of the generalized field line velocity and the vector potential.\nFurthermore, the flux integral of this term over certain areas is very small\ncompared to the integral of the unsigned quantity, which indicates that changes\nof field line helicity happen in a well-organized pairwise manner.

Here we consider the prospect of power suppression in the\ncontext of the multifield landscape. Based on the assumption that our\nobservable universe emerges from a tunnelling event and that the relevant\nfeatures originate purely from inflationary dynamics, we find that the power\nspectrum not only contains information on single-field dynamics, but also\nplaces strong con- straints on all scalar fields present in the theory. We find\nthat the simplest single-field models giving rise to power suppression do not\ngeneralise to multifield models in a straightforward way, as the resulting\nsuperhorizon evolution of the curvature perturbation tends to erase any power\nsuppression present at horizon crossing. On the other hand, multifield effects\ndo present a means of generating power suppression which to our knowledge has\nso far not been considered.

Our measured values of the circumburst density, jet opening angle, and\nbeaming corrected kinetic energy are consistent with the distribution of these\nparameters for long-duration GRBs at both z~1 and z>6, suggesting that the jet\nlaunching mechanism and environment of these events are similar to that of GRBs\nthat do not have bumps in their light curves.

Observational evidence provides\nsupport to the idea that SGRBs originate from the merger of compact binaries,\nconsisting of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH).\nTheoretical models and numerical simulations seem to converge to an explanation\nin which the central engine of SGRBs is given by a spinning BH surrounded by a\nhot accretion torus. Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these\nafterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the\n$\\sim\\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,\nsuggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation. Yet, if the\nmerger results in a massive NS the conditions to generate a relativistic jet\nand thus the prompt SGRB emission are hardly met.

However, several GRB host galaxies have\nrecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (H2), believed to be the\nfuel of star formation. Moreover, optical spectroscopy of GRB afterglows\nimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gas\nalong the GRB line-of-sight. Here we report the first ever 21 cm line\nobservations of GRB host galaxies, using the Australia Telescope Compact Array,\nimplying high levels of atomic hydrogen (HI), which suggests that the\nconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previously\nthought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas\n(or with very efficient HI-to-H2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of molecular\ngas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. This can happen in low\nmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas\n(necessary for star formation) is faster than the HI-to-H2 conversion. Indeed,\nlarge atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellar\nand dust masses are consistent with GRB hosts being preferentially galaxies\nwhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accreting\nmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. This provides a natural route for\nforming GRBs in low-metallicity environments.

However, recent theoretical progress has been hampered by the\nfact that the timescales of interest for the afterglow emission are\ninaccessible to numerical relativity simulations. Here we present a detailed\nmodel to bridge the gap between numerical simulations of the merger process and\nthe relevant timescales for the afterglows, assuming that the merger results in\na long-lived NS. This model is formulated in terms of a set of coupled\ndifferential equations that follow the evolution of the post-merger system and\npredict its electromagnetic (EM) emission in a self-consistent way, starting\nfrom initial data that can be extracted from BNS merger simulations and taking\ninto account the most relevant radiative processes.

The abundances of heavy elements are similar in the two stars but\nlithium is much more depleted in 16 Cyg B that in 16 Cyg A, by a factor of at\nleast 4.7. The interest of studying the 16 Cyg system is that the two star have\nthe same age and the same initial composition. The presently observed\ndifferences must be due to their different evolution, related to the fact that\none of them hosts a planet contrary to the other one. We computed models of the\ntwo stars which precisely fit the observed seismic frequencies. We used the\nToulouse Geneva Evolution Code (TGEC) that includes complete atomic diffusion\n(including radiative accelerations). We compared the predicted surface\nabundances with the spectroscopic observations and confirmed that another\nmixing process is needed. We then included the effect of accretion-induced\nfingering convection. The accretion of planetary matter does not change the\nmetal abundances but leads to lithium destruction which depends on the accreted\nmass. A fraction of earth mass is enough to explain the lithium surface\nabundances of 16 Cyg B. We also checked the beryllium abundances. In the case\nof accretion of heavy matter onto stellar surfaces, the accreted heavy elements\ndo not remain in the outer convective zones but they are mixed downwards by\nfingering convection induced by the unstable $\\mu$-gradient.

We build upon the cosmic rays model scheme of Grenfell et\nal.

Previous studies suggested\nthat planets in the habitable zone that are subject to strong flaring\nconditions have high atmospheric methane concentrations, while their ozone\nbiosignature is completely destroyed. Our current study shows, however, that\nadding cosmic ray induced HOx production can cause a decrease in atmospheric\nmethane abundance of up to 80\\%. Furthermore, the cosmic ray induced HOx\nmolecules react with NOx to produce HNO$_3$, which produces strong HNO$_3$\nsignals in the theoretical spectra and reduces NOx-induced catalytic\ndestruction of ozone so that more than 25\\% of the ozone column remains. Hence,\nan ozone signal remains visible in the theoretical spectrum (albeit with a\nweaker intensity) when incorporating the new cosmic ray induced NOx and HOx\nschemes, even for a constantly flaring M-star case.

Altogether, these results support the idea that\nthe equation of state of nuclear matter can be constrained tightly when a\nsignal in gravitational waves from binary neutron stars is detected. \n\n"}

The classical \"planetesimal\" accretion scenario for the formation of\nplanets has recently evolved with the idea that \"pebbles\", centimeter- to\nmeter-sized icy grains migrating in protoplanetary disks, can control\nplanetesimal and/or planetary growth.\n  Aims. We investigate how pebble accretion depends on disk properties and\naffects the formation of planetary systems\n  Methods. We construct analytical models of pebble accretion onto planetary\nembryos that consistently account for the mass and orbital evolution of the\npebble flow and reflect disk structure.\n  Results. We derive simple formulas for pebble accretion rates in the\nso-called \"settling\" regime for planetary embryos with more than 100 km in\nsize. For relatively smaller embryos or in outer disk regions, the accretion\nmode is 3D, meaning that the thickness of the pebble flow must be taken into\naccount, and resulting in an accretion rate that is independent of the embryo\nmass. For larger embryos or in inner regions, the accretion is in a 2D mode,\ni.e., the pebble disk may be considered to be infinitely thin. We show that the\nradial dependence of the pebble accretion rata is different (even the sign of\nthe power-law exponent changes) for different disk conditions such as the disk\nheating source (viscous heating or stellar irradiation), the drag law (Stokes\nor Epstein, and weak or strong coupling), and in the 2D or 3D accretion modes.\nWe also discuss the effect of the sublimation/destruction of icy pebbles inside\nthe snow line.\n  Conclusions. Pebble accretion easily produces a large diversity of planetary\nsystems. In other words, to correctly infer the results of planet formation\nthrough pebble accretion, detailed prescriptions of disk evolution and pebble\ngrowth, sublimation/destruction and migration are required. \n\n"}

In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes. \n\n"}

The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of the\ndifferent methods used to deal with stellar signals to recover extremely\nlow-mass planets despite. However, because observed RV variations at the m/s\nprecision level or below is a combination of signals induced by unresolved\norbiting planets, by the star, and by the instrument, performing such a\ncomparison using real data is extremely challenging. To circumvent this\nproblem, we generated simulated RV measurements including realistic stellar and\nplanetary signals. Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV\nmeasurements, using their own method to recover planetary signals despite\nstellar RV signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams\nwith the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,\nit is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different methods.\nThe most efficient methods to recover planetary signals {take into account the\ndifferent activity indicators,} use red-noise models to account for stellar RV\nsignals and a Bayesian framework to provide model comparison in a robust\nstatistical approach. Using the most efficient methodology, planets can be\nfound down to K/N= K_pl/RV_rms*sqrt{N_obs}=5 with a threshold of K/N=7.5 at the\nlevel of 80-90% recovery rate found for a number of methods. These recovery\nrates drop dramatically for K/N smaller than this threshold. In addition, for\nthe best teams, no false positives with K/N > 7.5 were detected, while a\nnon-negligible fraction of them appear for smaller K/N. A limit of K/N = 7.5\nseems therefore a safe threshold to attest the veracity of planetary signals\nfor RV measurements with similar properties to those of the different RV\nfitting challenge systems. \n\n"}

For young pulsars the\nlong-term trends are generally obscured by short term phenomena such as timing\nnoise and the recoveries form large glitches. Here we present a new method to\novercome the latter and report on braking index measurements for the Vela-like\npulsars PSR B1800-21 and PSR B1823-13, an updated measurement for Vela and new\nestimates for four more glitching pulsars observed at Jodrell Bank Observatory.\nThe values of braking indices describe the long-term evolution of the pulsars\nacross the P-P' diagram. Despite some measurements being affected by\nconsiderable uncertainties, there is evidence for a common trend involving low\nbraking indices (n<=2) among young glitching pulsars. Such values introduce a\nnew variant in the evolution of young pulsars and their relationship with other\npopulations in the P-P' diagram. Low braking indices also imply that these\npulsars could be a few times older than their characteristic ages. We consider\nPSR B1757-24 and conclude that the pulsar could be old enough to be related to\nthe supernova remnant G5.4-1.2. Between glitches, the short-term evolution of\nVela-like pulsars is characterised by large inter-glitch braking indices n_ig >\n10.

We aim\nto quantify the importance of a treatment of the ionisation fraction in\nturbulent magnetised media and investigate the effect of turbulence on shaping\nthe clouds and filaments before star formation sets in.

We compare the resulting density and mass-to-flux ratio structures both\nqualitatively and quantitatively via filament and core masses and filament\nfitting techniques (Gaussian and Plummer profiles.) We find that even with\nalmost no turbulence, filamentary structure still exists. Comparison of\nsimulations show that for turbulent Mach numbers above 2, there is little\nstructural difference between the Step-Like (SL) and Cosmic Ray only (CR-only)\nionisation models, while below this threshold the ionisation structure\nsignificantly affects the formation of filaments.

In particular, BBHs formed in\ndense nuclear star clusters or via compact accretion disks around a nuclear\nsupermassive black hole in active galactic nuclei would suffer strong\nacceleration, and produce large phase drifts measurable by LISA.

With a CRHWP, single detectors can measure\nthree of the Stokes parameters, $I$, $Q$ and $U$, thereby avoiding the set of\nsystematic errors that can be introduced by mismatches in the properties of\northogonal detector pairs. We focus on the implementation of CRHWPs in large\naperture telescopes (i.e. the primary mirror is larger than the current maximum\nhalf-wave plate diameter of $\\sim$0.5 m), where the CRHWP can be placed between\nthe primary mirror and focal plane. In this configuration, one needs to address\nthe intensity to polarization ($I{\\rightarrow}P$) leakage of the optics, which\nbecomes a source of 1/f noise and also causes differential gain systematics\nthat arise from CMB temperature fluctuations. In this paper, we present the\nperformance of a CRHWP installed in the POLARBEAR experiment, which employs a\nGregorian telescope with a 2.5 m primary illumination pattern. The CRHWP is\nplaced near the prime focus between the primary and secondary mirrors. We find\nthat the $I{\\rightarrow}P$ leakage is larger than the expectation from the\nphysical properties of our primary mirror, resulting in a 1/f knee of 100 mHz.\nThe excess leakage could be due to imperfections in the detector system, i.e.\ndetector non-linearity in the responsivity and time-constant. We demonstrate,\nhowever, that by subtracting the leakage correlated with the intensity signal,\nthe 1/f noise knee frequency is reduced to 32 mHz ($\\ell \\sim$39 for our scan\nstrategy), which is very promising to probe the primordial B-mode signal. We\nalso discuss methods for further noise subtraction in future projects where the\nprecise temperature control of instrumental components and the leakage\nreduction will play a key role. \n\n"}

At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off.

We want to address the question whether GRB 111209A was a\nspecial event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical\nGRB or another kind of high-energy transient.

We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with\nthe GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope\non-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by\nmulti-band modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws,\nand we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the\nspectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large\nensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another\nultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of\nthe host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8\ndays after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this,\nthe light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9\ndays after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be\nexceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic\nrebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and\nare not unique.

While the\nfiducial four-band ugri setup gives a photo-z bias $\\delta z=-2e-4$ and scatter\n$\\sigma_z<0.022$ at mean z = 0.23, combining magnitudes, colours, and galaxy\nsizes reduces the scatter by ~7% and the bias by an order of magnitude. Once\nthe ugri and IR magnitudes are joined into 12-band photometry spanning up to 12\n$\\mu$, the scatter decreases by more than 10% over the fiducial case. Finally,\nusing the 12 bands together with optical colours and linear sizes gives $\\delta\nz<4e-5$ and $\\sigma_z<0.019$.\n  This paper also serves as a reference for two public photo-z catalogues\naccompanying KiDS DR3, both obtained using the ANNz2 code.

The regime of greatest uncertainty is\nin the most actively star-forming galaxies, where large dust columns can\npotentially produce a dust-reprocessed infrared radiation field with enough\npressure to drive turbulence or eject material. Here we derive the conditions\nunder which a self-gravitating, mixed gas-star disc can remain hydrostatic\ndespite trapped radiation pressure. Consistently taking into account the\nself-gravity of the medium, the star- and dust-to-gas ratios, and the effects\nof turbulent motions not driven by radiation, we show that galaxies can achieve\na maximum Eddington-limited star formation rate per unit area\n$\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\rm *,crit} \\sim 10^3 M_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$,\ncorresponding to a critical flux of $F_{\\rm *,crit} \\sim 10^{13} L_{\\odot}$\nkpc$^{-2}$ similar to previous estimates; higher fluxes eject mass in bulk,\nhalting further star formation.

Because the vast majority of star-forming galaxies lie below the\nmaximum limit for typical dust-to-gas ratios, we conclude that infrared\nradiation pressure is likely unimportant for all but the most extreme systems\non galaxy-wide scales. Thus, while radiation pressure does not explain the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation, it does impose an upper truncation on it. Our\npredicted truncation is in good agreement with the highest observed gas and\nstar formation rate surface densities found both locally and at high redshift. \n\n"}

Exploiting more than $10^9$ equilibrium models for each\nclass of EOSs, we produce distribution functions of all the stellar properties\nand determine, among other quantities, the radius that is statistically most\nprobable for any value of the stellar mass.

To study the Li\ndesert, we measured the atmospheric parameters and Li abundance of 227 late-F\ndwarfs and subgiants, chosen to be in the T_eff range of the desert and without\nprevious Li abundance measurements. Subsequently, we complemented those with\nliterature data to obtain a homogeneous catalog of 2318 stars, for which we\ncompute masses and ages. We characterize stars surrounding the region of the Li\ndesert. We conclude that stars with low Li abundances below the desert are more\nmassive and more evolved than stars above the desert. Given the unexpected\npresence of low Li abundance stars in this effective temperature range, we\nconcentrate on finding their origin. We conclude that these stars with low Li\nabundance do not evolve from stars above the desert: at a given mass, stars\nwith low Li (i.e., below the desert) are more metal-poor. Instead, we suggest\nthat stars below the Li desert are consistent with having evolved from the Li\ndip, discarding the need to invoke additional mixing to explain this feature.\nThus, stars below the Li desert are not peculiar and are only distinguished\nfrom other subgiants evolved from the Li dip in that their combination of\natmospheric parameters locates them in a range of effective temperatures where\notherwise only high Li abundance stars would be found (i.e., stars above the\ndesert). \n\n"}

We have studied the orbital and spin evolution of\nbinary BHs in triple systems, where the tertiary companion excites large\neccentricity in the inner binary through Lidov-Kozai oscillations, causing the\nbinary to merge via gravitational radiation. Using the single-orbital-averaged\nand double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine\nthe merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner\nbinary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system\nparameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with\nthe perturber eccentricity $e_{\\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,\nreaching $10-20\\%$ at $e_{\\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions\nfor the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole\neffect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples. We also\nfollow the spin evolution of the BHs during the companion-induced orbital\ndecay. Starting from aligned spin axes, a wide range of final spin-orbit\nmisalignment angle $\\theta_{\\rm sl}^{\\rm f}$ can be generated when the binary\nenters the LIGO band.

The radio and X-ray afterglows of GW170817 exhibited delayed\nonset, a gradual rise in the emission with time as t^0.8, a peak at about 150\ndays post-merger, followed by a relatively rapid decline. To date, various\nmodels have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a\nchoked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However,\nthe observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817\nlaunched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817\nexhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger.\nThis measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that,\nwhile the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow\n(cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and\nnarrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of <5 degrees, and observed from\na viewing angle of about 20 degrees.

Abstract: We performed sensitive observations of the N15ND+(1-0) and 15NND+(1-0) lines\ntoward the prestellar core L1544 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The lines are\nnot detected down to 3 sigma levels in 0.2 km/s channels of around 6 mK. The\nnon-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+ of\n~700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local\nISM of ~200-300. The result indicates that N2 is depleted in 15N in the central\npart of L1544, because N2D+ preferentially traces the cold dense gas, and\nbecause it is a daughter molecule of N2. In-situ chemistry is unlikely\nresponsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase\nchemistry nor isotope selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N\ndepletion; the former prefers transferring 15N to N2, while the latter requires\nthe penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center. The most\nlikely explanation is that 15N is preferentially partitioned into ices compared\nto 14N via the combination of isotope selective photodissociation of N2 and\ngrain surface chemistry in the parent cloud of L1544 or in the outer regions of\nL1544 which are not fully shielded from the interstellar FUV radiation. The\nmechanism is the most efficient at the chemical transition from atomic to\nmolecular nitrogen. In other words, our result suggests that the gas in the\ncentral part of L1544 already went trough the transition from atomic to\nmolecular nitrogen in the earlier evolutionary stage, and that N2 is currently\nthe primary form of gas-phase nitrogen. \n\n"}

These exospheres are formed by surface\nparticles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar\nwind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are\ndriven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained\nby Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most\nwell constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii.

This equation provides a heuristic coarse-grained parametrization of\nthe ordinary Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation accounting for violent\nrelaxation and gravitational cooling. It involves a cubic nonlinearity taking\ninto account the self-interaction of the bosons, a logarithmic nonlinearity\nassociated with an effective temperature, and a source of dissipation. It leads\nto superfluid dark matter halos with a core-halo structure. The quantum\npotential or the self-interaction of the bosons generates a solitonic core that\nsolves the cusp problem of the cold dark matter model. The logarithmic\nnonlinearity generates an isothermal atmosphere accounting for the flat\nrotation curves of the galaxies.

Aims. The relative orientation has been\ninvestigated using different methods. Our goal is to explicitly compare two of\nthem: the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) and the gradient technique. Methods. We\nhave applied the RHT method and the gradient technique to two regions,\nidentified in surface brightness maps at 353 GHz generated via MHD simulations\npost-processed using radiative transfer modelling. For both methods we have\nderived the relative orientation between the magnetic field and the density\nstructures, to which we have applied two different statistics, the histogram of\nrelative orientation (HRO) statistic and the projected Rayleigh statistic\n(PRS). Results. The samples of pixels selected by each method are substantially\ndifferent. When the methods are applied to the same pixel selection, the\nresults in terms of relative orientation as a function of column density are\nconsistent between each other. When each method is applied to its own pixel\nselection, the differences are apparent. In Region 1, the RHT method roughly\nreproduces the observed trend of the relative orientation becoming more\nperpendicular for increasing column density, while the gradient method, applied\nat the same resolution as RHT, gives the opposite trend, with the relative\norientation moving towards a more parallel alignment.

We here investigate how such rapid accretion may occur with\nfinite amounts of heavy elements contained in the gas and dust. In our 1D\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the radiative transfer is solved for both\nthe direct UV lights emitted by an accretion disk and the diffuse IR lights\nthermally emitted by dust grains. Our results show that the radiative force by\nthe IR lights causes a strong feedback to regulate the mass accretion. The\nresulting mean accretion rate is lower with the higher metallicity, and there\nis the critical metallicity $Z \\sim 10^{-2}~Z_\\odot$, above which the\nsuper-Eddington accretion is prevented by the radiation pressure of the IR\nlights.

Recent studies suggest that the cold dark matter model\npredicts cores that are denser than those observed in galaxies, groups and\nclusters. One possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the dark matter\nhas strong interactions (SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A\ngeneralized form of the Navarro, Frenk and White profile (Zhao profile) may be\nused to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing\nstatistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple imaging is a\nvery sensitive function of the profile parameters in the range of interest for\nSIDM halos around clusters of galaxies. Less concentrated profiles, which\nresult from larger self-interaction cross-sections, can produce many fewer\nlensed pairs. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM. More\nrealistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to be done, however\nlarger self-interaction cross-sections may well be ruled out by the very\nexistence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster scales. The inclusion of centrally\ndominant cluster galaxies should boost the cross-section to multiple imaging.\nHowever our preliminary calculations suggest that the additional multiple\nimaging rate is small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate\nfor different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be\nimportant to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles since the\noptical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most concentrated members\nof a cluster population. \n\n"}

From such measurements, one can obtain distance estimates, explore\nthe dynamics of these systems and measure the mass of the Milky Way itself.

Using\nexisting HST images of fields in M31, the LMC and the Galaxy we simulate the\nbackground within the SIM FOV and estimate the errors in the measured position\nof the target star.

We then fit the model parameters to a combination of\nWMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS\nmeasurements and Lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fit\ncosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omega_b h^2=0.0224+-0.0009, Omega_m\nh^2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n_s(0.05/Mpc)=0.93+-0.03, and\nsigma_8=0.84+-0.04. WMAP's best determination of tau=0.17+-0.04 arises directly\nfrom the TE data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These\nparameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+-0.2 Gyr. The data favors\nbut does not require a slowly varying spectral index.

This method combines two physical criteria such as the tidal\nradius of a halo and the total energy of each particle to find member\nparticles. Two hierarchical meshes are used to increase the speed and the power\nof halo identification in the parallel computing environments. First, a coarse\nmesh with cell size equal to the mean particle separation $l_{\\rm mean}$ is\nused to obtain the density field over the whole simulation box. Mesh cells\nhaving density contrast higher than a local cutoff threshold $\\delta_{\\rm LOC}$\nare extracted and linked together for those adjacent to each other. This\nproduces local-cell groups. Second, a finer mesh is used to obtain density\nfield within each local-cell group and to identify halos. If a density shell\ncontains only one density peak, its particles are assigned to the density peak.\nBut in the case of a density shell surrounding at least two density peaks, we\nuse both the tidal radii of halo candidates enclosed by the shell and the total\nenergy criterion to find physically bound particles with respect to each halo.\nSimilar to DENMAX and HOP, the \\hfind method can efficiently identify small\nhalos embedded in a large halo, while the FoF and the SO do not resolve such\nsmall halos.

These events manifest themselves in form of luminous flares\npowered by accretion of debris from the disrupted star into the black hole.\n  Candidate events among optically non-active galaxies emerged in the past few\nyears.

The two most promising explanations are that these 'outer edges'\neither trace the maximum angular momentum during the galaxy formation epoch, or\nare associated with global star formation thresholds.

A\nkey characteristic of this statistical energization mechanism is the absence of\na momentum scale; astrophysical systems generally only impose scales at the\ninjection (low energy) and loss (high energy) ends of the particle spectrum.\nThe existence of structure in the cosmic ray spectrum (the \"knee\") at around\n3000 TeV has promoted contentions that there are at least two origins for\ncosmic rays, a galactic one supplying those up to the knee, and even beyond,\nand perhaps an extragalactic one that can explain even the ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays (UHECRs) seen at 1-300 EeV. Accounting for the UHECRs with familiar\nastrophysical sites of acceleration has historically proven difficult due to\nthe need to assume high magnetic fields in order to reduce the shortest\ndiffusive acceleration timescale, the ion gyroperiod, to meaningful values. Yet\nactive galaxies and gamma-ray bursts remain strong and interesting candidate\nsources for UHECRs, turning the theoretical focus to relativistic shocks. This\nreview summarizes properties of diffusive shock acceleration that are salient\nto the issue of UHECR generation.

Since these simulations are unable to resolve regions\nvery near the halo center, the extrapolation of the fitting formula leads to a\nspherically averaged \"universal'' density profile that diverges at the origin.\nWe remove this inconvenient feature by replacing a small central region of the\nNFW halo with an interior Schwarzschild solution with constant density,\ncontinuously matched to the remaining NFW spacetime. A model of a single halo,\nas an isolated object with finite mass, follows by smoothly matching the NFW\nspacetime to a Schwarzschild vacuum exterior along the virial radius, the\nphysical \"cut-off'' customarily imposed, as the mass associated with NFW\nprofiles diverges asymptotically. Numerical simulations assume weakly\ninteracting collisionless particles, hence we suggest that NFW halos\napproximately satisfy an \"ideal gas'' type of equation of state, where\nmass-density is the dominant rest--mass contribution to matter--energy, with\nthe internal energy contribution associated with an anisotropic kinetic\npressure. We show that, outside the central core, this pressure and the mass\ndensity roughly satisfy a polytropic relation.

Our analysis shows that the 2002\noutburst of V838 Mon consisted of two major phases: pre-eruption which was\nobserved in January 2002 and a major outburst, called eruption, which started\nin the beginning of February 2002. During pre-eruption the object seemed to be\nrelaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days\nof December 2001. The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002,\nresulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last\ndays of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption.\nThe burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity\nflash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form\nof two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs.\nIn mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its\nenergy radiated away, the object entered the decline phase during which V838\nMon was evolving along the Hayashi track.

From the absolute magnitudes of the variables calculated from these\ndistances, we find that the LMC Cepheids define tight period-luminosity\nrelations in the V, I, W,\n  J and K bands which agree exceedingly well with the corresponding Galactic PL\nrelations derived from the same technique, and are significantly steeper than\nthe LMC PL relations in these bands observed by the OGLE-II Project in V, I and\nW, and by Persson et al. in J and K. We find that the tilt-corrected true\ndistance moduli of the LMC Cepheids show a significant dependence on period,\nwhich hints at a systematic error in the ISB technique related to the period of\nthe stars. We identify as the most likely culprit the p-factor which converts\nthe radial into pulsational velocities; our data imply a much steeper period\ndependence of the p-factor than previously thought, and we derive p=1.58\n(+/-0.02) -0.15 (+/-0.05) logP as the best fit from our data, with a zero point\ntied to the Milky Way open cluster Cepheids.

We\nrefer to this new type of eruption as a combination nova. In late 2000, the\nprototypical symbiotic star Z Andromedae brightened by roughly two magnitudes\nin the optical. We observed the outburst in the radio with the VLA and MERLIN,\nin the optical both photometrically and spectroscopically, in the far\nultraviolet with FUSE, and in the X-rays with both Chandra and XMM. The\ntwo-year-long event had three distinct stages. During the first stage, the\noptical rise closely resembled an earlier, small outburst that was caused by an\naccretion-disk instability. In the second stage, the hot component ejected an\noptically thick shell of material. In the third stage, the shell cleared to\nreveal a white dwarf whose luminosity remained on the order of 10^4 Lsun for\napproximately one year. The eruption was thus too energetic to have been\npowered by accretion alone. We propose that the initial burst of accretion was\nlarge enough to trigger enhanced nuclear burning on the surface of the white\ndwarf and the ejection of an optically thick shell of material. This outburst\ntherefore combined elements of both a dwarf nova and a classical nova. Our\nresults have implications for the long-standing problem of producing shell\nflashes with short recurrence times on low-mass white dwarfs in symbiotic\nstars. \n\n"}

{"id": "astro-ph/0510807", "contents": "Title: Halo properties and secular evolution in barred galaxies Abstract: The halo plays a crucial role in the evolution of barred galaxies. Its\nnear-resonant material absorbs angular momentum emitted from some of the disc\nparticles and helps the bar become stronger. As a result, a bar (oval) forms in\nthe inner parts of the halo of strongly barred disc galaxies. It is thinner in\nthe inner parts (but still considerably fatter than the disc bar) and tends to\nspherical at larger radii. Its length increases with time, while always staying\nshorter than the disc bar. It is roughly aligned with the disc bar, which it\ntrails only slightly, and it turns with roughly the same pattern speed. The\nbi-symmetric component of the halo density continues well outside the halo bar,\nwhere it clearly trails behind the disc bar. The length and strength of the\ndisc and halo bars correlate; the former being always much stronger than the\nlatter. If the halo is composed of weakly interacting massive particles, then\nthe formation of the halo bar, by redistributing the matter in the halo and\nchanging its shape, could influence the expected annihilation signal. This is\nindeed found to be the case if the halo has a core, but not if it has a steep\ncusp. The formation and evolution of the bar strongly affect the halo orbits. A\nfraction of them becomes near-resonant, similar to the disc near-resonant\norbits at the same resonance, while another fraction becomes chaotic. Finally,\na massive and responsive halo makes it harder for a central mass concentration\nto destroy the disc bar. \n\n"}

This presents a\nchallenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembled\nlate in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper,\nwe discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model in which\nfeedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows\nin massive halos. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy\nluminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the\nMillennium N-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and large\nnumber of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulation\nprovides results in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of\nthe physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of local\ngalaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and\ngalaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate the volume averaged star\nformation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in\nwhich this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model\nrobustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift\n$z\\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasing\nredshift in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these\nproperties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy\nformation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the\nfundamentally hierachical CDM model provides a very good match to these\nobservations. \n\n"}

From the analysis of current Ly$\\alpha$ forest data at $z <\n6$, we conclude that it is impossible to disentangle the two scenarios, which\nfit equally well the observed Gunn-Peterson optical depth, flux probability\ndistribution function and dark gap width distribution. At $z>6$, however, clear\ndifferences start to emerge which are best quantified by the dark gap and peak\nwidth distributions. We find that 35 (zero) per cent of the lines of sight\nwithin $5.7< z <6.3$ show dark gaps widths $>50$ Angstrom in the rest frame of\nthe QSO if reionization is not (is) complete at $z \\gtrsim 6$.

We fit these\ndata with simple analytical forms, and derive conservative bands to indicate\npossible variations from the best fits. Since the z<~1 SFH data are quite\nprecise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that\ntogether affect the SFH normalisation, to test their accuracy, both in this\nredshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalisation, we consider\nthe evolution in stellar mass density, metal mass density, and supernova rate\ndensity, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalisation is much lower than\nindicated by our direct fit. Additionally, predictions from the SFH for\nsupernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of ~3 Gyr. As\na corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalisation, we consider the\nSuper-Kamiokande (SK) limit on the electron antineutrino flux from past\ncore-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z<~1.

This is approximately half a\ncycle from the phase at which the 90 Hz QPO is detected. The 625 Hz oscillation\nwas detected in an average power spectrum from nine successive cycles beginning\napproximately 180 s after the initial hard spike. It has a width (FWHM) of 2 Hz\nand an average amplitude (rms) during this interval of 8.5 %.

Here I discuss the accretion activity\nexpected from the material that is launched into eccentric, but gravitationally\nbound orbits during a compact binary merger coalescence. From a simple\nanalytical model the time scales and accretion luminosities that result from\nfallback in the aftermath of a compact binary merger are derived. For the\nconsidered mass range, double neutron star binaries are relatively homogeneous\nin their fallback luminosities. Neutron star black hole systems show a larger\nspread in their fallback behaviour.

In general, all the fossils\nwe study show regular and symmetric X-ray emission, indicating an absence of\nrecent major group mergers. We confirm that, for a given optical luminosity of\nthe group, fossils are more X-ray luminous than non-fossil groups. Fossils,\nhowever, fall comfortably on the conventional L_X-T_X relation of galaxy groups\nand clusters, suggesting that their X-ray luminosity and their gas temperature\nare both boosted, arguably, as a result of their early formation. This is\nsupported by other scaling relations including the L_X-sigma and T_X-sigma\nrelations in which fossils show higher X-ray luminosity and temperature for a\ngiven group velocity dispersion. We find that mass concentration in fossils is\nhigher than in non-fossil groups and clusters.

Abstract: The optical afterglow of the gamma-ray burst GRB 970508 (z = 0.835) was a few\nhundred times more luminous than any supernova.

If this case is strengthened with future\nafterglows then the popular model in which GRBs are caused be merging neutron\nstars will have to be abandoned, and a model linking GRBs to cataclysmic deaths\nof massive stars will be favored. The presence of X-ray precursors, first\ndetected with Ginga, is easier to understand within a framework of a `dirty'\nrather than a `clean' fireball. A very energetic explosion of a massive star is\nlikely to create a dirty fireball, rather than a clean one.\n  A specific speculative example of such an explosion is proposed, a\nmicroquasar. Its geometrical structure is similar to the `failed supernova' of\nWoosley (1993a): the inner core of a massive, rapidly rotating star collapses\ninto a ~ 10 solar mass Kerr black hole with ~ 5 x 10^54 erg of rotational\nenergy, while the outer core forms a massive disk/torus. A superstrong ~ 10^15\nG magnetic field is needed to make the object operate as a microquasar similar\nto the Blandford & Znajek (1977) model. Such events must be vary rare, 10^4 -\n10^5 times less common than ordinary supernovae, if they are to account for the\nobserved GRBs. \n\n"}

In the other, the\ntransport is down the specific angular momentum gradient, so convection moves\nangular momentum inward. We also consider general prescriptions which lie in\nbetween the two limits.\n  When convection moves angular momentum outward, we recover the usual\nself-similar solution for ADAFs in which the mass density scales as rho ~\nR^{-3/2}. When convection moves angular momentum inward, the result depends on\nthe viscosity coefficient alpha. If alpha>alpha_{crit1} ~ 0.05, we once again\nfind the standard ADAF solution. For alpha<alpha_{crit}, however, we find a\nnon-accreting solution in which rho ~ R^{-1/2}.

The event horizons of these\nblack holes possess a constant curvature and may be seen to be governed by\ndifferent topologies. The extremal geometries are explored, using the\nnoncommutative scaling in the theory, to reassure the attractor behavior at the\nblack hole event horizon. The emerging two dimensional, semi-classical, black\nhole is analyzed to provide evidence for the extra dimensions in a curved\nbrane-world. It is argued that the gauge nonlinearity in the theory may be\nredefined by a potential in a moduli space. As a result, D=11 and D=12\ndimensional geometries may be obtained at the stable extrema of the potential. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0608195", "contents": "Title: Asymmetric Swiss-cheese brane-worlds Abstract: We study a brane-world cosmological scenario with local inhomogeneities\nrepresented by black holes. The brane is asymmetrically embedded into the bulk.\nThe black strings/cigars penetrating the Friedmann brane generate a\nSwiss-cheese type structure. This universe forever expands and decelerates, as\nits general relativistic analogue. The evolution of the cosmological fluid\nhowever can proceed along four branches, two allowed to have positive energy\ndensity, one of them having the symmetric embedding limit. On this branch a\nfuture pressure singularity can arise for either (a) a difference in the\ncosmological constants of the cosmological and black hole brane regions (b) a\ndifference in the left and right bulk cosmological constants. While the\nbehaviour (a) can be avoided by a redefinition of the fluid variables, (b)\nestablishes a critical value of the asymmetry over which the pressure\nsingularity occurs. We introduce the pressure singularity censorship which\nbounds the degree of asymmetry in the bulk cosmological constant. We also show\nas a model independent generic feature that the asymmetry source term due to\nthe bulk cosmological constant increases in the early universe. In order to\nobey the nucleosynthesis constraints, the brane tension should be constrained\ntherefore both from below and from above. With the maximal degree of asymmetry\nobeying the pressure singularity censorship, the higher limit is 10 times the\nlower limit. The degree of asymmetry allowed by present cosmological\nobservations is however much less, pushing the upper limit to infinity. \n\n"}

We start with the two-body low momentum\ninteraction V_{low k} and use the RG flow from the particle-hole channels to\ncalculate the full scattering amplitude in the vicinity of the Fermi surface.\nThis is a new straightforward approach to the many-body problem which is\napplicable also to condensed matter systems without long-range interactions,\nsuch as liquid 3He. We derive the one-loop renormalization group equations for\nthe quasiparticle interaction and the scattering amplitude at zero temperature.\nThe RG presents an elegant method to maintain all momentum scales and preserve\nthe antisymmetry of the scattering amplitude. As a first application we solve\nthe RG equations for neutron matter. The resulting quasiparticle interaction\nincludes effects due to the polarization of the medium, the so-called induced\ninteraction of Babu and Brown. We present results for the Fermi liquid\nparameters, the equation of state of neutron matter and the 1S0 superfluid\npairing gap. \n\n"}

This implies qualitative differences for the QM of the two\nphase spaces: The quantizing group for the plane R^2 consists of the (centrally\nextended) translations generated by {q,p,1}, but the corresponding group for\n{(phi,I)} is SO(1,2) = Sp(2,R)/Z_2, (Sp(2,R): symplectic group of the plane),\nwith Lie algebra basis {h_0 = I, h_1 = I cos phi, h_2 = - I sin phi}. In the QM\nfor the (phi,I)-model the three h_j correspond to self-adjoint generators K_j,\nj=0,1,2, of irreducible unitary representations (positive discrete series) for\nSO(1,2) or one of its infinitely many covering groups, the Bargmann index k > 0\nof which determines the ground state energy E (k, n=0) = hbar omega k of the\n(phi,I)-Hamiltonian H(K). For an m-fold covering the lowest possible value is\nk=1/m, which can be made arbitrarily small! The operators Q and P, now\nexpressed as functions of the K_j, keep their usual properties, but the richer\nstructure of the K_j quantum model of the HO is ``erased'' when passing to the\nsimpler Q,P model!
