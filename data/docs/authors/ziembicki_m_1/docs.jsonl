Convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova\n  core Abstract: By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and\nneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial\nhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion\nphase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is\ndriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time\nvariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development\nof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the\npostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of\nsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked\nflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth\nof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock\ninstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger\nconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the\naverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the\nneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in\nsupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and\nmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the\naccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the\nSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a\nvariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the\nadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the\naccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an\namplifying global feedback loop.

If these particles make up the dark\nmatter, then they can be captured by the Sun or the Earth, sink to the\nrespective cores, annihilate, and produce neutrinos. Thus, these neutrinos can\nbe a striking dark matter signature at neutrino telescopes looking towards the\nSun and/or the Earth. Here, we improve previous analyses on computing the\nneutrino yields from WIMP annihilations in several respects. We include\nneutrino oscillations in a full three-flavor framework as well as all effects\nfrom neutrino interactions on the way through the Sun (absorption, energy loss,\nand regeneration from tau decays). In addition, we study the effects of\nnon-zero values of the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ as well as the normal and\ninverted neutrino mass hierarchies.

We\nfind that the yield of muon-type neutrinos from WIMP annihilations in the Sun\nis enhanced or suppressed, depending on the dominant WIMP annihilation channel.\nThis effect is due to an effective flavor mixing caused by neutrino\noscillations. For WIMP annihilations inside the Earth, the distance from source\nto detector is too small to allow for any significant amount of oscillations at\nthe neutrino energies relevant for neutrino telescopes. \n\n"}

It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the\nmodification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly\nreduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the\npeak position to lower pion energies.

According to the AMD, the Be-9 nucleus consists of\ntwo alpha-like clusters with a surrounding neutron.

We investigated whether clustering\nfeatures could appear in the structure function F_2 of Be-9 along with studies\nfor other light nuclei. We found that nuclear modifications of F_2 are similar\nin both AMD and shell models within our simple convolution description although\nthere are slight differences in Be-9.

When the tops\ndecay, these correlations imprint themselves on the angular patterns of the\nfinal quarks and leptons. While many approaches to the measurement of top spin\ncorrelations are known, the most common ones require detailed kinematic\nreconstructions and are insensitive to some important spin interference\neffects. In particular, spin-1 resonances with mostly-vector or mostly-axial\ncouplings to top cannot be easily discriminated from one another without\nappealing to mass-suppressed effects or to more model-dependent interference\nwith continuum Standard Model production. Here, we propose to probe the\nstructure of a resonance's couplings to tops by measuring the azimuthal angles\nof the tops' decay products about the production axis. These angles exhibit\nmodulations which are typically O(0.1-1), and which by themselves allow for\ndiscrimination of spin-0 from higher spins, measurement of the CP-phase for\nspin-0, and measurement of the vector/axial composition for spins 1 and 2.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering.

Here, we explore the prospect for corroboration of this\nsuggestion from 5 additional CMS&ATLAS search strategies targeting the\nproduction of light stops & gluinos at lower jet counts, which variously depend\non heavy flavor tagging and the inclusion or exclusion of associated leptons.\nThe current operating phase of the 7TeV LHC is highly conducive to the\nproduction of gluinos & light stops, given the supersymmetric particle mass\nhierarchy M_t_1<M_g<M_q that naturally evolves from the dynamics of the model\nnamed No-Scale FSU5 that we presently study. Moreover, some tension persists\nagainst the SM data-driven and MC generated background predictions in certain\nLHC searches of this variety. We demonstrate that the 1-sigma overlap of the\nallowed supersymmetric event production for these seven search methodologies\nroundly envelops the most favorable phenomenological subspace of FSU5, while\nhandily generating a 125GeV Higgs boson mass.

These reductions\ntranslate to smaller SFR estimates made from observed UV and Halpha\nluminosities.

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam\nand a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines\n300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at\n5 $\\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating\nphase range.

We\nemphasize the importance of anomalous single top plus Higgs production in these\nscenarios, in addition to the more widely studied $t \\to h j$ decays. By\nrecasting existing CMS searches in multilepton and diphoton plus lepton final\nstates, we show that bounds on $tuh$ couplings are improved by a factor of 1.5\nwhen single top plus Higgs production is accounted for.

All the earlier\nmodel predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we\npoint out that for a given tree operator $O_i$, the contribution from its\nFiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to\ncancel the internal $W$-emission amplitude induced from $O_i$. The wave\nfunction of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor\nwith the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these\nsymmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that\nhalf of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.\nSince this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,\nwe advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the\ntree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why\nmost previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above\nconsideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary\nto the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should\nbe proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$. \n\n"}

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger\nmass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion\nenergy in 3D. These differences are caused by less coherent, less massive, and\nless rapid convective downdrafts associated with postshock convection in 3D.\nThe less violent impact of these accretion downflows in the cooling layer\nproduces less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses by neutrino\nemission. We thus have, for the first time, identified a reduced mass accretion\nrate, lower infall velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of\nconvective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock turbulence that\nfacilitate neutrino-driven explosions and strengthen them compared to the 2D\ncase. \n\n"}

We begin with an overview of the Standard Model puzzles, followed by\na description of some classic lepton mixing patterns. Lepton mixing may be\nregarded as a deviation from tri-bimaximal mixing, with charged lepton\ncorrections leading to solar mixing sum rules, or tri-maximal lepton mixing\nleading to atmospheric mixing rules. We survey neutrino mass models, using a\nroadmap based on the open questions in neutrino physics. We then focus on the\nseesaw mechanism with right-handed neutrinos, where sequential dominance (SD)\ncan account for large lepton mixing angles and CP violation, with precise\npredictions emerging from constrained SD (CSD).

These and other discoveries in this period led to the acceptance of\nQCD as the theory of the strong interactions. The desire to understand nuclear\nphysics at high density such as in neutron stars led to the application of QCD\nto this problem and to the prediction of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in nuclei\nat high energy density and temperatures. This eventually led to the\nconstruction of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL to observe\nsuperdense nuclear matter in the laboratory. This article discusses how\nexperimental methods and results which confirmed QCD at the first hadron\ncollider, the CERN ISR, played an important role in experiments at the first\nheavy ion collider, RHIC, leading to the discovery of the QGP as a perfect\nliquid as well as discoveries at RHIC and the LHC which continue to the present\nday. \n\n"}

Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

By using the CP trajectory diagram we\nobserve that there is a two-fold ambiguity in the determination of delta which\nis related with the sign of Delta m^2_{13}. We then address the question of\nwhat are the promising options for conceptual design of experiments at low\nenergies which looks for CP violation and at the same time would resolve the\ntwo-fold ambiguity. We point out that a version with distance of about 700 km,\nwith a megaton class water Cherenkov detector gives an optimal design which\nallows simultaneous determination of delta and the sign of Delta m^2_{13} {\\it\nin situ}. We also point out that there is a possibility that the similar {\\it\nin situ} measurement of both quantities can be done at the Phase II of JHF\nexperiment with much shorter baseline, under the assumption of nature's kind\nsetting of delta to the region of sin{delta} \\cdot Delta m^2_{13} < 0. A\ntechnique of running at high (sim 1 GeV) and low (sim 0.5 GeV) beam energies is\nproposed as a method for better identification of delta. \n\n"}

A627 (1997) 543 is extended to the\nstudy of electroweak Charged Current (CC) induced nuclear reactions, at\nintermediate energies of interest for future neutrino oscillation experiments.\nThe model accounts for, among other nuclear effects, long range nuclear (RPA)\ncorrelations, Final State Interaction (FSI) and Coulomb corrections.\nPredictions for the inclusive muon capture in $^{12}$C and the reaction\n$^{12}$C $(\\nu_\\mu,\\mu^-)X$ near threshold are also given. RPA correlations are\nshown to play a crucial role and their inclusion leads to one of the best\nexisting simultaneous description of both processes, with accuracies of the\norder of 10-15% per cent for the muon capture rate and even better for the LSND\nmeasurement. \n\n"}

{"id": "nucl-th/9812063", "contents": "Title: Survey of heavy-meson observables Abstract: We employ a Dyson-Schwinger equation model to effect a unified and uniformly\naccurate description of light- and heavy-meson observables, which we\ncharacterise by heavy-meson leptonic decays, semileptonic heavy-to-heavy and\nheavy-to-light transitions - B -> D*, D, rho, pi; D -> K*, K, pi, radiative and\nstrong decays - B(s)* -> B(s) gamma; D(s)* -> D(s) gamma, D pi, and the rare\nB-> K* gamma flavour-changing neutral-current process. We elucidate the\nheavy-quark limit of these processes and, using a model-independent mass\nformula valid for all nonsinglet pseudoscalar mesons, demonstrate that their\nmass rises linearly with the mass of their heaviest constituent. In our\nnumerical calculations we eschew a heavy-quark expansion and rely instead on\nthe observation that the dressed c,b-quark mass functions are well approximated\nby a constant, interpreted as their constituent-mass: we find M_c=1.32 GeV and\nM_b=4.65 GeV. The calculated heavy-meson leptonic decay constants and\ntransition form factors are a necessary element in the experimental\ndetermination of CKM matrix elements. The results also show that this\nframework, as employed hitherto, is well able to describe vector meson\npolarisation observables. \n\n"}

The discussion on which is the dominant\neffect, thus on how to improve the stability of the oscillator, has been going\non for years without giving a clear answer. This article tackles the question\nby analyzing the phase noise spectrum of several commercial oscillators and\nlaboratory prototypes, and demonstrates that the fluctuation of the resonator\nnatural frequency is the dominant effect. The investigation method starts from\nreverse engineering the oscillator phase noise in order to show that if the\nLeeson effect was dominant, the resonator merit factor Q would be too low as\ncompared to the available technology. \n\n"}
