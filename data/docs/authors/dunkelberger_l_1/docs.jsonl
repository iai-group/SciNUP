We show for the first time that the $^{39}$Ar production\nunderground is dominated by stopping negative muon capture on $^{39}$K and\n($\\alpha,n)$ induced subsequent $^{39}$K(n,p)$^{39}$Ar reactions. The\nproduction of $^{39}$Ar is shown as a function of depth. We demonstrate that\nargon depleted in $^{39}$Ar can be obtained only if the depth of the\nunderground resources is greater than 500 m.w.e. below the surface. Stopping\nnegative muon capture on $^{39}$K dominates over radiogenic production at\ndepths of less than 2000 m.w.e., and that production by muon-induced neutrons\nis subdominant at any depth. The depletion factor depends strongly on both\nradioactivity level and potassium content in the rock. We measure the\nradioactivity concentration and potassium concentration in the rock for a\npotential site of an underground argon source in South Dakota. Depending on the\nprobability of $^{39}$Ar and $^{40}$Ar produced underground being dissolved in\nthe water, the upper limit of the concentration of $^{39}$Ar in the underground\nwater at this site is estimated to be in a range of a factor of 1.6 to 155 less\nthan the $^{39}$Ar concentration in the atmosphere.\n  The calculation tools presented in this paper are also critical to the dating\nmethod with $^{39}$Ar. \n\n"}

This has led\nnaturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of\n\"generalized\" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic\nfactorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process\ndependent Wilson line structures. In other words, to recover a factorization\nformula, it has become common to assume that it is sufficient to simply modify\nthe Wilson lines in the parton correlation functions for each separate hadron.\nIn this paper, we will illustrate by direct counter-example that this is not\npossible in a non-Abelian gauge theory. Since a proof of generalized transverse\nmomentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard\nhadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a\ngeneral proof does not exist. Therefore, to make the counter-argument clear and\nexplicit, we illustrate with a specific calculation for a double spin asymmetry\nin a spectator model with a non-Abelian gauge field. The observed breakdown of\ngeneralized transverse momentum dependent factorization challenges the notion\nthat the role of parton transverse momentum in such processes can be described\nusing separate correlation functions for each external hadron. \n\n"}

For\nthe hydrodynamical modeling with which we obtain the low-P_T spectrum, we have\ncomputed the initial conditions based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) minijet\nproduction and saturation. The sensitivity of the obtained charged-hadron P_T\nspectrum on the hydrodynamic model parameters is studied.

In\nthe case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on\nthe detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From\nthis standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of\nsources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation\nframework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach\nto event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple\nradioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with\nthe entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.\nVarious levels of information can also be recorded from the individual\ncomponents, with these record levels also being set at runtime. This\nflexibility in both source generation and information recording is possible\nwithout the need to recompile, reducing the complexity of code management and\nthe proliferation of versions. Within the code itself, casting geometry objects\nwithin this new set of classes rather than as the default Geant4 classes\nautomatically extends this flexibility to every individual component.

Due to its\nshort lifetime, many QGP properties can only be inferred indirectly through a\ncomparison of the final state measurements with transport model calculations.\nAmong the current phenomena of interest are the interdependencies between two\ncollective flow phenomena, elliptic and triangular flow. The former is mostly\nrelated to the initial geometry and collective expansion of the system whereas\nthe latter is sensitive to the fluctuations of the initial state. For our\ninvestigation we use a hybrid transport model based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach using an ideal\nhydrodynamic expansion for the hot and dense stage. Using UrQMD initial\nconditions for an Au-Au collision, particles resulting from a collision are\nmapped into an energy density distribution that is evolved event-by-event with\na hydrodynamic calculation. By averaging these distributions over different\nnumbers of events, we have studied how the granularity/smoothness of the\ndistribution affects the initial eccentricity, the initial triangularity, and\nthe resulting flow components. The average elliptic flow in non central\ncollisions is not sensitive to the granularity, while triangular flow is.

The deviation from the expected behavior in the leptonic mass\nspectrum exposes the inner structure of the meson. This deviation is\ncharacterized by a form factor.

However, the calculations of TPE corrections\nhave significant model dependence, and there is limited direct experimental\nevidence for such corrections. We present the results of a new experimental\ntechnique for making direct $e^\\pm p$ comparisons, which has the potential to\nmake precise measurements over a broad range in $Q^2$ and scattering angles. We\nuse the Jefferson Lab electron beam and the Hall B photon tagger to generate a\nclean but untagged photon beam. The photon beam impinges on a converter foil to\ngenerate a mixed beam of electrons, positrons, and photons. A chicane is used\nto separate and recombine the electron and positron beams while the photon beam\nis stopped by a photon blocker. This provides a combined electron and positron\nbeam, with energies from 0.5 to 3.2 GeV, which impinges on a liquid hydrogen\ntarget.

These model\nelements, whose dependence on relative azimuth angle has the form\n$\\cos[m(\\phi_1-\\phi_2)]$ where $m > 2$, were introduced to support a\nhydrodynamic flow interpretation of the same-side ($|\\phi_1-\\phi_2| < \\pi/2$)\n2D peak in the correlations. Previous studies have shown that the $m > 2$\nharmonics are not required by the data, that they destabilize the fitting\nmodels, and that their net effect is to decompose the same-side peak into two\ncomponents, one being dependent on and the other being independent of relative\npseudorapidity. Thus we are lead to question whether descriptions of angular\ncorrelation data including higher-order harmonics inform our understanding of\nthe same-side peak or heavy-ion collisions in general.

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to\nobtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with\nmasses below 1.6 solar masses.

We simulate several configurations of a future CUORE-like\nbolometer array which would utilize these improvements and present the\nsensitivity reach of a hypothetical next-generation bolometric 0nubb\nexperiment. We demonstrate that a bolometric experiment with the isotope mass\nof about 1 ton is capable of reaching the sensitivity to the effective Majorana\nneutrino mass (|mee|) of order 10-20 meV, thus completely exploring the\nso-called inverted neutrino mass hierarchy region. We highlight the main\nchallenges and identify priorities for an R&D program addressing them. \n\n"}

This\ncorrelation is incorporated into the centrality calculations used by ATLAS and\nPHENIX, both based on a similar Monte Carlo Glauber approach but with different\nmodels of the per-collision or per-participant event activity. It is found that\nthe presence of this correlation tends to increase the yield measured in more\ncentral events and decrease it in peripheral events. Numerical factors to\ncorrect measured yields for the centrality bias effect are calculated for $p$+A\ncollisions at RHIC and the LHC. Reasonable agreement with a previous\ncalculation of these factors by PHENIX is found, despite differences in the\nimplementation of the underlying bias. \n\n"}

The decrease is larger in the\nmore peripheral collisions. By examining both Au$+$Au and Cu$+$Cu collisions we\nfind that $v_2$ depends both on eccentricity and the number of participants,\n$N_{\\rm part}$.

Centrality classes are defined\nusing different event activity estimators, i.e. charged particle multiplicities\nmeasured in three disjunct pseudorapidity regions as well as the energy\nmeasured at beam rapidity (zero-degree). The procedures to determine the\ncentrality, quantified by the number of participants ($N_{\\rm part}$), or the\nnumber of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions ($N_{\\rm coll}$), are described. We\nshow that, in contrast to Pb-Pb collisions, in p-Pb collisions large\nmultiplicity fluctuations together with the small range of participants\navailable, generate a dynamical bias in centrality classes based on particle\nmultiplicity.

For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium.

The relative difference in the CME signal between the two isobaric\ncollisions is found to be robust, insensitive to the final-state interactions. \n\n"}

The set of jet shapes includes the first radial moment or angularity, $g$;\nthe momentum dispersion, $p_{\\rm T}D$; and the difference between the leading\nand sub-leading constituent track transverse momentum, $LeSub$. These\nobservables provide complementary information on the jet fragmentation and can\nconstrain different aspects of the theoretical description of jet-medium\ninteractions. The jet shapes were measured for a small resolution parameter $R\n= 0.2$ and were fully corrected to particle level. The observed jet shape\nmodifications indicate that in-medium fragmentation is harder and more\ncollimated than vacuum fragmentation as obtained by PYTHIA calculations, which\nwere validated with the measurements of the jet shapes in proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The comparison of the measured distributions\nto templates for quark and gluon-initiated jets indicates that in-medium\nfragmentation resembles that of quark jets in vacuum.

To date, most\njet modification studies have been based on comparing the jet properties\nmeasured in heavy-ion collisions to a proton-proton baseline at the same\nreconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$).

This historic detection has been instrumental\nin providing constraints on the tidal polarizability of neutron stars. In turn,\nthe tidal polarizability has been used to impose limits on stellar radii and\nultimately on the equation of state (EOS). The tidal polarizability is also\nsensitive to the second tidal Love number k2. It is the main purpose of this\nwork to perform a detailed study of k2 which, for a given compactness\nparameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal polarizability to the\nEOS. In particular, we examine the role that the crustal component of the EOS\nplays in the determination of k2. A set of realistic models of the equation of\nstate that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and\nsupport neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal\npolarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a\nuniversal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness\nparameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS. Thus, besides an\nextraction of the tidal polarizabilities, a measurement of the individual\nstellar masses is also required to impact the mass-radius relation.
