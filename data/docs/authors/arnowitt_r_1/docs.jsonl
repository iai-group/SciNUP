The random potential causes\nthe inflaton to undergo a Brownian motion with a drift in the D-dimensional\nfield space. To quantify such an effect, we employ a stochastic approach to\nevaluate the two-point and three-point functions of primordial perturbations.\nWe find that in the weakly random scenario the resulting power spectrum\nresembles that of the single field slow-roll case, with up to 2% more red tilt.\nThe strongly random scenario, leads to rich phenomenologies, such as primordial\nfluctuations in the power spectrum on all angular scales. Such features may\nalready be hiding in the error bars of observed CMB TT (as well as TE and EE)\npower spectrum and can be detected or falsified with more data coming in the\nfuture.

However, N-body\nsimulations show that dark matter halos grow through a mixture of smooth\naccretion, violent encounters and fragmentations, and modeling halo collapse as\nspherical, or even as ellipsoidal, is a significant oversimplification. We\npropose that some of the physical complications inherent to a realistic\ndescription of halo formation can be included in the excursion set theory\nframework, at least at an effective level, by taking into account that the\ncritical value for collapse is not a fixed constant $\\delta_c$, as in the\nspherical collapse model, nor a fixed function of the variance $\\sigma$ of the\nsmoothed density field, as in the ellipsoidal collapse model, but rather is\nitself a stochastic variable, whose scatter reflects a number of complicated\naspects of the underlying dynamics.

Abstract: This paper explores whether Eguchi-Kawai reduction for gauge theories with\nadjoint fermions is valid. The Eguchi-Kawai reduction relates gauge theories in\ndifferent numbers of dimensions in the large $N$ limit provided that certain\nconditions are met. In principle, this relation opens up the possibility of\nlearning about the dynamics of 4D gauge theories through techniques only\navailable in lower dimensions. Dimensional reduction can be understood as a\nspecial case of large $N$ equivalence between theories related by an orbifold\nprojection. In this work, we focus on the simplest case of dimensional\nreduction, relating a 4D gauge theory to a 3D gauge theory via an orbifold\nprojection. A necessary condition for the large N equivalence between the 4D\nand 3D theories to hold is that certain discrete symmetries in the two theories\nmust not be broken spontaneously. In pure 4D Yang-Mills theory, these\nsymmetries break spontaneously as the size of one of the spacetime dimensions\nshrinks. An analysis of the effect of adjoint fermions on the relevant\nsymmetries of the 4D theory shows that the fermions help stabilize the\nsymmetries.

We\nfind that if m_h ~ 125 GeV focus-point strips would be disfavoured, as would\nthe low-tan beta stau-chi and stop -chi coannihilation strips, whereas the\nstau-chi coannihilation strip at large tan beta and A_0 > 0 would be favoured,\ntogether with its extension to a funnel where rapid annihilation via\ndirect-channel H/A poles dominates.

Abstract: The entropic approach to dissociation of bound states immersed in strongly\ncoupled systems is developed. In such systems, the excitations of the bound\nstate are often delocalized and characterized by a large entropy, so that the\nbound state is strongly entangled with the rest of the statistical system. If\nthis entropy $S$ increases with the separation $r$ between the constituents of\nthe bound state, $S = S(r)$, then the resulting entropic force $F = T\\\n{\\partial S}/{\\partial r}$ ($T$ is temperature) can drive the dissociation\nprocess. As a specific example, we consider the case of heavy quarkonium in\nstrongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, where lattice QCD indicates a large amount\nof entropy associated with the heavy quark pair at temperatures $0.9\\ T_c \\leq\nT \\leq 1.5\\ T_c$ ($T_c$ is the deconfinement temperature); this entropy $S(r)$\ngrows with the inter-quark distance $r$.

This \"entropic self-destruction\" may thus explain why the\nexperimentally measured quarkonium nuclear modification factor at RHIC (lower\nenergy density) is smaller than at LHC (higher energy density), possibly\nresolving the \"quarkonium suppression puzzle\" - all of the previously known\nmechanisms of quarkonium dissociation operate more effectively at higher energy\ndensities, and this contradicts the data.

In this\npaper, we work in the rigid-spacetime approximation and consider field\ntrajectories within the single-field attractor, which is a generic feature of\nthese models. We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter\nspace in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and\nsemi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is\ncharacterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large\nvalues of the nonminimal couplings, $\\xi_I \\gg 1$, in which the dominant\ninstability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers\n$k \\rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\\xi_I$ regime is not reached until\n$\\xi_I \\geq {\\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\\xi_I \\sim {\\cal\nO}(1 - 10)$, the resonance structure depends strongly on wavenumber and\ncouplings. The resonance structure for isocurvature perturbations is distinct\nand more complicated than its adiabatic counterpart. An intermediate regime,\nfor $\\xi_I \\sim {\\cal O} (1 - 10)$, is again evident. For large values of\n$\\xi_I$, the Floquet chart consists of densely spaced, nearly parallel\ninstability bands, suggesting a very efficient preheating behavior. The\nincreased efficiency arises from features of the nontrivial field-space\nmanifold in the Einstein frame, which itself arises from the fields' nonminimal\ncouplings in the Jordan frame, and has no analogue in models with minimal\ncouplings. Quantitatively, the approach to the large-$\\xi_I$ asymptotic\nsolution for isocurvature modes is slower than in the case of the adiabatic\nmodes. \n\n"}

To date, most considerations of this important hypothetical\nprocess have been restricted to Lorentz-violating photons, as the necessary\ntheoretical tools for the SME fermion sector have not been available. With\ntheir development in a very recent paper, we are now in a position to compute\nthe decay rates based on a modified Dirac theory. Two realizations of the\nCherenkov process are studied. In the first scenario, the spin projection of\nthe incoming fermion is assumed to be conserved, and in the second, the spin\nprojection is allowed to flip. The first type of process is shown to be still\nforbidden for the dimensionful $a$ and $b$ coefficients where there are strong\nindications that it is energetically disallowed for the $H$ coefficients, as\nwell. However, it is rendered possible for the dimensionless $c$, $d$, $e$,\n$f$, and $g$ coefficients. For large initial fermion energies, the decay rates\nfor the $c$ and $d$ coefficients were found to grow linearly with momentum and\nto be linearly suppressed by the smallness of the Lorentz-violating coefficient\nwhere for the $e$, $f$, and $g$ coefficients this suppression is even\nquadratic. The decay rates vanish in the vicinity of the threshold, as\nexpected. The decay including a fermion spin flip plays a role for the\nspin-nondegenerate operators and it was found to occur for the dimensionful $b$\nand $H$ coefficients as well as for the dimensionless $d$ and $g$. The\ncharacteristics of this process differ much from the properties of the\nspin-conserving one, e.g., there is no threshold.

They restricted their discussion to those\nrealizations of antilinear symmetry in which all the energy eigenvalues of the\nHamiltonian are real. Here we extend the discussion to the two other\nrealizations possible with antilinear symmetry, namely energies in complex\nconjugate pairs or Jordan-block Hamiltonians that are not diagonalizable at\nall. In particular, we show that under certain circumstances it is possible for\nthe Goldstone boson mode itself to be one of the zero-norm states that are\ncharacteristic of Jordan-block Hamiltonians. While we discuss the same model as\nAlexandre et al. our treatment is quite different, though their main conclusion\nthat one can have Goldstone bosons in the non-Hermitian case remains intact. In\ntheir paper Alexandre et al. presented a variational procedure for the action\nin which the surface term played an explicit role, to thus suggest that one has\nto use such a procedure in order to establish the Goldstone theorem in the\nnon-Hermitian case. However, by taking certain fields that they took to be\nHermitian to actually either be anti-Hermitian or be made so by a similarity\ntransformation, we show that we are then able to obtain a Goldstone boson using\na completely standard variational procedure. Since we use a standard\nvariational procedure we can readily extend our analysis to a continuous local\nsymmetry by introducing a gauge boson. We show that when we do this the gauge\nboson acquires a non-zero mass by the Higgs mechanism in all realizations of\nthe antilinear symmetry, except the one where the Goldstone boson itself has\nzero norm, in which case, and despite the fact that the continuous local\nsymmetry has been spontaneously broken, the gauge boson remains massless. \n\n"}

Masses and\nmixings of supersymmetric particles can be computed within DarkSUSY or with the\nhelp of external programs such as FeynHiggs, ISASUGRA and SUSPECT. Accelerator\nbounds can be checked to identify viable dark matter candidates. DarkSUSY also\ncomputes a large variety of astrophysical signals from neutralino dark matter,\nsuch as direct detection in low-background counting experiments and indirect\ndetection through antiprotons, antideuterons, gamma-rays and positrons from the\nGalactic halo or high-energy neutrinos from the center of the Earth or of the\nSun.

Assuming a hierarchichal pattern of neutrino\nmasses, these effects are large for only the third generation of sleptons.

We then investigate how these primordial modulation\neffects leave an imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Our\nconclusions are that for favourable parameter values already the presently\nflying MAP satellite will have a chance to detect such transplanckian\noscillations in the pattern of temperature fluctuations on the sky, and that\nthe upcoming Planck satellite will either detect them or put stringent limits\nrelated to the mass scale where the new effects appear. \n\n"}

We find that,\nin all cases as long as the brane annihilation and the SM branes are not both\nin the bulk, the transfer of energy to start the hot big bang epoch can be\nefficient enough to be compatible with big bang nucleosynthesis. The\nsuppression of the abundance of the graviton and its Kaluza-Klein (KK) thermal\nrelics follows from the warped geometry in flux compactification. This works\nout even in the scenarios where a long period of tunneling is expected. In the\nmulti-throat scenario, we find a dynamical mechnism of selecting a long throat\nas the SM throat. We establish three new dark matter candidates: KK modes with\nspecific angular momentum in the SM throat, those in the brane annihilation\nthroat, and different matters generated by KK modes tunneled to other throats.\nSince the latter two couple to the visible matter sector only through graviton\nmediation, they behave as hidden dark matter.
