Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

In this case, acceptable cosmological\nsolutions that contain a long enough matter dominated era followed by a\nlate-time accelerated expansion are found. To support theoretical results, we\nalso obtain numerical solutions for a few functions of g(R), and results of the\ncorresponding models confirm the predictions. We classify solutions into six\nclasses which demonstrate more acceptable solutions and there is more freedom\nto have the matter dominated era than in the f(R) gravity. In particular, there\nis a new fixed point which can represent late-time acceleration. We draw\ndifferent diagrams of the matter densities (consistent with the present\nvalues), the related scale factors and effective equation of state. The\ncorresponding diagrams of parameters illustrate that there is a saddle\nacceleration era which is a middle era before final stable acceleration de\nSitter era for some models.

In this setting, spinning PBHs are unstable to a\nspontaneous spindown through the well-known \"black-hole bomb\" mechanism. At\nlinear level, the photon density is trapped by the effective photon mass and\ngrows exponentially in time due to superradiance. As the plasma density\ndeclines due to cosmic expansion, the associated energy around PBHs is released\nand dissipated in the CMB. We evaluate the resulting spectral distortions of\nthe CMB in the redshift range 10^3 < z < 2x10^6.

This concept is similar in spirit\nto dualities discovered in more complicated examples in field theory or string\ntheory. Our approach makes it evident that such generalized dualities are\nwidespread. This suggests that, as a general phenomenon, there are hidden\nrelations and hidden symmetries that conventional 1T-physics does not capture,\nimplying the existence of a more unified formulation of physics that naturally\nsupplies the hidden information.

In the low-redshift region the holographic dark energy\nmodels are degenerate with each other and with the $\\Lambda$CDM model in the\n$H(z)$ and $q(z)$ evolutions. In particular, the HDE model is highly degenerate\nwith the $\\Lambda$CDM model, and in the HDE model the cases with different\nparameter values are also in strong degeneracy. Since the observational data\nare mainly within the low-redshift region, it is very important to break this\nlow-redshift degeneracy in the $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ diagnostics by using some\nquantities with higher order derivatives of the scale factor. It is shown that\nthe statefinder diagnostic $r(z)$ is very useful in breaking the low-redshift\ndegeneracies.

Thus, Yang-Mills contribution decays\nexponentially at very large distances compared to $1/m$, leaving a pure\nChern-Simons theory with level number $k$. The focus of this research is the\n$near$ Chern-Simons limit of the theory, where the distance is large enough to\ngive an almost topological theory, with a small contribution from the\nYang-Mills term. It is shown that this almost topological theory consists of\ntwo copies of Chern-Simons with level number $k/2$, very similar to the\nChern-Simons splitting of topologically massive AdS gravity model. As $m$\napproaches to infinity, the split parts add up to give the original\nChern-Simons term with level $k$. Also, gauge invariance of the split\nChern-Simons theories is discussed for odd values of $k$. Furthermore, a\nrelation between the observables of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and\nChern-Simons theory is obtained. It is shown that one of the two split\nChern-Simons pieces is associated with Wilson loops while the other with 't\nHooft loops.

{"id": "1604.08140", "contents": "Title: How should spin-weighted spherical functions be defined? Abstract: Spin-weighted spherical functions provide a useful tool for analyzing\ntensor-valued functions on the sphere. A tensor field can be decomposed into\ncomplex-valued functions by taking contractions with tangent vectors on the\nsphere and the normal to the sphere. These component functions are usually\npresented as functions on the sphere itself, but this requires an implicit\nchoice of distinguished tangent vectors with which to contract. Thus, we may\nmore accurately say that spin-weighted spherical functions are functions of\nboth a point on the sphere and a choice of frame in the tangent space at that\npoint. The distinction becomes extremely important when transforming the\ncoordinates in which these functions are expressed, because the implicit choice\nof frame will also transform. Here, it is proposed that spin-weighted spherical\nfunctions should be treated as functions on the spin group. This approach more\ncleanly reflects the geometry involved, and allows for a more elegant\ndescription of the behavior of spin-weighted functions. In this form, the\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics have simple expressions as elements of the\nWigner $\\mathfrak{D}$ representations, and transformations under rotation are\nsimple. Two variants of the angular-momentum operator are defined directly in\nterms of the spin group; one is the standard angular-momentum operator\n$\\mathbf{L}$, while the other is shown to be related to the spin-raising\noperator $\\eth$. Computer code is also included, providing an explicit\nimplementation of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics in this form. \n\n"}

We extend previous\nworks to include slow rotation and find a relation between the dimensionless\nmoment of intertia, ($\\bar{I}=Ic^2/G_{\\rm N} M^3$), and the compactness,\n$\\cal{C}=G_{\\rm N} M/Rc^2$ (an $\\bar{I}$-$\\cal{C}$ relation), independent of\nthe equation of state, that is reminiscent of but distinct from the general\nrelativity prediction.

We first explicitly demonstrate that the non-relativistic\nlimit of these scaling relations reduce to known results from the statistical\ntheory of incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence. In simulations of the\ninverse-cascade range, we find the relevant relativistic scaling relation is\nsatisfied to a high degree of accuracy.

This mechanism requires composite top\npartners which are relatively light compared to the typical mass scale of the\nstrongly coupled theory. While most studies of the phenomenology of such models\nhave focused on a bottom-up approach with a minimal effective theory, a\ntop-down approach suggests that that the theory should contain a limit in which\nan unbroken global chiral symmetry protects the mass of the top partners, and\nthe spectrum of the partners satisfies `t Hooft matching conditions. We\ntherefore consider a model for the UV gauge group which could provide a\nsolution to the matching conditions, and note that the relatively light\nfermions and pseudo-Goldstone bosons fall into complete multiplets of a large\napproximate global symmetry. This implies that the spectrum of particles\nlighter than a few TeV is non-minimal. Our example illustrates likely features\nof a composite Higgs theory, and also serves as an example of a non-chiral\ntheory with no sign problem and a possible solution to `t Hooft matching\nconditions.

In the coordinate frame in which these observers\nare at rest, the horizon manifests itself as a (coordinate) singularity in the\nmetric tensor. Regularization of this singularity removes the inaccessible\nregion, and leads to the following consequences: (a) The non-trivial\ntopological structure for the effective manifold allows one to obtain the\nstandard results of quantum field theory in curved space-time. (b) In case of\ngravity, this principle requires that the effect of the unobserved degrees of\nfreedom should reduce to a boundary contribution $A_{\\rm boundary}$ to the\ngravitational action. When the boundary is a horizon, $A_{\\rm boundary}$\nreduces to a single, well-defined term proportional to the area of the horizon.\nUsing the form of this boundary term, it is possible to obtain the full\ngravitational action in the semiclassical limit.

The quantum dynamics of AQG is governed by a\nsingle Master Constraint operator. While AQG is inspired by Loop Quantum\nGravity (LQG), it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is\nfundamentally no topology or differential structure. A natural Hilbert space\nrepresentation acquires the structure of an infinite tensor product (ITP) whose\nseparable strong equivalence class Hilbert subspaces (sectors) are left\ninvariant by the quantum dynamics. The missing information about the topology\nand differential structure of the spacetime manifold as well as about the\nbackground metric to be approximated is supplied by coherent states. Given such\ndata, the corresponding coherent state defines a sector in the ITP which can be\nidentified with a usual QFT on the given manifold and background.

The integration over k\nproviding the real-space wave function for a quantum walker corresponds to\nconsidering an orbital state of a Weyl particle, which is defined as a\nsuperposition (curvilinear integration) of the energy-momentum eigenstates of a\nfree Weyl equation along the orbit. Konno's novel distribution function of\nquantum-walker's pseudo-velocities in the long-time limit is fully controlled\nby the shape of the orbit and how the orbit is embedded in the\nthree-dimensional momentum space. The family of orbital states can be regarded\nas a geometrical representation of the unitary group U(2) and the present study\nwill propose a new group-theoretical point of view for quantum-walk problems. \n\n"}

We\nexplicitly construct the Lippmann-Schwinger bras and kets along with their\nenergy representation, their time evolution and the rigged Hilbert spaces to\nwhich they belong. It will be concluded that the natural setting for the\nsolutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation--and therefore for scattering\ntheory--is the rigged Hilbert space rather than just the Hilbert space. \n\n"}

The Lee model with a standard Yukawa\ninteraction is shown to provide such a realization.
