We have performed a cluster analysis of the local\nextrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a\nlarge group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have\nre-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps,\nwhich have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the\nsignal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar\nproperties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of\nthe CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian\ntail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is\nformed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles\nbetween 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This\nsignal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in\nboth the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After\nsubtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to\nbe consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity. \n\n"}

We demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron\nstar surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the\nreflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,\nwhere the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass\naccretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.\nAssuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv\\'en radius, we constrain the\nstellar magnetic moment to \\mu=(9\\pm5) 10^{25} G cm^3, which corresponds to the\nsurface field of 10^8 G.

This predicts an\nincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\\sim$ 4\n$\\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emission\nfrom t $\\sim$ 10$^4$ s. A highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due to\nunrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that is\nnot observed. We conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tuned\nenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required to\ncreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that are\ninvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical X-ray light curves of GRBs. \n\n"}

We expect both submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies and to a lesser extent\nsecondary CMB anisotropies from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) to\nsignificantly contribute to the observed power. Subtracting the SZE power\nspectrum expected for sigma_8=0.8 and masking bright sources, the best fit\nvalue for the remaining power is C_l = 1.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8} x 10^{-5} micro K^2\n(1.7^{+1.4}_{-1.3} Jy^2 sr^{-1}).

Direct optical imaging of a majority of edge-on spiral\ngalaxies shows large numbers of dusty clouds populating the thick disk to\nheights z~2 kpc. These observations are likely revealing a cold, dense phase of\nthe thick disk interstellar medium. New observations in the mid-infrared show\nemission from traditional grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in\nthe thick disks of spiral galaxies.

Assuming that the initial BH seeds are relatively massive, of the\norder of 10^5 Msun, and that seeding occurs around z~15 in dark matter haloes\nof mass 10^9-10^10 Msun, we find that it is possible to build up supermassive\nBHs (SMBHs) by z=6 that assemble most of their mass during extended\nEddington-limited accretion periods. The properties of the simulated SMBHs are\nconsistent with observations of z=6 quasars in terms of the estimated BH masses\nand bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within the\nhost halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions of\nthe host galaxy. After a peak in the BH accretion rate at z=6, the most massive\nBH has become sufficiently massive for the growth to enter into a much slower\nphase of feedback-regulated accretion. We explore the full range of expected\nrecoils and radiative efficiencies, and also consider models with spinning BHs.\nIn the most `pessimistic' case where BH spins are initially high, we find that\nthe growth of the SMBHs can be potentially hampered if they grow mostly in\nisolation and experience only a small number of mergers.

We show that Cooper-pair\nneutrino emission remains, nevertheless, an efficient cooling mechanism through\nthe axial channel. As a result, the elimination of neutrino emission from\nCooper-paired nucleons through the vector channel has only minor effects on the\nlong-term cooling of neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm.

Abstract: We report long-slit spectroscopic observations of SDSS J092712+294344\ncarried-out at the recently commissioned 2m telescope in IUCAA Girawali\nObservatory, India. This AGN-like source is known to feature three sets of\nemission lines at zem = 0.6972, 0.7020 and 0.7128. Different scenarios such as\na recoiling black hole after asymmetric emission of gravitational waves, binary\nblack holes and possible merging systems are proposed for this object. We test\nthese scenarios by comparing our spectra with that from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS), obtained 4 years prior to our observations. Comparing the\nredshifts of [OIII]4960,5008 we put a 3 sigma limit on the relative\nacceleration to be less than 32 km s^-1 yr^-1 between different emitting\nregions. Using the 2D spectra obtained at different position angles we show\nthat the [OIII]5008 line from the zem = 0.7128 component is extended beyond the\nspectral point spread function. We infer the linear extent of this line\nemitting region is ~8 kpc. We also find a tentative evidence for an offset\nbetween the centroid of the [OIII]5008 line at zem = 0.7128 and the QSO trace\nwhen the slit is aligned at a position angle of 299 degrees. This corresponds\nto the zem = 0.7128 system being at an impact parameter of ~1 kpc with respect\nto the zem = 0.6972 in the north west direction.

We\nsystematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical\nprocesses are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically,\nwe find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high\nredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as\nit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas\nexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher\nredshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and\nto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height\nof the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the\npresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole\nfeedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both\nboost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated\nfashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback\nfrom massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and\naccretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF\nlaw.

The adaptive smoothing scheme allows to take full\nadvantage of the spatially resolved photometric information contained in an\nimage in that at any location the minimal smoothing is applied to reach the\nrequested S/N. Support is given to match more images on the same smoothing\nlength, such that proper estimates of local colours can be done, with a big\npotential impact on multi-wavelength studies of extended sources (galaxies,\nnebulae). Different modes to estimate local S/N are provided. In addition to\nclassical arithmetic-mean averaging mode, the code can operate in median\naveraging mode, resulting in a significant enhancement of the final image\nquality and very accurate flux conservation. To this goal also other code\noptions are implemented and discussed in this paper. Finally, we analyze in\ngreat detail the effect of the adaptive smoothing on galaxy photometry, in\nparticular in terms of surface brightness (SB) profiles and aperture\nphotometry: deviations in SB with respect to the original image can be limited\nto <0.01 mag, with flux difference in apertures of less than 0.001 mag. \n\n"}

A\nstandard model of the synchrotron self-Compton emission of a compact source\ninside a jet is not able to explain such a correlation. Therefore, we propose\nan alternative scenario where the emission of at least two independent compact\ncomponents is observed at the same time.\n  We compare two different models. The first model assumes the injection of\nrelativistic particles into a downstream region of a shock wave inside a jet\nthat creates the emitting source. The model precisely describes the evolution\nof the particle energy spectrum inside the source and takes into account a\nlight-crossing time effect for the produced radiation. The second model assumes\nan intrinsically constant emission of a homogeneous source that travels inside\nthe jet along a curved trajectory, where the activity is produced simply by\ndifferent values of the source's Doppler factor. To verify the two models we\nuse recentlu published observations of Mrk 421.\n  Our simulations show that simultaneous radiation of at least two independent\nsources, where the first source dominates the emission in the X-ray range and\nthe second source radiates strongly in the gamma-ray range, can explain the\nobserved correlations.

Previous calculations have found that the two-point function can\nhave a logarithmic running of the form log(k/mu), where k is the wavenumber of\nthe perturbation, and mu is the renormalization scale. We highlight that this\nresult would have profound consequences for both eternal inflation and the\npredictivity of standard inflation. We find a different result. We consider two\nsets of theories: one where the inflaton has a large cubic self-interaction and\none where the inflaton interacts gravitationally with N massless spectator\nscalar fields. We find that there is a logarithmic running but of the form\nlog(H/mu), where H is the Hubble constant during inflation. We find this result\nin three independent ways: by performing the calculation with a sharp cutoff in\nfrequency-momentum space, in dimensional regularization and by the simple\nprocedure of making the loop integral dimensionless. For the simplest of our\ntheories we explicitly renormalize the correlation function proving that the\ndivergencies can be reabsorbed and that the correlation function for\nsuper-horizon modes does not depend on time (once the tadpole terms have been\nproperly taken into account). We prove the time-independence of the\nsuper-horizon correlation function in several additional ways: by doing the\ncalculation of the correlation function at finite time using both the\nregularizations and by developing a formalism which expresses loop corrections\ndirectly in terms of renormalized quantities at each time. We find this last\nformalism particularly helpful to develop intuition which we then use to\ngeneralize our results to higher loops and different interactions. \n\n"}

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that\nis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest\nhalo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter\npotential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that\n$f_{\\rm BNC}$ increases from $\\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1}\n{\\rm M_{\\odot}} \\leq M \\lsim 2 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) to $\\sim\n0.4$ in massive haloes ($M \\gsim 5 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$).

Next, we find covariant expressions for the\nevolution of the adiabatic/curvature and entropy/isocurvature modes, and we\ndiscuss how the mode evolution can be inferred directly from the background\nkinematics and the geometry of the field manifold. From these expressions, we\nderive semi-analytic formulae for the curvature, isocurvature, and cross\nspectra, and the spectral observables, all to second-order in the slow-roll and\nslow-turn approximations. In tandem, we show how our covariant formalism\nprovides useful intuition into how the characteristics of the inflationary\nLagrangian translate into distinct features in the power spectra.

By reassessing this new case together with published data on\nother quasar pairs, we conclude that the typical size (radius) of DLAs at these\nredshifts is R ~ (5 +/- 3) kpc, smaller than previously realised. Highly\nionized gas associated with the DLA is more extended, as we find only small\ndifferences in the C IV absorption profiles between the two sightlines.\n  Coincident with UM 673B, we detect a weak and narrow Ly-alpha emission line\nwhich we attribute to star formation activity at a rate SFR >~ 0.2 M_solar/yr.\nThe DLA in UM 673A is metal-poor, with an overall metallicity Z_DLA ~ 1/30\nZ_solar, and has a very low internal velocity dispersion. It exhibits some\napparent peculiarities in its detailed chemical composition, with the elements\nTi, Ni, and Zn being deficient relative to Fe by factors of 2-3.

Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and\ndisplaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light\ncurves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the\ntime lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical\nformalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the\nproblems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated\nerrors, and seasonal gaps.

It is\nexpected that Dark Matter can be found in halos surrounding galaxies, the Milky\nWay among them, and it is hypothesized that it exists in the form of massive,\nweakly interacting particles i.e. WIMPs. A large experimental effort is being\nconducted to discover these elusive particles either directly, in underground\nlaboratories, or indirectly, using experiments which search for decay or\nannihilation products of such particles in the night sky.

We numerically solve the\nequations and show that there can be intensive evolution of structure of the\ngaseous disk. Secular evolution of the disk shows interesting characteristics\nthat are 1) high viscosity excited by SNexp can efficiently transport the gas\nfrom 10kpc to $\\sim 1$kpc forming a stellar disk whereas a stellar ring forms\nfor the case with low viscosity; 2) starbursts trigger SMBH activity with a lag\n$\\sim 10^8$yr depending on star formation rates, prompting the joint evolution\nof SMBHs and bulges; 3) the velocity dispersion is as high as $\\sim 100~\\kms$\nin the gaseous disk. In order to compare the present models with the observed\ndynamical structure and images, we use the incident continuum from the simple\nstellar synthesis (GALAXEV) and CLOUDY to calculate emission line ratios of\nH$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, $\\OIII$ and $\\NII$, and H$\\alpha$ brightness of gas\nphotoionized by young massive stars formed on the disks.

High\nviscosity excited by SNexp is able to efficiently transport the gas into a\nbulge to maintain high star formation rates, or, to form a stellar ring close\nenough to the bulge so that it immigrates into the bulge of its host galaxy.\nThis leads to a fast growing bulge.

Using toy\ntemperature models and detailed heating histories from cosmological simulations\nof HeII reionization, we study the consequences of inhomogeneous heating for\nthe Ly-alpha forest. The impact of temperature fluctuations in physically\nwell-motivated models can be surprisingly subtle. In fact, we show that\ntemperature fluctuations at the level predicted by our reionization simulations\ndo not give rise to detectable signatures in the types of statistics that have\nbeen employed previously. However, because of the aliasing of small-scale\ndensity power to larger scale modes in the line-of-sight Ly-alpha forest power\nspectrum, earlier analyses were not sensitive to 3D modes with >~ 30 comoving\nMpc wavelengths -- scales where temperature fluctuations are likely to be\nrelatively largest. The ongoing Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)\naims to measure the 3D power spectrum of the Ly-alpha forest, P_F, from a large\nsample of quasars in order to avoid this aliasing.

The dominant source of the systematics for all ground based telescopes\nis the spatial correlation of the PSF modulated by both atmospheric turbulence\nand optical aberrations. In this paper, we present a full FOV simulation of the\nLSST images by modeling both the atmosphere and the telescope optics with the\nmost current data for the telescope specifications and the environment. To\nsimulate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, we generated six-layer phase\nscreens with the parameters estimated from the on-site measurements. For the\noptics, we combined the ray-tracing tool ZEMAX and our simulated focal plane\ndata to introduce realistic aberrations and focal plane height fluctuations.\nAlthough this expected flatness deviation for LSST is small compared with that\nof other existing cameras, the fast f-ratio of the LSST optics makes this focal\nplane flatness variation and the resulting PSF discontinuities across the CCD\nboundaries significant challenges in our removal of the systematics. We resolve\nthis complication by performing PCA CCD-by-CCD, and interpolating the basis\nfunctions using conventional polynomials.

Aims: To study the effects of cosmic ray ion (H, He, CNO and\nFe-Co-Ni) and electron bombardment of PAHs in galactic and extragalactic\nenvironments. Methods: We calculate the nuclear and electronic interactions for\ncollisions between PAHs and cosmic ray ions and electrons with energies between\n5 MeV/nucleon and 10 GeV, above the threshold for carbon atom loss, in normal\ngalaxies, starburst galaxies and cooling flow galaxy clusters. Results: The\ntimescale for PAH destruction by cosmic ray ions depends on the electronic\nexcitation energy Eo and on the amount of energy available for dissociation.\nSmall PAHs are destroyed faster, with He and the CNO group being the more\neffective projectiles. For electron collisions, the lifetime is independent of\nthe PAH size and varies with the threshold energy To.

Intergalactic Globular Clusters and\n  the Massive Globular Cluster System at the Core of the Coma Galaxy Cluster Abstract: Intracluster stellar populations are a natural result of tidal interactions\nin galaxy clusters. Measuring these populations is difficult, but important for\nunderstanding the assembly of the most massive galaxies. The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1. The fraction of red IGCs (20%), and the red\ncolor of those GCs, implies that IGCs can originate from the halos of\nrelatively massive, L* galaxies, and not solely from the disruption of dwarf\ngalaxies.

These solutions include both a dark radiation\nterm in the bulk as well as a four-dimensional (boundary) cosmological\nconstant, while gravity at the boundary remains non-dynamical. We\nholographically calculate the stress-energy tensor, showing that it consists of\ntwo contributions: The first one, generated by the dark radiation term, leads\nto the thermal fluid of N = 4 SYM theory, while the second, the conformal\nanomaly, originates from the boundary cosmological constant. Conservation of\nthe boundary stress tensor implies that the boundary cosmological constant is\ntime-independent, such that there is no exchange between the two stress-tensor\ncontributions.

Abstract: Smoothing over structures in general relativity leads to a renormalisation of\nthe background, and potentially many other effects which are poorly understood.\nObservables such as the distance-redshift relation when averaged on the sky do\nnot necessarily yield the same smooth model which arises when performing\nspatial averages. These issues are thought to be of technical interest only in\nthe standard model of cosmology, giving only tiny corrections. However, when we\ntry to calculate observable quantities such as the all-sky average of the\ndistance-redshift relation, we find that perturbation theory delivers divergent\nanswers in the UV and corrections to the background of order unity. There are\nfurther problems. Second-order perturbations are the same size as first-order,\nand fourth-order at least the same as second, and possibly much larger, owing\nto the divergences. Much hinges on a coincidental balance of 2 numbers: the\nprimordial power, and the ratio between the comoving Hubble scales at\nmatter-radiation equality and today. Consequently, it is far from obvious that\nbackreaction is irrelevant even in the concordance model, however natural it\nintuitively seems. \n\n"}

Abstract: The prospect of detecting the first galaxies by observing their impact on the\nintergalactic medium as they reionized it during the first billion years leads\nus to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing which\ntypes of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. We attempt to answer\nthis by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations of\nreionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningful\npredictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving all\natomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 M_solar. We focus here on predictions of\nthe 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable of\ndistinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one in\nwhich both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how these\nresults depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. We find that 21-cm\nfluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation EoR/21-cm radio\ninterferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization by\nhigh-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together.\nSome reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolution\nand thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization history\nand 21-cm PDF distributions. We find that the skewness of the 21-cm PDF\ndistribution smoothed over LOFAR-like window shows a clear feature correlated\nwith the rise of the rms due to patchiness. Measurements of the mean\nphotoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions being\nstudied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases. (abridged) \n\n"}

The\naverage FIR-to-AGN UV luminosity ratio of this faint quasar sample is about two\ntimes higher than that of the bright quasars at z~6 (m_1450<20.2). A fit to the\naverage FIR and AGN bolometric luminosities of both the UV/optically faint and\nbright z~6 quasars, and the average luminosities of samples of submillimeter\n/millimeter-observed quasars at z~2 to 5, yields a relationship of L_{FIR}\n{L_{bol}}^{0.62}. Five of the 18 faint z~6 quasars have been detected at 250\nGHz. These 250 GHz detections, as well as most of the millimeter-detected\noptically bright z~6 quasars, follow a shallower trend of L_{FIR}\n{L_{bol}}^{0.45} defined by the starburst-AGN systems in local and high-z\nuniverse.

The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble\nthose between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly\nconfined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium\nwith the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas\ntypically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling.\nHowever, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given\nmode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong\nstatements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong\ncooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas\naccreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback\nresults in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii.\nThe gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also\naccount for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass.

In particular we show that: (i) surviving massive satellites were\naccreted later than their less massive counterparts, from more massive haloes;\n(ii) the mixing of galaxy populations is incomplete during halo assembly, which\ncreates a correlation between the time a galaxy becomes satellite and its\npresent distance from the parent halo centre. The weakest trends are found for\nthe most massive satellites, as a result of efficient dynamical friction and\nlate formation times of massive haloes. A large fraction of the most massive\ngroup/cluster members are accreted onto the main progenitor of the final halo\nas central galaxies, while about half of the galaxies with low and intermediate\nstellar mass are accreted as satellites.

Since there are three basic physical units, of mass, length and\ntime, there are up to three free parameters in such a rescaling of the units,\n$N_f \\leq 3$. In Newtonian hydrodynamics, e.g., there are indeed usually three\nfree parameters, $N_f = 3$. If, however, the dynamical equations contain a\nuniversal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or the\ngravitational constant $G$, then the requirement that its value remains the\nsame imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of free\nparameters by one, to $N_f = 2$. This is the case, for example, in\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$\nappears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units to\nscale by the same factor, or in Newtonian gravity where the gravitational\nconstant $G$ appears in the equations. More generally, when there are $N_{udc}$\nindependent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then the\nnumber of free parameters is $N_f = max(0,3-N_{udc})$. When both gravity and\nrelativity are included, there is only one free parameter ($N_f = 1$, as both\n$G$ and $c$ appear in the equations so that $N_{udc} = 2$), and the units of\nmass, length and time must all scale by the same factor. The explicit\nrescalings for different types of systems are discussed and summarized here.\nSuch rescalings of the units also hold for discrete particles, e.g. in N-body\nor particle in cell simulations. They are very useful when numerically\ninvestigating a large parameter space or when attempting to fit particular\nexperimental results, by significantly reducing the required number of\nsimulations. \n\n"}

We take a first look at SDSS (g-r) colors of galaxies in the\nAMIGA sample involving many of the most isolated galaxies in the local\nUniverse. This leads us to simultaneously consider the pitfalls of using\nautomated SDSS colors. We focus on median values for the principal\nmorphological subtypes found in the AMIGA sample (E/S0 and Sb-Sc) and compare\nthem with equivalent measures obtained for galaxies in denser environments. We\nfind a weak tendency for AMIGA spiral galaxies to be redder than objects in\nclose pairs. We find no clear difference when we compare with galaxies in other\n(e.g. group) environments.

We\nestimate the spectral index, the polarization angle, the polarization fraction\nand apparent size and shape of these objects when smoothed to a nominal\nresolution of 1 degree FWHM.

Using the\nassociation of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the death of massive stars\nand their ultra-luminous nature, the CSFH can be probed to higher redshifts\nthan current conventional methods. Unfortunately, no consensus has been reached\non the manner in which the LGRB rate (LGRBR) traces the CSFH, leaving many of\nthe questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. Observations by the\nGRB NIR detector (GROND) over the past 4 years have, for the first time,\nacquired highly complete LGRB samples. Driven by these completeness levels and\nnew evidence of LGRBs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxies\nthan previously thought, the possible biases of the LGRBR-CSFH connection are\ninvestigated over a large range of galaxy properties. The CSFH is modelled\nusing empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formation\nrates. Biasing the CSFH by metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and other\nunknown redshift dependencies, a LGRBR is generated and compared to the highly\ncomplete GROND sample.

Then, considering that 7Li is\nmainly produced from 7Be via the electron capture process 7Be + e -> 7Li +\nnu_e, we assess the impact of the various channels of 7Be destruction.\nDifferently from previous analysis, we consider the role of unknown resonances\nby using a complete formalism which takes into account the effect of Coulomb\nand centrifugal barrier penetration and that does not rely on the use of the\nnarrow-resonance approximation. As a result of this, the possibility of a\nnuclear physics solution to the 7Li problem is significantly suppressed. Given\nthe present experimental and theoretical constraints, it is unlikely that the\n7Be + n destruction rate is underestimated by the 2.5 factor required to solve\nthe problem. We exclude, moreover, that resonant destruction in the channels\n7Be + t and 7Be + 3He can explain the 7Li puzzle. New unknown resonances in 7Be\n+ d and 7Be + alpha could potentially produce significant effects. Recent\nexperimental results have ruled out such a possibility for 7Be+d. On the other\nhand, for the 7Be + alpha channel very favorable conditions are required. The\npossible existence of a partially suitable resonant level in 11C is studied in\nthe framework of a coupled-channel model and the possibility of a direct\nmeasurement is considered. \n\n"}

Using three different\ncosmological radiative transfer simulations, we investigate if quasars are\ncapable of substantially changing the size and morphology of the H II regions\nthey are born in. We choose stellar and quasar luminosities in a way that is\nfavourable to seeing such an effect.

However, the quasar H II region is found to be more spherical.\nWe next investigate the prospects of detecting such H II regions in the\nredshifted 21cm data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) by means of a matched\nfilter technique.

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

To improve quality in the 3D mass mapping using 3D-lensing, we\ncombine the lensing information with the spatial clustering of a population of\ngalaxies that trace the matter density with a known galaxy bias (defined as\ntracers). For our minimum variance estimator, merely all the second-order bias\nof the tracers has to be known, which can in principle be self-consistently\nconstrained in the data by lensing techniques. This synergy introduces a new\nnoise component because of the stochasticity in the matter-tracer density\nrelation. We give a description of the stochasticity noise in the Gaussian\nregime, and we investigate the estimator characteristics analytically. We apply\nthe estimator to a mock survey based on the Millennium Simulation. The\nestimator linearly mixes the individual lensing mass and tracer number density\nmaps into a combined smoothed mass map. The weighting in the mix depends on the\nS/N of the individual maps and the correlation, $r$, between the matter and\ngalaxy density. The weight of the tracers can be reduced by hand. For moderate\nmixing, the S/N in the mass map improves by a factor $\\sim2-3$ for\n$r\\gtrsim0.4$; the systematic offset between a true and apparent mass peak\ndistance ($z$-shift bias) in a lensing-only map is eliminated, even for weak\ncorrelations of $r\\sim0.4$.

The optical\nspectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,\nH-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening\nof the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by\nincreasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha\nluminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant\nprogenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict.

In this paper, we present an approach to foreground removal that\nexplicitly accounts for this frequency dependence.

By\nfocusing on delay-modes that correspond to image-domain regions beyond the\nhorizon, we show that it is possible to avoid the bulk of smooth-spectrum\nforegrounds. We map the point-spread function of delay-modes to k-space,\nshowing that delay-modes that are uncorrupted by foregrounds also represent\nsamples of the three-dimensional power spectrum, and can be used to constrain\ncosmic reionization.

In this paper we show that the\nobservational constraint does not need to be violated if the black holes in\nquasars have undergone a two-phase growing process: with a short\nsuper-Eddington accretion process they get their masses inflated by a very\nlarge factor until the feedback process becomes important, then with a\nprolonged sub-Eddington accretion process they have their masses increased by a\nfactor $\\ga 2$. The overall average efficiency of this two-phase process is\nthen $\\ga 0.1$, and the existence of black holes of $10^9 M_\\odot$ by redshift\n6 is easily explained.

We present a radio\ncontinuum survey of all z<1 GRB hosts in The Optically Unbiased GRB Host\n(TOUGH) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-Swift) GRB-SN\nhosts discovered before October 2006. We present new radio data for 22 objects\nand have obtained a detection for three of them (GRB 980425, 021211, 031203;\nnone in the TOUGH sample), increasing the number of radio-detected GRB hosts\nfrom two to five. The star formation rate (SFR) for the GRB 021211 host of ~825\nMo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a GRB host, places it in the category\nof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We found that at least 63% of GRB hosts\nhave SFR < 100 Mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have SFR > 500 Mo yr^-1. For the\nundetected hosts the mean radio flux (<35 uJy 3sigma) corresponds to an average\nSFR < 15 Mo yr^-1. Moreover, ~88% of the z<1 GRB hosts have ultraviolet dust\nattenuation A_UV < 6.7 mag (visual attenuation A_V < 3 mag). Hence we did not\nfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of GRB hosts. Finally,\nwe found that the distributions of SFRs and A_UV of GRB hosts are consistent\nwith those of Lyman break galaxies, Halpha emitters at similar redshifts and of\ngalaxies from cosmological simulations. The similarity of the GRB population\nwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that GRBs, a\nleast at z<1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are therefore\nless biased indicators than once thought. \n\n"}

Probing the redshift\nrange z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an X-ray\ndetected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation\nderived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. At z=1,\nwe find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two less\nthan in passive centrals at the same halo mass. This implies that the presence\nor lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochastic\nprocess. By z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the different\ngrowth rates of these objects. A similar but weaker trend is observed when\ndividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation.

We calculate the future\nevolution of the companion by injecting 2-6 10^47 ergs into the stellar\nevolution model of a 1 Msun donor star based on the post-explosion progenitors\nseen in simulations. We find that, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz collapse of the\nenvelope, the companion must become significantly more luminous (10 - 10^3\nLsun) for a long period of time (10^3 - 10^4 years).

One\ndifficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\\simeq$15 seconds)\nproposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may\nbe dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from\nthe LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a\n5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple\nboxcar smoothing technique.

The ZENS galaxies are classified into quenched,\nmoderately star-forming, and strongly star-forming using a combination of\nspectral features and FUV-to-optical colors; this approach optimally\ndistinguishes quenched systems from dust-reddened star-forming galaxies. The\nlatter contribute up to 50% to the (B-I) \"red sequence\" at ~10^10Msun. At fixed\nmorphological or spectral type, we find that galaxy stellar masses are largely\nindependent of environment, and especially of halo mass. As a first utilization\nof our photometric database, we study, at fixed stellar mass and Hubble type,\nhow (B-I) colors, color gradients and color dispersion of disk satellites\ndepend on group mass (M_GROUP), group-centric distance (R/R_200) and\nlarge-scale structure overdensity. The strongest environmental trend is found\nfor disk-dominated satellites with M_GROUP and R/R_200.

Based on spectra taken at multiple\nepochs of the 1.73d binary orbital period we determine physical as well as\norbital parameters for the donor star. We find the donor to be a B1.5IV\nsub-giant with effective temperature T=22,000-23,000 K. From the luminosity,\ntemperature and known distance to M33 we derive a radius of R = 8.9 \\pm 0.5\nR_sun.

Using the physical properties of\nthe B-star determined from the optical spectrum, we estimate the star's mass to\nbe M_opt = 11 \\pm 1 M_sun. Based on the X-ray spectrum, the compact companion\nis likely a neutron star, although no pulsations have yet been detected. Using\nthe spectroscopically derived B-star mass we find the neutron star companion\nmass to be M_X = 2.0 \\pm 0.4 M_sun, consistent with the neutron star mass in\nthe HMXB Vela X-1, but heavier than the canonical value of 1.4 M_sun found for\nmany millisecond pulsars. We attempt to use as an additional constraint that\nthe B star radius inferred from temperature, flux, and distance, should equate\nthe Roche radius, since the system accretes by Roche lobe overflow. This leads\nto substantially larger masses, but from trying to apply the technique to known\nsystems, we find that the masses are consistently overestimated. Attempting to\naccount for that in our uncertainties, we derive M_X = 2.2^{+0.8}_{-0.6} M_sun\nand M_opt =13 \\pm 4 M_sun.

In most cases the WD is disrupted and accreted\nonto the more massive core. However, in the rare cases where the merger takes\nplace when the WD is denser than the core, the core will be disrupted and\naccreted onto the cooler WD. In such cases the explosion might occur with no\nappreciable delay, i.e., months to years after the termination of the CE phase.\nThis, we propose, might be the evolutionary route that could lead to the\nexplosion of PTF 11kx.

Our goal is to improve the\nstudy of the combined radio-optical data by investigating if there is a\ncorrelation between the radio luminosity at 20 cm over the luminosity of the\noptical H\\alpha line (L[20 cm]/L[H\\alpha]) and line excitation ratios, where\nthe latter provide the spectroscopic classification in Seyferts, low-ionization\nnuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) and star-forming galaxies. We found that\nthe percentage of detected AGNs (Seyferts and LINERs) or composites is much\nhigher in the optical-radio sample than in the optical sample alone.

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

This consists in the Bayesian analysis of the observed galaxy\nspectral energy distributions with a comprehensive library of synthetic spectra\nassembled using realistic, hierarchical star formation and chemical enrichment\nhistories from cosmological simulations. We constrain the SFH of each galaxy in\nour sample by comparing the observed fluxes in the B, R, I and Ks bands and\nrest-frame optical emission-line luminosities with those of one million model\nspectral energy distributions. We explore the dependence of the resulting SFHs\non galaxy stellar mass and redshift. We find that the average SFHs of high-mass\ngalaxies rise and fall in a roughly symmetric bell-shaped manner, while those\nof low-mass galaxies rise progressively in time, consistent with the typically\nstronger activity of star formation in low-mass compared to high-mass galaxies.\nFor galaxies of all masses, the star formation activity rises more rapidly at\nhigh than at low redshift. These findings imply that the standard approximation\nof exponentially declining SFHs widely used to interpret observed galaxy\nspectral energy distributions may not be appropriate to constrain the physical\nparameters of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts. \n\n"}

The [4.5]\nfilter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame optical\nemission lines. We find that galaxies at M_z<-21.5 (roughly corresponding to\nL*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. The\nUV continuum slopes and the J_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. The most\nsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at these\nredshifts is better described by an SMC-like extinction curve, rather than the\ntypically assumed Calzetti reddening.

The proposed function provides an\nextraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with\nMach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. Compared to a\nlognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of\nmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This\nis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding\nmagnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T\nthat increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can\nbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)\nvelocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,\nand we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a\ncontinuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. It provides a new\nand unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not just\nvelocity) structure of turbulence.

PSR\nJ0529-6652 is detectable as a single pulse emitter, with amplitudes that\nclassify the pulses as giant pulses. This makes PSR J0529-6652 the second known\ngiant pulse emitter in the LMC, after PSR B0540-69. The fraction of the emitted\npulses detectable from PSR J0529-6652 at this frequency is roughly two orders\nof magnitude greater than it is for either PSR B0540-69 or the Crab pulsar (if\nthe latter were located in the LMC). We have measured a pulse nulling fraction\nof 83.3 \\pm 1.5% and an intrinsic modulation index of 4.07 \\pm 0.29 for PSR\nJ0529-6652. The modulation index is significantly larger than values previously\nmeasured for typical radio pulsars but is comparable to values reported for\nmembers of several other neutron star classes.

The most efficient mechanism known today is the\nsmall-scale dynamo, which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic\nenergy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field. The efficiency\nof the dynamo depends on the type of turbulence indicated by the slope of the\nturbulence spectrum v(l) \\propto l^{theta}, where v(l) is the eddy velocity at\na scale l.

In this work we analyze the properties of the small-scale dynamo\nfor low magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm, which denotes the ratio of the magnetic\nReynolds number, Rm, to the hydrodynamical one, Re. We solve the Kazantsev\nequation, which describes the evolution of the small-scale magnetic field,\nusing the WKB approximation. In the limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers the\ngrowth rate is proportional to Rm^{(1-theta)/(1+theta)}. We furthermore discuss\nthe critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm_crit, which is required for\nsmall-scale dynamo action. The value of Rm_crit is roughly 100 for Kolmogorov\nturbulence and 2700 for Burgers.

The recently demonstrated correlation\nbetween timing noise and variation of pulse profile motivates us to further\ninvestigate its origins. We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes. Considering the existence of the ultracompact binary white dwarf of\norbital period of 5.4 minute, HM Cancri, such orbital periods to pulsar\nbinaries are not strange. The change of latitude of the magnetic moment\nexceeding the range of emission beam of a pulsar results in the intermittency,\nwhich explains the behavior of PSR B1931+24.

We write the first crossing distribution as\na formal series, ordered by the number of times a walk upcrosses the barrier.\nSince the fraction of walks with many upcrossings is negligible if the walk has\nnot taken many steps, the leading order term in this series is the most\nrelevant for understanding the massive objects of most interest in cosmology.\nThis first term only requires knowledge of the bivariate distribution of the\nwalk height and slope, and provides an excellent approximation to the first\ncrossing distribution for all barriers and smoothing filters of current\ninterest. We show that this simplicity survives when extending the approach to\nthe case of non-Gaussian random fields. For non-Gaussian fields which are\nobtained by deterministic transformations of a Gaussian, the first crossing\ndistribution is simply related to that for Gaussian walks crossing a suitably\nrescaled barrier. Our analysis shows that this is a useful way to think of the\ngeneric case as well. Although our study is motivated by the possibility that\nthe primordial fluctuation field was non-Gaussian, our results are general. In\nparticular, they do not assume the non-Gaussianity is small, so they may be\nviewed as the solution to an excursion set analysis of the late-time, nonlinear\nfluctuation field rather than the initial one. They are also useful for models\nin which the barrier height is determined by quantities other than the initial\ndensity, since most other physically motivated variables (such as the shear)\nare usually stochastic and non-Gaussian. We use the Lognormal transformation to\nillustrate some of our arguments. \n\n"}

The constructed maps reflect the N-body cosmic structures\non a range of scales going from the arcminute to the degree scale.

The scenarios investigated include a reference LCDM cosmology, a\nstandard coupled DE (cDE) scenario, and a \"bouncing\" cDE scenario. For the\nstandard cDE scenario, we find that differences in the lensing potential result\nfrom two effects: the enhanced growth of linear CDM density fluctuations with\nrespect to the LCDM case, and the modified nonlinear dynamics of collapsed\nstructures induced by the DE-CDM interaction. As a consequence, CMB lensing\nhighlights the DE impact in the cosmological expansion, even in the degenerate\ncase where the amplitude of the linear matter density perturbations,\nparametrised through sigma_8, is the same in both the standard cDE and LCDM\ncosmologies. For the bouncing scenario, we find that the two opposite\nbehaviours of the lens density contrast and of the matter abundance lead to a\ncounter-intuitive effect, making the power of the lensing signal lower by 10%\nthan in the LCDM scenario. Moreover, we compare the behaviour of CDM and\nbaryons in CoDECS separately, in order to isolate effects coming from the\ncoupling with the DE component.

Its pre-2012 observations make\nit the best documented SN progenitor in history, but have fueled debate about\nthe nature of its 2012 explosion --- whether it was a true SN or some type of\nviolent non-terminal event. Both could power shock interaction with\ncircumstellar material (CSM), but only a core-collapse SN provides a\nself-consistent explanation. The persistent broad emission lines in the\nspectrum require a relatively large ejecta mass, and a corresponding kinetic\nenergy of at least 10^51 erg, while the faint 2012a event is consistent with\npublished models of core-collapse SNe from compact (~60 R_Sun) blue\nsupergiants. The light curves of SN 2009ip and another Type IIn, SN 2010mc,\nwere nearly identical; we demonstrate that their spectra match as well, and\nthat both are standard SNe IIn. Our observations contradict the recent claim\nthat the late-time spectrum of SN 2009ip is returning to its progenitor's\nLBV-like state, and we show that late-time spectra of SN 2009ip closely\nresemble spectra of SN 1987A.

The most straighforward and self-consistent interpretation is that\nSN 2009ip was an initially faint core-collapse explosion of a blue supergiant\nthat produced about half as much 56-Ni as SN 1987A, with most of the peak\nluminosity from CSM interaction. \n\n"}

In an alternative formation channel, NSs are\nproduced via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a massive white dwarf (WD)\nin a close binary.

Numerical calculations with a detailed\nstellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre-\nand post-AIC evolution of close binaries. We investigated the mass transfer\nonto a massive WD in 240 systems with three different types of non-degenerate\ndonor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars. When the WD is\nable to accrete sufficient mass (depending on the mass-transfer rate and the\nduration of the accretion phase) we assumed it collapses to form a NS and we\nstudied the dynamical effects of this implosion on the binary orbit.\nSubsequently, we followed the mass-transfer epoch which resumes once the donor\nstar refills its Roche lobe and calculated the continued LMXB evolution until\nthe end.

Supposing that a small fraction of colored objects\nescaped hadronization and survived up to now in the form of quark-gluon nuggets\n(QNs), and also taking into account radiation, we investigate scalar\nperturbations of the FRW metrics due to inhomogeneities of dustlike matter as\nwell as fluctuations of QNs and radiation.

The first function (the effective\nequation of state) uniquely controls the expansion history of the universe. The\nremaining four functions appear in the linear cosmological perturbation\nequations, but only three of them regulate the growth history of large scale\nstructures. We propose a specific parameterization of such functions in terms\nof characteristic coefficients that serve as coordinates in the space of\nmodified gravity theories and can be effectively constrained by the next\ngeneration of cosmological experiments. We address in full generality the\nproblem of the soundness of the theory against ghost-like and gradient\ninstabilities and show how the space of non-pathological models shrinks when a\nmore negative equation of state parameter is considered.

Our observational campaign aims to better understand\nand describe the multiwavelength data, the physical properties of the system\ncomponents, and the short- and long-term behavior of the component fluxes in RS\nCae. We employ stellar atmosphere, stratified accretion-column, and widely used\nX-ray spectral models.

Our XMM-Newton data of RS Cae are clearly dominated by soft X-ray\nemission. The X-ray light curves are shaped by emission from the main accretion\nregion, which is visible over the whole orbital cycle, interrupted only by a\nstream eclipse. The optical light curves are formed by cyclotron and stream\nemission. The XMM-Newton X-ray spectra comprise a black-body-like and a plasma\ncomponent at mean temperatures of 36eV and 7keV. The spectral fits give\nevidence of a partially absorbing and a reflection component. Multitemperature\nmodels, covering a broader temperature range in the X-ray emitting accretion\nregions, reproduce the spectra appropriately well. Including archival data, we\ndescribe the spectral energy distribution with a combination of models based on\na consistent set of parameters and derive a lower limit estimate of the\ndistance d > 750pc.\n  Conclusions.

We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel.

The model yields good fits of the UV and Lyman-alpha LFs at\nz>~2. The weak evolution of both LFs between z=2 and z=6 is explained as the\ncombined effect of the negative evolution of the halo mass function, of the\nincrease with redshift of the star formation efficiency, and of dust\nextinction.

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane.

We show that the X-ray luminosity is strongly correlated with the\nstellar wind mass-loss-rate, with a power-law form that is slightly steeper\nthan linear for the majority of the less luminous, lower-Mdot B stars and\nflattens for the more luminous, higher-Mdot O stars. As the winds are\nradiatively driven, these scalings can be equivalently written as relations\nwith the bolometric luminosity.

However, finding consistent scenarios for\ninflationary magnetogenesis is a challenging theoretical problem. The\nrequirements to avoid an excessive production of electromagnetic energy, and to\navoid entering a strong coupling regime characterized by large values for the\nelectromagnetic coupling constant, typically allow one to generate only a tiny\namplitude of magnetic field during inflation.

In models where the linear matter power\nspectrum is suppressed by the scattering, we find that on nonlinear scales the\npower spectrum is strongly enhanced. This is due to the friction term\nincreasing the efficiency of gravitational collapse, which also leads to a\nscale-independent amplification of the concentration and mass functions of\nhalos.

The flat spectrum\nand variability are indicative of synchrotron emission originating in an\noutflow from the system, most likely in the form of a compact, partially\nself-absorbed jet, as is seen in LMXBs at higher accretion rates. The radio\nbrightness, however, greatly exceeds extrapolations made from observations of\nmore vigorously accreting neutron star LMXB systems.

Determination of the fundamental interactions that\ngovern matter under such extreme conditions is one of the major unsolved\nproblems of modern physics, and -- since it is impossible to replicate these\nconditions on Earth -- a major scientific motivation for SKA.

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius.

The exact nature of their progenitor systems however remain unclear.\nRadio emission from the interaction between the explosion shock front and its\nsurrounding CSM or ISM provides an important probe into the progenitor star's\nlast evolutionary stage. No radio emission has yet been detected from Type Ia\nsupernovae by current telescopes. The SKA will hopefully detect radio emission\nfrom Type Ia supernovae due to its much better sensitivity and resolution.\nThere is a 'supernovae rate problem' for the core collapse supernovae because\nthe optically dim ones are missed due to being intrinsically faint and/or due\nto dust obscuration. A number of dust-enshrouded optically hidden supernovae\nshould be discovered via SKA1-MID/survey, especially for those located in the\ninnermost regions of their host galaxies. Meanwhile, the detection of\nintrinsically dim SNe will also benefit from SKA1.

A first test of this approach is carried out by applying nested\nsampling to simplified models of global 21-cm data to compute the Bayesian\nevidence for the models.

The effectiveness of the cleaning may be improved by explicitly\nincreasing the hyperbolic wave speed or by cycling the cleaning equations\nbetween timesteps. In the latter, it is possible to achieve DivB=0. Chapter 4\ndevelops a switch to reduce dissipation of the magnetic field from artificial\nresistivity. Compared to the existing switch in the literature, this leads to\nsharper shock profiles in shocktube tests, lower overall dissipation of\nmagnetic energy, and importantly, is able to capture magnetic shocks in the\nhighly super-Alfvenic regime. Chapter 5 compares these numerical methods\nagainst grid-based MHD methods (using the Flash code) in simulations of the\nsmall-scale dynamo amplification of a magnetic field in driven, isothermal,\nsupersonic turbulence. Both codes exponentially amplify the magnetic energy at\na constant rate, though SPMHD shows a resolution dependence that arises from\nthe scaling of the numerical dissipation terms. The time-averaged saturated\nmagnetic spectra have similar shape, and both codes have PDFs of magnetic field\nstrength that are log-normal, which become lopsided as the magnetic field\nsaturates. We conclude that SPMHD is able to reliably simulate the small-scale\ndynamo amplification of magnetic fields. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis and\npresents some preliminary work demonstrating that SPMHD can activate the\nmagneto-rotational instability in 2D shearing box tests. \n\n"}

One major problem is that most galaxy shape measurement methods\nare subject to bias due to pixel noise in the images (\"noise bias\").

However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using\ncross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration\ntechniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles\ndriving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal.

Building upon recent Bayesian large-scale\ninference of initial conditions, we present a cosmographic analysis of the dark\nmatter distribution and its evolution, referred to as the dark matter\nphase-space sheet, in the nearby universe as probed by the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey main galaxy sample.

X-ray pulsations\nat $\\sim$18.81 s were clearly detected in the light curves obtained from both\nobservations. Pulse periods estimated during the outburst showed that the\npulsar was spinning up.

Spectroscopic redshifts are only available for a\nvery limited number of objects but can be used for creating statistical models.\nA broad variety of photometric catalogues provide uncertain low resolution\nspectral information for galaxies and quasars that can be used to infer a\nredshift. Many different techniques have been developed to produce those\nredshift estimates with increasing precision. Instead of providing a point\nestimate only, astronomers start to generate probabilistic density functions\n(PDFs) which should provide a characterisation of the uncertainties of the\nestimation. In this work we present two simple approaches on how to generate\nthose PDFs. We use the example of generating the photometric redshift PDFs of\nquasars from SDSS(DR7) to validate our approaches and to compare them with\npoint estimates. We do not aim for presenting a new best performing method, but\nwe choose an intuitive approach that is based on well known machine learning\nalgorithms. Furthermore we introduce proper tools for evaluating the\nperformance of PDFs in the context of astronomy. The continuous ranked\nprobability score (CRPS) and the probability integral transform (PIT) are well\naccepted in the weather forecasting community. Both tools reflect how well the\nPDFs reproduce the real values of the analysed objects.

However, it is unclear how molecules and grains are able to\ncondense within the ejecta, given the potentially harsh environment created by\nionizing radiation from the white dwarf. Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low. Given observations\nshowing that individual novae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we\nconcur with previous works attributing this bimodality to chemical\nheterogeneity of the ejecta. Nova outflows are diverse and inhomogeneous, and\nthe observed variety of dust formation events can be reconciled by different\nabundances, the range of shock properties, and the observer viewing angle.

However, only one, iPTF16geu, has\nbeen found to date, and many more are needed to achieve these goals. To\nincrease the multiply imaged SN Ia discovery rate, we present a simple\nalgorithm for identifying gravitationally lensed SN Ia candidates in cadenced,\nwide-field optical imaging surveys. The technique is to look for supernovae\nthat appear to be hosted by elliptical galaxies, but that have absolute\nmagnitudes implied by the apparent hosts' photometric redshifts that are far\nbrighter than the absolute magnitudes of normal SNe Ia (the brightest type of\nsupernovae found in elliptical galaxies).

Here, we use multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics and\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to explore the\nproperties of red supergiant (RSG) star explosions embedded in a variety of\ndense envelopes. We consider the cases of an extended static atmosphere or a\nsteady-state wind, adopting a range of mass loss rates. The shock-breakout\nsignal, the SN radiation up to 10d, and the ejecta dynamics are strongly\ninfluenced by the properties of this nearby environment.

Recent studies propose a\nsuper-wind phase with a mass loss rate from 0.001 up to 1Msun/yr in the last\nmonths/years of the RSG life, although there is no observational constraint\nthat this external material is a steady-state outflow. Alternatively,\nobservations may be explained by the explosion of a RSG star inside its complex\natmosphere. Indeed, spatially resolved observations reveal that RSG stars have\nextended atmospheres, with the presence of downflows and upflows out to several\nRstar, even in a standard RSG like Betelgeuse. Mass loading in the region\nintermediate between star and wind can accommodate the 0.01Msun needed to\nexplain the observations of 2013fs.

Consistent\nwith recent studies, the dynamo action is found to be sensitive to the aspect\nratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the\ndirection normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial\ndirection). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To\nexplain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a\nlong box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most\nefficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a\nresult, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal\n(stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux\nspreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are\npermeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the\ninstability.

It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to\nsystematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of\nSNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We\nperformed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties\nof SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley\nrapid binary evolution code. We also considered the influence of different\nmetallicities on the final results. Results: From our simulations, we found\nthat no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a CO WD\nand a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time.\nThis scenario mainly contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long\ndelay times. The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and\na He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and\ncover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from\nthis scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities. \n\n"}

When the local\ngravitational interactions between the scalar modes are sufficiently rapid, it\ncan cause the field to re-organize into a BEC of gravitationally bound clumps.\nWhile these clumps are stable when only gravitation is included, the picture is\ncomplicated by the presence of the axion's attractive self-interactions, which\ncan potentially cause the clumps to collapse. Here we perform a detailed\nstability analysis to determine under what conditions the clumps are stable. In\nthis paper we focus on spherical configurations, leaving aspherical\nconfigurations for future work. We identify branches of clump solutions of the\naxion-gravity-self-interacting system and study their stability properties. We\nfind that clumps that are (spatially) large are stable, while clumps that are\n(spatially) small are unstable and may collapse. Furthermore, there is a\nmaximum number of particles that can be in a clump. We map out the full space\nof solutions, which includes quasi-stable axitons, and clarify how a recent\nclaim in the literature of a new ultra-dense branch of stable solutions rests\non an invalid use of the non-relativistic approximation. We also consider\nrepulsive self-interactions that may arise from a generic scalar dark matter\ncandidate, finding a single stable branch that extends to arbitrary particle\nnumber. \n\n"}

We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large\nsample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC\ndefinitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the\nextremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the\ncriteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the\nCC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed\nfractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result\nis partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed\ngas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative\nagreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the\nsimulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs\nappears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the\nfraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are\nmore relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting\nCCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC\ncriteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is\ndependent on the CC criteria. We conclude that the thermodynamic structure of\ngalaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG shares many similarities with observations, but\nachieving better agreement most likely requires modifications of the underlying\ngalaxy formation model. \n\n"}

However, several secondary effects\nin the low redshift universe will produce \\textit{non-primordial} B-modes.

The resulting\nextinction, $A_V$, increases monotonically up to about 1 mag, 150 days after\ndiscovery. The inferred $R_V$ value also increases slightly with time, but\nappears constant in the range 4.5--8, beyond 100 days after discovery.

After few days, the HeI\n5876 A transition appears with a P-Cygni profile and an expansion velocity of\nabout 8700 km/s. Fifty days after maximum, the spectrum shows signs typically\nseen in interacting supernovae. A broad (FWHM~8000 km/s) Halpha becomes more\nprominent with time until ~150 days after maximum and quickly declines later\non. At these phases Halpha starts to show an intermediate component, which\ntogether with the blue pseudo-continuum are clues that the ejecta begin to\ninteract with the CSM. The spectra at the latest phases look very similar to\nthe nebular spectra of stripped-envelope SNe. The early part (the first 40 days\nafter maximum) of the bolometric curve, which peaks at a luminosity\nintermediate between normal and superluminous supernovae, is well reproduced by\na model in which the energy budget is essentially coming from ejecta\nrecombination and 56Ni decay.

Three\nsources are likely to be some of the fastest known stars in the Milky Way, with\ntotal Galactocentric velocities between 1000 and 3000 km/s, and are consistent\nwith having previously been companion WDs in pre-SN Ia systems. However,\nalthough the radial velocity of one of the stars is > 1000 km/s, the radial\nvelocities of the other two stars are puzzlingly consistent with 0. The\ncombined five-parameter astrometric solutions from Gaia and radial velocities\nfrom follow-up spectra yield tentative 6D confirmation of the D^6 scenario. The\npast position of one of these stars places it within a faint, old SN remnant,\nfurther strengthening the interpretation of these candidates as hypervelocity\nrunaways from binary systems that underwent SNe Ia. \n\n"}

As a\nconsequence, such scenarios can be constrained using the global 21-cm\nabsorption signal initiated by the UV radiation of the first stars. The\nExperiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES)\nrecently reported the first detection of such an absorption signal at redshift\n$\\sim 17$. While its amplitude might indicate the need for new physics, we\nsolely focus on the timing of the signal to test non-cold DM models. Assuming\nconservative limits for the stellar-to-baryon fraction ($f_{*}<0.03$) and for\nthe minimum cooling temperature ($T_{\\rm vir}>10^3$ Kelvin) motivated by\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we are able to derive unprecedented\nconstraints on a variety of non-cold DM models. For example, the mass of\nthermal warm DM is limited to $m_{\\rm TH}>6.1$ keV, while mixed DM scenarios\n(featuring a cold and a hot component) are constrained to a hot DM fraction\nbelow 17 percent.

We use this effect to constrain PMFs described by a\nspectrum of power-law type, extending our previous study (based on a\nscale-invariant spectrum) to arbitrary spectral index. We derive upper bounds\non the integrated amplitude of PMFs due to the separate effect of ambipolar\ndiffusion and MHD decaying turbulence and their combination. We show that\nambipolar diffusion is relevant for $n_{\\rm B}>0$ whereas for $n_{\\rm B}<0$ MHD\nturbulence is more important.

Due to the small radius of the NS the\naccretion is through an accretion disk and the outflow is in jets (or bipolar\ndisk winds). The r-process nucleosynthesis takes place inside the jets. To\naccount for the r-process abundances in the Galaxy we require that one in ten\ncases of a NS entering the envelope of a giant star ends as a CEJSN r-process\nevent. \n\n"}

This model, GLTofDE, surprisingly provides a framework to\nstudy not only temporal tensions in cosmology e.g. $H_0$ tension but also\nspatial anomalies of CMB e.g. the hemispherical power asymmetry and\nquadrupole-octopole alignment. In the mean field (or Landau) approximation of\nGLTofDE, there is a spontaneously symmetry breaking exactly like the Higgs\npotential. We modeled this transition, phenomenologically, and showed that\nGLTofDE can resolve both the $H_0$ tension and Lyman-$\\alpha$ anomaly in a\nnon-trivial way. According to $\\chi^2$-analysis the transition happens at\n$z_t=0.738\\pm0.028$ while $H_0=71.89\\pm0.93$ km/s/Mpc and\n$\\Omega^{like}_{k}=-0.225\\pm0.049$ which are consistent with the latest $H(z)$\nreconstructions. In addition, the GLTofDE proposes a framework to address the\nCMB anomalies when it is considered beyond the mean field approximation. In\nthis regime existence of a long wavelength mode is a typical consequence which\nis named the Goldstone mode in the case of continuous symmetries. This mode,\nwhich is an automatic byproduct in GLTofDE, makes cosmological constant,\ndirection dependent. This means one side of the sky should be colder than the\nother side in agreement with what has been already observed in CMB. In addition\nbetween initial stochastic pattern and the final state with one long wavelength\nmode, we can observe smaller patches or protrusions of the biggest remaining\npatch in the simulation. Our simulations show these protrusions are few in\nnumbers and will be evolved according to Alan-Cahn mechanism. These protrusions\ncan give an additional effect on CMB which is the existence of aligned\nquadrupole-octopole mode and its direction should be orthogonal to the dipole\ndirection.
