The Landau criterium\napplied to the two-component system determines a certain region in the velocity\nspace in which superfluidity may take place. Stationary waves arise out of this\nregion, but under the additional condition that the relative velocity of the\ncomponents does not exceed some critical value. Under increase of the relative\nvelocity the spectrum of the excitations becomes complex valued and the\nstationary wave pattern is broken. In case of equal velocities two sets of\nstationary waves that correspond to the lower and the upper Bogolyubov mode can\narise.

Generally, highly ordered states are more\nrobust in higher dimensions, while thermal and quantum fluctuations, which\nfavour disordered states, play a more important role in lower dimensions. The\ncase of a two-dimensional (2d) Bose fluid is particularly fascinating because\nof its \"marginal\" behaviour. In an infinite uniform 2d fluid thermal\nfluctuations at any non-zero temperature are strong enough to destroy the fully\nordered state associated with Bose--Einstein condensation, but are not strong\nenough to suppress superfluidity in an interacting system at low, but non-zero\ntemperatures.

The\nresulting quasi-one-dimensional spin model is a two-leg AFM ladder with\nfrustrating next-nearest-neighbor couplings along the legs. The individual\ncouplings are estimated from band structure calculations and by fitting the\nmagnetic susceptibility with theoretical predictions, obtained using ED.

In the case that the Hamiltonian undergoes spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the full symmetry group G to a finite residual gauge group H,\nparticles are given by representations of the quantum double $D(H)$ of the\nsubgroup.

A general and explicit factorization of the time evolution operator is\nderived with each factor having a clear physical interpretation. The\nfactorization consists of a geometric operator (path-ordered magnetic\ntranslation), a dynamical operator generated by the usual time-independent\nLandau Hamiltonian, and a nonadiabatic operator that determines the transition\nprobabilities among the Landau levels. Since the path-ordered magnetic\ntranslation and the nonadiabatic operators are, up to completely determined\nnumerical phase factors, just ordinary exponentials whose exponents are\nexplicitly expressible in terms of the canonical variables, all of the factors\nin the factorization are explicitly constructed. The numerical phase factors\nare quantum mechanical in nature and could be of significance in interference\nexperiments. The factorization is unique from the point of view of the quantum\nadiabatic theorem and provides a demonstration of how the quantum adiabatic\ntheorem (incorporating the Berry phase phenomenon) is realized when infinitely\ndegenerate energy levels are involved. Since the factorization separates the\neffect caused by the electric field into a geometric factor and a nonadiabatic\nfactor, it makes possible to calculate the nonadiabatic transition\nprobabilities near the adiabatic limit. A formula for matrix elements that\ndetermines the mixing of the Landau levels for a general, non-adiabatic\nevolution is also provided by the factorization. \n\n"}

To better understand the molecular origin of Debye peak we\nran large scale molecular dynamics simulations and performed several different\ndistance-dependent decompositions of the low frequency dielectric spectra,\nfinding that it involves processes that take place on scales of 1.5-2.0 nm. We\nalso calculated the $k$-dependence of the Debye relaxation, finding it to be\nhighly dispersive. These findings are inconsistent with models that relate\nDebye relaxation to local processes such as the rotation/translation of\nmolecules after H-bond breaking. We introduce the spectrumfitter Python package\nfor fitting dielectric spectra and analyze different ways of fitting the high\nfrequency excess, such as including one or two additional Debye peaks.

In contrast, some exactly solvable models\nshowcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small\nnon-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean\nthat a part may contain more information about the global temperature than the\nwhole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove\nthat local quantum thermometry at low $T$ is exponentially inefficient in\nnon-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we\nshow through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a\nharmonic thermometer (probe) jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by\nmeans of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like\nbehavior as $T \\rightarrow 0$. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the\nfact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature\nmeasurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped\ntranslationally invariant chain (for which low--$T$ thermometry is indeed\nexponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the\nlow-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a\ngapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample\ninteraction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency.

In our previous work\n[arXiv:1711.03528] such dynamics was attributed to the existence of \"quantum\nscarred\" eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized\nmodel.

We find that the majority of the eigenstates exhibit anomalous\nthermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs\nensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum,\nwe identify non-ergodic eigenstates that strongly violate the ETH, whose number\ngrows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same eigenstates were\nidentified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to\nexplain the revivals observed in experiment.

On phenomenological grounds, we identify the scaling variables as the\ndensity of thermal regions and the lengthscale that controls the decay of\ntypical matrix elements. Within this KT picture, the MBL phase is a line of\nfixed points that terminates at the delocalization transition. We discuss two\npossible scenarios distinguished by the distribution of rare, fractal thermal\ninclusions within the MBL phase. In the first scenario, these regions have a\nstretched exponential distribution in the MBL phase.

The particle region (P) adjacent to the wall, is described at the\natomistic level by molecular dynamics, while the outer region (C), described by\na continuum equation for the transversal momentum, is solved via a finite\nvolume method. Both regions overlap in the ``handshaking'' region where a\ntwo-way coupling scheme (C$\\to$P and P$\\to$C) is implemented. A protocol for\nthe C$\\to$P coupling was presented in a previous paper [Delgado-Buscalioni and\nCoveney, Phys. Rev.

We chiefly consider the most\nfundamental case of the inter-species repulsion with zero intra-species\ninteractions. Existence and stability regions for gap solitons (GSs) supported\nby the interplay of the inter-species repulsion and periodic potential are\nidentified. Two-component GSs are constructed by means of the variational\napproximation (VA) and in a numerical form. The VA provides accurate\ndescription for the GS which is a bound state of two tightly-bound components,\neach essentially trapped in one cell of the periodic potential. GSs of this\ntype dominate in the case of intra-gap solitons, with both components belonging\nto the first finite bandgap of the linear spectrum. Inter-gap solitons, with\none component residing in the second bandgap, and intra-gap solitons which have\nboth components in the second gap, are possible in a deeper periodic potential,\nwith the strength essentially exceeding the recoil energy of the atoms.\nInter-gap solitons are, typically, bound states of one tightly- and one\nloosely-bound components. In this case, results are obtained in a numerical\nform. For 2D solitons, the stability is identified in direct simulations, while\nin the 1D case it is done via eigenfrequencies of small perturbations, and then\nverified by simulations. In the latter case, if the intra-gap soliton in the\nfirst bandgap is weakly unstable, it evolves into a stable breather, while\nunstable solitons of other types get completely destroyed. The intra-gap 2D\nsolitons in the first bandgap are less robust, and in some cases they are\ncompletely destroyed by the instability.
