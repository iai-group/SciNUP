Pauksztello has independently introduced them as\nco-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of\ncomplexes in $K(B)$. We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's\ncategories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure\n$w$ defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and\nfunctorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For $Hw$ being the\nheart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical\nconservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category\nof complexes $K_w(Hw)$. For any (co)homological functor $H:C\\to A$ for an\nabelian $A$ we construct a weight spectral sequence $T:H(X^i[j])\\implies\nH(X[i+j])$ where $(X^i)=t(X)$; it is canonical and functorial starting from\n$E_2$.

One can often construct a certain\n$t$-structure which is 'adjacent' to $w$ and vice versa.

Such equations are ubiquitous in string\nfield theory and have recently attracted considerable interest also from\ncosmologists. Though these equations have been studied in the classical\nmathematical literature, it appears that the physics community is largely\nunaware of the relevant formalism. Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation. We show\nthat differential equations of infinite order do not generically admit\ninfinitely many initial data. Rather, each pole of the propagator contributes\ntwo initial data to the final solution. Though it is possible to find\ndifferential equations of infinite order which admit well-defined initial value\nproblem with only two initial data, neither the dynamical equations of p-adic\nstring theory nor string field theory seem to belong to this class. However,\nboth theories can be rendered ghost-free by suitable definition of the action\nof the formal pseudo-differential operator.

In many cases\nthe Casimir self-energy is the sum of cutoff-dependent (Weyl) terms having\ngeometrical origin, and an \"intrinsic\" term that is independent of the cutoff.\nThe Weyl terms make a measurable contribution to the physical situation even\nwhen regularization methods succeed in isolating the intrinsic part.\nRegularization methods fail when the Weyl terms and intrinsic parts of the\nCasimir effect cannot be clearly separated. Specifically, we demonstrate that\nthe Casimir self-energy of a smooth boundary in two dimensions is a sum of two\nWeyl terms (exhibiting quadratic and logarithmic cutoff dependence), a\ngeometrical term that is independent of cutoff, and a non-geometrical intrinsic\nterm. As by-products we resolve the puzzle of the divergent Casimir force on a\nring and correct the sign of the coefficient of linear tension of the Dirichlet\nline predicted in earlier treatments. \n\n"}

We expect to be able to detect and analyze\nmany cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very\nprecise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required.

In this paper we extend a new time-domain\ntechnique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the\ncase of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole.

In this paper I will argue that the coincidence is not a\nfine-tuning problem, but instead an artifact of anthropic selection.

In the specific case of cosmology, most measurements of dark\nenergy and dark matter will done during an epoch when large numbers of linear\nmodes are available to observers, so we should not be surprised at living at\nsuch a time.

In the both the extremal and non-extremal cases, the\ncollapse takes an infinite amount of observer time to complete. However, in the\nover-charged case, the collapse never actually occurs, instead one finds an\noscillatory solution which prevents the formation of a naked singularity. As\nfar as the infalling observer is concerned, the collapse is completed within a\nfinite amount of proper time. Thus, the gravitational collapse follows that of\nthe typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse.\n  Quantum mechanically, in the absence of induced quasi-particle production and\nfluctuations of the metric geometry, we take primary interest in the behavior\nof the collapse near the horizon and near the classical singularity from the\npoint of view of both asymptotic and infalling observers.

Then, we provide a general review on the recent developments of\nthe theory in three different but also related areas: (i) universal horizons,\nblack holes and their thermodynamics; (ii) non-relativistic gauge/gravity\nduality; and (iii) quantization of the theory. The studies in these areas can\nbe generalized to other gravitational theories with broken Lorentz invariance. \n\n"}

The minimal\nexamples typically involve Higgs scalars with a large charge with respect to a\n$U(1)$ (e.g. charges $(Z,1)$ in $U(1)^2$ with $Z\\gg 1$). This type of Higgs\nmultiplets play also a key role in clockwork $U(1)$ theories. We study these\nissues in the context of heterotic string theory and find that, while indeed\nthere is no new physics at the standard magnetic WGC scale $\\Lambda\\sim g_{IR}\nM_P$, the string scale is just slightly above, at a scale $\\sim\n\\sqrt{k_{IR}}\\Lambda$. Here $k_{IR}$ is the level of the IR $U(1)$ worldsheet\ncurrent. We show that, unlike the standard magnetic cutoff, this bound is\ninsensitive to subsequent Higgsing. One may argue that this constraint gives\nrise to no bound at the effective field theory level since $k_0$ is model\ndependent and in general unknown. However there is an additional constraint to\nbe taken into account, which is that the Higgsing scalars with large charge $Z$\nshould be part of the string massless spectrum, which becomes an upper bound\n$k_{IR}\\leq k_0^2$, where $k_0$ is the level of the UV currents. Thus, for\nfixed $k_0$, $Z$ cannot be made parametrically large.

The constraint from renormalizability and\nsmall back reaction entails that D(k) < mu^2/k^2 for large k, implying that\nobservable effects from initial conditions are more prominent in the low\nmultipoles. This behavior affects the CMB quadrupole by the observed amount\n\\~10-20% when mu is of the order of the energy scale of inflation. The effects\non high l-multipoles are suppressed by a factor ~1/l^2 due to the fall off of\nD(k) for large wavevectors k. We show that the determination of generic initial\nconditions for the fluc- tuations is equivalent to the scattering problem by a\npotential V(eta) localized just prior to the slow roll stage. Such potential\nleads to a transfer function D(k) which automatically obeys the\nrenormalizability and small backreaction constraints. We find that an\nattractive potential V(eta) yields a suppression of the lower CMB\nmultipoles.Both for curvature and tensor modes, the quadrupole suppression\ndepends only on the energy scale of V(eta) and on the time interval where\nV(eta) is nonzero. A suppression of the quadrupole for curvature pertur-\nbations consistent with the data is obtained when the scale of the potential is\nof the order of k^2_Q where k_Q is the wavevector whose physical wavelength is\nthe Hubble radius today. \n\n"}

This implies that the mass of the axion\ncan be adjusted independently of its couplings to ordinary matter, thereby\nproviding a new method of rendering the axion invisible. Second, we discuss the\nnew phenomenon of laboratory axion oscillations (analogous to neutrino\noscillations), and show that these oscillations cause laboratory axions to\n``decohere'' extremely rapidly as a result of Kaluza-Klein mixing. This\ndecoherence may also be a contributing factor to axion invisibility. Third, we\ndiscuss the role of Kaluza-Klein axions in axion-mediated processes and decays,\nand propose several experimental tests of the higher-dimensional nature of the\naxion. Finally, we show that under certain circumstances, the presence of an\ninfinite tower of Kaluza-Klein axion modes can significantly accelerate the\ndissipation of the energy associated with cosmological relic axion\noscillations, thereby enabling the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to\nexceed the usual four-dimensional relic oscillation bounds.

Classical and quantum mechanical\n  aspects Abstract: In this work we examine noncommutativity of position coordinates in classical\nsymplectic mechanics and its quantisation. In coordinates $\\{q^i,p_k\\}$ the\ncanonical symplectic two-form is $\\omega_0=dq^i\\wedge dp_i$. It is well known\nin symplectic mechanics {\\bf\\cite{Souriau,Abraham,Guillemin}} that the\ninteraction of a charged particle with a magnetic field can be described in a\nHamiltonian formalism without a choice of a potential. This is done by means of\na modified symplectic two-form $\\omega=\\omega_0-e\\F$, where $e$ is the charge\nand the (time-independent) magnetic field $\\F$ is closed: $\\dif\\F=0$. With this\nsymplectic structure, the canonical momentum variables acquire non-vanishing\nPoisson brackets: $\\{p_k,p_l\\} = e F_{kl}(q)$. Similarly a closed two-form in\n$p$-space $\\G$ may be introduced. Such a {\\it dual magnetic field} $\\G$\ninteracts with the particle's {\\it dual charge} $r$. A new modified symplectic\ntwo-form $\\omega=\\omega_0-e\\F+r\\G$ is then defined.
