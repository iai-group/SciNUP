Implementing expected improvement requires a choice\nof Gaussian process prior, which determines an associated space of functions,\nits reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is fixed, expected\nimprovement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in the RKHS. We\nbegin by providing convergence rates for this procedure. The rates are optimal\nfor functions of low smoothness, and we modify the algorithm to attain optimal\nrates for smoother functions. For practitioners, however, these results are\nsomewhat misleading. Priors are typically not held fixed, but depend on\nparameters estimated from the data. For standard estimators, we show this\nprocedure may never discover the minimum of f. We then propose alternative\nestimators, chosen to minimize the constants in the rate of convergence, and\nshow these estimators retain the convergence rates of a fixed prior. \n\n"}

The\nramified allocation problem aims at finding an optimal allocation plan as well\nas an associated optimal allocation path to minimize overall cost of\ntransporting commodity from factories to households.

Specifically, we investigate the\nconvergence of constant step-size gradient descent algorithms for solving this\nproblem. The challenge is that often the underlying cost function is neither\nglobally differentiable nor convex, and despite this one would like to have\nguaranteed convergence to the global minimizer. After some necessary\npreparations we state a conjecture which we argue is the best (in a sense\ndescribed) convergence condition one can hope for. The conjecture specifies\nconditions on the spread of the data points, step-size range, and the location\nof the initial condition (i.e., the region of convergence) of the algorithm.\nThese conditions depend on the topology and the curvature of the manifold and\ncan be conveniently described in terms of the injectivity radius and the\nsectional curvatures of the manifold. For manifolds of constant nonnegative\ncurvature (e.g., the sphere and the rotation group in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$) we show\nthat the conjecture holds true (we do this by proving and using a comparison\ntheorem which seems to be of a different nature from the standard comparison\ntheorems in Riemannian geometry).

This precise formulation has its roots in the work of\nCharles Spearman in 1904 and of Ragnar Frisch in the 1930's. Various topics\nsuch as errors-in-variables, factor analysis, and instrumental variables, all\nrefer to alternative formulations of the problem of how to account for the\nanticipated way that noise enters in the data. In the present paper we begin by\ndescribing the basic theory and provide alternative modern proofs to some key\nresults.

Alternatively, for each coordinate system, we observe the\ncoordinates of a subset of the points. The problem of estimating the global\ncoordinates of the $N$ points (up to a rigid transform) from such measurements\ncomes up in distributed approaches to molecular conformation and sensor network\nlocalization, and also in computer vision and graphics.\n  The least-squares formulation of this problem, though non-convex, has a well\nknown closed-form solution when $M=2$ (based on the singular value\ndecomposition). However, no closed form solution is known for $M\\geq 3$.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate how the least-squares formulation can be\nrelaxed into a convex program, namely a semidefinite program (SDP).

In\ncontrast, we consider monotone stochastic variational inequality (SVI) problems\nwhere the strong monotonicity and Lipschitzian assumptions on the mappings are\nweakened. In the first part of the paper, to address such shortcomings, a\nregularized smoothed SA (RSSA) scheme is developed wherein the stepsize,\nsmoothing, and regularization parameters are diminishing sequences updated\nafter every iteration. Under suitable assumptions on the sequences, we show\nthat the algorithm generates iterates that converge to a solution in an almost\nsure sense, extending the results in [16] to the non-Lipschitzian regime.\nMotivated by the need to develop non-asymptotic rate statements, in the second\npart of the paper, we develop a variant of the RSSA scheme, denoted by\naRSSA$_r$, in which we employ a weighted iterate-averaging, parametrized by a\nscalar $r$ where $r = 1$ provides us with the standard averaging scheme.

In order to get our result we use the\nindifference principle fulfilled by any Nash equilibrium, and the classical KKT\nconditions (in the vector setting), that are necessary conditions for Pareto\nefficiency. Our characterization enables us to design a\nstrong-Nash-equilibrium-finding algorithm with complexity in\nSmoothed-$\\mathcal{P}$.

An alternative framework for interpolating distributions,\nrooted in statistical mechanics and large deviations, is that of Schroedinger\nbridges (entropic interpolation).

We show that a recovery algorithm that consists of a low-rank\nrecovery stage followed by a sparse recovery stage will produce an accurate\nestimate of the target when the number of measurements is\n$\\mathsf{O}(k\\,\\log\\frac{d}{k})$, where $k$ and $d$ denote the sparsity level\nand the dimension of the input signal.

However, its wide adoption in real-world\nsystems is challenged by the time- and manpower-consuming site survey process,\nwhich builds a fingerprint database a priori for localization. To address this\nproblem, we visualize the 3-D RF fingerprint data as a function of locations\n(x-y) and indices of access points (fingerprint), as a tensor and use tensor\nalgebraic methods for an adaptive tubal-sampling of this fingerprint space. In\nparticular using a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework in [1] we\ncapture the complexity of the fingerprint space as a low-dimensional\ntensor-column space.

A reason for\nthis relatively low degree of popularity is the lack of a well developed system\nof theory and algorithms to support the applications, as is the case for its\nconvex counterpart. This paper aims to take one step in the direction of\ndisciplined nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. In particular, we consider in\nthis paper some constrained nonconvex optimization models in block decision\nvariables, with or without coupled affine constraints. In the case of without\ncoupled constraints, we show a sublinear rate of convergence to an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary solution in the form of variational inequality for a\ngeneralized conditional gradient method, where the convergence rate is shown to\nbe dependent on the H\\\"olderian continuity of the gradient of the smooth part\nof the objective.

A simple\nand natural strategy is to select the best assortment out of all those that are\nconstructed by fixing a threshold revenue $\\pi$ and then choosing all products\nwith revenue at least $\\pi$. This is known as the revenue-ordered assortments\nstrategy. In this paper we study the approximation guarantees provided by\nrevenue-ordered assortments when customers are rational in the following sense:\nthe probability of selecting a specific product from the set being offered\ncannot increase if the set is enlarged. This rationality assumption, known as\nregularity, is satisfied by almost all discrete choice models considered in the\nrevenue management and choice theory literature, and in particular by random\nutility models.

However, naive gradient methods generally converge\nslowly. Hence, much efforts have been made to accelerate various first-order\nmethods. This paper proposes two accelerated methods towards solving structured\nlinearly constrained convex programming, for which we assume composite convex\nobjective.\n  The first method is the accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method\n(LALM). At each update to the primal variable, it allows linearization to the\ndifferentiable function and also the augmented term, and thus it enables easy\nsubproblems. Assuming merely weak convexity, we show that LALM owns $O(1/t)$\nconvergence if parameters are kept fixed during all the iterations and can be\naccelerated to $O(1/t^2)$ if the parameters are adapted, where $t$ is the\nnumber of total iterations.\n  The second method is the accelerated linearized alternating direction method\nof multipliers (LADMM). In addition to the composite convexity, it further\nassumes two-block structure on the objective. Different from classic ADMM, our\nmethod allows linearization to the objective and also augmented term to make\nthe update simple. Assuming strong convexity on one block variable, we show\nthat LADMM also enjoys $O(1/t^2)$ convergence with adaptive parameters. This\nresult is a significant improvement over that in [Goldstein et. al, SIIMS'14],\nwhich requires strong convexity on both block variables and no linearization to\nthe objective or augmented term.\n  Numerical experiments are performed on quadratic programming, image\ndenoising, and support vector machine. The proposed accelerated methods are\ncompared to nonaccelerated ones and also existing accelerated methods. The\nresults demonstrate the validness of acceleration and superior performance of\nthe proposed methods over existing ones. \n\n"}

This permits the solution of larger problems with\nsmaller regularization and negligible truncation error. A new convergence\nanalysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm is developed, working towards a better\nunderstanding of epsilon-scaling.

Then, we show that any deep structured linear\nnetwork can be cast as a generic multilinear problem (that uses the Segre\nembedding). This is the {\\em tensorial lifting}. Using the tensorial lifting,\nwe provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of the\nfactors (up to a scale rearrangement). We finally provide the necessary and\nsufficient condition called \\NSPlong~(because of the analogy with the usual\nNull Space Property in the compressed sensing framework) which guarantees that\nthe stability property holds. We illustrate the theory with a practical example\nwhere the deep structured linear network is a convolutional linear network. As\nexpected, the conditions are rather strong but not empty. A simple test on the\nnetwork topology can be implemented to test if the condition holds. \n\n"}

RSBT treatment planning has more degrees\nof freedom than conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) due to the\naddition of emission direction, and this necessitates a fast optimization\ntechnique to enable clinical usage. // Methods: The multi-helix RSBT (H-RSBT)\ndelivery technique was considered with five representative cervical cancer\npatients.

The rectum, bladder,\nsigmoid, high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV), and HR-CTV boundary were\nthe structures considered in our optimization problem, called the asymmetric\ndose-volume optimization with smoothness control.

Simulations on New York City\n(NYC) taxi trip data show that our heuristics are up to 90% optimal and 10^5\ntimes faster than the (necessarily) exponential-time optimal algorithm.\n  Commercial ridesharing service providers generate significant savings by\nmatching multiple ride requests using heuristic methods. The resulting savings\nare typically shared between the service provider (in the form of increased\nprofit) and the ridesharing passengers (in the form of discounts). It is not\nclear a priori how this split should be effected, since higher discounts would\nencourage more ridesharing, thereby increasing total savings, but the fraction\nof savings taken as profit is reduced. We simulate a scenario where the\ndecisions of the passengers to opt for ridesharing depend on the discount\noffered by the service provider. We provide an adaptive learning algorithm\nIDFLA that learns the optimal profit-maximizing discount factor for the\nprovider. An evaluation over NYC data shows that IDFLA, on average, learns the\noptimal discount factor in under 16 iterations.\n  Finally, we investigate the impact of imposing a detour-aware routing policy\nbased on sequential individual rationality, a recently proposed concept.

The tradeoff is between energy efficiency,\nwhich decreases with the number of active sensors, and fidelity, which\nincreases with the number of active sensors. The problem of minimizing the\ntime-averaged mean-squared error over infinite horizon is examined under the\nconstraint of the mean number of active sensors. The proposed methods artfully\ncombine three key ingredients: Gibbs sampling, stochastic approximation for\nlearning, and modifications to consensus algorithms to create a high\nperformance, energy efficient tracking mechanisms with active sensor selection.\nThe following progression of scenarios are considered: centralized tracking of\nan i.i.d. process; distributed tracking of an i.i.d. process and finally\ndistributed tracking of a Markov chain. The challenge of the i.i.d. case is\nthat the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown\nparameter which must be learned.

The\nobjective of the problem is to determine the optimal thrust commands that will\nminimize the time-of-flight while satisfying the aforementioned constraints.\nSolving this problem quickly and reliably is challenging because (a) it is\nnonlinear and non-convex, (b) the validity of the solution is heavily dependent\non the accuracy of the discretization scheme, and (c) it can be difficult to\nselect a suitable reference trajectory to initialize an iterative solution\nprocess. To deal with these issues, our algorithm (a) uses successive\nconvexification to eliminate non-convexities, (b) computes the discrete\nlinear-time-variant system matrices to ensure that the converged solution\nperfectly satisfies the original nonlinear dynamics, and (c) can be initialized\nwith a simple, dynamically inconsistent reference trajectory. Using the\nproposed convex formulation and successive convexification framework, we are\nable to convert the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP) sub-problems. Through the use of Interior\nPoint Method (IPM) solvers, this sequence can be solved quickly and reliably,\nthus enabling higher fidelity real-time guidance for rocket powered landings on\nMars. \n\n"}

Ideally,\nparallel mini-batch SGD can achieve a linear speed-up of the training time\n(with respect to the number of workers) compared with SGD over a single worker.\nHowever, such linear scalability in practice is significantly limited by the\ngrowing demand for gradient communication as more workers are involved.

Unfortunately, such topology knowledge is\noften unavailable due to limited investment, especially for \\revv{low-voltage}\ndistribution grids. Also, the bus phase labeling information is inaccurate due\nto human errors or outdated records. For this challenge, this paper utilizes\nsmart meter data for an information-theoretic approach to learn the topology of\ndistribution grids. Specifically, multi-phase unbalanced systems are converted\ninto symmetrical components, namely positive, negative, and zero sequences.\nThen, this paper proves that the Chow-Liu algorithm finds the topology by\nutilizing power flow equations and the conditional independence relationships\nimplied by the radial multi-phase structure of distribution grids with the\npresence of incorrect bus phase labels. At last, by utilizing Carson's\nequation, this paper proves that the bus phase connection can be correctly\nidentified using voltage measurements.

Existing SDP solvers by classical convex optimization are\nexpensive to solve large-scale problems. Employing the low rank of solution,\nBurer-Monteiro's method reformulated SDP as a nonconvex problem via the\n$quadratic$ factorization ($Z$ as $XX^\\top$). However, this would lose the\nstructure of problem in optimization. In this paper, we propose to convert SDP\ninto a biconvex problem via the $bilinear$ factorization ($Z$ as $XY^\\top$),\nand while adding the term $\\frac{\\gamma}{2}||X-Y||_F^2$ to penalize the\ndifference of $X$ and $Y$.

The basic setting is that the objective is\nthe sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the\nd-th order derivative information available, and the second function is\npossibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed\napproximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find -- in that setting\n-- the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization.\nAlong that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the\nobjective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order\nmethods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ). A high-order tensor\nalgorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes\n(2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor\nalgorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1\n/ k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as\nestablished in Nesterov (2018), and Shamir et al.

Global climate model that describes the ice's thickness\nevolution requires an accurate spatial temperature profile of the Arctic sea\nice. However, measuring the complete temperature profile is not feasible within\nand throughout the Arctic icecap. Instead, measuring the ice's thickness is\ndoable with the acquisition of data from submarine and satellite devices.

The observer is designed in\na rigorous manner to drive the temperature profile estimation error to zero,\nfor a salinity-free sea ice model. Moreover, the proposed observer is used to\nestimate the temperature profile of the original sea ice model with salinity\nvia numerical simulation. In comparison with the straightforward open-loop\nalgorithm, the simulation results illustrate that our observer design achieves\nten times faster convergence of the estimated temperature. \n\n"}
