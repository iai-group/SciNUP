The B-DMFT is applicable for\narbitrary values of the coupling parameters and temperature and becomes exact\nin the limit of high spatial dimensions d or coordination number Z of the\nlattice. In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the\nB-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending\non whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be\novercome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian\nitself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal\nfooting and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling. It\nreproduces all previously investigated limits in parameter space such as the\nBeliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations and generalizes the\nexisting mean-field theories of interacting bosons.

Recent technological developments provide many possible\nrealizations of effectively one-dimensional systems. These devices promise to\ngive us access to a new range of phenomena. It is therefore very interesting to\ndevelop theoretical methods specific for such systems to model their behavior\nand calculate the correlators of the resulting theory. Incidentally, one such\nmethod exists and is known as Bosonization. It can be applied to\none-dimensional systems and effectively describes low energy excitations in a\nuniversal way. We use the example of a correlator known as the Emptiness\nFormation Probability to show that Bosonization fails to describe some long\nrange correlators corresponding to large disturbances (the EFP measures the\nprobability for the ground state of the system to develop a region without\nparticles). We trace this failure to the fact that Bosonization is constructed\nas a linear approximation of the full theory and we set up to develop a\ncollective description with the required non-linearity.

We\nfocus on the regime where the initial inter-atomic interactions dominate over\nthe kinetic energy and the disorder. At equilibrium in a trapping potential and\nfor small disorder, the condensate shows a Thomas-Fermi shape modified by the\ndisorder. When the condensate is released from the trap, a strong suppression\nof the expansion is obtained in contrast to the situation in a periodic\npotential with similar characteristics. This effect crucially depends on both\nthe momentum distribution of the expanding BEC and the strength of the\ndisorder. For strong disorder, the suppression of the expansion results from\nthe fragmentation of the core of the condensate and from classical reflections\nfrom large modulations of the disordered potential in the tails of the\ncondensate. We identify the corresponding disorder-induced trapping scenario\nfor which large atom-atom interactions and strong reflections from single\nmodulations of the disordered potential play central roles.

While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase. We present a simple variational ansatz for the\nground state in this more strongly coupled superfluid. We further generalize\nthe (s-wave) Hubbard model to d-wave pairing and address issues of potential\nrelevance to high temperature superconductors.

The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene\nquantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian. Similar to graphene model, the\neffective SOC in low-buckled geometry opens a gap at Dirac points and\nestablishes QSHE. The effective SOC actually contains first order in the atomic\nintrinsic SOC strength $\\xi_{0}$, while such leading order contribution of SOC\nvanishes in planar structure. Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled\ncounterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger\ngap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled\ngeometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is\nthe structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in\nlow-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature\nregime. In addition, the Rashba SOC in silicene is intrinsic due to its own\nlow-buckled geometry, which vanishes at Dirac point $K$, while has nonzero\nvalue with $\\vec{k}$ deviation from the $K$ point.

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and\ncorrect errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting\ncodes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a\none-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single\nphase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code\nused [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by\nencoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all\nthree qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by\nreversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a\nthree-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the\ncode can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process\nshould decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the\ncorrecting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or\nToffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single\nqubit, in 63 ns.

The interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon\nmodes, the gauge field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT\nlevel in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic\nphonons is interpreted as a strain pattern, allowing the calculation of the\nacoustic gauge field parameter in the GW approximation.

We then solve\nthe Boltzmann equation semi-analytically in graphene, including both acoustic\nand optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen and\nequipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the\nunscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation\npotential is negligible and strongly screened.

Topological (Chern) insulators are known to have a quantized Hall\nconductance. A natural question is how the Hall viscosity behaves for these\nmaterials. So far, most of studies on the Hall viscosity of Chern insulators\nhave focused on the continuum limit. The presence of lattice breaks the\ncontinuous translational symmetry to a discrete group and this causes two\ncomplications: it introduces a new length scale associated with the lattice\nconstant, and makes the momentum periodic. We develop two different methods of\nhow to implement a lattice deformation: (1) a lattice distortion is encoded as\na shift in the lattice momentum, and (2) a lattice deformation is treated\nmicroscopically in the gradient expansion of the hopping matrix elements. After\nestablishing the method of deformation we can compute the Hall viscosity\nthrough a linear response (Kubo) formula.

Quantum error correction protects\nquantum states by encoding a logical quantum bit (qubit) in multiple physical\nqubits. To be compatible with universal fault-tolerant computations, it is\nessential that the states remain encoded at all times and that errors are\nactively corrected. Here we demonstrate such active error correction on a\ncontinuously protected qubit using a diamond quantum processor. We encode a\nlogical qubit in three long-lived nuclear spins, repeatedly detect phase errors\nby non-destructive measurements using an ancilla electron spin, and apply\ncorrections on the encoded state by real-time feedback. The actively\nerror-corrected qubit is robust against errors and multiple rounds of error\ncorrection prevent errors from accumulating. Moreover, by correcting correlated\nphase errors naturally induced by the environment, we demonstrate that encoded\nquantum superposition states are preserved beyond the dephasing time of the\nbest physical qubit used in the encoding. These results establish a powerful\nplatform for the fundamental investigation of error correction under different\ntypes of noise and mark an important step towards fault-tolerant quantum\ninformation processing. \n\n"}

Recent experimental studies on a hole-doped version of BEDT\ncompounds reveal an enhancement of superconductivity and a rapid crossover\nbetween two different conducting phases above the superconducting dome. One of\nthese phases is a Fermi liquid, the other not.

The ac bias, due to high frequency irradiation, drives\nthe wire out of equilibrium. For coherent transport the photon absorption\nprocesses create multiple photon steps in the energy distribution, where the\nnumber of steps is dependent on the relation between the amplitude of the field\neV and the photon energy \\omega. Furthermore we observe that for the slow field\nregime, \\omega \\tau_D < 1, the photon absorption is highly time-dependent.

We therefore numerically\ninvestigate the interplay of confinement, lattice commensuration, and disorder,\nin the form of a random chemical potential. We begin by pointing out that the\nground state at commensurate filling spontaneously breaks the translational\nsymmetry of the lattice. This feature is absent in the conventional lattice\nregularization, which breaks the relevant symmetry explicitly, but is present\nin an alternative (symmetric) regularization that we introduce. Remarkably, the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking survives the addition of a random chemical\npotential (which explicitly breaks the relevant symmetry) in apparent\ncontradiction of the Imry-Ma theorem, which forbids symmetry breaking in one\ndimension with this kind of disorder. We identify the long range interaction as\nthe key ingredient enabling the system to evade Imry-Ma constraints. We examine\nspatially resolved energy level statistics for the disordered system, and\ndemonstrate that the low energy Hilbert space exhibits ergodicity breaking,\nwith level statistics that fail to follow random matrix theory. A careful\nexamination of the structure of low lying excited states reveals that disorder\ninduced localization is responsible for the deviations from random matrix\ntheory, and further reveals that the elementary excitations are charge neutral,\nand therefore not long range interacting. \n\n"}

In addition, thermodynamic and tunneling spectroscopies have\nled to the inference that the order parameter $\\Delta_{sc}$ is to be\ndistinguished from the excitation gap $\\Delta$; in this way, pseudogap effects\npersist below Tc. It has been argued by many in the community that the presence\nof these distinct energy scales demonstrates that the pseudogap is unrelated to\nsuperconductivity. In this paper we show that this inference is incorrect. We\ndemonstrate that the difference between the order parameter and excitation gap\nand the contrasting dependences of T* and Tc on hole concentration $x$ and\nmagnetic field $H$ follow from a natural generalization of BCS theory. This\nsimple generalized form is based on a BCS-like ground state, but with self\nconsistently determined chemical potential in the presence of arbitrary\nattractive coupling $g$. We have applied this mean field theory with some\nsuccess to tunneling, transport, thermodynamics and magnetic field effects.

The method relies on defining the coboundary\noperator of the local Weyl group, and giving a cohomological interpretation to\ncounterterms in the effective action in dimensional regularization with respect\nto this group. Non-trivial cocycles of the Weyl group arise from local\nfunctionals that are Weyl invariant in and only in the physical even integer\ndimension. In the physical dimension the non-trivial cocycles generate\ncovariant non-local action functionals characterized by sensitivity to global\nWeyl rescalings. The non-local action so obtained is unique up to the addition\nof trivial cocycles and Weyl invariant terms, both of which are insensitive to\nglobal Weyl rescalings. These distinct behaviors under rigid dilations can be\nused to distinguish between infrared relevant and irrelevant operators in a\ngenerally covariant manner.

Basically the same amplification mechanism is (according to our\nstandard model of cosmology) supposed to be responsible for the generation of\nthe initial inhomogeneities -- and hence the seeds for the formation of\nstructures such as our galaxy -- during cosmic inflation (i.e., a very early\nepoch in the evolution of our universe). After a general discussion of the\nanalogy (\\emph{analogue cosmology}), we calculate the frozen and amplified\ndensity-density fluctuations for quasi-two dimensional (Q2D) and three\ndimensional (3D) condensates which undergo a free expansion after switching off\nthe (longitudinal) trap.

We extend the work of C. Schoen\net al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 110503 (2005)], where it was shown that all states\ngenerated in a sequential manner can be classified efficiently in terms of\nmatrix-product states. In particular, we consider two scenarios: photonic\nmulti-qubit states sequentially generated at the cavity output of a\nsingle-photon source and atomic multi-qubit states generated by their\nsequential interaction with the same cavity mode. \n\n"}

We focus on the exchange\ninteraction oscillation in silicon based solid-state architectures with a\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian. This method easily applies to a general two-qubit\nHamiltonian. We show how the robust CNOT gate can achieve a very high fidelity\nwhen a single application of the composite rotations is combined with a modest\nlevel of Hamiltonian characterisation. Operating the robust CNOT gate in a\nsuitably characterised system means concatenation of the composite pulse is\nunnecessary, hence reducing operation time, and ensuring the gate operates\nbelow the threshold required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. \n\n"}
