The difference between these approaches has evolved\ninto a systematic effect that does not go away as higher orders in the\nperturbative expansion are added. We attempt to clarify under which\ncircumstances one or the other approach provides a better approximation to the\ntrue result. To this end, we propose to describe the Adler function series by a\nmodel that includes the exactly known coefficients and theoretical constraints\non the large-order behaviour originating from the operator product expansion\nand the renormalisation group.

Indeed, the maps in these categories may be\ndirectly interpreted as processes which communicate by two-way channels. The\nmaps of an SP-category may also be viewed as a proof theory for a simple logic\nwith a game theoretic intepretation. The cut-elimination procedure for this\nlogic determines equality only up to certain permuting conversions. As the\nequality classes under these permuting conversions are finite, it is easy to\nsee that equality between cut-free terms (even in the presence of the additive\nunits) is decidable. Unfortunately, this does not yield a tractable decision\nalgorithm as these equivalence classes can contain exponentially many terms.\nHowever, the rather special properties of these free categories -- and, thus,\nof two-way communication -- allow one to devise a tractable algorithm for\nequality. We show that, restricted to cut-free terms s,t : X --> A, the\ndecision procedure runs in time polynomial on |X||A|, the product of the sizes\nof the domain and codomain type. \n\n"}

The inflaton potential depends on the\nstructure of the Higgs kinetic term. For instance, the inflaton potential is\nproportional to phi^2 and phi^{2/3} in the standard model and NMSSM,\nrespectively. It is also possible to have a flatter inflaton potential. \n\n"}

However, the\nbroad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles\ncould only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII\nprogram concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c\nflourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the\nTevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the\ndeconfinement regime.

Dyson\nspheres, in a {\\it fully nonlinear covariant} theory of gravity with the\nsimplest galileon field. We integrate exactly all the field equations once,\nreducing them to first order nonlinear equations. For the simplest galileon,\nstatic solutions come on {\\it six} distinct branches. On one, a Dyson sphere\nsurrounds itself with a galileon hair, which far away looks like a hair of any\nBrans-Dicke field. The hair changes below the Vainshtein scale, where the extra\ngalileon terms dominate the minimal gradients of the field. Their hair looks\nmore like a fuzz, because the galileon terms are suppressed by the derivative\nof the volume determinant. It shuts off the `hair bunching' over the `angular'\n2-sphere. Hence the fuzz remains dilute even close to the source. This is\nreally why the Vainshtein's suppression of the modifications of gravity works\nclose to the source. On the other five branches, the static solutions are all\n{\\it singular} far from the source, and shuttered off from asymptotic infinity.\nOne of them, however, is really the self-accelerating branch, and the\nsingularity is removed by turning on time dependence. We give examples of\nregulated solutions, where the Dyson sphere explodes outward, and its\nself-accelerating side is nonsingular. These constructions may open channels\nfor nonperturbative transitions between branches, which need to be addressed\nfurther to determine phenomenological viability of multi-branch gravities. \n\n"}

Requiring $b$-jets in addition to missing energy $\\eslt$ should,\ntherefore, enhance the supersymmetry signal relative to Standard Model\nbackgrounds. We quantify the increase in the supersymmetry reach of the LHC\nfrom $b$-tagging in a variety of well-motivated models of supersymmetry. We\nalso explore $top$-tagging at the LHC. Second, we explore the prospects for\ndetecting the direct production of third generation squarks in models with an\ninverted squark mass hierarchy. This is signalled by $b$-jets + $\\eslt$ events\nharder than in the Standard Model, but softer than those from the production of\ngluinos and heavier squarks. We find that these events can be readily separated\nfrom SM background (for third generation squark masses in the 200-400 GeV\nrange), and the contamination from the much heavier gluinos and squarks\nalthough formidable can effectively be suppressed.

The most natural way to do this - and the simplest, once the\n(substantial) groundwork has been laid - is to consider promonoidal categories\nas an instance of the general theory of pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory.\nAccordingly, we describe and explain the notions of monoidal bicategory and\npseudomonoid therein.\n  The higher-dimensional nature of monoidal bicategories presents serious\nnotational difficulties, since to use the natural analogue of the commutative\ndiagrams used in ordinary category theory would require the use of\nthree-dimensional diagrams.

This mechanism requires that the quadratic divergences, or tadpoles\nof the three gauge-theory couplings, unify at a certain scale. We verify this\nstatement, and find that this occurs at \\Lambda_u ~ 4x10^7 GeV. The tadpole\ncancellation condition, together with the dilaton self-energy, fixes the value\nof the unified tadpole coefficient to be 1/[4 ln(\\Lambda_cut/\\Lambda_u)]. The\nobserved values of the coupling constants at \\Lambda_u then implies \\Lambda_cut\n~ 4x10^18 GeV, which is close to the value of the reduced Planck mass\nMR_Pl=M_Pl/sqrt(8 pi)=2.4 x 10^18 GeV.

The\nformalism also includes experimental measurements on the modulus in the region\n0.65-0.70 GeV, taken from the most recent $e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ experiments,\nand recent measurements of the form factor on the spacelike axis. By combining\nthe results obtained with inputs from CMD2, SND, BABAR and KLOE, we make the\npredictions $a_\\mu^{\\pi\\pi, \\LO}\\,[2 m_\\pi,\\, 0.30 \\gev]=(0.553 \\pm 0.004)\n\\times 10^{-10}$ and $a_\\mu^{\\pi\\pi, \\LO}\\,[0.30 \\gev,\\, 0.63 \\gev]=(133. 083\n\\pm 0.837)\\times 10^{-10}$.

While their chiral limit is\nwell understood, recent measurements of the gamma^* omega pi^0 and gamma^*\ngamma pi^0 form factors at high photon virtualities seem to depart from the\nsimplest scaling behavior suggested by QCD. Here we attempt to describe them in\ntheir whole measured energy regimes within the Resonance Chiral Theory, a\nframework which naturally incorporates the chiral limit constraints and extends\nto higher energies by including the resonances as active fields.\n  Specifically, we obtained an accurate description of the data up to 2 GeV on\nthe former form factor by including three multiplets of vector resonances. Good\nagreement with measurements of the latter was possible even in the single\nresonance approximation, although we propose to measure the e^+e^- to\nmu^+mu^-pi^0 cross-section and di-muon invariant mass distribution to better\ncharacterize this form factor.

The duality between monads and\ncomonads corresponds, in general, to a symmetry between construction and\nobservation, for instance between raising an exception and looking up a state.\nThanks to the properties of adjunction one may go one step further: the\ncoKleisli-on-Kleisli category of a monad provides a kind of observation with\nrespect to a given construction, while dually the Kleisli-on-coKleisli category\nof a comonad provides a kind of construction with respect to a given\nobservation. In the previous examples this gives rise to catching an exception\nand updating a state. However, the interpretation of computational effects is\nusually based on a category which is not self-dual, like the category of sets.\nThis leads to a breaking of the monad-comonad duality. For instance, in a\ndistributive category the state effect has much better properties than the\nexception effect.

We show that the dominant annihilation channels of\nthe light DM in the Sun and the Galactic Center are either $b\\bar b$ or $t\\bar\nt$, while the heavy DM annihilation is completely dominated by $Zh$ channel.\nThe latter produces a hard neutrino spectrum which has not been previously\nanalyzed.

Therefore we use a metric which incorporates the fundamental quarks\nby embedding the coincident D7 branes in the Klebanov-Tseytlin background and a\nfinite temperature is switched on by inserting a black hole into the\nbackground, known as OKS-BH metric. Further inclusion of an additional UV cap\nto the metric prepares the dual gauge theory to run similar to thermal QCD.\nMoreover $\\hat{q}$ is usually defined in the literature from the Glauber-model\nperturbative QCD evaluation of the Wilson loop, which has no reasons to hold if\nthe coupling is large and is thus against the main idea of gauge-gravity\nduality. Thus we use an appropriate definition of $\\hat{q}$: $\\hat{q} L^- =\n1/L^2$, where $L$ is the separation for which the Wilson loop is equal to some\nspecific value.

Using the delocalized type IIA SYZ mirror (with\n$SU(3)$ structure) of the holographic type IIB dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD of\narXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 as constructed in arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at finite\ncoupling and number of colors ($N_c$ = Number of $D5(\\overline{D5}$)-branes\nwrapping a vanishing two-cycle in the top-down holographic construct of\narXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 = ${\\cal O}(1)$ in the IR in the MQGP limit of\narXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at the end of a Seiberg duality cascade), we obtain\nanalytical (not just numerical) expressions for the vector and scalar meson\nspectra and compare our results with previous calculations of hep-th/0412141,\narXiv:1409.0559 [hep-th], and obtain a closer match with the Particle Data\nGroup (PDG) results (Chin.

This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning to\nthe underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like the\nHiggs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and the\nBEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed by\ncarefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phase\ndiagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms of\ngauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states. Using gauge-invariant perturbation\ntheory, as developed by Froehlich, Morchio, and Strocchi, it is possible to\nrederive conventional perturbation theory. This derivation explicitly shows why\nthe description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,\ngauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, but\nalso of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful.

We study\nuniversal dynamics after a cooling quench, focusing on situations where the\ntime evolution represents a pure rescaling of spatial correlations, with time\ndefining the scale parameter. The non-equilibrium initial condition set by the\nquench induces a redistribution of particles in momentum space. Depending on\nconservation laws, this can take the form of a wave-turbulent flux or of a more\ngeneral self-similar evolution, signaling the critically slowed approach to a\nnon-thermal fixed point. We identify such fixed points using a non-perturbative\nkinetic theory of collective scattering between highly occupied long-wavelength\nmodes. In contrast, a wave-turbulent flux, possible in the perturbative\nBoltzmann regime, builds up in a critically accelerated self-similar manner. A\nkey result is the simple analytical universal scaling form of the\nnon-perturbative many-body scattering matrix, for which we lay out the concrete\nconditions under which it applies.

A physical content of\nthe semiclassical approximation is that the quantum fluctuations effects are\nsuppressed and vanish asymptotically. The chiral as well as $U(1)_A$ breakings\nin QCD result from quantum fluctuations. Hence these breakings must be\nsuppressed high in the spectrum and the spectrum of high-lying hadrons must\nexhibit $U(2)_L \\times U(2)_R$ symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian.

As intuitively expected, the graviton is\neffectively four dimensional at intermediate scales and becomes five\ndimensional at large scales. However in the holographic effective theory the\nessentially 4D radion dominates at long distances and gives rise to scalar\nanti-gravity. The holographic description shows that at large distances the GRS\nmodel is equivalent to the model recently proposed by Dvali, Gabadadze and\nPorrati (DGP), where a tensionless brane is embedded into 5D Minkowski space,\nwith an additional induced 4D Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane.

In the case of a finite cyclic\norbifold group, we use the characteristic series for the two-variable genus to\ndefine an analytic equivariant genus in Grojnowski's equivariant elliptic\ncohomology, and we show that this gives precisely the orbifold two-variable\ngenus. The second purpose of this paper is to study the effect of varying the\nBU<6>-structure in the Borel-equivariant sigma orientation. We show that\nvarying the BU<6>-structure by a class in the third cohomology of the orbifold\ngroup produces discrete torsion in the sense of Vafa. This result was first\nobtained by Sharpe, for a different orbifold genus and using different methods. \n\n"}

The set of all programs is partitioned into equivalence\nclasses. Two programs are equivalent if they are essentially the same program.\nThe set of equivalence classes forms the category of algorithms. Although the\nset of programs does not even form a category, the set of algorithms form a\ncategory with extra structure. The conditions we give that describe when two\nprograms are essentially the same turn out to be coherence relations that\nenrich the category of algorithms with extra structure. Universal properties of\nthe category of algorithms are proved. \n\n"}

We show how this is modified by lowest-order terms\nbreaking Wigner symmetry and prove general energy convexity results for SU(N).\nWe also discuss the inclusion of Wigner-symmetric three and four-nucleon force\nterms. \n\n"}

It is found that the models\npredict too large proton fractions, although one of the models (G2) predicts an\nacceptable EOS. This is caused by the isovector terms. Except G2, the other two\nmodels predict anomalous NMFP. In order to minimize the anomaly, besides an\nacceptable EOS, a large M* is favorable. A model with large M* retains the\nregularity in the NMFP even for a small neutron fraction. \n\n"}

Special attention is given to flavor SU(3) breaking. In this\napproach, isoscalar and isovector magnetic moments are treated separately in\nview of their different behavior under SU(3) breaking. We conclude that the\nanomalous magnetic moment associated with the flavor singlet current is small.\nTogether with the small isoscalar anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon,\nthis implies suppression of the strange magnetic moment of the proton which is\nfound to be small and positive, mu^(s) = (0.16 \\pm 0.03) mu_N in units of the\nnuclear magneton. \n\n"}
