This has led\nnaturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of\n\"generalized\" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic\nfactorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process\ndependent Wilson line structures. In other words, to recover a factorization\nformula, it has become common to assume that it is sufficient to simply modify\nthe Wilson lines in the parton correlation functions for each separate hadron.\nIn this paper, we will illustrate by direct counter-example that this is not\npossible in a non-Abelian gauge theory. Since a proof of generalized transverse\nmomentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard\nhadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a\ngeneral proof does not exist. Therefore, to make the counter-argument clear and\nexplicit, we illustrate with a specific calculation for a double spin asymmetry\nin a spectator model with a non-Abelian gauge field. The observed breakdown of\ngeneralized transverse momentum dependent factorization challenges the notion\nthat the role of parton transverse momentum in such processes can be described\nusing separate correlation functions for each external hadron. \n\n"}

The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse\nproportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons\nand neutrons to the same relative fractions. Based on these two properties the\nhigh-momentum distribution function for asymmetric nuclei has been modeled and\ndemonstrated that it describes reasonably well the high-momentum\ncharacteristics of light nuclei. However, the most surprising result is\nobtained for neutron rich nuclei with large A, for which a substantial relative\nabundance of high-momentum protons as compared to neutrons is predicted.

The reactions are treated as\nbirth-death processes and the first stage of the derivation is at the single\nparticle level, taking into account the death process, whilst the second stage\nconsiders an ensemble of these particles including the birth process. Using\nthis model we have investigated different types of pattern formation across the\nvertices on a range of networks. Importantly, the CTRW defines the Laplacian\noperator on the network in a non \\emph{ad-hoc} manner and the pattern formation\ndepends on the structure of this Laplacian. Here we focus attention on CTRWs\nwith exponential waiting times for two cases; one in which the rate parameter\nis constant for all vertices and the other where the rate parameter is\nproportional to the vertex degree. This results in nonsymmetric and symmetric\nCTRW Laplacians respectively. In the case of symmetric Laplacians, pattern\nformation follows from the Turing instability.

However, in the absence of a preferred model for the\nearly universe, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameter\nestimates are strongly prejudiced by the assumed power-law form of PPS. In this\npaper, for the first time, we perform cosmological parameter estimation\nallowing the free form of the primordial spectrum. This is in fact the most\ngeneral approach to estimate cosmological parameters without assuming any\nparticular form for the primordial spectrum. We use direct reconstruction of\nthe PPS for any point in the cosmological parameter space using recently\nmodified Richardson-Lucy algorithm however other alternative reconstruction\nmethods could be used for this purpose as well. We use WMAP 9 year data in our\nanalysis considering CMB lensing effect and we report, for the first time, that\nthe flat spatial universe with no cosmological constant is ruled out by more\nthan 4\\sigma confidence limit without assuming any particular form of the\nprimordial spectrum.

Our results on the estimated cosmological\nparameters show that higher values of baryonic and matter density and lower\nvalue of Hubble parameter (in comparison to the estimated values by assuming\npower-law PPS) is preferred by the data.

The unfolding method is shown to recover the input\nv_2-v_4 distributions for multiplicities similar to those observed in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at the LHC.

These model\nelements, whose dependence on relative azimuth angle has the form\n$\\cos[m(\\phi_1-\\phi_2)]$ where $m > 2$, were introduced to support a\nhydrodynamic flow interpretation of the same-side ($|\\phi_1-\\phi_2| < \\pi/2$)\n2D peak in the correlations. Previous studies have shown that the $m > 2$\nharmonics are not required by the data, that they destabilize the fitting\nmodels, and that their net effect is to decompose the same-side peak into two\ncomponents, one being dependent on and the other being independent of relative\npseudorapidity. Thus we are lead to question whether descriptions of angular\ncorrelation data including higher-order harmonics inform our understanding of\nthe same-side peak or heavy-ion collisions in general. Results from analysis of\ntwo-dimensional angular correlation data from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion\nCollider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that the RHIC data do\nnot exclude a single-Gaussian hypothesis for the same-side peak.

Those non-Gaussian effects are\nsystematically insignificant and can be accommodated by minor perturbations to\nthe same-side 2D Gaussian peak model, which act locally at small relative\nazimuth.

Conclusions: A\nnew mean-field-plus-pairing approach is introduced to compute properties of\nopen-shell nuclei. The formalism provides an efficient and powerful alternative\nto the computation of both ground-state properties and monopole energies of\nopen-shell nuclei. We find ground-state properties to be well reproduced in\nthis approach. However, as many have concluded before us, we find that pairing\ncorrelations are unlikely to provide an answer to the question of ''why is Tin\nso soft?'' \n\n"}

The purpose of\nthis study is twofold. First, we improve our previous event-by-event studies,\nby properly implementing $p_t$ dependence in the modeling. We show that, within\nthe jet \"monography\" scenario featuring a strong near-Tc-enhancement of jet\nenergy loss, the computed high-$p_t$ nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and\nthe harmonic coefficients in its azimuthal anisotropy $v_{2,\\,3,\\,4}$, agree\nwell with the available data from both Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)\nand Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Second, in light of current discussions on\npossible final state collective behavior in the high-multiplicity pPb and dAu\ncollisions, we examine the implication of final state jet attenuation in such\ncollisions, by applying the same model used in AA collisions and quantifying\nthe corresponding $R_{pA}$ and $R_{dA}$ and their azimuthal anisotropy. The\nhigh-$p_t$ $V_n$ provide a set of clean indicators of final state energy loss.\nIn particular we find in the most central pPb (5.02 TeV) and dAu (200 GeV)\ncollisions, $V_2$ is on the order of $0.01$ and $0.1$ respectively, measurable\nwith current experimental accuracy.

To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of\nthe produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with\nelementary Collins modulation.

The study of the modification of the\ntransverse momentum differential yields of charm particles in Pb-Pb collisions\nwith respect to pp collisions, quantified by the nuclear modification factor\n($R_{\\rm AA}$), can unravel details of the energy loss mechanism, such as its\ndependence on the quark mass and on the path length the parton travels through\nthe medium.

Production rates of cosmogenic isotopes in all the materials\npresent in the experimental set-up, as well as the corresponding cosmic rays\nexposure history, must be both well known in order to assess the relevance of\nthis effect in the achievable sensitivity of a given experiment. Although\nNaI(Tl) scintillators are being used in experiments aiming at the direct\ndetection of dark matter since the first nineties of the last century, very few\ndata about cosmogenic isotopes production rates have been published up to date.\nIn this work we present data from two 12.5 kg NaI(Tl) detectors, developed in\nthe frame of the ANAIS project, which were installed inside a convenient\nshielding at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory just after finishing surface\nexposure to cosmic rays. The very fast start of data taking allowed to identify\nand quantify isotopes with half-lives of the order of tens of days. Initial\nactivities underground have been measured and then production rates at sea\nlevel have been estimated following the history of detectors; values of about a\nfew tens of nuclei per kg and day for Te isotopes and 22Na and of a few\nhundreds for I isotopes have been found. These are the first direct estimates\nof production rates of cosmogenic nuclides in NaI crystals. A comparison of the\nso deduced rates with calculations using typical cosmic neutron flux at sea\nlevel and a carefully selected description of excitation functions will be also\npresented together with an estimate of the corresponding contribution to the\nbackground at low and high energies, which can be relevant for experiments\naiming at rare events searches. \n\n"}

Removal of\nfrequency-dependent interstellar medium (ISM) delays due to dispersion and\nscattering is a key issue in the detection process. Current timing algorithms\nroutinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to\ncold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct\nfor delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering\nintroduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in\npulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for\ninterstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements\nthat can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from\nfrequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.\nCyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest\n(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency\ndecomposition. As a step toward a more comprehensive ISM propagation delay\ncorrection, we demonstrate through a simulation that we can accurately recover\nimpulse response functions (IRFs), such as those that would be introduced by\nmulti-path scattering, with a realistic signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate\nthat timing precision is improved when scatter-corrected TOAs are used, under\nthe assumptions of a high signal-to-noise and highly scattered signal.

The expected scale of\nthe demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in\nsome cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data\nproduced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities\nand researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new\ntechniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes\nfrom HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and\nanalyze large and complex data volumes. Appropriately configured\nleadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling\nscientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC\nsimulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP\nexperiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate\ninterdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be\nrequired to meet HEP's research needs.

The operation of RHIC was outstanding with a\npolarized p+p run at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV with integrated luminosity that\nexceeded the sum of all previous p+p integrated luminosity at this $\\sqrt{s}$.\nFor the first time at RHIC asymmetric p+Au and p+Al runs were made but the p+Al\nrun caused damage in the PHENIX forward detectors from quenches that were\ninadequately shielded for this first p+A run. This was also the 10th\nanniversary of the 2005 announcement of the Perfect Liquid Quark Gluon Plasma\nat RHIC and a review is presented of the discoveries leading to this claim. A\nnew result on net-charge fluctuations (with no particle identification) from\nPHENIX based on previous scans over beam energy to look for a QCD critical\npoint is discussed which combined with Lattice QCD calculations and smaller\nerrors on the higher cumulants than previous measurements led to calculations\nof the baryon chemical potential and freezeout temperature in agreement with\nthe best accepted analysis from baryon/anti-baryon ratio measurements. \n\n"}

At given bombarding energy, for a given set\nof radii, the EV HRG model fits do not just yield a single $T-\\mu_B$ pair, but\na whole range of $T-\\mu_B$ pairs, each with similarly good fit quality. These\npairs form a valley in the $T-\\mu_B$ plane along a line of nearly constant\nentropy per baryon, $S/A$, which increases nearly linearly with bombarding\nenergy $E_{\\rm lab}$. The entropy per baryon values extracted from the data at\nthe different energies are a robust observable: it is almost independent of the\ndetails of the modeling of the eigenvolume interactions and of the specific\n$T-\\mu_B$ values obtained.

We show that,\nbecause of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when\n$K\\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state\nare narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After freezeout this wake\nbecomes soft particles with a broad angular distribution but with net momentum\nin the jet direction. We show that the particles coming from the response of\nthe medium to the momentum and energy deposited in it leads to a correlation\nbetween the momentum of soft particles well separated from the jet in angle\nwith the direction of the jet momentum, and find qualitative but not\nquantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed to\nextract such a correlation. By confronting the results that we obtain upon\nintroducing transverse momentum broadening and the response of the medium to\nthe jet with available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes\nfor understanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets. \n\n"}

To explore the currently-unknown territories in the nuclear\nchart far away from the stability, reliable theoretical predictions are\ninevitable.\n  Purpose: To provide a reliable prediction of production cross sections taking\ninto account secondary deexcitation processes, both particle evaporation and\nfission, a new method called TDHF+GEMINI is proposed, which combines the\nmicroscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory with a sophisticated\nstatistical compound-nucleus deexcitation model, GEMINI++.\n  Results: The method is applied for multinucleon transfer processes in\nlow-energy heavy ion reactions. It is shown that the inclusion of secondary\ndeexcitation processes, which are dominated by neutron evaporation in the\npresent systems, substantially improves agreement with the experimental data.\nThe magnitude of the evaporation effects is very similar to the one observed in\nGRAZING calculations. TDHF+GEMINI provides better description of the absolute\nvalue of the cross sections for channels involving transfer of more than one\nprotons, compared with the GRAZING results. However, there remain discrepancies\nbetween the measurements and the calculated cross sections, indicating a limit\nof the theoretical framework that works with a single mean-field potential.\nPossible causes of the discrepancies are discussed.\n  Conclusions: In order to perfectly reproduce experimental cross sections for\nmultinucleon transfer processes, one should go beyond the standard\nself-consistent mean-field description.

In particular,\nthe role of color flow is now being explored through many different\nobservables; one such observable is nearly back-to-back hadron correlations in\nproton-proton collisions which are predicted to be sensitive to states that are\nentangled via their QCD color charge. The PHENIX detector at the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider is well suited to study potential effects from color flow.\nAngular correlations between nearly back-to-back hadrons or a direct\nphoton-hadron are measured to study the prediction of color entanglement or\nfactorization breaking. The correlations can be treated in a\ntransverse-momentum-dependent framework where sensitivity to non-Abelian\neffects from color are predicted. These measurements are the first ever to\nsearch for experimental evidence of these entangled states and will help\nestablish color flow in hadronic interactions as a new area of focus within QCD\nresearch. Results are presented for proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass\nenergies of 200 and 510 GeV and proton-nucleus collisions at nucleon-nucleon\ncenter-of-mass energies of 200 GeV. World measurements of processes where\nfactorization is predicted to hold are also compiled and analyzed to compare to\nthe new experimental results presented here. The measured results do not\nindicate any obvious qualitative differences from observables where\nfactorization is predicted to hold. This indicates that quantitative\ncomparisons with phenomenological calculations will be necessary to identify\nthe magnitude of effects from color entanglement. As QCD is the only\nnon-Abelian quantum field theory known to exist in nature that admits bound\nstates, it will be essential to continue exploring unique QCD phenomena due to\ncolor interactions in controlled ways in the coming years. \n\n"}

It is thus an\nimportant concern to constrain these scenarios which also allow for experiments\nbelow the GeV scale. MURMUR is a new neutron-passing-through-walls experiment\ndesigned to constrain neutron-hidden neutron transitions in the context of\nbraneworlds scenarios. As our visible universe could be a 3-brane embedded in a\nmultidimensional bulk, adjacent hidden 3-branes are often expected. Their\nexistence can be constrained as matter exchange between braneworlds must occur\nwith a swapping probability $p$. A neutron $n$ can convert into a hidden\nneutron $n'$ when scattered by a nucleus with cross section $\\sigma (n \\to n')$\n$\\propto$ $\\sigma_E (n \\to n)\\ p$, where $\\sigma_E$ is the usual elastic\ncross-section. Hidden neutrons could therefore be generated in the moderator\nmedium of a nuclear reactor, where high-flux neutrons undergo many elastic\ncollisions.

Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}
