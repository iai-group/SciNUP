Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The importance of these second stars for understanding the\norigin of the elements in the early universe are manifold. While the massive\nfirst stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently\nobserved. They are the carriers of the information about the first stars, but\nthey are also capable of nuclear production themselves. For example, in order\nto use ultra or extremely metal-poor stars as a probe for the r-process in the\nearly universe a reliable model of the s-process in the second stars is needed.\nEventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions\nranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements,\nnot only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the\nC-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature,\nare thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase\nof intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low\nmetallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important\ndiscrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen. This may\nhint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal-poor evolved stars that\nare not yet included in the standard picture of evolution, as for example the\nhydrogen-ingestion flash.

Abstract: The optical and gamma-ray observations of GRB 080319B allow us to determine a\nfairly complete physical picture for this remarkable burst. The data indicate\nthat the prompt optical and gamma-ray photons were produced at the same\nlocation but by different radiation processes: synchrotron and synchrotron\nself-Compton, respectively. The burst emission was produced at a distance of\n10^{16.5} cm from the center of explosion by an ultra-relativistic source\nmoving at Lorentz factor of ~500. A straightforward inference is that about 10\ntimes more energy must have been radiated at tens of GeV than that released at\n~1 MeV. Assuming that the GRB outflow was baryonic and that the gamma-ray\nsource was shock-heated plasma, the collimation-corrected kinetic energy of the\njet powering GRB 080319B was larger than 10^{52.3} erg. The decay of the early\nafterglow optical emission (up to 1 ks) is too fast to be attributed to the\nreverse shock crossing the GRB ejecta but is consistent with the expectations\nfor the \"large-angle emission\" released during the burst.

The total gas mass in the\nplume (7x10^8 M_sun) and tail (1x10^9 M_sun) is about three times that in the\ncore of M86, which supports the scenario where most of the gas was stripped\nrapidly and recently.

These jets\ntransport the energy from the collapsed core to large distances, where it is\ndissipated in the form of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. In this paper we\nstudy the dynamics of ultrarelativistic jets produced in collapsars. Also we\nextrapolate our results to infer the angular energy distribution of the\nproduced outflows in the afterglow phase. Our main focus is to look for global\nenergetical properties which can be imprinted by the different structure of\ndifferent progenitor stars. Thus, we employ a number of pre-supernova, stellar\nmodels (with distinct masses and metallicities), and inject in all of them jets\nwith fixed initial conditions. We assume that at the injection nozzle, the jet\nis mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor $\\sim 5$), has a finite half-opening\nangle ($5^\\circ$), and carries a power of $10^{51} $erg s$^{-1}$. These jets\narrive intact to the stellar surface and break out of it. A large Lorentz\nfactor region $\\Gamma\\simmore 100$ develops well before the jet reaches the\nsurface of the star, in the unshocked part of the beam, located between the\ninjection nozzle and the first recollimation shock. These high values of\n$\\Gamma$ are possible because the finite opening angle of the jet allows for\nfree expansion towards the radial direction. We find a strong correlation\nbetween the angular energy distribution of the jet, after its eruption from the\nprogenitor surface, and the mass of the progenitors. The angular energy\ndistribution of the jets from light progenitor models is steeper than that of\nthe jets injected in more massive progenitor stars.

These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.\nAssuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv\\'en radius, we constrain the\nstellar magnetic moment to \\mu=(9\\pm5) 10^{25} G cm^3, which corresponds to the\nsurface field of 10^8 G.

Using automated algorithms for\ndetecting flux ropes and ejections in the global magnetic model, the effects of\nkey simulation parameters on the formation of flux ropes and the number of\nejections are considered, over a 177-day period in 1999. These key parameters\ninclude the magnitude and sign of magnetic helicity emerging in active regions,\nand coronal diffusion. The number of flux ropes found in the simulation at any\none time fluctuates between about 28 and 48, sustained by the emergence of new\nbipolar regions, but with no systematic dependence on the helicity of these\nregions. However, the emerging helicity does affect the rate of flux rope\nejections, which doubles from 0.67 per day if the bipoles emerge untwisted to\n1.28 per day in the run with greatest emerging twist. The number of ejections\nin the simulation is also increased by 20%-30% by choosing the majority sign of\nemerging bipole helicity in each hemisphere, or by halving the turbulent\ndiffusivity in the corona.

These are thought to\nappear as as type Ib/c and II SNe, and are associated with young stellar\npopulations. A type Ia SN is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonation\nof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose mass\napproaches the Chandrasekhar limit. Such SNe are observed in both young and old\nstellar environments. Here we report our discovery of the faint type Ib SN\n2005E in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, NGC 1032.\n  The lack of any trace of recent star formation near the SN location (Fig. 1),\nand the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 M_sun), argue strongly against a\ncore-collapse origin for this event. Spectroscopic observations and the derived\nnucleosynthetic output show that the SN ejecta have high velocities and are\ndominated by helium-burning products, indicating that SN 2005E was neither a\nsubluminous nor a regular SN Ia (Fig. 2). We have therefore found a new type of\nstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likely\ninvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. The\nSN ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of SN and likely\nadditional large amounts of radioactive 44Ti.

For n(r)~1/r the AMD\nis found to be independent of \\xi, in good agreement with its behavior inferred\nfrom the X-ray spectra of several AGNs.

Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably\nform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar \"bulges\" and steep central DM\nprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies\nthrough accretion and repeated mergers.

This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM\nframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow\ncentral DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions\nwhich remove low angular momentum gas.

In light of the last decade of\ndiscovery in the field of PN, we revise this framework, which, although\nsimplistic, can still serve as a benchmark against which to test theories of PN\norigin and shaping. Within the framework, we revisit the role of planets in\nshaping PN. Soker invoked a planetary role in shaping PN because there are not\nenough close binaries to shape the large fraction of non-spherical PN. In this\npaper we adopt a model whereby only ~20% of all 1-8 solar mass stars make a PN.\nThis reduces the need for planetary shaping. Through a propagation of\npercentages argument, and starting from the assumption that planets can only\nshape mildly elliptical PN, we conclude, like in Soker, that ~20% of all PN\nwere shaped via planetary and other substellar interactions but we add that\nthis corresponds to only ~5% of all 1-8 solar mass stars. This may be in line\nwith findings of planets around main sequence stars. PN shaping by planets is\nmade plausible by the recent discovery of planets that have survived\ninteractions with red giant branch (RGB) stars.

Its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long and followed\nby a bright X-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual optical\ncounterpart. During the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as an\nexpanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistent\nwith a faint supernova, emerged.

They\nare the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon\ndistance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to\nbe candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy\nproduction rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long\nGRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view\nthat GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs. We here suggest that many of the low\nluminosity GRBs, due to their low luminosity, can not trigger the current GRB\ndetectors and hence their contribution to the local gamma-ray energy production\nrate is missing. We find that the real local energy production rate by\nlow-luminosity GRBs, taking into account the missing part, which constitutes a\ndominant fraction of the total amount, could be sufficient to account for the\nflux of UHECRs. Due to the low-luminosity, only intermediate-mass or heavy\nnuclei can be accelerated to ~ 10^20 eV. We discuss the acceleration and\nsurvival of these UHE nuclei in low-luminosity GRBs, especially in those\nmissing low-luminosity GRBs.

The source was\nfound in a quiet state, and its far-infrared spectrum is consistent with a\npower-law with a spectral index of alpha ~ 0.7. Our Herschel observations were\npreceded by two 'orphan' gamma-ray flares. The near-infrared data reveal the\nhigh-energy cut-off in the main synchrotron component, which cannot be\nassociated with the main gamma-ray component in a one-zone leptonic model. This\nis because in such a model the luminosity ratio of the External-Compton and\nsynchrotron components is tightly related to the frequency ratio of these\ncomponents, and in this particular case an unrealistically high energy density\nof the external radiation would be implied. Therefore, we consider a\nwell-constrained two-zone blazar model to interpret the entire dataset. In this\nframework, the observed infrared emission is associated with the synchrotron\ncomponent produced in the hot-dust region at the supra-pc scale, while the\ngamma-ray emission is associated with the External-Compton component produced\nin the broad-line region at the sub-pc scale. In addition, the optical/UV\nemission is associated with the accretion disk thermal emission, with the\naccretion disk corona likely contributing to the X-ray emission. \n\n"}

If compact\nbinary mergers produce indeed gamma-ray bursts there should also be an\ninteraction region where an ultra-relativistic outflow interacts with the\nneutrino-driven wind and produces moderately relativistic ejecta. Each type of\nejecta has different physical properties and therefore plays a different role\nfor nucleosynthesis and for the electromagnetic transients that go along with\ncompact object encounters. Here we focus on the dynamic ejecta and present\nresults for over 30 hydrodynamical simulations of both gravitational\nwave-driven mergers and parabolic encounters as they may occur in globular\nclusters. We find that mergers eject $\\sim 1$% of a solar mass of extremely\nneutron-rich material.

This model can be used to constrain simultaneously the\nform, scatter (including its covariance) and evolution of the scaling\nrelations, as well as the masses of the individual clusters. In this framework,\nscaling relations between observables (such as that between X-ray luminosity\nand temperature) are modelled explicitly in terms of the fundamental\nmass-observable scaling relations, and so are fully constrained without being\nfit directly. We apply the PICACS model to two observational datasets, and show\nthat it performs as well as traditional regression methods for simply measuring\nindividual scaling relation parameters, but reveals additional information on\nthe processes that shape the relations while providing self-consistent mass\nconstraints. Our analysis suggests that the observed combination of slopes of\nthe scaling relations can be described by a deficit of gas in low-mass clusters\nthat is compensated for by elevated gas temperatures, such that the total\nthermal energy of the gas in a cluster of given mass remains close to\nself-similar expectations. This is interpreted as the result of AGN feedback\nremoving low entropy gas from low mass systems, while heating the remaining\ngas. We deconstruct the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation and show that its\nsteepening compared to self-similar expectations can be explained solely by\nthis combination of gas depletion and heating in low mass systems, without any\nadditional contribution from a mass dependence of the gas structure. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that a self-consistent analysis of the scaling relations leads\nto an expectation of self-similar evolution of the LT relation that is\nsignificantly weaker than is commonly assumed. \n\n"}

We set out a\nprocedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less\nenergetic magnetar bursts.

The 0.33-50 keV spectrum is described by\nthe sum of a hard Comptonized component originated in an optically thin\n{\\tau}~1 corona, a soft kTin~0.2 keV component interpreted as accretion disc\nemission, and of disc reflection of the hard component.

A simultaneous detection\nin EPIC-pn, EPIC-MOS2, and RGS spectra favours an astrophysical origin also for\nthe former, which has an energy compatible with Fe-L{\\alpha} and helium-like\nNe-K{\\alpha} transitions. Broadness of the two features suggests a common\norigin, resulting from reflection in an accretion disc with inclination of\n(30+4{\\deg}), and extending down to Rin=25(+16,-11) gravitational radii from\nthe compact object.

When a star is disrupted in a bound\norbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal\nbehavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is\ninitially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time ~ the original\nstellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher\nthan the Eddington rate. Furthermore if the star is disrupted close to the\nhole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris\norbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the\ndebris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris\nenergy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a\nspinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection,\nand circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of\nflare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that\nquasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the\ntidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve. The\nlate-time light curve may still show power-law behavior which is generic to\ndisk accretion processes.

The average physical properties of this circumgalactic medium\n(CGM) are determined by combining average absorption and emission measurements\nalong several extragalactic sightlines. However, there is a wide distribution\nof both, the halo emission measure and the \\ovii column density, suggesting\nthat the Galactic warm-hot gaseous halo is anisotropic. We present {\\it Suzaku}\nobservations of fields close to two sightlines along which we have precise\n\\ovii absorption measurements with \\chandran. The column densities along these\ntwo sightlines are similar within errors, but we find that the emission\nmeasures are different. Therefore the densities and pathlengths in the two\ndirections must be different, providing a suggestive evidence that the warm-hot\ngas in the CGM of the Milky Way is not distributed uniformly. However, the\nformal errors on derived parameters are too large to make such a claim. The\naverage density and pathlength of the two sightlines are similar to the global\naverages, so the halo mass is still huge, over 10 billion solar masses.

Yet, the clustering strength\nof cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass,\nsuch as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. If galaxy\ncharacteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, the\nbasic assumption of HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for\nassembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation\nstatistics. We use halo abundance matching and age matching to construct\nfiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additional\nmock catalogs with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit a\nparameterized HOD to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies in\neach catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels of\nassembly bias. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs generally\ndescribe the true underlying HODs well, validating the basic methodology.\nHowever, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs have\nsystematic errors that are statistically significant. In most cases, these\nsystematic errors cannot be identified using void statistics as auxiliary\nobservables. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy\nclustering should be subject to a non-negligible systematic error induced by\nassembly bias.

Most of the\nblack hole growth since z~1 is associated with star-forming hosts.\nNevertheless, ~15-20% of the X-ray luminosity density since z~1, is taking\nplace in the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram. For the z~0.40 subsample,\nthere is tentative evidence (2sigma significance), that AGN split by their UVJ\ncolours differ in Eddington ratio.

Results\n  from scaling the ISM opacity Abstract: The opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates the\naccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of\nplanets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3. The\nobservational result lies between these values, pointing to core accretion as\nthe formation mechanism. \n\n"}

In the one-dimensional case,\ncomputing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the\nevaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the $n$-dimensional\nsetting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \\times n$ covariance\nmatrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\\det(C)$. In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct\nmethods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\\mathcal O(n^3)$\nwork. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling.

Abstract: Starting from the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we know how in classical general\nrelativity the gravitational collapse of matter form a black hole with a\ncentral spacetime singularity. It is widely believed that the singularity must\nbe removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired\nsingularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but\nwhen one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands\nfor ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black\nhole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in\nNature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends\non the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role\nand our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper\nadjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that\nthe \"correct answer\" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de\nSitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass. Our black holes have indeed a de\nSitter core and the ghost would make these configurations unstable. Therefore\nwe believe that these black hole static solutions represent the transient phase\nof a gravitational collapse, but never survive as asymptotic states. \n\n"}

We have derived the pulsar distance from parallax and orbital decay\nmeasurements to be 0.73$_{-0.24}^{+0.60}$ kpc (68%) and < 1.2 kpc (95% upper\nlimit), respectively; these are significantly discrepant from the distance\nestimated using Galactic electron density models.

We present two-dimensional axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations which start from a collapsar engine and evolve all\nthe way through the late afterglow phase. The resultant outflow includes a jet\ncore which is highly relativistic after breaking out of the star, but becomes\nbaryon-loaded after colliding with a massive outer shell, corresponding to mass\nfrom the stellar atmosphere of the progenitor star which became trapped in\nfront of the jet core at breakout.

For this, we consider a simple\nHiggs-portal DM model, namely, the inert Higgs doublet model (IHDM) where the\nStandard Model is extended with an additional complex SU(2)$_L$ doublet scalar.\nThe stability of the DM candidate in this model, i.e., the lightest neutral\nscalar component of the extra doublet, is ensured by imposing discrete\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.

We find that Kr is strongly\nenriched in NGC 3918 and that Se is less enriched than Kr, in agreement with\nthe results of previous papers and with predicted s-process nucleosynthesis. We\nalso find that Xe is not as enriched by the s-process in NGC 3918 as is Kr and,\ntherefore, that neutron exposure is typical of modestly sub-solar metallicity\nAGB stars.

Our current study shows, however, that\nadding cosmic ray induced HOx production can cause a decrease in atmospheric\nmethane abundance of up to 80\\%.

The impact of these errors as function of the number of\nindependent realisations has been previously evaluated for Gaussian distributed\ndata. However, non-linearities in the late time clustering of matter cause\ndepartures from Gaussian statistics. Here, we address the impact of\nnon-Gaussian errors on the sample covariance and precision matrix errors using\na large ensemble of numerical N-body simulations. In the range of modes where\nfinite volume effects are negligible ($0.1\\lesssim k\\,[h\\,{\\rm\nMpc^{-1}}]\\lesssim 1.2$) we find deviations of the estimated variance of the\nsample covariance with respect to Gaussian predictions above $\\sim 10\\%$ level.\nThese reduce to about $\\sim 5\\%$ in the case of the precision matrix.

Here we present a three-dimensional model\nthat explains this relationship, in order to shed insight on the processes that\ncontrol heat redistribution in tidally-locked planetary atmospheres. This\nthree-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric\ncirculation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of\nequilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag\nstrengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic\ntheory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves\nmediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,\nanalogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure\nin Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by\neither radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag\nwould likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere\nthreaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with\nincreasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and\ncooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative\nheating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing\nequilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in\ncontrolling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our\nanalytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important\nif it is stronger than the Coriolis force.

In the bin with the smallest H$\\beta$ width, objects with the bluest\nslopes that are similar to accretion disk predictions are found to have\nEW(NaID)=0, supporting the line-of-sight dust hypothesis. This conclusion is\nalso supported by the dependence of the $H\\alpha/H\\beta$ line ratio on\nalpha_opt. The implied relationship between alpha_opt and dust reddening is\ngiven by E(B-V)~0.2(-0.1-alpha_opt), and the implied reddening of a typical\ntype 1 AGN with alpha_opt=-0.5 is E(B-V)~0.08mag. Photoionization calculations\nshow that the dusty gas responsible for reddening is too ionized to produce the\nobserved features. Therefore, we argue that the sodium absorption arises in\nregions of the host ISM which are shielded from the AGN radiation, and the\ncorrelation with alpha_opt arises since ISM columns along shielded and\nnon-shielded sightlines are correlated. This scenario is supported by the\nsimilarity of the E(B-V)-NaID relation implied by our results with the relation\nin the Milky-Way found by previous studies. \n\n"}

Space-based detectors will observe\nlong-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to their\nlocation on the sky, using Doppler shifts of the signal to locate the sky\nposition. While these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector or\nnetwork, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards one\nexpects from electromagnetic astronomy. Another technique that can be used for\nsky localization is null-stream pointing. In the case where multiple\nindependent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitational\nwaves will appear in each of the data streams.

We therefore investigate the rotation curves in BCDs formed from\nmergers between gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies based on the results of\nnumerical simulations for BCD formation. The principal results are as follows.\nThe dark matter of merging dwarf irregulars undergoes a central concentration\nso that the central density can become up to six times higher than those of the\ninitial dwarf irregulars. However, the more compact dark matter halo alone can\nnot reproduce the gradient differences observed between dwarf irregulars and\nBCDs. We provide further support that the central concentration of gas due to\nrapid gas-transfer to the central regions of dwarf--dwarf mergers is\nresponsible for the observed difference in rotation curve gradients. The BCDs\nwith central gas concentration formed from merging can thus show steeply rising\nrotation curves in their central regions. Such gas concentration is also\nresponsible for central starbursts of BCDs and the high central surface\nbrightness and is consistent with previous BCD studies. We discuss the\nrelationship between rotational velocity gradient and surface brightness, the\ndependence of BCD rotation curves on star formation threshold density,\nprogenitor initial profile, interaction type and merger mass ratio, as well as\npotential evolutionary links between dwarf irregulars, BCDs and compact dwarf\nirregulars. \n\n"}

Recently, the\nGHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,\nproviding further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,\ncompact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to\nGHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be\nyoung due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the\ngamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source\nclass. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a\npower law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the\nspectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.\nData from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT\nobservations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN\nJ1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and\nmeasure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known\nrelation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear\nsource size of ~1.4 kpc.

Abstract: Simulations of cosmological filamentary accretion reveal flows (\"streams\") of\nwarm gas, ~$10^4$ K, which are efficient in bringing gas into galaxies. We\npresent a phenomenological scenario where gas in such flows -- if it is shocked\nas it enters the halo as we assume -- become biphasic and, as a result,\nturbulent. We consider a collimated stream of warm gas that flows into a halo\nfrom an over dense filament of the cosmic web. The post-shock streaming gas\nexpands because it has a higher pressure than the ambient halo gas, and\nfragments as it cools. The fragmented stream forms a two phase medium: a warm\ncloudy phase embedded in hot post-shock gas. We argue that the hot phase\nsustains the accretion shock. A fraction of the initial kinetic energy of the\ninfalling gas is converted into turbulence among and within the warm clouds.\nThe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas is largely determined by the\nrelative timescales of several processes -- the cooling, the expansion of the\npost-shock gas, the amount of turbulence in the clouds, and the halo dynamics.\nWe expect the gas to become multiphase when the cooling and dynamical times are\nof the same order-of-magnitude. In this framework, we show that this occurs in\nthe important mass range of ~$10^{11}$ to $10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$ , where the bulk\nof stars have formed in galaxies. Gas accreting along cosmic web filaments may\neventually lose coherence and mix with the ambient halo gas. Through both the\nphase separation and \"disruption\" of the stream, the accretion efficiency onto\na galaxy in a halo dynamical time is lowered. De-collimating flows make the\ndirect interaction between galaxy feedback and accretion streams more likely,\nthereby further reducing the overall accretion efficiency. Moderating the gas\naccretion efficiency through these mechanisms may help to alleviate a number of\nsignificant challenges in theoretical galaxy formation. \n\n"}

Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a\ndistinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.\nWe demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural\noutcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical\nsignificance, but that the quiescent population requires additional\nastrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution\nbased on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local\ngalaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the\nevolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the\ndepletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The\nquiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas\nhas fallen below a threshold for disk stability.

The SSFR distribution of the quiescent and passive\nimplies that the timescale of this process must be greater than a few Gyrs but\nless than a few tens of Gyrs.

{"id": "1611.08311", "contents": "Title: Tracing star formation with non-thermal radio emission Abstract: A key for understanding the evolution of galaxies and in particular their\nstar formation history will be future ultra-deep radio surveys. While star\nformation rates (SFRs) are regularly estimated with phenomenological formulas\nbased on the local FIR-radio correlation, we present here a physically\nmotivated model to relate star formation with radio fluxes. Such a relation\nholds only in frequency ranges where the flux is dominated by synchrotron\nemission, as this radiation originates from cosmic rays produced in supernova\nremnants, therefore reflecting recent star formation. At low frequencies\nsynchrotron emission can be absorbed by the free-free mechanism. This\nsuppression becomes stronger with increasing number density of the gas, more\nprecisely of the free electrons. We estimate the critical observing frequency\nbelow which radio emission is not tracing the SFR, and use the three\nwell-studied local galaxies M 51, M 82, and Arp 220 as test cases for our\nmodel. If the observed galaxy is at high redshift, this critical frequency\nmoves along with other spectral features to lower values in the observing\nframe. In the absence of systematic evolutionary effects, one would therefore\nexpect that the method can be applied at lower observing frequencies for high\nredshift observations. However, in case of a strong increase of the typical gas\ncolumn densities towards high redshift, the increasing free-free absorption may\nerase the star formation signatures at low frequencies. At high radio\nfrequencies both, free-free emission and the thermal bump, can dominate the\nspectrum, also limiting the applicability of this method. \n\n"}

HAWC is able to detect secondary particles from\nextensive air showers (EAS) initiated in the interaction of a primary particle\n(either a gamma or a charged cosmic ray) with the upper atmosphere. Because an\noverwhelming majority of EAS events are triggered by cosmic rays, background\nnoise suppression plays an important role in the data analysis process of the\nHAWC observatory. Currently, HAWC uses cuts on two parameters (whose values\ndepend on the spatial distribution and luminosity of an event) to separate\ngamma-ray events from background hadronic showers.

{"id": "1709.00423", "contents": "Title: The Delay Time Distribution of Tidal Disruption Flares Abstract: Recent observations suggest that stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) are\nstrongly overrepresented in rare, post-starburst galaxies. Several dynamical\nmechanisms have been proposed to elevate their TDE rates, ranging from central\nstellar overdensities to the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nbinaries. Another such mechanism, introduced here, is a radial velocity\nanisotropy in the nuclear star cluster produced during the starburst. These,\nand other, dynamical hypotheses can be disentangled by comparing observations\nto theoretical predictions for the TDE delay time distribution (DTD). We show\nthat SMBH binaries are a less plausible solution for the post-starburst\npreference, as they can only reproduce the observed DTD with extensive\nfine-tuning. The overdensity hypothesis produces a reasonable match to the\nobserved DTD (based on the limited data currently available), provided that the\ninitial stellar density profile created during the starburst, $\\rho(r)$, is\nexceptional in both steepness and normalization. In particular, explaining the\npost-starburst preference requires $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma\n\\gtrsim 2.5$, i.e. much steeper than the classic Bahcall-Wolf equilibrium\nprofile of $\\gamma = 7/4$.

Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task\nhowever.

The\nclassifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model\nSnapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected\nuncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the\ncross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are\nlabelled in an entirely model independent way.

When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high\nconfidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the\nexpectation from models given the data uncertainties.

Such constructions, at the field theory level, are quite\ngeneral and can be interpreted as the four-dimensional field theory realization\nof the Green-Schwarz mechanism of anomaly cancellation of string theory. We\npresent an overview of models of this type in the TeV/multi TeV range in their\noriginal formulation and their recent embeddings into an ordinary GUT theory,\npresenting an $E_6\\times U(1)_X$ model as an example. In this case the model\ncontains two axions, the first corresponding to a Peccei-Quinn axion, whose\nmisalignment takes place at the QCD phase transition, with a mass in the meV\nregion and which solves the strong CP problem. The second axion is ultralight,\nin the $10^{-20}-10^{-22}$ eV region, due to a misalignment and a decoupling\ntaking place at the GUT scale. The two scales introduced by the PQ solution,\nthe PQ breaking scale and the misalignment scale at the QCD hadron transition,\nbecome the Planck and the GUT scales respectively, with a global anomaly\nreplaced by a gauge anomaly. The periodic potential and the corresponding\noscillations are related to a particle whose De Broglie wavelength can reach 10\nkpc. Such a sub-galactic scale has been deemed necessary in order to resolve\nseveral dark matter issues at the astrophysical level. \n\n"}

Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit surveys\nwhen two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods.\nSuch pair of candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are\nnot Hill-stable.

However, a jet-like outflow with an\nopening angle of 10-20 degress provides a good description of the data. The\nevidence in favor of a jet interpretation is based on the behavior of the radio\nlight curves, since the expected jet break is masked at optical wavelengths by\nthe light of the host galaxy.

We find that the principal\naxes of I and T are strongly aligned, even though I characterizes the\nproto-halo locally while T is determined by the large-scale structure. Thus,\nthe resultant galactic spin, which plays a key role in galaxy formation, is\nonly a residual due to ~10 per cent deviations from perfect alignment of T and\nI. The T-I correlation induces a weak tendency for the proto-halo spin to be\nperpendicular to the major axes of T and I, but this correlation is erased by\nnon-linear effects at late times, making the observed spins poor indicators of\nthe initial shear field. However, the T-I correlation implies that the shear\ntensor can be used for identifying the positions and boundaries of proto-haloes\nin cosmological initial conditions -- a missing piece in galaxy formation\ntheory. The typical configuration is of a prolate proto-halo lying\nperpendicular to a large-scale high-density ridge, with the surrounding voids\ninducing compression along the major and intermediate inertia axes of the\nproto-halo.

First, we show that the dark bursts cannot be explained by a failure to\nimage deeply enough quickly enough: We fit a variety of brightness distribution\nmodels to the optical data, and find that approx. 57(+13,-11)% of all bursts,\nand approx. 82(+22,-17)% of dark bursts, have afterglows that are fainter than\nR = 24 mag 18 hours after the burst.

Furthermore, the sublimation\ndistance is a decreasing function of grain size, while the fragmentation\ndistance is a decreasing function of grain size for large grains and an\nincreasing function of grain size for small grains. We investigate how these\nvery different, but somewhat complementary, processes change the optical depth\nof the circumburst medium. To this end, we adopt a canonical distribution of\ngraphite and silicate grain sizes, and a simple fragmentation model, and we\ncompute the post-burst/optical flash/afterglow optical depth of a circumburst\ncloud of constant density n and size R as a function of burst and afterglow\nisotropic-equivalent X-ray energy E and spectral index alpha, and optical flash\nisotropic-equivalent peak luminosity L: This improves upon previous analyses\nthat consider circumburst dust of a uniform grain size.

We use this model to predict\nthe thermodynamic history of the IGM when photoionized by galaxies forming in a\ncold dark matter (CDM) universe. The evolution of the galaxies is calculated\nusing a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects of\ntidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting inside\nlarger dark matter halos. We include in the model the negative feedback on\ngalaxy formation from the photoionizing background. Photoionization inhibits\ngalaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos in two ways: (i) heating of the\nIGM and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark halos by the IGM pressure,\nand (ii) reduction in the radiative cooling of gas within halos.

In the latter case, for $N \\ge 10000$,\nsome trajectories, even if unstable, had exceedingly long diffusion times,\nwhich correlated with the characteristic e-folding timescale of the\ninstability. For trajectories of $N \\approx 100000$ systems this timescale\ncould be arbitrarily large --- and thus appear to correspond to regular orbits.\nFor centrally concentrated systems, low angular momentum trajectories were\nfound to be systematically more unstable. This phenomenon is analogous to the\nwell known case of trajectories in generic centrally concentrated non-spherical\nsmooth systems, where eccentric trajectories are found to be chaotic. The\nexponentiation times also correlate with the conservation of the angular\nmomenta along the trajectories. For $N$ up to a few hundred, the instability\ntimescales of $N$-body systems and their variation with particle number are\nsimilar to those of the most chaotic trajectories in inhomogeneous\nnon-interacting systems.

Our results depend crucially on whether we use the total\nionizing rate measured by the proximity effect technique or the lower\ndetermination from the flux decrement distribution of Ly alpha forest lines.\nAssuming a faint-end LF slope of 1.58 and the SDSS estimates of the bright-end\nslope and normalization, we find that the LF must break at M_B*=-24.2,-22.3,\n-20.8 at z=3,4, 5 if we adopt the lower ionization rate and assume no stellar\ncontribution to the background. The break must occur at M_B*=-20.6,-18.7, -18.7\nfor the proximity effect background estimate. These values brighten by as much\nas ~2 mag if high-z galaxies contribute to the background with an escape\nfraction of ionizing photons consistent with recent estimates: f_e=0.16. By\ncomparing to faint AGN searches, we find that the typically-quoted proximity\neffect estimates of the background imply an over-abundance of faint AGN (even\nwith f_e=1). Even adopting the lower bound on proximity effect measurements,\nthe stellar escape fraction must be high: f_e>0.2.

We\ncalculate the synchrotron emission from such shocks using an analytical model,\ncalibrated with a hydrodynamical LCDM simulation. The resulting signal composes\na large fraction of the extragalactic radio background (ERB) below 500 MHz. The\nassociated angular fluctuations dominate the sky for frequencies nu<10 GHz and\nangular scales arcmin-deg (after a modest removal of point sources), provided\nthat xi_e*xi_B>3*10^-4. The fluctuating signal is most pronounced for nu<500\nMHz, dominating the sky even for xi_e*xi_B=5*10^-5. The signal will be easily\nobservable by next generation radio telescopes such as LOFAR and SKA, and is\nmarginally observable with present telescopes. It may be identified using\ncross-correlations with tracers of large scale structure, possibly even in\nexisting <10 GHz CMB anisotropy maps and high resolution ~1 GHz radio surveys.\nDetection of the signal will provide the first identification of intergalactic\nshocks and of the WHIM, and gauge the unknown intergalactic magnetic field. We\nshow that existing observations of the diffuse <500 MHz radio background are\nwell fit by a simple, double-disk Galactic model, precluding a direct\nidentification of the diffuse ERB.

We propose a scenario in\nwhich the jet and the X-ray corona are fed by the same energy reservoir where\nlarge amounts of accretion power are stored before being channelled into either\nthe jet or the high energy radiation. This time dependent model reproduces the\nmain features of the rapid multi-wavelength variability of XTE J1118+480.\nAssuming that the energy is stored in the form of magnetic field, we find that\nthe required values of the model parameters are compatible with both a patchy\ncorona atop a cold accretion disc and a hot thick inner disc geometry. The\nrange of variability timescales for the X-ray emitting plasma are consistent\nwith the dynamical times of an accretion flow between 10 and 100 Schwarzschild\nradii. On the other hand, the derived range of timescales associated with the\ndissipation in the jet extends to timescales more than 10 times larger,\nconfirming the suggestion that the generation of a powerful outflow requires\nlarge scale coherent poloidal field structures. A strong requirement of the\nmodel is that the total jet power should be at least a few times larger than\nthe observed X-ray luminosity.

The star formation in LIRGs is\nsufficient in itself to produce 38% of the total stellar mass of intermediate\nmass galaxies and then to account for most of the reported stellar mass\nformation since z=1.

These gas complexes form star complexes, giving the familiar beads on a\nstring of star formation along spiral arms, or nuclear hotspots in the case of\na ring. Turbulence compression, supernovae, and self-gravitational contraction\ninside the giant clouds produce a nearly scale-free structure, including giant\nmolecular clouds that form OB associations and molecular cloud cores that form\nclusters. Without stellar density waves or similar structures, random\ngravitational instabilities form flocculent spirals and these fragment into\nstar complexes, OB associations and star clusters in the same way. The largest\ncoherent star-forming regions are the flocculent arms themselves. At the core\nof the hierarchy are the very dense clumps in which individual and binary stars\nform. The overall star formation rate in a galaxy appears to be regulated by\ngravitational collapse on large scales, giving the Kennicutt/Schmidt law\nscaling with density, but the efficiency factor in front of this scaling law\ndepends on the fraction of the gas that is in a dense form.

The\nearly X-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadly\nconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay\n(t^{-alpha} with 3<alpha_1<5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay\n(0.2<alpha_2<0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1<alpha_3<1.5).\nThese power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,\n300s<t_{break,1}<500s and 10^3s<t_{break,2}<10^4s. On top of this canonical\nbehavior of the early X-ray light curve, many events have superimposed X-ray\nflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lasting\nsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the GRB. We\nfind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of the\nprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to our\nline of sight. The first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes place\nwhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallow\nflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into the\nexternal shock. When this energy injection stops, a second break is then\nobserved in the light curve (t_{break,2}). This energy injection increases the\nenergy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f>4, and augments the\nalready severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-ray\nemission. \n\n"}

In this paper we present a simple model for computing the\ncharacteristic quantities (including energy, temperature, and time-duration)\nfor the transient event from the shock breakout in Type Ibc supernovae produced\nby the core-collapse of WR stars surrounded by dense winds. In contrast to the\ncase of a star without a strong wind, the shock breakout occurs in the wind\nregion rather than inside the star, caused by the large optical depth in the\nwind. We find that, for the case of a WR star with a dense wind, the total\nenergy of the radiation generated by the supernova shock breakout is larger\nthan that in the case of the same star without a wind by a factor > 10. The\ntemperature can be either hotter or cooler, depending on the wind parameters.\nThe time-duration is larger caused by the increase in the effective radius of\nthe star due to the presence of a thick wind. Then, we apply the model to GRB\n060218/SN 2006aj. We show that, to explain both the temperature and the total\nenergy of the black-body component observed in GRB 060218 by the shock\nbreakout, the progenitor WR star has to have an unrealistically large core\nradius (the radius at optical depth of 20), larger than 100 Rsun.

Three separate groups have reached the same conclusion that this event\nforces the existence of a new previously-unsuspected class of GRBs. The problem\nwith this conclusion is that the redshift is not secure, as the measured galaxy\nemission lines simply give the redshift of the brightest galaxy near the\nline-of-sight to the GRB afterglow. Fortunately, eight different luminosity\nindicators are known which can give the luminosity (and hence redshift) of the\nGRB itself. In combination, these luminosity indicators have already proven to\ngive redshifts with average one-sigma errors of 26% as based on 69 GRBs with\nspectroscopic redshifts. For GRB060614, the luminosity indicators all uniformly\ngive a high luminosity for the burst which implies a high redshift. This can be\nseen by the spiky many-peaked light curve, the high E_{peak} value, the\nnear-zero spectral lag, and the timing of the jet break. Quantitatively, we\nderive a redshift of 1.97 (1.44<z<2.81 one-sigma) from the eight luminosity\nindicators. Additional information from the detection of the afterglow in all\nSwift UVOT bands further constrains the redshift to be <1.71, so the final\nrange of allowed redshift is 1.44<z<1.71, which readily explains why no\nsupernova was visible. Thus, GRB060614 is at high redshift and is certainly not\nevidence for a new class of GRBs. \n\n"}

However, spectroscopic or meteoritic\nabundance determinations are only possible for an incomplete sample of the 83\nelements detected in the solar system. Therefore, only relative abundances are\nexperimentally determined, with respect to H or to Si for spectroscopic or\nmeteoritic measurements, respectively. For this reason, the available\ncompilations of solar abundances are obtained by combining spectroscopic and\nmeteoritic determinations, a procedure requiring the knowledge of the chemical\nmodification occurred in the solar photosphere. We provide a method to derive\nthe mass fractions of all the 83 elements (and their most abundant isotopes) in\nthe early solar system material and in the present-day solar surface.\nCalculations are repeated by adopting the most widely adopted compilations of\nsolar abundances.

It is important,\nfor example, in establishing the origin of the group and also in comparative\nstudies of the properties of planetary systems, eventually surrounding some of\nthe AB Dor group members, with those existing in other groups. For AB Dor two\nrather different estimates for its age have been proposed: a first one, of the\norder of 50 Myr, by Zuckerman and coworkers from a comparison with\nTucana/Horologium moving group and a second one of about 100-125 Myr by Luhman\nand coworkers from color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). Using this last value and\nthe closeness in velocity space of AB Dor and the Pleiades galactic cluster,\nLuhman and coworkers suggested coevality for these systems. Because strictly\nspeaking such a closeness does not still guarantee coevality, here we address\nthis problem by computing and comparing the full 3D orbits of AB Dor, Pleiades,\nalpha Persei and IC 2602. The latter two open clusters have estimated ages of\nabout 85-90 Myr and 50 Myr. The resulting age 119 $\\pm$ 20 Myr is consistent\nwith AB Dor and Pleiades being coeval.

We find that the support provided by magnetic fields\nover thermal pressure alone has several important effects on fragmentation and\nthe formation of binary and multiple systems, and on the properties of massive\ncircumstellar discs. The extra support suppresses the tendency of molecular\ncloud cores to fragment due to either initial density perturbations or disc\nfragmentation. Furthermore, unlike most previous studies, we find that magnetic\npressure plays the dominant role in inhibiting fragmentation rather than\nmagnetic tension or magnetic braking. In particular, we find that if the\nmagnetic field is aligned with the rotation axis of the molecular cloud core,\nthe effects of the magnetic field on fragmentation and disc structure are\nalmost entirely due to magnetic pressure, while if the rotation axis is\ninitially perpendicular to the magnetic field, magnetic tension plays a greater\nrole and can actually aid fragmentation. Despite these effects, and contrary to\nseveral past studies, we find that strongly-perturbed molecular cloud cores are\nable to fragment to form wide binary systems even in the presence of quite\nstrong magnetic fields. For massive circumstellar discs, we find that slowing\nof the collapse caused by the magnetic support decreases the mass infall rate\non to the disc and, thus, weakens gravitational instabilities in young massive\ncircumstellar discs.

While it appears that\nan accretion disk corona (ADC) model, where the corona sandwiches the cold\naccretion disk, is capable of explaining the observations of Seyfert galaxies,\nrecent work has shown that this model is problematic for GBHCs. To address the\ndifferences in the spectra of Seyferts and GBHCs, we consider the structure of\nthe atmosphere of the accretion disk in a region near an active magnetic flare\n(we refer to this region as transition layer). We show that the transition\nlayer is subject to a thermal instability. Due to the much higher ionizing\nX-ray flux in GBHCs, the only stable solution for the upper layer of the\naccretion disk is that in which it is highly ionized and is at the Compton\ntemperature ($kT \\sim $ a few keV). Using numerical simulations for a slab\ngeometry ADC, we show that the presence of a transition layer can significantly\nalter the spectrum of escaping radiation for modest optical depths. The\npresence of the transition layer also leads to a reduction in reprocessing\nfeatures, i.e., the iron line and the X-ray reflection hump. We find that due\nto the thermal instability of the surface of the accretion disk, which leads to\ndifferent endpoints for GBHCs and Seyfert galaxies, the X-ray spectra from\nthese two types of objects can be explained by a single unifying ADC model. \n\n"}

We establish this\nrelationship in two important burst samples using the cross-correlation lags\nbetween low (25-50 keV) and high (100-300 keV and > 300 keV) energy bands. For\na set of seven bursts (six with redshifts) observed by CGRO/BATSE and BeppoSAX\nwhich also have optical or radio counterparts, the gamma/X peak flux ratios and\npeak luminosities are anti-correlated with spectral lag. For the 174 brightest\nBATSE bursts with durations longer than 2 s and significant emission above 300\nkeV, a similar anti-correlation is evident between gamma-ray hardness ratio or\npeak flux, and spectral lag. For the six bursts with redshifts, the connection\nbetween peak luminosity and spectral lag is well-fitted by a power-law.

The high X-ray luminosity of the\nsystem suggests that massive clusters may begin to form at redshifts\nconsiderably greater than unity. This scenario is supported by the high degree\nof optical and X-ray substructure in ClJ0152.7-1357, which is similarly complex\nas that of other X-ray selected distant clusters and consistent with the\npicture of cluster formation by mass infall along large-scale filaments. X-ray\nemission from ClJ0152.7-1357 was detected already in 1980 with the EINSTEIN\nIPC. However, because the complex morphology of the emission caused its\nsignificance to be underestimated, the corresponding source was not included in\nthe EMSS cluster sample and hence not previously identified. Simulations of the\nEMSS source detection and selection procedure suggest a general bias of the\nEMSS against X-ray luminous clusters with pronounced substructure. If highly\nunrelaxed, merging clusters are common at high redshift, they could create a\nbias in some samples as the morphological complexity of mergers may cause them\nto fall below the flux limit of surveys that assume a unimodal spatial source\ngeometry.

Although\ntheir sizes and masses are similar to those of present star-forming regions,\ntheir temperatures are expected to be much higher because cooling is provided\nonly by trace amounts of molecular hydrogen. Several recent simulations of the\ncollapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds have converged on a thermal\nregime where the density is about 10^3-10^4 cm^{-3} and the temperature is\nabout 300 K; under these conditions the Jeans mass is of the order of 10^3\nM_sun, and all of the simulations show the formation of clumps with masses of\nthis order. The temperatures in these clumps subsequently rise slowly as they\ncollapse, so little if any further fragmentation is expected. As a result, the\nformation of predominantly massive or very massive stars is expected, and star\nformation with a normal present-day IMF seems very unlikely. The most massive\nearly stars are expected to collapse to black holes, and these in turn are\npredicted to end up concentrated near the centers of present-day large\ngalaxies.

Besides, if\nour model is considered as an alternative of early time acceleration, it is\nshown that the early stage accelerating phase ends in a dust dominated FRW\nhomogeneous Universe. Mirage-driven acceleration thus provides a dark matter\ncomponent for the brane Universe final state. We finally show that the model\nfulfills the current constraints on inhomogeneities. \n\n"}

The corresponding background solutions are unstable,\nwhich we argue is a universal feature of contracting models that yield\nscale-invariant spectra. For expanding universes, we find that nearly\nscale-invariant adiabatic perturbation spectra can only be produced for $w\n\\approx -1$, and that the corresponding scaling solutions are attractors. The\npresence of a nontrivial metric on field space is a crucial ingredient in our\nresults. \n\n"}

We have compiled from\nthe literature experimental data on spectra of particles emitted from\nproton-induced reactions at incident energies from 30 GeV to 70 GeV on\ndifferent nuclei and have performed calculations for all reactions for which we\nfound data with these three codes without any modifications and using only\ndefault parameters and standard inputs. Our results (514 plots) show that all\nthree codes describe reasonably most of the studied reactions, though all of\nthem should be further improved before becoming reliable tools for PRad. We\npresent here our conclusions concerning the relative roles of different\nreaction mechanisms in the production of specific secondary particles. We\ncomment on the strengths and weaknesses of QGSM, MARS, and LAHET3 and suggest\nfurther improvements to these codes and to other models. \n\n"}

Diamond, SiC and different AIIIBV compounds\n(GaAs, GaP, InP, InAs, InSb) are possible competitors for silicon to different\nelectronic devices for the up-mentioned applications. The main goal of this\npaper is to give theoretical predictions about the behaviour of these\nsemiconductors in hadron fields (pions, protons). The effects of the\ninteraction between the incident particle and the semiconductor are\ncharacterised in the present paper both from the point of view of the\nprojectile, the relevant quantity being the energy loss by nuclear\ninteractions, and of the target, using the concentration of primary radiation\ninduced defects on unit particle fluence. Some predictions about the damage\ninduced by hadrons in these materials in possible applications in particle\nphysics and space experiments are done. \n\n"}
