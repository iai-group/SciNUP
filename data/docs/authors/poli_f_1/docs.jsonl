Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

The VL\nrelation at I- and K-bands is independent of surface brightness, size and light\nconcentration. The log-slope of the I- and K-band RL relations is a strong\nfunction of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5. The average dispersion\nsigma_ln(RL) decreases from 0.33 at I-band to 0.29 at K, likely due to the\n2MASS selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies.

High resolution radio images are presented of the best high redshift FRI\ncandidate galaxies, drawn from two fields of the Leiden Berkeley Deep Survey,\nand previously defined in Rigby, Snellen & Best (2007, Paper I). Together with\nlower resolution radio observations (both previously published in Paper I and,\nfor a subset of sources, also presented here) these are used to morphologically\nclassify the sample. Sources which are clearly resolved are classified by\nmorphology alone, whereas barely or unresolved sources were classified using a\ncombination of morphology and flux density loss in the higher resolution data,\nindicative of resolved out extended emission. The space densities of the FRIs\nare then calculated as a function of redshift, and compared to both\nmeasurements of the local value and the behaviour of the more powerful FRIIs.\nThe space density of FRI radio sources with luminosities (at 1.4 GHz) > 10^25\nW/Hz is enhanced by a factor of 5-9 by z ~ 1, implying moderately strong\nevolution of this population; this enhancement is in good agreement with models\nof FRII evolution at the same luminosity.

Incorporating the constraints from both the flux-limited samples\nobserved with CGRO/BATSE and Swift/BAT and the redshift-known GRB sample, we\ninvestigate the luminosity function for both LL- and HL-GRBs through\nsimulations. Our multiple criteria, including the log N - log P distributions\nfrom the flux-limited GRB sample, the redshift and luminosity distributions of\nthe redshift-known sample, and the detection ratio of HL- and LL- GRBs with\nSwift/BAT, provide a set of stringent constraints to the luminosity function.\nAssuming that the GRB rate follows the star formation rate, our simulations\nshow that a simple power law or a broken power law model of luminosity function\nfail to reproduce the observations, and a new component is required. This\ncomponent can be modeled with a broken power, which is characterized by a sharp\nincrease of the burst number at around L < 10^47 erg s^-1}.

The cylinders are electrically connected\nthrough a remote, perfectly conducting endcap, which allows a radial electric\ncurrent to pass through the liquid. The radial current interacting with the\naxial component of magnetic field gives rise to the azimuthal electromagnetic\nforce, which destabilizes the base flow by making its angular momentum decrease\nradially outwards. This instability, which we refer to as the\npseudo--magnetorotational instability (MRI), looks like an MRI although its\nmechanism is basically centrifugal. In a helical magnetic field, the radial\ncurrent interacting with the azimuthal component of the field gives rise to an\naxial electromagnetic force, which drives a longitudinal circulation. First,\nthis circulation advects the Taylor vortices generated by the centrifugal\ninstability, which results in a traveling wave as in the helical MRI (HMRI).\nHowever, the direction of travel of this wave is opposite to that of the true\nHMRI. Second, at sufficiently strong differential rotation, the longitudinal\nflow becomes hydrodynamically unstable itself. For electrically connected\ncylinders in a helical magnetic field, hydrodynamic instability is possible at\nany sufficiently strong differential rotation. In this case, there is no\nhydrodynamic stability limit defined in the terms of the critical ratio of\nrotation rates of inner and outer cylinders that would allow one to distinguish\na hydrodynamic instability from the HMRI. These effects can critically\ninterfere with experimental as well as numerical determination of MRI. \n\n"}

First, giant stars\nwith planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich\nobjects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not\nvalid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant\nplanets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.\n  None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of\ngiant planet formation.

Whatever\nthe precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a\nbraking torque on the black hole.

We find that the\npredicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and\ndimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate\nthe efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF\nflow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96%\nof the maximal spin value in the absence of jets.

Viscous evolution of the\nouter circumbinary disk initially hardens the binary, while the inner disk\ndrains onto the primary (central) black hole. As long as the inner disk remains\ncool and thin at low $\\dot{M}_{\\rm ext}$ (rather than becoming hot and\ngeometrically thick), the mass of the inner disk reaches an asymptotic mass\ntypically $\\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}\\Msun$. Once the semimajor axis shrinks below a\ncritical value, angular momentum losses from gravitational waves dominate over\nviscous transport in hardening the binary. The inner disk then no longer\nresponds viscously to the inspiraling black holes. Instead, tidal interactions\nwith the secondary rapidly drive the inner disk into the primary.

In particular, we show that both Lx and Gamma, the slope of the\npower-law that best fits the 0.5 - 8 keV spectra, are consistent with a clear\ndecline in the accretion power along the sequence, corresponding to a softening\nof their spectra. This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low luminosity AGN levels,\nthere is an anti-correlation between Gamma and L/Ledd, opposite to the trend\nexhibited by high z AGN (quasars). The turning point in the Gamma -L/Ledd LLAGN\n+ quasars relation occurs near Gamma ~ 1.5 and L/Ledd ~ 0.01.

Using general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations, we construct steady state axisymmetric\nnumerical models for a wide range of black hole spins (dimensionless spin\nparameter 0.1 <= a <= 0.9999 and a variety of jet geometries. We assume that\nthe total magnetic flux through the black hole horizon at radius r_H(a) is held\nconstant. If the black hole is surrounded by a thin accretion disk, we find\nthat the total black hole power output depends approximately quadratically on\nthe angular frequency of the hole, P \\propto \\Omega_H^2 \\propto (a/r_H)^2.

Here, we draw on a large suite of\nhigh resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, to systematically\ninvestigate this process and its dependence on the baryonic physics associated\nwith galaxy formation. The inclusion of baryons results in significantly more\nconcentrated density profiles if radiative cooling is efficient and feedback is\nweak. The dark matter halo concentration can in that case increase by as much\nas 30 (10) per cent on galaxy (cluster) scales. The most significant effects\noccur in galaxies at high redshift, where there is a strong anti-correlation\nbetween the baryon fraction in the halo centre and the inner slope of both the\ntotal and the dark matter density profiles. If feedback is weak, isothermal\ninner profiles form, in agreement with observations of massive, early-type\ngalaxies.

In\nthe linear regime, the observed growth rates and wavelengths match the\ntheoretical predictions; the nonlinear stage of the instability shows a strong\nreaction of both the background plasma and the CR particles, with the\nsaturation level of the magnetic field varying with the CR parameters. The\nsimulations with CR-to-background density ratios of n_CR/n_b=10^(-5) reveal the\nhighest magnetic field saturation levels, with energy also being transferred to\nthe background plasma and to the perpendicular velocity components of the CR\nparticles.

Here, we present high signal-to-noise spectra of SDSS 1257+5428, which\nconfirm an independent finding that the system is in fact composed of two white\ndwarfs, one relatively cool and with low mass, and the other hotter and more\nmassive. With this, the demographics and merger rate are no longer puzzling\n(various factors combine to lower the latter by more than two orders of\nmagnitude). We show that the spectra are fit well with a combination of two\nhydrogen model atmospheres, as long as the lines of the higher-gravity\ncomponent are broadened significantly relative to what is expected from just\npressure broadening. Interpreting this additional broadening as due to\nrotation, the inferred spin period is short, about 1 minute. Similarly rapid\nrotation is only seen in accreting white dwarfs that are magnetic; empirically,\nit appears that in non-magnetized white dwarfs, accreted angular momentum is\nlost by nova explosions before it can be transferred to the white dwarf.

The extra-terms in the gravitational field equations with\ngeometry-matter coupling modify the equations of motion of test particles, and\ninduce a supplementary gravitational interaction. Starting from the variational\nprinciple describing the particle motion in the presence of the non-minimal\ncoupling, the expression of the tangential velocity of a test particle, moving\nin the vacuum on a stable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric geometry,\nis derived. The tangential velocity depends on the metric tensor components, as\nwell as of the coupling function between matter and geometry.

If the\ntangential velocity profile is known, the coupling term between matter and\ngeometry can be obtained explicitly in an analytical form.

The sky-projected angle between the\nspin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to\nbe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin\nanomaly.

A potentially\ndangerous feature of this scenario is the existence of perturbations in the\nradial field direction, which have red power spectrum. We show, however, that\nto the linear order in the small parameter - the quartic self-coupling - the\ninfrared effects are completely harmless, as they can be absorbed into field\nredefinition.

To the linear\norder in the quartic self-coupling the statistical anisotropy is free of the\ninfrared effects. The latter show up at the quadratic order in the\nself-coupling and result in the mild (logarithmic) enhancement of the\ncorresponding contribution to the statistical anisotropy.

We use a chemical evolution model to compute the\ntemporal progression of quantities, such as the amount of dust and gas, stellar\nmasses, star formation rates (SFRs) and the metallicity for various\ncombinations of the initial mass function (IMF), the mass of the galaxy, dust\nproduction efficiencies, and the degree of dust destruction in the ISM. We\ninvestigate the influence of the SFR on the evolution of these quantities, and\ndetermine the earliest epochs at which agreement with observations can be\nachieved. We apply the obtained results to individual QSOs at z > 6. We find\nthat large quantities of dust can be generated rapidly as early as 30 Myr after\nthe onset of the starburst when the SFR of the starburst is > 10^3 M_sun\nyr^(-1). The amount of dust and several other physical quantities of individual\nQSOs at z > 6 are satisfactorily reproduced by models at epochs 30, 70, 100,\nand 170 Myr for galaxies with initial gas masses of 1-3 x 10^11 M_sun.

It is\nimportant in magnetic fusion and in space and solar physics --- areas that have\nso far provided the context for most of reconnection research. Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs. Here, magnetic\nenergy density is so high that its dissipation heats the plasma to MeV\ntemperatures. Electron-positron pairs are then copiously produced, making the\nreconnection layer highly collisional and dressing it in a thick pair coat that\ntraps radiation. The pressure is dominated by radiation and pairs. Yet,\nradiation diffusion across the layer may be faster than the global Alfv\\'en\ntransit time; then, radiative cooling governs the thermodynamics and\nreconnection becomes a radiative transfer problem, greatly affected by the\nultra-strong magnetic field. This overall picture is very different from our\ntraditional picture of reconnection and thus represents a new frontier in\nreconnection research. \n\n"}

Relying on atomic, ionised, and molecular gas, we account for most\nobservables with a scenario that assumes that a few hundreds Myr ago, M31\nunderwent a frontal collision with M32, which triggered some star-formation\nactivity in the centre, and this collision explains the special configuration\nof M31 with two rings observed at 0.7kpc and 10kpc.

{"id": "1106.0301", "contents": "Title: Metallicity-Dependent quenching of Star Formation at High Redshift in\n  Small Galaxies Abstract: [abridged] The star formation rates (SFR) of low-metallicity galaxies depend\nsensitively on the gas metallicity, because metals are crucial to mediating the\ntransition from intermediate-temperature atomic gas to cold molecular gas, a\nnecessary precursor to star formation. We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the\nexpected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a\ngiven z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat\nand rising respectively. Our model predictions qualitatively match some of the\npuzzling features in the observed star formation history. \n\n"}

This is confirmed in hydro-AMR\nzoom-in simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. In most high-z\nclumps, the centrifugal force dominates the support, R=Vrot^2/Vcirc^2 > 0.5,\nwhere Vrot is the rotation velocity and Vcirc is the circular velocity.

Giant\nclumps of 10^8-9 Msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-rich\ngalaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feed\nsupermassive black holes (BH). We use emission line diagnostics to compare a\nsample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disks\nat redshift z~0.7. The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high\nprobability of containing AGN. Their [OIII] emission line is strongly excited,\ninconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [NeIII] excitation is\nalso higher. Stable disks rarely have such properties. Stacking ultra sensitive\nChandra observations (4 Ms) reveals an X-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, which\ncannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of AGN. The\nclumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical of\ngas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the Main\nSequence of star formation. This suggests that our findings apply to the\nphysically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z>1. Using the\nobserved [OIII] and X-ray luminosities, we conservatively estimate that AGN\nhosted by clumpy disks have typical bolometric luminosities of the order of a\nfew 10^43 erg/s, BH growth rates ~10^-2 Msun/yr, and that these AGN are\nsubstantially obscured in X-rays. This moderate-luminosity mode could be\nsufficient to provide a large fraction of today's BH mass over a couple of Gyr\ngiven that our observations suggest a high duty cycle (>10%), accretion bursts\nwith higher luminosities being possible over shorter phases. The observed\nevolution of disk instabilities with mass and redshift could explain the\nsimultaneous downsizing of star formation and of BH growth. \n\n"}

With these six LAEs, we revise our previous\nestimate of the number of faint LAEs in the Dressler et al. survey. Combining\nthese data with the density of bright LAEs in the Cosmic Origins Survey and\nSubaru Deep Field provides the best constraints to date on the redshift 5.7 LAE\nluminosity function (LF). Schechter function parameters, phi^* = 4.5 x 10^{-4}\nMpc^{-3}, L^* = 9.1 x 10^{42} erg s^{-1}, and alpha= -1.70, are estimated using\na maximum likelihood technique with a model for slit losses. To place this\nresult in the context of the UV-selected galaxy population, we investigate how\nvarious parameterizations of the Lyman Alpha equivalent width distribution,\nalong with the measured UV-continuum LF, affect shape and normalization of the\nLyman Alpha LF. The nominal model, which uses z~6 equivalent widths from the\nliterature, falls short of the observed space density of LAEs at the bright\nend, possibly indicating a need for higher equivalent widths. This\nparameterization of the equivalent width distribution implies that as many as\n50% of our faintest LAEs should have M_{UV} > -18.0, rendering them\nundetectable in even the deepest Hubble Space Telescope surveys at this\nredshift. Hence, ultra-deep emission-line surveys find some of the faintest\ngalaxies ever observed at the end of the reionization epoch. Such faint\ngalaxies likely enrich the intergalactic medium with metals and maintain its\nionized state. Observations of these objects provide a glimpse of the building\nblocks of present-day galaxies at an early time. \n\n"}

We expect that more binary lenses\nof this kind will be detected in the future. For binaries whose orbital period\nis comparable to the event duration, the orbital motion can cause the lensing\nsignal to deviate drastically from that of a static binary lens.

This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet\npopulation synthesis calculations.\n  Aims. Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of\nimportant disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime on\nfundamental planetary properties.\n  Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population\nof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration\nand disk evolution.\n  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary\ninitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different\nroles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,\ngiant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both\nmore frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets\ncannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.\nIn contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot\nfor giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher\nplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be\ncompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low\nmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high\nmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of\nmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with\nmetallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of\ngiant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,\nbut migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate\nless. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than Hot\nJupiters.\n  Conclusions. The properties of protoplanetary disks are decisive for the\nproperties of planets, and leave many imprints. \n\n"}

Present-day properties Abstract: We use the Millennium I and II cosmological simulations to revisit the impact\nof mergers in the growth of bulges in central galaxies in the LCDM scenario. We\nseed galaxies within the growing CDM haloes using semi-empirical relations to\nassign stellar and gaseous masses, and an analytic treatment to estimate the\ntransfer of stellar mass to the bulge of the remnant after a galaxy merger. We\nfind that this model roughly reproduces the observed correlation between the\nbulge-to-total (B/T) mass ratio and stellar mass in present-day central\ngalaxies as well as their observed demographics, although low-mass B/T<0.1\n(bulgeless) galaxies might be scarce relative to the observed abundance. In our\nmerger-driven scenario, bulges have a composite population made of (i) stars\nacquired from infalling satellites, (ii) stars transferred from the primary\ndisc due to merger-induced perturbations, and (iii) newly formed stars in\nstarbursts triggered by mergers. We find that (i) and (ii) are the main\nchannels of mass assembly, with the first being dominant for massive galaxies,\ncreating large bulges with different stellar populations than those of the\ninner discs, while the second is dominant for intermediate/low-mass galaxies\ncreating small bulges with similar stellar populations to the inner discs. We\nassociate the dominion of the first (second) channel to classical (pseudo)\nbulges, and compare the predicted fractions to observations. We remark that our\ntreatment does not include other mechanisms of bulge growth such as intrinsic\nsecular disc instabilities or misaligned gas accretion.

We\npresent the results of a long-term programme to investigate the intra-night\noptical variability (INOV) of powerful flat spectrum radio core-dominated\nquasars (CDQs), with a focus on probing the relationship of INOV to the degree\nof optical polarization.

Next the self\nsimilarity of the collapse of cold dynamical systems is investigated\nnumerically.

The light curve exhibits an abrupt\ntransition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau to a steep bolometric decline.\nLeading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits signs of\ninteraction with circumstellar material (CSM), in the form of relatively narrow\nP-Cygni features of H I and He I superimposed on broad Lorentzian wings. For\nthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni\nprofiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after the plateau has ended,\nthe SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden\ntransitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum. At this stage,\nthe light curve exhibits a low luminosity that is comparable to that\nsub-luminous Type II-P supernovae, and a relatively fast visual-wavelength\ndecline that is significantly steeper than the Co-56 decay rate. However, the\ntotal bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56\ndecay, and implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun).

If compact\nbinary mergers produce indeed gamma-ray bursts there should also be an\ninteraction region where an ultra-relativistic outflow interacts with the\nneutrino-driven wind and produces moderately relativistic ejecta.

These\nclusters are specifically selected to lack significant substructure at bright\nlimits in their central regions so that we are largely able to eliminate the\nlocal action of merging clusters on the frequency of AGN.

We attribute this deficit of AGN in the\ncluster centre to the changing mix of galaxy types with radius. We use the WHAN\ndiagnostic to separate weak AGN from `retired' galaxies in which the main\nionization mechanism comes from old stellar populations. These retired AGN are\nfound at all radii, while the mass effect is much more pronounced: we find that\nmassive galaxies are more likely to be in the retired class.

Recently, quantitative spectral analysis of two\nemission-line CSs, PB 8 and IC 4663, revealed that these stars do not belong to\nthe [WC] class.

However,\nUCDs typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the same\nluminosity. We use a GPU-enabled version of the particle-mesh code\n\\textsc{superbox} to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxies\ninto UCDs by tidally stripping them in a Virgo-like galaxy cluster.

However, the\ninterpretation of this finding has been ambiguous, because the subgiants are\nalso thought to be more massive than the F- and G-type stars that dominate the\nmain-sequence sample. Consequently it has been unclear whether the absence of\nhot Jupiters is due to tidal destruction, or inhibited formation of those\nplanets around massive stars.

It is\ntherefore surprising that universal EOS-independent relations connecting\ndifferent physical quantities of neutron stars can exist. Lau et al. [ApJ, 714,\n1234 (2010)] found that the frequency of the $f$-mode oscillation, the mass,\nand the moment of inertia are connected by universal relations. More recently,\nYagi and Yunes [Science, 341, 365 (2013)] discovered the I-Love-Q universal\nrelations among the mass, the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the\nquadrupole moment. In this paper, we study these universal relations in the\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. This theory differs from general\nrelativity (GR) significantly only at high densities due to the nonlinear\ncoupling between matter and gravity. It thus provides us an ideal case to test\nhow robust the universal relations of NSs are with respect to the change of the\ngravity theory. Thanks to the apparent EOS formulation of EiBI gravity\ndeveloped recently by Delsate and Steinhoff [Phys. Rev.

The data are well fit by this\nexomoon model, but an alternate star+planet model fits the data almost as well.\nNevertheless, these results indicate the potential of microlensing to detect\nexomoons, albeit ones that are different from the giant planet moons in our\nsolar system. The argument for an exomoon hinges on the system being relatively\nclose to the Sun. The data constrain the product M pi_rel, where M is the lens\nsystem mass and pi_rel is the lens-source relative parallax. If the lens system\nis nearby (large pi_rel), then M is small (a few Jupiter masses) and the\ncompanion is a sub-Earth-mass exomoon.

However, data from the OGLE collaboration nearly rule out a high\nsource proper motion, so the exoplanet+exomoon model is the favored\ninterpretation for the best fit model.

We present delay times of double-detonation SNe, in which\na sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes non-dynamically\nfrom a helium-rich companion. One of the main uncertainties in quantifying SN\nrates from double-detonations is the (assumed) retention efficiency of He-rich\nmatter. Therefore, we implement a new prescription for the treatment of\naccretion/accumulation of He-rich matter on white dwarfs. In addition, we test\nhow the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a\ndetonation in the helium shell. In comparing the results to our standard case\n(Ruiter et al. 2011), we find that regardless of the adopted He accretion\nprescription, the SN rates are reduced by only 25% if low-mass He shells (<\n0.05 Msun) are sufficient to trigger the detonations. If more massive (0.1\nMsun) shells are needed, the rates decrease by 85% and the delay time\ndistribution is significantly changed in the new accretion model - only SNe\nwith prompt (< 500 Myr) delay times are produced.

Using these observations, we have previously considered the\nrelativistic precession (RP) twin peak QPO model to estimate the mass of\ncentral NS in Circinus X-1. We have shown that such an estimate results in a\nspecific mass-angular-momentum (M-j) relation rather than a single preferred\ncombination of M and j. Here we confront our previous results with another\nbinary, the atoll source 4U 1636-53 that displays the twin peak QPOs at very\nhigh frequencies, and extend the consideration to various twin peak QPO models.\nIn analogy to the RP model, we find that these imply their own specific M-j\nrelations. We explore these relations for both sources and note differences in\nthe chi-square behavior that represent a dichotomy between high- and\nlow-frequency sources. Based on the RP model, we demonstrate that this\ndichotomy is related to a strong variability of the model predictive power\nacross the frequency plane. This variability naturally comes from the radial\ndependence of characteristic frequencies of orbital motion. As a consequence,\nthe restrictions on the models resulting from observations of low-frequency\nsources are weaker than those in the case of high-frequency sources. Finally we\nalso discuss the need for a correction to the RP model and consider the\nremoving of M-j degeneracies, based on the twin peak QPO-independent angular\nmomentum estimates. \n\n"}

We recover the sequence in\nassociation of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several\nindicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the\nstellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the\nthree SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and\noccur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter\nshowing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses\nthat are $\\sim$0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of\nold stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time\ndistribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our\nsample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts.\nSince both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN\nrate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts,\nand reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from\nvery old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive\ngalaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass\ngalaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia\nhosts.

It is therefore crucial to understand their\nbehavior. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures provides a\nconsistent way to perturbatively predict the clustering of dark matter at large\ndistances. The fact that baryons move distances comparable to dark matter\nallows us to infer that baryons at large distances can be described in a\nsimilar formalism: the backreaction of short-distance non-linearities and of\nstar-formation physics at long distances can be encapsulated in an effective\nstress tensor, characterized by a few parameters. The functional form of\nbaryonic effects can therefore be predicted. In the power spectrum the leading\ncontribution goes as $\\propto k^2 P(k)$, with $P(k)$ being the linear power\nspectrum and with the numerical prefactor depending on the details of the\nstar-formation physics. We also perform the resummation of the contribution of\nthe long-wavelength displacements, allowing us to consistently predict the\neffect of the relative motion of baryons and dark matter. We compare our\npredictions with simulations that contain several implementations of baryonic\nphysics, finding percent agreement up to relatively high wavenumbers such as\n$k\\simeq 0.3\\,h\\, Mpc^{-1}$ or $k\\simeq 0.6\\, h\\, Mpc^{-1}$, depending on the\norder of the calculation.

Secondly, we propose that cold populations of\nthin disc stars, selected by applying an orbital eccentricity cut, can be\ndirectly used to determine the LSR without the need of asymmetric drift\ncorrections. Both approaches yield consistent results of solar motion in the\ndirection of Galactic rotation, V_sun, that are much higher than the standard\nvalue adopted hitherto, derived from Stromgren's equation. The newly deduced\nvalues of V_sun are 1-2 km/s smaller than the more recent estimates derived\nfrom the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey sample of stars in the solar neighbourhood\n(within 100 pc).

The arrival distribution of cosmic rays at Earth is the convolution of\nthe distribution of their sources and of the effects of geometry and properties\nof the magnetic field through which particles propagate.

A suppression in\nthe flux of UHECRs at energies above 40 EeV -- as expected from both these\ninteractions -- has been established experimentally beyond any doubt by current\nexperiments.

Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully\nreproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the\ninitial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation\nand after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a\nscale-free pure power-law distribution $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto\nM^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by\nintroducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the\ncascade. Our candidate for such physics is a simple model for stellar radiation\nfeedback. Radiative heating, powered by accretion onto forming stars, arrests\nthe fragmentation cascade and imposes a characteristic mass scale that is\nnearly independent of the time-evolution or initial conditions in the\nstar-forming cloud, and that agrees well with the peak of the observed IMF. In\ncontrast, models that introduce a stiff equation of state for denser clouds but\nthat do not explicitly include the effects of feedback do not yield an\ninvariant IMF. \n\n"}

Data for\nother 13 PNe and three H II regions were retrieved from the literature.\nPhysical conditions and chemical abundances of O, N, Ne, Ar and S were derived\nfor 19 PNe and 4 H II regions.

Two groups of PNe can be differentiated: one old, with low metallicity\n(12+log(O/H)<8.0 and 12+log(Ar/H)<5.7) and another younger with metallicities\nsimilar to the values of H II regions. The old objects are distributed in a\nlarger volume than the young ones. An important fraction of PNe (>30%) was\nfound to be highly N-rich (Type I PNe). Such PNe occur at any metallicity.

The s-process pollution must therefore originate from\nmass transfer from a companion formerly on the AGB, now a carbon-oxygen white\ndwarf (WD). If the 384 d velocity variations are attributed to the WD\ncompanion, its orbit must be seen almost face-on, with $i \\sim 2.3^\\circ$,\nbecause the mass function is very small: $f(M_1,M_2) =\n(6.1\\pm1.1)\\times10^{-6}$ Msun. Alternatively, the WD orbital motion could be\nresponsible for the long-term velocity variations, with a period of several\ndecades. The 384 d variations should then be attributed either to a low-mass\ninner companion (perhaps a brown dwarf, depending on the orbital inclination),\nor to stellar pulsations. The latter possibility is made likely by the fact\nthat similar low-amplitude velocity variations, with periods close to 1 yr,\nhave been reported for other CEMP stars in a companion paper (Jorissen et al.,\n2015).

The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of\nit falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching\nepisode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the\nprincipal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN\nexplosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the\njet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse\ncore mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular\nmomentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback\nmechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the\nexplosion. Typical velocity and mass of this outflow are estimated to be\napproximately 1000 km/s and greater than about 1 solar mass, respectively,\nthough quantitative values will have to be checked in future hydrodynamic\nsimulations. \n\n"}

It is found that the\nefficiency at which magnetic energy is converted to radiation is limited to a\nmaximum value of $\\epsilon_c=3l_{dis}\\,\\sigma_0/4(\\sigma_0+1)$, where\n$\\sigma_0$ is the initial magnetization of the flow and $l_{dis}\\le1$ the\nfraction of initial Poynting flux that can dissipate. The asymptotic Lorentz\nfactor satisfies $\\Gamma_\\infty\\ge\\Gamma_0(1+l_{dis}\\,\\sigma_0/4)$, where\n$\\Gamma_0$ is the initial Lorentz factor. This limit is approached in cases\nwhere the cooling time is shorter than the local dissipation time. A somewhat\nsmaller radiative efficiency is expected if radiative losses are dominated by\nsynchrotron and SSC emissions. It is suggested that under certain conditions\nmagnetic field dissipation may occur in two distinct phases: On small scales,\nasymmetric magnetic fields that are advected into the polar region and dragged\nout by the outflow dissipate to a more stable configuration. The dissipated\nenergy is released predominantly as gamma rays. On much larger scales, the\noutflow encounters a flat density profile medium and re-collimates. This leads\nto further dissipation and wobbling of the jet head by the kink instability, as\nfound recently in 3D MHD simulations.

Previous global climate model\n(GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating planets, strong convection\nat the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the\nplanetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway.\nHowever these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods\nfor synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host\nstar. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the habitable zone for\nsynchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars\nusing a 3-D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar\nmetallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary\norbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the\nefficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation\nrate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity,\nplanetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the\ninner edge of the habitable zone is farther away from the host stars than in\nprevious GCM studies.

Abstract: Successful phenomenological models of pulsar wind nebulae assume efficient\ndissipation of the Poynting flux of the magnetized electron-positron wind as\nwell as efficient acceleration of the pairs in the vicinity of the termination\nshock, but how this is realized is not yet well understood. The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would\nfurther preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to\nequipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high\nmagnetization to values of order unity. Furthermore, it is speculated that the\nturbulence generated by the corrugation pattern may sustain a relativistic\nFermi process, accelerating particles close to the radiation reaction limit, as\nobserved in the Crab nebula.

Here, we\nsystematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on\ntemperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized\nplanets, using an idealized 3D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk\ncomposition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent\nvariables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular\nweight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to\nhave a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in\nthe thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the\nequatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the \"jet core\" region,\nwhere the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level.\nThe zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating\npattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also present analytical\ntheories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the\nunderlying dynamical mechanisms.

Eta Car is\na unique object for studying the massive stellar wind during the LBV phase. It\nis also an eccentric binary with a period of 5.54 yr. The nature of both stars\nis uncertain, although we know from X-ray studies that there is a wind-wind\ncollision whose properties change with orbital phase.\n  Methods. Observations of Eta Car were carried out with the ESO VLTI and the\nAMBER instrument between approximately five and seven months before the August\n2014 periastron passage. Velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images were\nreconstructed from the spectrally dispersed interferograms. Interferometric\nstudies can provide information on the binary orbit, the primary wind, and the\nwind collision.\n  Results. We present velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images reconstructed\nin more than 100 different spectral channels distributed across the Br Gamma\n2.166 micrometer emission line. The intensity distribution of the images\nstrongly depends on wavelength. At wavelengths corresponding to radial\nvelocities of approximately -140 to -376 km/s measured relative to line center,\nthe intensity distribution has a fan-shaped structure. At the velocity of -277\nkm/s, the position angle of the symmetry axis of the fan is ~ 126 degree.

Testing the fidelity of lensed quasar host galaxy\n  reconstruction Abstract: The empirical correlation between the mass of a super-massive black hole\n(MBH) and its host galaxy properties is widely considered to be evidence of\ntheir co-evolution. A powerful way to test the co-evolution scenario and learn\nabout the feedback processes linking galaxies and nuclear activity is to\nmeasure these correlations as a function of redshift. Unfortunately, currently\nMBH can only be estimated in active galaxies at cosmological distances. At\nthese distances, bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) can outshine the host\ngalaxy, making it extremely difficult to measure the host's luminosity.\nStrongly lensed AGNs provide in principle a great opportunity to improve the\nsensitivity and accuracy of the host galaxy luminosity measurements as the host\ngalaxy is magnified and more easily separated from the point source, provided\nthe lens model is sufficiently accurate.

When $h<2$, the plasma effect\ndominates over the vacuum Schwarzschild curvature, potentially shifting the\nradius of the unstable circular photon orbit outside the surface of the CO.\nWhen this occurs, we define two relatively narrow radio-frequency bands in\nwhich plasma effects are particularly significant. Rays in the escape window\nhave $\\omega_{0} < \\omega \\leq \\omega_{+}$ and are free to propagate to\ninfinity from the CO surface. To a distant observer, the visible portion of the\nCO surface appears to shrink as the observed frequency is reduced, and vanishes\nentirely at $\\omega_{0}$, in excess of the plasma frequency at the CO surface.\nWe define the anomalous propagation window for frequencies $\\omega_{-}< \\omega\n\\leq \\omega_{0}$.

We conclude\nwith a study of neutron star (NS) compactness ratios for a variety of nuclear\nmatter equations of state (EoS). For $h=1$, NSs generated from stiff EoS should\ndisplay significant frequency dependence in the EW, and lower values of $h$\nwith softer EoS can also show these effects. \n\n"}

The observed wavelength dependence of\nthe intrinsic polarization does not support non-thermal synchrotron emission\nfrom a jet as a plausible mechanism, but is in better agreement with the\ncombined effect of electron (Thomson) scattering and absorption in a flattened\nplasma envelope or outflow surrounding the illuminating source. Alternatively,\nthe polarization signal can be produced by scattering of the disc radiation in\na mildly relativistic polar outflow. The position angle of the intrinsic\npolarization, nearly parallel to the jet direction (i.e. perpendicular to the\naccretion disc plane), is in agreement with these interpretations. \n\n"}

However, its robustness in realistic\n3D reconnection -- in particular, whether the 3D relativistic drift-kink\ninstability (RDKI) disrupts NTPA -- has not been systematically investigated,\nalthough pioneering 3D simulations have observed NTPA in isolated cases. Here\nwe present the first comprehensive study of NTPA in 3D relativistic\nreconnection in collisionless electron-positron plasmas, characterizing NTPA as\nthe strength of 3D effects is varied systematically via the length in the third\ndimension and the strength of the guide magnetic field. We find that, while the\nRDKI prominently perturbs 3D reconnecting current sheets, it does not suppress\nparticle acceleration, even for zero guide field; fully 3D reconnection\nrobustly and efficiently produces nonthermal power-law particle spectra closely\nresembling those obtained in 2D. This finding provides strong support for\nreconnection as the key mechanism powering high-energy flares in various\nastrophysical systems. We also show that strong guide fields significantly\ninhibit NTPA, slowing reconnection and limiting the energy available for plasma\nenergization, yielding steeper and shorter power-law spectra. \n\n"}

In the in-situ formation scenario, the\neccentricities and inclinations of planets are determined by gravitational\nscattering and collisions between protoplanets on the giant impact stage. We\ninvestigate the effect of the initial eccentricities and inclinations of\nprotoplanets on the formation of close-in super-Earths.

We find that while the\neccentricities of protoplanets are well relaxed through their evolution, the\ninclinations are not. When the initial inclinations are small, they are not\ngenerally pumped up since scattering is less effective and collisions occur\nimmediately after orbital crossing. On the other hand, when the initial\ninclinations are large, they tend to be kept large since collisional damping is\nless effective. Not only the resultant inclinations of planets, but also their\nnumber, eccentricities, angular momentum deficit, and orbital separations are\naffected by the initial inclinations of protoplanets. \n\n"}

In addition, at lower temperatures (< 29 K),\ngaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO$_{2}$ and other\nmore complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O$_{2}$ and CO\nthermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature\nthan suggested by its binding energy. Chemistry in the disk midplane is\nionisation-driven, and evolves over time. In order to reliably predict the\natmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed\natmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have\nformed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and\nimplemented into planet formation models. \n\n"}

We find that a toroidally dominated magnetic field is\nessential for the generation of a single spot with a strong magnetic field.\nOnce a spot forms, it survives for several million years, even after the total\nmagnetic field has decayed significantly. We find that the dipole axis is not\nstationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general\ncoincide with the location of the magnetic spot. This is due to\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal\ndipole axis at rates that may reach $0.4^{\\circ}$ per century. A misaligned\npoloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant\ndisplacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case. Finally we discuss\nthe evolution of neutron stars with such magnetic fields on the $P-\\dot{P}$\ndiagram and the observational implications.

We investigate appearance and\nproperties of the resulting cavities, and the efficiency of jets in providing\nnear-isotropic heating to the cooling cluster core.\n  Methods: We use numerical simulations to explore four models of jets over\nseveral active/inactive cycles. We keep the jet power and duration fixed,\nvarying only the jet angle prescription. We track the total energy of the\nintracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core over time, and the fraction of\nthe jet energy transferred to the ICM, paying attention to where the energy is\ndeposited. We also compare synthetic X-ray images of the simulated cluster to\nactual observations.\n  Results: Jets whose re-orientation is minimal ($\\lesssim 20^{\\circ}$)\ntypically produce conical structures of interconnected cavities, with the\nopening angle of the cones being $\\sim 15-20^{\\circ}$, extending to $\\sim 300$\nkpc from the cluster centre. Such jets transfer about $60\\%$ of their energy to\nthe ICM, yet they are not very efficient at heating the cluster core, as the\njet energy is deposited further out. Jets that re-orient by $\\gtrsim\n20^{\\circ}$ generally produce multiple pairs of detached cavities. Although\nsmaller, these cavities are inflated within the central 50~kpc and are more\nisotropically distributed, resulting in more effective heating of the core.\nSuch jets, over few hundreds Myr, can deposit up to $80\\%$ of their energy\nwhere it is required. Consequently, these models come the closest to an\nheating/cooling balance and to mitigating runaway cooling of the core, even\nthough all models have identical power/duration profiles. Additionally, the\ncorresponding synthetic X-ray images exhibit structures closely resembling\nthose seen in real cool-core clusters. \n\n"}

We confront these internal rotation rates to stellar\nevolution models with rotationally induced transport of angular momentum, in\norder to test angular momentum transport mechanisms.

We show that the buoyancy radius can be used\nas a reliable evolution indicator for field stars on the MS. We computed\nrotating evolutionary models including transport of angular momentum in\nradiative zones, following Zahn and Maeder, with the CESTAM code. This code\ncalculates the rotational history of stars from the birth line to the tip of\nthe RGB. The initial angular momentum content has to be set initially, which is\ndone by fitting rotation periods in young stellar clusters.

In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to\nsolve the above problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter\nestimation and model selection in Astrophysics. Variational inference converts\nthe inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the\nposterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence to characterize the difference. It takes advantage of fast\noptimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets and\nmakes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform.

Microwave observations\nfor specific regions with well-constrained PAH features would be crucial to\ntest the spinning dust hypothesis. In this paper, we present physical modeling\nof microwave emission from spinning PAHs from protoplanetary disks (PPDs)\naround Herbig Ae/Be stars and T-Tauri stars where PAH features are well\nobserved. Guided by the presence of 10 $\\mu$m silicate features in some PPDs,\nwe also model microwave emission from spinning nanosilicates. Thermal emission\nfrom big dust grains is computed using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code.\nOur numerical results demonstrate that microwave emission from either spinning\nPAHs or spinning nanosilicates dominates over thermal dust at frequencies $\\nu<\n60$ GHz, even in the presence of significant grain growth. Finally, we attempt\nto fit mm-cm observational data with both thermal dust and spinning dust for\nseveral disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars that exhibit PAH features and find that\nspinning dust can successfully reproduce the observed excess microwave emission\n(EME).

In our simulations, we take into account the\neffects of secular dynamical evolution, stellar evolution, tidal evolution and\nencounters with passing stars. We focus on type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) driven\nby collisions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs). Such collisions can\narise from several channels: (1) collisions due to extremely high\neccentricities induced by secular evolution, (2) collisions following a\ndynamical instability of the system, and (3) collisions driven by semisecular\nevolution. The systems considered here have initially wide inner orbits, with\ninitial semilatus recti larger than 12 AU, implying no interaction if the\norbits were isolated. However, taking into account dynamical evolution, we find\nthat $\\approx 0.4$ ($\\approx 0.6$) of 2+2 (3+1) systems interact.

Primarily, affine spacetime, composed of geodesics with no notion of\nlength and angle, accommodates gravity but not matter. The thesis study is\nexpected to reveal salient properties of matter dynamics in affine spacetime\nand may reveal an intimate connection between vacuum state and metrical\ngravity. An interesting application of the framework is the inflationary\nregime, where it is shown that affine gravity prefers only a unique metric\ntensor such that the transition from nonminimal to minimal coupling of the\ninflaton is performed only via redefinition of the latter. This allows us to\navoid the use of the so called conformal frames. In fact, unlike metric\ngravity, the metric tensor in affine gravity is generated and not postulated a\npriori, thus this tensor is absent in the actions and conformal transformation\ndoes not make sense.

The molecular gas morphology is complex\nand disturbed, showing no evidence for a rotationally-supported structure in\nequilibrium. $80\\%$ of the gas is situated within the central 5 kpc of the\ngalactic center, while the remaining gas is located in a 20 kpc long filament.\nThe cold gas has likely condensed out of the hot atmosphere. The filament is\noriented along the edge of a putative X-ray cavity, suggesting that AGN\nactivity has stimulated condensation. This is enegetically feasible, although\nthe morphology is not as conclusive as systems whose molecular filaments trail\ndirectly behind buoyant radio bubbles. The velocity gradient along the filament\nis smooth and shallow. It is only consistent with free-fall if it lies within\n$20^{\\circ}$ of the plane of the sky.

The application we have in mind is to old stellar\nsystems such as globular star clusters, where N~10^6, and so we concentrate on\nspherical, centrally concentrated systems with total energy E<0. Hitherto no\nconnection has been made between the time scale for divergence (denoted here by\nt_e) and the two-body relaxation time scale (t_r), even though both may be\ncalculated by consideration of two-body encounters.\n  In this paper we give a simplified model showing that divergence in phase\nspace is initially roughly exponential, on a timescale proportional to the\ncrossing time (defined as a mean time for a star to cross from one side of the\nsystem to another). In this phase t_e is much less than t_r, if N is not too\nsmall (i.e. N is much more than about 30). After several e-folding times, the\nmodel shows that the divergence slows down. Thereafter the divergence (measured\nby the energies of the bodies) varies with time as t^{1/2}, on a timescale\nnearly proportional to the familiar two-body relaxation timescale, i.e. t_e ~\nt_r in this phase.

Our main findings are: (i) The lensing\nprobability should be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than for conventional\nsurveys. The expected fraction of multiply-imaged quasars is highly sensitive\nto redshift and the uncertain slope of the bright end of the luminosity\nfunction, beta_h. For beta_h=2.58 (3.43) we find that at z~4.3 and i*<20.0 the\nfraction is ~4% (13%) while at z~6 and z*<20.2 the fraction is ~7% (30%). (ii)\nThe distribution of magnifications is heavily skewed; sources having the\nredshift and luminosity of the SDSS z>5.8 quasars acquire median magnifications\nof med(mu_obs)~1.1-1.3 and mean magnifications of <mu_obs>~5-50. Estimates of\nthe quasar luminosity density at high redshift must therefore filter out\ngravitationally-lensed sources. (iii) The flux in the Gunn-Peterson trough of\nthe highest redshift (z=6.28) quasar is known to be f_lambda<3 10^-19\nerg/sec/cm^2/Angstrom. Should this quasar be multiply imaged, we estimate a 40%\nchance that light from the lens galaxy would have contaminated the same part of\nthe quasar spectrum with a higher flux. Hence, spectroscopic studies of the\nepoch of reionization need to account for the possibility that a lens galaxy,\nwhich boosts the quasar flux, also contaminates the Gunn-Peterson trough.

Their median stellar surface mass\ndensity scales with stellar mass as mu* propto M_*^0.54, suggesting that the\nstellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of its\nhalo mass.

We identify 12 cosmological systems, and 6 systems\nthat are either ejected from the background QSO or affected by its local\nradiation field. Almost all of the intergalactic OVI is associated with strong\nLy-a absorption (N_HI > 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from CIV and\noften lower ionization species. The absorbing regions are conservatively\nconstrained to have L<=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar >= 2.5, with actual values\nprobably closer to L ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. They also have two\ndistinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized CIV and SiIV at T ~ 30,000\nK, and a second which is seen only in OVI. The OVI temperature is difficult to\nconstrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, but\nit does appear that this gas is hotter than the CIV/SiIV phase and could\nsupport collisional OVI production. The OVI is strongly clustered on velocity\nscales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s. The\npower-law slope of the correlation function resembles that of local galaxy and\ncluster surveys, with a comoving correlation length of 11h_{65}^-1 Mpc. The\naverage Oxygen abundance of the OVI systems is [O/H]>-1.5, about 10 times\nhigher than the level observed in the general IGM.

The\nbright envelope of rest-frame B-band galaxy luminosities is similar from 0<z<3,\nand the co-moving luminosity density is constant to within a factor of 3 over\nthat redshift range.

Using adaptive optics and speckle\nimaging to study the motions of stars in the plane of sky with +-~2 mas\nprecision over the past 7 years, we have obtained the first simultaneous\norbital solution for multiple stars. Among the included stars, three are newly\nidentified (S0-16, S0-19, S0-20). The most dramatic orbit is that of the newly\nidentified star S0-16, which passed a mere 60 AU from the central dark mass at\na velocity of 9,000 km/s in 1999. The orbital analysis results in a new central\ndark mass estimate of 3.6(+-0.4)x10^6(D/8kpc)^3 Mo.

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is\nbimodal at all redshifts out to z~1. This bimodality permits a\nmodel-independent definition of red, early-type galaxies and blue, late-type\ngalaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder\ntowards the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has\ndropped strongly since z~1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they\npopulate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in\ngalaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over\nthis redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color\nof the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent\nwith the aging of an ancient stellar population.

The 0.5-10 keV intrinsic continuum of the source is well represented\nby a single power law (Gamma=1.53) and a soft black-body component (kT=10 keV).\nThe spectrum contains over 100 features, which are well fit by PHASE with just\nsix free parameters. The model consists of a simple two phase absorber with\ndifference of 35 in the ionization parameter and difference of 4 in the column\ndensity of the phases. The two absorption components turned out to be in\npressure equilibrium, and are consistent with a single outflow (750 kms-1) an a\nsingle turbulent velocity (300 km s-1), and with solar elemental abundances.\nThe main features of the low ionization phase are an Fe M-shell unresolved\ntransition array (UTA) and the OVII lines. The OVII features, usualy identified\nwith the OVIII and a warm absorber, are instead produced in a cooler medium\nalso producing OVI lines. The UTA sets tight constraints on the ionization\ndegree of the absorbers, making the model more reliable.

Within dark matter\nhalos, forming at the rate predicted by the canonical hierarchical clustering\nscenario, the gas evolution is controlled by gravity, radiative cooling, and\nheating by feedback from supernovae and from the growing active nucleus.\nSupernova heating is increasingly effective with decreasing binding energy in\nslowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows. The more massive\nproto-galaxies virializing at earlier times are thus the sites of the faster\nstar-formation. The correspondingly higher radiation drag fastens the angular\nmomentum loss by the gas, resulting in a larger accretion rate onto the central\nblack-hole. In turn, the kinetic energy carried by outflows driven by active\nnuclei can unbind the residual gas, thus halting both the star formation and\nthe black-hole growth, in a time again shorter for larger halos. For the most\nmassive galaxies the gas unbinding time is short enough for the bulk of the\nstar-formation to be completed before type Ia supernovae can substantially\nincrease the $Fe$ abundance of the interstellar medium, thus accounting for the\n$\\alpha$-enhancement seen in the largest galaxies.

By combining various\nextensive photometric datasets in BVI and single-epoch 2MASS JHK photometry, PL\nrelationships for the cluster Cepheids are obtained. A comparison between the\nfield LMC and cluster PL relationships for the reddening free Wesenheit index\ngives a firm determination of the distance between the cluster and the LMC main\nbody (0.04 mag in distance modulus, the cluster being more distant) which,\ncoupled to a model for the geometry of the LMC disk, provides \\Delta (DM)\nranging between 0.0 and -0.11 mag. The simultaneous comparison of the PL\nrelationships in BVI for the cluster and LMC field gives an estimate of the\ncluster reddening, which results to be E(B-V) = 0.12 \\pm 0.02. This\ndetermination is higher than the canonical value of 0.06 mag used in all\nprevious studies, but we show that it is not in contradiction with a\nre-analysis of independent estimates.

We use the results of\nthis analysis to compare the luminosities and sizes of nuclear star clusters to\nthose of other ellipsoidal stellar systems, in particular the Milky Way\nglobular clusters.

The focus of this paper is\non the design of the selection algorithm and on its application to simulated\ndata. In the companion paper we test it by applying it to sources discovered\nthrough Chandra observations of 4 galaxies. We find that, in its application to\nboth simulated and real data, our procedure also selects somewhat harder\nsources, which we call quasisoft.

Three of these planes are\northogonal to the ecliptic at a level inconsistent with gaussian random\nstatistically isotropic skies at 99.8% C.L., and the normals to these planes\nare aligned at 99.9% C.L. with the direction of the cosmological dipole and\nwith the equinoxes. The remaining octopole plane is orthogonal to the\nsupergalactic plane at >99.9% C.L. In a combined quadrupole-octopole map, the\necliptic plane narrowly threads between a hot spot and a cold spot over\napproximately 1/3 of the sky, and separates the three strongest extrema (in the\nsouth ecliptic hemisphere) from the three weakest extrema (in the north\necliptic hemisphere). \n\n"}

BH coalescences may represent an important component of the quasar\nmass assembly and yet not produce any observable electromagnetic signature.\nTherefore, ignoring gravitational wave (GW) emission during such coalescences,\nwhich reduces the amount of mass locked into remnant BHs, results in an\noverestimate of epsilon. Here, we put constraints on the magnitude of this\nbias. We calculate the cumulative mass loss to GWs experienced by a\nrepresentative population of BHs during repeated cosmological mergers, using\nloss prescriptions based on detailed general relativistic calculations. Despite\nthe possibly large number of mergers in the assembly history of each individual\nSMBH, we find that near--equal mass mergers are rare, and therefore the\ncumulative loss is likely to be modest, amounting at most to an increase by 20\npercent of the inferred epsilon value.

During the luminous phase (first 100\nd) the line profiles are composed of three major components: (i) narrow P-Cygni\nlines with the absorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines with\nBVZI ~4000 km/s; and (iii) broad, smooth wings, most apparent in H-alpha. These\ncomponents are identified with an expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope,\nshocked cool gas in the forward post-shock region, and multiple Thomson\nscattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P-Cygni lines\nfrom the supernova is the result of the formation of an optically thick, cool,\ndense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope. We model the\nsupernova deceleration and Thomson scattering wings to recover the density,\nradial extent and Thomson optical depth of the CS envelope during the first\nmonth.

Estimating the mass within the\n  virial radius Abstract: Elliptical galaxies are modelled with a a 4-component model: Sersic stars,\nLCDM dark matter (DM), hot gas and central black hole. DM is negligible in the\ninner regions, which are dominated by stars and the central black hole. This\nprevents any kinematical estimate (using a Jeans analysis) of the inner slope\nof the DM density profile. The gas fraction rises, but the baryon fraction\ndecreases with radius, at least out to 10 effective radii (R_e). Even with\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion (VD) measurements at 4 to 6 R_e with 20 km/s\naccuracy and perfectly known velocity anisotropy, the total mass within the\nvirial radius (r_v) is uncertain by a factor over 3. The DM distributions found\nin LCDM simulations are consistent with the stellar VD profiles, but appear\ninconsistent with the low VDs measured by Romanowsky et al. (2003) of planetary\nnebulae between 2 and 5 R_e, which imply such low M/Ls that the baryon fraction\nwithin r_v must be greater than the universal value. Replacing the NFW DM model\nby the new model of Navarro et al. (2004) decreases slightly the VD at a given\nradius. So, given the observed VD measured at 5 R_e, the inferred M/L within\nr_v is 40% larger than predicted with the NFW model. Folding in the slight\n(strong) radial anisotropy found in LCDM (merger) simulations, which is well\nmodelled (much better than with the Osipkov-Merritt formula) with beta(r) = 1/2\nr/(r+a), the inferred M/L within r_v is another 1.6 (2.4) times higher than for\nthe isotropic NFW model. Thus, the DM model and radial anisotropy can partly\nexplain the low PN VDs, but not in full. In an appendix, single integral\nexpressions are derived for the VDs in terms of the tracer density and total\nmass profiles, for 3 anisotropic models: radial, Osipkov-Merritt, and the model\nabove, for general radial profiles of luminosity density and mass. \n\n"}

The primordial abundance of any one nuclide can, therefore, be used to\nmeasure the baryon abundance and the value derived from the observationally\ninferred primordial abundance of deuterium closely matches that from current,\nnon-BBN data, primarily from the WMAP survey. However, using this same estimate\nthere is a tension between the SBBN-predicted 4He and 7Li abundances and their\ncurrent, observationally inferred primordial abundances, suggesting that N_nu\nmay differ from the standard model value of three and/or that there may be a\nnon-zero neutral lepton asymmetry (or, that systematic errors in the abundance\ndeterminations have been underestimated or overlooked). The differences are not\nlarge and the allowed ranges of the BBN parameters permitted by the data are\nquite small. Within these ranges, the BBN-predicted abundances of D, 3He, 4He,\nand 7Li are very smooth, monotonic functions of eta, N_nu, and the lepton\nasymmetry.

Fold Lenses Abstract: When the source in a 4-image gravitational lens lies close to a \"fold\"\ncaustic, two of the lensed images lie close together. If the lens potential is\nsmooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, then the\ndifference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, Rfold =\n(F1-F2)/(F1+F2) \\approx 0. Violations of this \"fold relation\" in observed\nlenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than\nthe separation between the close images. We study the fold relation and find it\nto be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which\nRfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on the\ndistance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the\ncaustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. Thus, it is\nimpossible to say from Rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalous\nor not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of Rfold values that\ncan be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation between\nthe two close images and the distance to the next nearest image. We analyze the\ngeneric and specific features of this distribution, and then show that 5 of the\n12 known lenses with fold configurations have flux ratio anomalies: B0712+472,\nSDSS 0924+0219, PG 1115+080, B1555+375, and B1933+503.

Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff\nconsistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy\nvariation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses\nnear the Planck scale.

We have investigated the problem in two\nways: a global radiation background and local radiative feedback surrounding\nthe first star clusters.\n  Cooling in the first halos at high redshift is dominated by molecular\nhydrogen, H_2 - we call these Generation 1 objects. At lower redshift and\nhigher virial temperature, T_vir > 10^4K, electron cooling dominates - we call\nthese generation 2. Radiation fields act to photo-dissociate H_2, but also\ngenerate free electrons that can help to catalyse its production. At modest\nradiation levels, J_{21}/(1+z)^3 ~ 10^{-12}-10^{-7}, the nett effect is to\nenhance the formation of Generation 1 star-clusters. At higher fluxes the\nheating from photo-ionisation dominates and halts their production.

A\nsimilar effect is seen with local feedback. Provided that enough photons are\nproduced to maintain ionization of their host halo, they will suppress the\ncooling in Generation 1 halos and boost the numbers of primordial star clusters\nin Generation 2 halos.

Our analysis finds:\ni) delay times as long as 3-4 Gyr, derived from observations of SNe Ia at high\nredshift, cannot reproduce the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the colors and\non the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies, as observed in the local\nUniverse; ii) the comparison between observed SN rates and a grid of\ntheoretical \"single-population\" DTDs shows that only a few of them are possibly\nconsistent with observations. The most successful models are all predicting a\npeak of SN explosions soon after star formation and an extended tail in the\nDTD, and can reproduce the data but only at a modest statistical confidence\nlevel; iii) present data are best matched by a bimodal DTD, in which about 50%\nof type Ia SNe (dubbed \"prompt\" SN Ia) explode soon after their stellar birth,\nin a time of the order of 10^8 years, while the remaining 50% (\"tardy\" SN Ia)\nhave a much wider distribution, well described by an exponential function with\na decay time of about 3 Gyr.

A model with\nlittle evolution of quasar clustering in comoving coordinates is best explained\nin the current cosmological paradigm by rapid evolution in quasar bias. We show\nthat quasar biasing must have changed from b_Q~3 at a (photometric) redshift of\nz=2.2 to b_Q~1.2-1.3 by z=0.75. Such a rapid increase with redshift in biasing\nimplies that quasars at z~2 cannot be the progenitors of modern L* objects,\nrather they must now reside in dense environments, such as clusters. Similarly,\nthe duration of the UVX quasar phase must be short enough to explain why local\nUVX quasars reside in essentially unbiased structures. Our estimates of b_Q are\nin good agreement with recent spectroscopic results, which demonstrate the\nimplied evolution in b_Q is consistent with quasars inhabiting halos of similar\nmass at every redshift.

The most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either double\nneutron star (DNS) binaries or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) systems. Such\nevents are strong sources of gravitational-waves (GWs) and might be detected by\nground-based GW observatories. In this work we combine the census of SHB\nobservations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluation\nof the compact binary model. We then explore the implications for GW detection\nof these events. Beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic\ntime, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions can\nreproduce the known SHB redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak flux\ndistribution of the large BATSE SHB sample. We find that: (1) The typical\nprogenitor lifetime is long. Assuming lognormal lifetime distribution the\ntypical lifetime is >4[1] Gyr (2[3]\\sigma c.l.). If the lifetime distribution\nis a power-law with index \\eta then \\eta>-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \\sigma c.l.). This\nresult is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galactic\nDNS population, suggesting that if SHBs do result from DNS mergers then the\nobserved galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) We find that\nthe local rate of SHBs is larger than 10Gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by several\norders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) Assuming that\nSHBs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the LIGO and VIRGO\nevent rates are encouraging: The chance for detection by current facilities is\nnot negligible, while a coincident detection of GW and electromagnetic\nradiation from an SHB is guaranteed for next-generation observatories. \n\n"}

The flares of GRB 050607 were not symmetric as\nin previously reported cases, showing a very steep rise and a shallower decay,\nsimilar to the Fast Rise, Exponential Decay that are frequently observed in the\ngamma-ray prompt emission. The brighter flare had a flux increase by a factor\nof approximately 25,peaking for 30 seconds at a count rate of approximately 30\ncounts s-1, and it presented hints of addition short time scale activity during\nthe decay phase. There is evidence of spectral evolution during the flares. In\nparticular, at the onset of the flares the observed emission was harder, with a\ngradual softening as each flare decayed. The very short time scale and the\nspectral variability during the flaring activity are indicators of possible\nextended periods of energy emission by the GRB central engine. The flares were\nfollowed by a phase of shallow decay, during which the forward shock was being\nrefreshed by a long-lived central engine or by shells of lower Lorentz factors,\nand by a steepening after approximately 12 ks to a decay slope considered\ntypical of X-ray afterglows. \n\n"}

During\nthis campaign the pulsar experienced 23 sudden increases in frequency\n(``glitches'') amounting to a total gain of over six ppm of rotation frequency\nsuperposed on its gradual spindown of d(nu)/d(t) = -2e-10 Hz/s.

In terms of theoretical understanding we are still just scratching a\nsurface of a very rich subject. We have some theoretically well justified\nmodels that are poorly supported by experiments, we also have She-Leveque\nmodel, which could be vulnerable on theoretical grounds, but, nevertheless, is\nwell supported by experimental and laboratory data.

The flare\nactivity suggests a quasi-periodicity of ~20 minutes in agreement with previous\nobservations. Aims: By simultaneous fitting of the lightcurve fluctuations and\nthe time-variable polarization angle, we address the question of whether these\nchanges are consistent with a simple hot spot/ring model, in which the\ninterplay of relativistic effects plays the major role, or whether some more\ncomplex dependency of the intrinsic emissivity is required. Methods: We discuss\nthe significance of the 20min peak in the periodogram of a flare from 2003. We\nconsider all general relativistic effects that imprint on the polarization\ndegree and angle and fit the recent polarimetric data, assuming that the\nsynchrotron mechanism is responsible for the intrinsic polarization and\nconsidering two different magnetic field configurations. Results: Within the\nquality of the available data, we think that the model of a single spot in\naddition to an underlying ring is favoured. In this model the broad\nnear-infrared flares of Sgr A* are due to a sound wave that travels around the\nMBH once while the sub-flares, superimposed on the broad flare, are due to\ntransiently heated and accelerated electrons which can be modeled as a plasma\nblob. Within this model it turns out that a strong statement about the spin\nparameter is difficult to achieve, while the inclination can be constrained to\nvalues > 35 deg on a 3sigma level. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that, under certain restrictions, such simulations\nconverge with increasing resolution to a consistent solution. The dark matter\nachieves convergence provided that the relevant scales dominating nonlinear\ncollapse are resolved. If the gas has a minimum temperature (as expected when\nintergalactic gas is heated by photoionization due to the ultraviolet\nbackground) and the corresponding Jeans mass is resolved, then the baryons also\nconverge. However, if there is no minimum baryonic collapse mass or if this\nscale is not resolved, then the baryon results err in a systematic fashion. In\nsuch a case, as resolution is increased the baryon distribution tends toward a\nhigher density, more tightly bound state. We attribute this to the fact that\nunder hierarchical structure formation on all scales there is always an earlier\ngeneration of smaller scale collapses, causing shocks which irreversibly alter\nthe state of the baryon gas. In a simulation with finite resolution we miss\nsuch earlier generation collapses, unless a physical scale is introduced below\nwhich structure formation is suppressed in the baryons.

In this paper, we establish\nthe existence of a rich cluster at the quasar redshift, and study the\nproperties of the cluster galaxies through further detailed analysis of the\nphotometric data. The color distribution of the galaxies in the cluster is\nquite broad and the fraction of blue galaxies (\\sim 70%) is much larger than in\nintermediate-redshift clusters. Using evolutionary synthesis models, we show\nthat this color distribution can be explained by galaxies with various amounts\nof star-formation activity mixed with the old stellar populations. Notably,\nthere are about a dozen galaxies which show very red optical-NIR colors but\nalso show significant UV excess with respect to passive-evolution models. They\ncan be interpreted as old early-type galaxies with a small amount of star\nformation. The fact that the UV-excess red galaxies are more abundant than the\nquiescent red ones suggests that a large fraction of old galaxies in this\ncluster are still forming stars to some extent.

A\nproposed explanation for this remarkable fact is that gravitational radiation\nfrom a steady-state r-mode oscillation in the neutron star's core halts the\nspin-up due to accretion. For the neutron star transients, balancing the\ntime-averaged accretion torque with gravitational wave emission from\nsteady-state, constant amplitude r-mode pulsations implies a quiescent\nluminosity too bright to be consistent with observations (in particular of Aql\nX-1). The viscous dissipation (roughly 10 MeV per accreted nucleon for a spin\nof 300 Hz) from such an r-mode makes the core sufficiently hot to power a\nthermal luminosity of order 1e34 erg/s when accretion halts. This is the\nminimum quiescent luminosity that the neutron star must emit when viscous\nheating in the core is balanced by radiative cooling from the surface, as is\nthe case when the core of the star is superfluid. We therefore conclude that\neither the accretion torque is much less than (dM/dt)(GMR)^{1/2}, or that a\nsteady-state r-mode does not limit the spin rate of the neutron star\ntransients.

Quasi-Spherical Spacetimes Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which cosmological variations in physical\n`constants' and scalar fields are detectable on the surface of local\ngravitationally-bound systems, such as planets, in non-spherically symmetric\nbackground spacetimes. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to\ndeal with the large range of length scales that appear in the problem. We\nderive a sufficient condition for the local time variation of the scalar fields\ndriving variations in 'constants' to track their large-scale cosmological\nvariation and show that this is consistent with our earlier conjecture derived\nfrom the spherically symmetric problem. We perform our analysis with spacetime\nbackgrounds that are of Szekeres-Szafron type. They are approximately\nSchwarzschild in some locality and free of gravitational waves everywhere. At\nlarge distances, we assume that the spacetime matches smoothly onto a Friedmann\nbackground universe. We conclude that, independent of the details of the\nscalar-field theory describing the varying `constant', the condition for its\ncosmological variations to be measured locally is almost always satisfied in\nphysically realistic situations. The very small differences expected to be\nobserved between different scales are quantified.

The symmetry will be spontaneously broken again in a given\nfluctuation region as the temperature drops there (for fluctuations with length\nscales smaller than the horizon), resulting in the production of baryon\nasymmetry.

In contrast\nto modifications of general relativity based on metric geometry, no continuous\ndeformation scale needs to be introduced; the extension to area geometry is\npurely structural and thus rigid. We present an intriguing prediction of area\nmetric gravity: without dark energy or fine-tuning, the late universe exhibits\na small acceleration. \n\n"}

Hence it\nis important to examine in details uncertainties (and values) of inputs to the\nSSM. Currently, the largest fractional uncertainty is due to the new evaluation\nof the surface composition of the sun. We examine the nuclear input on the\nformation of solar 8B [S17(0)] and demonstrate that it is still quite uncertain\ndue to ill known slope of the measured astrophysical cross section factor and\nthus ill defined extrapolation to zero energy. This yields an additional\nreasonably estimated uncertainty due to extrapolation of +0.0 -3.0 eV-b (+0%\n-14%). Since a large discrepancy exists among measured as well as among\npredicted slopes, the value of S17(0) is dependent on the choice of data and\ntheory used to extrapolate S17(0). This situation must be alleviated by new\nmeasurement(s). The \"world average\" is driven by the Seattle result due to the\nvery small quoted uncertainty, which we however demonstrate it to be an\nover-estimated accuracy. We propose more realistic error bars for the Seattle\nresults based on the published Seattle data. \n\n"}

The nuclear weak charge and current operators have vector and\naxial-vector components, that include one- and many-body terms. All possible\nmultipole transitions connecting any of the p 3He S- and P-wave channels to the\n4He bound state are considered. The S-factor at a p 3He center-of-mass energy\nof 10 keV, close to the Gamow-peak energy, is predicted to be 10.1 10^{-20} keV\nb with the AV18/UIX Hamiltonian, a factor of about 4.5 larger than the value\nadopted in the standard solar model. The P-wave transitions are found to be\nimportant, contributing about 40 % of the calculated S-factor. The energy\ndependence is rather weak: the AV18/UIX zero-energy S-factor is 9.64 10^{-20}\nkeV b, only 5 % smaller than the 10 keV result quoted above. The model\ndependence is also found to be weak: the zero-energy S-factor is calculated to\nbe 10.2 10^{-20} keV b with the older AV14/UVIII model, only 6 % larger than\nthe AV18/UIX result. Our best estimate for the S-factor at 10 keV is therefore\n(10.1 \\pm 0.6) 10^{-20} keV b, when the theoretical uncertainty due to the\nmodel dependence is included. This value for the calculated S-factor is not as\nlarge as determined in fits to the Super-Kamiokande data in which the hep flux\nnormalization is free. However, the precise calculation of the S-factor and the\nconsequent absolute prediction for the hep neutrino flux will allow much\ngreater discrimination among proposed solar neutrino oscillation solutions. \n\n"}
