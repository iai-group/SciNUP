For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA. \n\n"}

Based on large samples of\nnumerically simulated cluster-sized objects with virial masses ~ 1e15 solar,\nthe predicted Einstein radii are only 15-25'', a factor of two below the\nobserved Einstein radii of these four clusters. This is because the predicted\nmass profile is too shallow to exceed the critical surface density for lensing\nat a sizable projected radius.

Insisting on a background\nindependent renormalization group (RG) flow the coarse graining operation must\nbe defined in terms of an unspecified variable metric since no rigid metric of\na fixed background spacetime is available. This leads to an extra field\ndependence in the functional RG equation and a significantly different RG flow\nin comparison to the standard flow equation with a rigid metric in the mode\ncutoff. The background independent RG flow can possess a non-Gaussian fixed\npoint, for instance, even though the corresponding standard one does not. We\ndemonstrate the importance of this universal, essentially kinematical effect by\ncomputing the RG flow of Quantum Einstein Gravity in the ``conformally\nreduced'' Einstein--Hilbert approximation which discards all degrees of freedom\ncontained in the metric except the conformal one.

In earlier work, we presented an accurate\n(2+1)D finite-difference time-domain code to solve the Teukolsky equation,\nwhich evolves curvature perturbations near rotating (Kerr) black holes. The key\nnew ingredient there was a simple but accurate model of the singular source\nterm based on a discrete representation of the Dirac-delta function and its\nderivatives. Our earlier work was intended as a proof of concept, using simple\ncircular, equatorial geodesic orbits as a testbed. Such a source is effectively\nstatic, in that the smaller body remains at the same coordinate radius and\norbital inclination over an orbit.

After an introductory discussion\nof the Schwarzschild geometry and the black hole concept, the classical theorem\nof Kay and Wald on the boundedness of scalar waves on the exterior region of\nSchwarzschild is reviewed. The original proof is presented, followed by a new\nmore robust proof of a stronger boundedness statement. The problem of decay of\nscalar waves on Schwarzschild is then addressed, and a theorem proving\nquantitative decay is stated and its proof sketched. This decay statement is\ncarefully contrasted with the type of statements derived heuristically in the\nphysics literature for the asymptotic tails of individual spherical harmonics.\nFollowing this, our recent proof of the boundedness of solutions to the wave\nequation on axisymmetric stationary backgrounds (including slowly-rotating Kerr\nand Kerr-Newman) is reviewed and a new decay result for slowly-rotating Kerr\nspacetimes is stated and proved.

While\nthe oscillatory pieces of the gravitational-wave polarizations for\nquasicircular, inspiralling compact binaries have been computed to 3PN order,\nthe memory contribution to the polarizations has only been calculated to\nleading order (the next-to-leading order 0.5PN term has previously been shown\nto vanish).

For example, by assuming for it a solar (MX =M_Sun) or brown\ndwarf mass (MX = 80mJup), now at not less than dX = 11-6 kau (1 kau=1000\nastronomical units), v would be of the order of 6-10% and 3-5% of the speed of\nlight c, respectively.

Of course this\napproach can only be applied whenever there is a newtonian limit, and the\nlatter is related to the GR solution that is generalized by a given ST solution\nunder consideration.

However, an unsolved problem concerning such\nobjects is the presence of a space-time singularity in their core.

Because the result has an enormous\nimpact on science, it might be worth double-checking the time definitions with\nrespect to the non-inertial system in which the neutrino travel time was\nmeasured.

We\naim to investigate the synchronization of non-inertial clocks on Earth by\nrelating this time to the proper time of an inertial observer at Solar System\nBarycenter(SSB). The Tempo2 software was used to time-stamp events observed on\nthe geoid with respect to the SSB inertial observer time. Neutrino results from\nOPERA might carry the fingerprint of non-inertial effects. The CERN-Gran Sasso\nclock synchronization is accomplished by applying corrections that depend on\nspecial and general relativistic time dilation effects at the clocks, depending\non the position of the clocks in the solar system gravitational well.

In particular, it enables us to compute the\ncurvature perturbation, {\\zeta}, on large scales without actually solving\nperturbed field equations. However, people often wonder why this is the case.\nIn order for this approach to be valid, the perturbed Hamiltonian constraint\nand matter-field equations on large scales must, with a suitable choice of\ncoordinates, take on the same forms as the corresponding unperturbed equations.\nWe find that this is possible when (1) the unperturbed metric is given by a\nhomogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric; and (2)\non large scales and with a suitable choice of coordinates, one can ignore the\nshift vector (g0i) as well as time-dependence of tensor perturbations to\ngij/a2(t) of the perturbed metric.

The gravity dual that we employ is the ${\\rm\nAdS}_5$ Soliton background at zero temperature. We first analyze the normal\nmodes associated to the superconducting order parameter which are purely real\nsince the background has no horizon. We then study the full time evolution of\nthe order parameter after a quench. For sufficiently a weak and slow\nperturbation we show that the order parameter undergoes simple undamped\noscillations in time with a frequency that agrees with the lowest normal model\ncomputed previously. This is expected as the soliton background has no horizon\nand therefore, at least in the probe and large $N$ limits considered, the\nsystem will never return to equilibrium. For stronger and more abrupt\nperturbations higher normal modes are excited and the pattern of oscillations\nbecomes increasingly intricate. We identify a range of parameters for which the\ntime evolution of the order parameter become quasi chaotic. The details of the\nchaotic evolution depend on the type of perturbation used. Therefore it is\nplausible to expect that it is possible to engineer a perturbation that leads\nto the almost complete destruction of the oscillating pattern and consequently\nto quasi equilibration induced by superposition of modes with different\nfrequencies. \n\n"}

This feature of classical\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is traditionally interpreted as non-locality of quantum\nmechanics.

We here explore the yet unknown origin for this\nuniversality. First, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interior\nand of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find\nthat the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole\nmoment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the\ntotal radius, which corresponds to the density range\n$(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. Second, we study the impact on the universality\nof approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An\nanalytical calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the\nellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the\nself-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we investigate the\neccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that the\nellipticity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly (20-30)% in the\nregion that matters to the universal relations. Fourth, we repeat the above\nanalysis for non-compact, regular stars and find that the ellipticity is not\nconstant, with variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost.\nThese findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate\nsymmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from non-compact\nstar region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation inside\nstars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensity\ncontours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior\nmultipole moments. \n\n"}

The answer depends on the number of\ne-foldings $N_{in}$ between the beginning of inflation and horizon crossing of\nthe observable fluctuations.

One promising avenue is to modify general\nrelativity and obtain a new description of the gravitational force. Because\ngravitation dominates the other forces mostly on large scales, cosmological\nprobes provide an ideal testing ground for theories of gravity. In this thesis,\nwe describe two complementary approaches to the problem of testing gravity\nusing cosmology.\n  In the first part, we discuss the cosmological solutions of massive gravity\nand its generalisation to a bimetric theory. These theories describe a graviton\nwith a small mass, and can potentially explain the late-time acceleration in a\ntechnically-natural way. We describe these self-accelerating solutions and\ninvestigate the cosmological perturbations in depth, beginning with an\ninvestigation of their linear stability, followed by the construction of a\nmethod for solving these perturbations in the quasistatic limit. This allows\nthe predictions of stable bimetric models to be compared to observations of\nstructure formation.

Our classically derived axion pressure term in Einstein's\ngravity is identical to the one derived in the non-relativistic quantum\nmechanical context in the literature.

We\nterm these signals \"intermediate-duration\" because they are shorter than\ncontinuous wave signals but longer than signals traditionally considered as\ngravitational wave bursts, and are difficult to detect with most burst and\ncontinuous wave methods. The cross-correlation technique proposed by [S.\nDhurandhar et al., Phys. Rev.

Quantum systems scan all possible available states and switch randomly\nand very rapidly among them. The longer they remain in a given state, the\nlarger the probability of the system to be found in that state during a\nmeasurement. A crucial property that we postulate is quantum inertia, that\nincreases whenever a constituent is added, or the system is perturbed with all\nkinds of interactions. Once the quantum inertia $I_q$ reaches a critical value\n$I_{cr}$ for an observable, the switching among the different eigenvalues of\nthat observable stops and the corresponding superposition comes to an end.\nConsequently, increasing the mass, temperature, gravitational force, etc. of a\nquantum system increases its quantum inertia until the superposition of states\ndisappears for all the observables and the system transmutes into a classical\none. The process could be reversible: decreasing the size, temperature,\ngravitational force, etc. of a classical system one could revert the situation.\nEntanglement can only occur between quantum systems, not between a quantum\nsystem and a classical one, because an exact synchronization between the\nswitchings of the systems involved must be established in the first place and\nclassical systems do not have any switchings to start with. Future experiments\nmight determine the critical inertia $I_{cr}$ corresponding to different\nobservables. In addition, our proposal implies a new radiation mechanism in\nstrong gravitational fields, giving rise to non-thermal synchrotron emission,\nthat could contribute to neutron star formation.

In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system.

Using dynamical system techniques\nalong with numerical analysis, we find two classes of solutions: the first one\nis always unstable of the saddle type while the second is always stable so that\nits dynamical behavior corresponds to a center equilibrium point. The\nimportance of the second class of solutions is due to the significant duty they\nhave in constructing non-singular emergent models in which the universe could\nhave experienced past-eternally, a series of infinite oscillations about such\nan initial static state after which, it enters through a suitable physical\nmechanism, to an inflationary era.

We show that this tacit assertion is not correct.

The spin memory effect had not been computed\nexplicitly for astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, such as compact\nbinaries. In this paper, we compute the spin memory in terms of a set of\nradiative multipole moments of the gravitational-wave strain.

Invariant set theory is built on geometric properties of a compact\nfractal-like subset $I_U$ of cosmological state space on which the universe is\nassumed to evolve and from which the laws of physics are assumed to derive.\nConsistent with the primacy of $I_U$, a non-Euclidean (and hence non-classical)\nstate-space metric $g_p$ is defined, related to the $p$-adic metric of number\ntheory where $p$ is a large but finite Pythagorean prime. Uncertain states on\n$I_U$ are described using complex Hilbert states, but only if their squared\namplitudes are rational and corresponding complex phase angles are rational\nmultiples of $2 \\pi$. Such Hilbert states are necessarily $g_p$-distant from\nstates with either irrational squared amplitudes or irrational phase angles.\nThe gappy fractal nature of $I_U$ accounts for quantum complementarity and is\ncharacterised numerically by a generic number-theoretic incommensurateness\nbetween rational angles and rational cosines of angles. The Bell inequality,\nwhose violation would be inconsistent with local realism, is shown to be\n$g_p$-distant from all forms of the inequality that are violated in any\nfinite-precision experiment.

By contrast,\nan extension of the Einstein field equations on $I_U$ is proposed which reduces\nsmoothly to general relativity as $p \\rightarrow \\infty$.

More is required to access the most remote corners of\nthe universe. Third-generation gravitational-wave detectors have been proposed,\nwhich could observe most of the binary black holes merging anywhere in the\nuniverse. In this paper we check if and to which extent it makes sense to keep\nprevious-generation detectors up and running once a significantly more\nsensitive detector is online. First, we focus on a population of binary black\nholes with redshifts distributed uniformly in comoving volume. We show that\nmeasurement of extrinsic parameters, such as sky position, inclination and\nluminosity distance can significantly benefit from the presence of a less\nsensitive detector. Conversely, intrinsic parameters such as\n\\emph{detector-frame} masses and spins are largely unaffected. Measurement of\nthe \\emph{source-frame masses} is instead improved, owing to the improvement of\nthe distance measurement. Then, we focus on nearby events. We simulated sources\nsimilar to GW150914 and GW151226 and check how well their parameters can be\nmeasured by various networks. Here too we find that the main difference is a\nbetter estimation of the sky position, although even a single triangular-shaped\nthird-generation detector can estimate their sky position to 1~deg$^2$ or\nbetter. \n\n"}

Therefore, is it really too early\nto seek actively for new tests and approaches to these problems?

Some previous numerical studies\nindicate that the bar is short lived, lasting for only a few bar-rotation\nperiods, while other studies suggest that the bar is relatively long lived.\nThis paper contains the results of a numerical simulation of a rapidly rotating\ngamma=5/3 fluid star. The simulation shows that the bar shape is long lived:\nonce the bar is established, the star retains this shape for more than 10\nbar-rotation periods, through the end of the simulation. The results are\nconsistent with the conjecture that a star will retain its bar shape\nindefinitely on a dynamical time scale, as long as its rotation rate exceeds\nthe threshold for secular bar instability. The results are described in terms\nof a low density neutron star, but can be scaled to represent, for example, a\nburned-out stellar core that is prevented from complete collapse by centrifugal\nforces.

In order to have a well defined evolution, and a consistent quantum\ntheory, evolving constants must be self-adjoint operators. We show that this\ncondition imposes strong restrictions to the choices of the clock variables. We\nanalize four cases. The first one is non- relativistic quantum mechanics in\nparametrized form. We show that, for the free particle case, the standard\nchoice of time is the only one leading to self-adjoint evolving constants.\nSecondly, we study the relativistic case. We show that the resulting quantum\ntheory is the free particle representation of the Klein Gordon equation in\nwhich the position is a perfectly well defined quantum observable. The\nadmissible choices of clock variables are the ones leading to space-like\nsimultaneity surfaces.

In this\nperspective, the DF model is simply the limiting case when this factor is unity\nfor all frequencies. In the second part, we introduce an alternative model\nwhich is based on self-interactions described by an action principle. When the\ncoupling is constant, this model can be solved exactly and gives rise to a\npartially reflecting mirror. The usefulness of this dynamical model lies in the\npossibility of switching off the coupling between the mirror and the field.\nThis allows to obtain regularized expressions for the fluxes in situations\nwhere they are singular when using the DF model.

First, the expression of the\nactive mass in Schwarzschild's solution is given for a barotropic perfect\nfluid, both for general relativity (GR) and for an alternative, scalar theory.\nThe principle of the asymptotic method is then recalled and the PN expansion of\nthe active mass is derived.

The mass and charge of the black hole are generated self-consistently by\nthe accreted material. The accreted baryonic fluid undergoes one of two\npossible fates: either it plunges directly to the spacelike singularity at zero\nradius, or else it drops through the Cauchy horizon. The baryons fall directly\nto the singularity if the conductivity either exceeds a certain continuum\nthreshold kappa_oo, or else equals one of an infinite spectrum kappa_n of\ndiscrete values. Between the discrete values kappa_n, the solution is\ncharacterized by the number of times that the baryonic fluid cycles between\ningoing and outgoing. If the conductivity is at the continuum threshold\nkappa_oo, then the solution cycles repeatedly between ingoing and outgoing,\ndisplaying a discrete self-similarity reminiscent of that observed in critical\ncollapse. Below the continuum threshold kappa_oo, and except at the discrete\nvalues kappa_n, the baryonic fluid drops through the Cauchy horizon, and in\nthis case undergoes a shock, downstream of which the solution terminates at an\nirregular sonic point where the proper acceleration diverges, and there is no\nconsistent self-similar continuation to zero radius.

The spins of a binary's black holes have an important impact on its\nwaveform. Specifically, geodetic and gravitomagnetic effects cause the spins to\nprecess; this precession then modulates the waveform, adding periodic structure\nwhich encodes useful information about the binary's members. Following\npioneering work by Vecchio, we examine the impact upon GW measurements of\nincluding these precession-induced modulations in the waveform model. We find\nthat the additional periodicity due to spin precession breaks degeneracies\namong certain parameters, greatly improving the accuracy with which they may be\nmeasured. In particular, mass measurements are improved tremendously, by one to\nseveral orders of magnitude. Localization of the source on the sky is also\nimproved, though not as much -- low redshift systems can be localized to an\nellipse which is roughly ${a few} \\times 10$ arcminutes in the long direction\nand a factor of 2-4 smaller in the short direction.

In this paper instead of using\n3D quantities and their ``apparent'' transformations we deal with 4D geometric\nquantities their Lorentz transformations and equations with them. We introduce\na new decomposition of the torque N (bivector) into 1-vectors N_{s} and N_{t}.\nIt is shown that in the frame of ``fiducial'' observers, in which the observers\nwho measure N_{s} and N_{t} are at rest, and in the standard basis, only the\nspatial components N_{s}^{i} and N_{t}^{i} remain, which can be associated with\ncomponents of two 3D torques. In such treatment with 4D geometric quantities\nthe mentioned paradox does not appear. The presented explanation is in a\ncomplete agreement with the principle of relativity and with the Trouton-Noble\nexperiment without the introduction of any additional torque. \n\n"}

Similarly with respect to non-locality, we discuss delayed\nand predictive dynamics which involve two points separated on the time axis.\nWith certain combinations of fluctuations and non-locality in time, we observe\na ``resonance'' effect. This is an effect similar to stochastic resonance,\nwhich has been discussed within the normal context of stochastic dynamics, but\nwith different mechanisms.

{"id": "physics/9703020", "contents": "Title: Lorentz Invariance and Superluminal Particles Abstract: If textbook Lorentz invariance is actually a property of the equations\ndescribing a sector of matter above some critical distance scale, several\nsectors of matter with different critical speeds in vacuum can coexist and an\nabsolute rest frame (the vacuum rest frame, possibly related to the local rest\nframe of the expanding Universe) may exist without contradicting the apparent\nLorentz invariance felt by \"ordinary\" particles (particles with critical speed\nin vacuum equal to $c$ , the speed of light). Sectorial Lorentz invariance,\nreflected by the fact that all particles of a given dynamical sector have the\nsame critical speed in vacuum, will then be an expression of a fundamental\nsectorial symmetry (e.g. preonic grand unification or extended supersymmetry)\nprotecting a parameter of the equations of motion. We study the breaking of\nLorentz invariance in such a scenario, with emphasis on mixing between the\n\"ordinary\" sector and a superluminal sector, and discuss with examples the\nconsequences of existing data. The sectorial universality of the value of the\nhigh-energy speed in vacuum, even exact, does not necessarily imply that\nLorentz invariance is not violated and does not by itself exclude the\npossibility to produce superluminal particles at accelerators or to find them\nin experiments devoted to high-energy cosmic rays. Similarly, the stringent\nexperimental bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation at low energy cannot be\nextrapolated to high-energy phenomena. Several basic questions related to\npossible effects of Lorentz symmetry violation are discussed, and potential\nsignatures are examined. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/9911022", "contents": "Title: Is the Lorentz Transformation Distance-Dependent? Abstract: An analysis of the Lorentz transformation shows that the unchangeability of\nthe space-time coordinates of the inertial systems under consideration and the\npossibility of a direct projection of those coordinates onto another are the\nunderlying assumptions as to its unlimited validity. It is demonstrated that\nfrom a empiric-physical point of view these assumptions are not given in the\ncase of inertial systems separated by very large distances. Analogous to the\nimpossibility to measure motion relative to absolute space, it turns out to be\nphysically non feasible to extend the coordinate system of any reference frame\nconsidered at rest relative to a distantly moving system for a direct\ncomparision of the coordinates, and vice versa. The extended Lorentz\ntransformation strictly based on first physical principles predicts the\npossibility of superluminal propagation of very distant material bodies and, in\nthis case, the generation of Cerenkov radiation out of the quantum vacuum. For\nmany astrophysical phenomena and their experimentally verified properties this\nyields a novel view. \n\n"}
