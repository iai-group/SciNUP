The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust.

Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the\nnear-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to\nstudy the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for\nasymmetries. Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,\ntaking advantage of the \"cube\" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a\nlarge number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a \"lucky\nimaging\" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images\nover the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters. Results: In\nall filters, the photosphere of Betelgeuse appears partly resolved.

We\ninvestigate the 5-35 um Spitzer IRS spectra of a sample of 13 group I sources\nand 20 group II sources. We focus on the continuum emission to study the\nunderlying disk geometry. We have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7]\ncontinuum flux ratios. The 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellar\nphotosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-IR emission\nproduced by the inner disk. We have compared our data to self-consistent\npassive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We\nconfirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between\ngroup I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small\ndust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and\n[13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources. Moreover, the [30/13.5] flux\nratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample. To\nexplain these correlations with the models, we need to introduce an artificial\nscaling factor for the inner disk height. In roughly 50% of the Herbig Ae/Be\nstars in our sample, the inner disk must be inflated by a factor 2 to 3 beyond\nwhat hydrostatic calculations predict. The total disk mass in small dust grains\ndetermines the degree of flaring. We conclude, however, that for any given disk\nmass in small dust grains, the shadowing of the outer (tens of AU) disk is\ndetermined by the scale height of the inner disk (1 AU).

We used VLT/UVES and VLT/FLAMES to obtain\nhigh-resolution spectra on six epochs in 2003/04 (UVES) and ten epochs in\n2008/09 (FLAMES). These spectra are used alongside other VLT/FLAMES and\nNTT/EMMI spectra to follow the evolution of W243 from 2002 to 2009. W243\ndisplays a complex, time-varying spectrum with emission lines of Hydrogen,\nHelium and Lyman-pumped metals, forbidden lines of Nitrogen and Iron, and a\nlarge number of absorption lines from neutral and singly-ionized metals. Many\nlines are complex emission/absorption blends. The LBV has a current temperature\nof ~8500K (spectral type A3Ia+), and displays signs of photospheric pulsations\nand weak episodic mass loss. Nitrogen is highly overabundant, with Carbon and\nOxygen depleted, indicative of surface CNO-processed material and considerable\nprevious mass-loss, although current time-averaged mass-loss rates are low. The\nemission-line spectrum forms at large radii, when material lost by the LBV in a\nprevious mass-loss event is ionized by an unseen hot companion.

The sample shows a highly dispersed distribution in the Halpha\nto FUV flux ratio indicating that two of the most commonly used star formation\ntracers give star formation rates with uncertainties up to a factor of 2-3. The\nhigh dispersion is due to the presence of AGN, where the UV and the Halpha\nemission can be contaminated by nuclear activity, highly inclined galaxies, for\nwhich the applied extinction corrections are probably inaccurate, or starburst\ngalaxies, where the stationarity in the star formation history required for\ntransforming Halpha and UV luminosities into star formation rates is not\nsatisfied. Excluding these objects we reach an uncertainty of ~50% on the SFR.\nThe Halpha to FUV flux ratio increases with their total stellar mass.

In the absence of dust grains, at redshifts z < 10\nmoderate characteristic masses (of 10s of Msun) are formed when the metallicity\nis 10^{-4} Zsun < Z < 10^{-2.5} Zsun; at higher metallicities, the CMB inhibits\nfragmentation and only very large masses (of ~ 100s of Msun) are formed.

We examine the properties of these\nBH-BH binaries through direct N-body simulations of star clusters using the\nGPU-enabled NBODY6 code. We perform simulations of N <= 10^5 Plummer clusters\nof low-mass stars with an initial population of BHs.

While most BH binaries are\nejected from the cluster by recoils received during super-elastic encounters\nwith the single BHs, few of them harden sufficiently so that they can merge via\nGW emission within the cluster.

The formation and\noutward expansion of the accretion shock is accompanied with a sudden and rapid\npower-law decline in the central accretion rate Mdot ~ t^{-2.8}, which\nresembles the L_X ~ t^{-3} decline observed in the X-ray light curves. The\ncollapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-mass\nequatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere.

The new detections\nindicate (1) that the galactic z-distribution of RRATs in the surveys closely\nresembles the distribution of pulsars, with objects up to 0.86 kpc from the\ngalactic plane; (2) where measurable, the RRAT pulse widths are similar to that\nof individual pulses from pulsars of similar period, implying a similar beaming\nfraction; and (3) our new detections span a variety of nulling fractions, and\nthus we postulate that the RRATs may simply be nulling pulsars that are only\n\"on\" for less than a pulse period.

Adopting the new abundances leads to models with sound speed\ndiscrepancies of up to 1.4$%$ below the base of the convection zone (compared\nto discrepancies of less than 0.4$%$ with the old abundances), a convection\nzone that is too shallow, and a convection zone helium abundance that is too\nlow. Here we review briefly recent attempts to restore agreement, and we\nevaluate three changes to the models: early mass loss, accretion of low-Z\nmaterial, and convective overshoot. One goal of these attempts is to explore\nmodels that could preserve the structure in the interior obtained with the old\nabundances while accommodating the new abundances at the surface. Although the\nmass-losing and accretion models show some improvement in agreement with\nseismic constraints, a satisfactory resolution to the solar abundance problem\nremains to be found. In addition, we perform a preliminary analysis of models\nwith the Caffau et al.

Abstract: In planetary nebulae, abundances of oxygen and other heavy elements derived\nfrom optical recombination lines are systematically higher than those derived\nfrom collisionally excited lines. We investigate the hypothesis that the\ndestruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas\nthat could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly\nexceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected\nto be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars. We therefore\nconclude that contemporaneous solid body destruction cannot explain the\nobserved abundance discrepancies in planetary nebulae. However, similar\narguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion.\nIn this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one\nten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris\ndisks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may\ncontribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some planetary nebulae, so\nlong as mixing of the high metallicity gas is inefficient. \n\n"}

We show that the power and spectral\nindices at the outer scale of turbulence are approximately isotropic. The\nturbulent cascade causes the power anisotropy at smaller scales manifested by\nanisotropic scalings of the spectrum: close to k^{-5/3} across and k^{-2} along\nthe local magnetic field, consistent with a critically balanced Alfvenic\nturbulence. By using data at different radial distances from the Sun, we show\nthat the width of the inertial range does not change with heliocentric distance\nand explain this by calculating the radial dependence of the ratio of the outer\nscale to the ion gyroscale.

Here we present results of star formation simulations that accurately\ntrack the evolution of a protostellar fragment over eleven orders of magnitude\nin density (from 300 cm^-3 to \\approx 10^14 cm^-3), i.e., from the early\nambipolar-diffusion--initiated fragmentation phase, through the magnetically\nsupercritical, dynamical-contraction phase and the subsequent magnetic\ndecoupling stage, to the formation of a protostellar core in near hydrostatic\nequilibrium. As found by Fiedler & Mouschovias (1993), gravitationally-driven\nambipolar diffusion leads to the formation and subsequent dynamic contraction\nof a magnetically supercritical core. Moreover, we find that ambipolar\ndiffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, is responsible for decoupling all the species\nexcept the electrons from the magnetic field, by a density \\approx 3 x 10^12\ncm^-3. Magnetic decoupling precedes the formation of a central stellar object\nand ultimately gives rise to a concentration of magnetic flux (a `magnetic\nwall') outside the hydrostatic core --- as also found by Tassis & Mouschovias\n(2005a,b) through a different approach. At approximately the same density at\nwhich Ohmic dissipation becomes more important than ambipolar diffusion\n(\\gtrsim 7 x 10^12 cm^-3), the grains carry most of the electric charge as well\nas the electric current.

We transform these into median and extreme masses of stars\non the HB taking into account evolutionary effects, and compare these masses\nwith those expected at the tip of the Red Giant Branch to derive the total mass\nlost by the stars. A simple linear dependence on metallicity of this total mass\nlost explains well the median colours of HB stars. Adopting this mass loss law\nas universal, we find that age is the main second parameter. However, at least\na third parameter is clearly required. The most likely candidate is the He\nabundance, which might be different in GCs stars belonging to the different\nstellar generations whose presence was previously derived from the Na-O and\nMg-Al anticorrelations. Variations in the median He abundance allow explaining\nthe extremely blue HB of some GCs; such variations are correlated with the\nR-parameter. Suitable He abundances allow deriving ages from the HB which are\nconsistent with those obtained from the Main Sequence. Small corrections to\nthese latter ages are then proposed, producing a tight age-metallicity relation\nfor disk and bulge GCs. Star-to-star variations in the He content explain the\nextension of the HB. There is a strong correlation between this extension and\nthe interquartile of the Na-O anticorrelation. The main driver for the\nvariations in the He-content within GCs seems the total cluster mass. 47 Tuc\nand M3 exhibit exceptional behaviours; however, they can be accommodated in a\nscenario for the formation of GCs that relates their origin to cooling flows\ngenerated after very large episodes of star formation. \n\n"}

Computational Method Abstract: The asymptotic response of donor stars in interacting binary systems to very\nrapid mass loss is characterized by adiabatic expansion throughout their\ninteriors.

In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks.

We find three\nnew binaries in the ONC, two in OB1b, and three non-members in OB1b (two of\nthem most likely being OB1a/25 Ori members). Veiling only affects one target in\nthe ONC, and the effective temperatures derived using two spectroscopic\ntechniques agree within the errors. The ONC and OB1b are characterized by a\nsmall scatter in iron abundance, with mean [Fe/H] values of -0.11+/-0.08 and\n-0.05+/-0.05, respectively. We find a small scatter in all the other elemental\nabundances. We confirm that P1455 is a metal-rich star in the ONC. Conclusions.\nWe conclude that the Orion metallicity is not above the solar value. The OB1b\ngroup might be slightly more metal-rich than the ONC; on the other hand, the\ntwo subgroups have similar almost solar abundances of iron-peak and\nalpha-elements with a high degree of homogeneity. \n\n"}

Here I describe how recent observations and theoretical\nmodels of dynamo action in low-mass stars are partly confirming, and partly\nconfounding, this basic expectation.

The simulated stars can establish latitudinal differential\nrotation at their surfaces which is solar-like at ``rapid'' rotation rates\n(defined within) and anti-solar at slower rotation rates; the differential\nrotation is greatly reduced by feedback from strong dynamo-generated magnetic\nfields in some parameter regimes.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars). Finally, mass ejections induced repeatedly at\nperiastron cause orbital evolution; this may explain the origin of very\neccentric colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries such as WR140. \n\n"}

The\nsystem revolves in an eccentric orbit with a periodicity of 140.7 days. The\nsecondary has a similar temperature but is less evolved and fainter than the\nprimary. It is also rotating more rapidly. Since the composite spectra are\nheavily blended, the direct extraction of radial velocities over the orbit of\ncomponent B was hitherto unsuccessful. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data\nrecently obtained with the Elodie (OHP, France) and Hermes (ORM, La Palma,\nSpain) spectrographs, and applying a spectra disentangling algorithm to three\nindependent data sets including spectra from the Oak Ridge Observatory (USA),\nwe derived an improved spectroscopic orbit and refined the solution by\nperforming a combined astrometric-spectroscopic analysis based on the new\nspectroscopy and the long-baseline data from the Mark III optical\ninterferometer. As a result, the velocity amplitude of the fainter component is\nobtained in a direct and objective way. Major progress based on this new\ndetermination includes an improved computation of the orbital parallax.

Our modeling\nindicates that (1) ASAS-09 is a main sequence active system with nearly-twin\ncomponents with masses of M1 = 0.771(33) Msun, M2 = 0.768(21) Msun and radii of\nR1 = 0.772(12) Rsun and R2 = 0.769(13) Rsun.

Our goal was to detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during\neclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of\nplanet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on. This implies the WASP-1 star has a high obliquity with\nrespect to the edge-on planetary orbit. Because WASP-2 is a K1V star, and is\nexpected to be a slow rotator, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the\nstellar obliquity.

The\ndifferential rotation and meridional circulation are intimately linked, with a\ncommon origin in the turbulent stresses of the upper solar convection zone. The\nexistence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of\nangular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed. Rather, the\nturbulent angular momentum transport accounts for the poleward meridional flow\nwhile the often overlooked meridional force balance maintains the mid-latitude\nrotational shear. We suggest that the base of the NSSL is marked by a\ntransition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses in the meridional plane which\nsuppress Coriolis-induced circulations that would otherwise establish a\ncylindrical rotation profile. The turbulent angular momentum transport must be\nnon-diffusive and directed radially inward. Inferred mean flows are consistent\nwith the idea that turbulent convection tends to mix angular momentum but only\nif the mixing efficiency is inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic. The latitudinal\nand longitudinal components of the estimated turbulent transport are comparable\nin amplitude and about an order of magnitude larger than the vertical\ncomponent.

Here I provide such a calculation. The\ntypical stellar mass is set by the characteristic fragment mass in a\nstar-forming cloud, which depends on the cloud's density and temperature\nstructure. Except in the very early universe, the latter is determined mainly\nby the radiation released as matter falls onto seed protostars. The energy\nyield from this process is ultimately set by the properties of deuterium\nburning in protostellar cores, which determines the stars' radii. I show that\nit is possible to combine these considerations to compute a characteristic\nstellar mass almost entirely in terms of fundamental constants, with an\nextremely weak residual dependence on the interstellar pressure and\nmetallicity. This result not only explains the invariance of stellar masses, it\nresolves a second mystery: why fragmentation of a cold, low-density\ninterstellar cloud, a process with no obvious dependence on the properties of\nnuclear reactions, happens to select a stellar mass scale such that stellar\ncores can ignite hydrogen.

{"id": "1111.2337", "contents": "Title: Spiral flows in cool-core galaxy clusters Abstract: We argue that bulk spiral flows are ubiquitous in the cool cores (CCs) of\nclusters and groups of galaxies. Such flows are gauged by spiral features in\nthe thermal and chemical properties of the intracluster medium, by the\nmulti-phase properties of CCs, and by X-ray edges known as cold fronts. We\nanalytically show that observations of piecewise-spiral fronts impose strong\nconstraints on the CC, implying the presence of a cold, fast flow, which\npropagates below a hot, slow inflow, separated by a slowly rotating, trailing,\nquasi spiral, tangential discontinuity surface. This leads to the nearly\nlogarithmic spiral pattern, two-phase plasma, \\rho \\sim r^{-1} density (or T\n\\sim r^{0.4} temperature) radial profile, and ~100kpc size, characteristic of\nCCs. By advecting heat and mixing the gas, such flows can eliminate the cooling\nproblem, provided that a feedback mechanism regulates the flow.

When considering these\nalternative pictures it is important to recognize that the age spread in a\ngiven star-forming cloud is necessarily an upper limit to the timescales of\nlocal collapse, as not all spatially-distinct regions will start contracting at\nprecisely the same instant. Moreover, star-forming clouds may dynamically\nevolve on timescales of a few Myr; in particular, global gravitational\ncontraction will tend to yield increasing star formation rates with time due to\ngenerally increasing local gas densities.

Whilst it has been established that GRBs are related to the death\nthroes of massive stars, the identification of their progenitors has proved\nchallenging. Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\nloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we\ntake recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the\nsix line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae. The statistics imply\nthat the null hypothesis of no correlation between line-effect WR stars and\nejecta nebulae can be rejected at the 0.0004% level. Given that four\nline-effect and WR ejecta nebula have spectroscopically been confirmed to\ncontain nucleosynthetic products, we argue that the correlation is both\nstatistically significant and physically convincing. The implication is that we\nhave identified a WR sub-population that fulfills the necessary criteria for\nmaking GRBs.

The mass-loss rates have values in the\nrange from 10e-11 to 10e-7 M_sun/yr and scale linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nwith only a weak dependence on the other parameters explored. However, in the\ncase of high FUV to X-ray (L_FUV/L_X>100) luminosity ratios, the FUV constricts\nthe X-ray flow and may dominate the mass-loss.\n  Simulations of low mass discs with inner holes demonstrate a further stage of\ndisc clearing, which we call `thermal sweeping'.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

The\npresence of a period was detected using the Scargle Lomb Normalized Periodogram\ntechnique and the autocorrelation analysis. The assessment of the results has\nbeen performed through a consistency verification supported by the folded light\ncurve analysis. The data analysis procedure has discarded a non-negligible\nfraction of light curves due to instrumental artifacts, however it has allowed\nus to identify pulsators and binaries among a large number of field stars. We\nmeasure a wide range of periods, from 0.25 to 100 days, most of which are\nrotation periods. The final catalogue includes 1978 periods, with 1727 of them\nidentified as rotational periods, 169 are classified as pulsations and 82 as\norbital periods of binary systems. Our sample suffers from selection biases not\neasily corrected for, thus we do not use the distribution of rotation periods\nto derive the age distribution of the main-sequence population.

PLAN-IT:\n  An Observing Program and its Application to VB 10 Abstract: The successful prediction of lensing events is a new and exciting enterprise\nthat provides opportunities to discover and study planetary systems.

This paper is devoted to\noutlining the components of observing programs that can discover planets\norbiting stars predicted to make a close approach to a background star. If the\ntime and distance of closest approach can be well predicted, then the system\ncan be targeted for individual study. In most cases, however, the predictions\nwill be imprecise, yielding only a set of probable paths of approach and event\ntimes. We must monitor an ensemble of such systems to ensure discovery, a\nstrategy possible with observing programs similar to a number of current\nsurveys, including PTF and Pan-STARRS; nova searches, including those conducted\nby amateurs; ongoing lensing programs such as MOA and OGLE; as well as MEarth,\nKepler and other transit studies. If well designed, the monitoring programs\nwill be guaranteed to either discover planets in orbits with semi-major axes\nsmaller than about two Einstein radii, or else to rule out their presence.\nPlanets on wider orbits may not all be discovered, but if they are common, will\nbe found among the events generated by ensembles of potential lenses.

Standard theories suggest that\ncollisions are rare, occurring only via random encounters between stars in\ndense clusters. We present a different formation pathway, the triple evolution\ndynamical instability (TEDI), in which mass loss in an evolving triple star\nsystem causes orbital instability. The subsequent chaotic orbital evolution of\nthe stars triggers close encounters, collisions, exchanges between the stellar\ncomponents, and the dynamical formation of eccentric compact binaries\n(including Sirius like binaries). We demonstrate that the rate of stellar\ncollisions due to the TEDI is approximately 10^{-4} yr^{-1} per Milky-Way\nGalaxy, which is nearly 30 times higher than the total collision rate due to\nrandom encounters in the Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, we find that the\ndominant type of stellar collisions is qualitatively different; most collisions\ninvolve asymptotic giant branch stars, rather than main sequence, or slightly\nevolved stars, which dominate collisions in globular clusters.

In wide binaries, the\ncompanion star captures some of the mass ejected in a wind by the primary star.\nThe captured material forms an accretion disk. Here, we study the evolution of\nwind-accretion disks, using a numerical approach which allows us to follow the\nlong term evolution. For a broad range of initial conditions, we derive the\nradial density and temperature profiles of the disk. In most cases,\nwind-accretion leads to long-lived stable disks over the lifetime of the AGB\ndonor star. The disks have masses of a few times 10^{-5}-10^{-3} M_sun, with\nsurface density and temperature profiles that follow broken power-laws. The\ntotal mass in the disk scales approximately linearly with the viscosity\nparameter used. Roughly 50% to 80% of the mass falling into the disk accretes\nonto the central star; the rest flows out through the outer edge of the disk\ninto the stellar wind of the primary.

Our study is relevant to astrobiology as it addresses whether life\non Earth could have been transferred to other planetary systems in the solar\nsystem's birth cluster and whether life on Earth could have been transferred\nhere from beyond the solar system. In the solar system, the timescale over\nwhich solid material was delivered to the region from where it could be\ntransferred via this mechanism likely extended to several hundred million years\n(as indicated by the 3.8-4.0 Ga epoch of the Late Heavy Bombardment).

For the\nlarge majority of stars with masses 0.7 < M/M_sun < 0.9 and heavy-element mass\nfractions 0.001 < Z < 0.006, the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation\nA(Li) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z, where a0, a1, a2, and a3 are constants.\nExtrapolating this relation to Z = 0 leads to a Li abundance close to the\nprimordial value predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations\nand the WMAP baryon density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars\nwith [Fe/H] < -1.5. We suggest that metal-rich halo stars were formed with a Li\nabundance close to the primordial value, and that lithium in their atmospheres\nhas been depleted in time with an approximately linear dependence on stellar\nmass and Z.

Digital signal handling enables very many baselines to be\nsynthesized, while stars are tracked with electronic time delays, thus\nsynthesizing an optical interferometer in software. Simulated observations\nindicate limiting magnitudes around m(v)=8, reaching resolutions ~30\nmicroarcsec in the violet. The signal-to-noise ratio favors high-temperature\nsources and emission-line structures, and is independent of the optical\npassband, be it a single spectral line or the broad spectral continuum.\nIntensity interferometry provides the modulus (but not phase) of any spatial\nfrequency component of the source image; for this reason image reconstruction\nrequires phase retrieval techniques, feasible if sufficient coverage of the\ninterferometric (u,v)-plane is available. Experiments are in progress; test\ntelescopes have been erected, and trials in connecting large Cherenkov\ntelescopes have been carried out. This paper reviews this interferometric\nmethod in view of the new possibilities offered by arrays of air Cherenkov\ntelescopes, and outlines observational programs that should become realistic\nalready in the rather near future. \n\n"}

Our\ngoal is to correct the biases present in the theoretical predictions for the\nnear-IR photometry of low-mass PMS stars.

We consider a sample of ~300 PMS stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (age\n1 Myr) with measured luminosities, temperatures and photospheric JHKs\nphotometry. By analyzing the photospheric colors of our sample of stars, we\nfind that the synthetic JHKs photometry provided by theoretical spectral\ntemplates for late spectral types (>K6) are accurate at the level of ~0.2 mag,\nwhile colors are accurate at ~0.1 mag.

The widely accepted presence of\nclumping in hot star winds implies a significant reduction of observational\nmass-loss rate estimates from diagnostics that depend on the square of the\ndensity. Moreover, the ultraviolet Pv resonance lines indicate a possible need\nfor even stronger reduction of hot star mass-loss rates, provided that Pv is a\ndominant ionization stage of phosphorus at least in some hot stars. The latter\nassumption is challenged by a possible presence of the XUV radiation.\n  Here we study the influence of the XUV radiation on the Pv ionization\nfraction in the hot star winds. By a detailed solution of the hydrodynamical,\nradiative transfer, and statistical equilibrium equations we confirm that\nsufficiently strong XUV radiation source may decrease the Pv ionization\nfraction, possibly depreciating the Pv lines as a reliable mass-loss rate\nindicator. On the other hand, the XUV radiation influences also the ionization\nfraction of heavier ions that drive the wind, leading to a decrease of the wind\nterminal velocity. Consequently, we conclude that the XUV radiation alone can\nnot bring theory and observations in accord.\n  We fit our predicted wind mass-loss rates by a suitable formula and compare\nthe results with the observational mass-loss rate diagnostics. We show that for\nsupergiants and giants the theoretical predictions do not contradict the\nmass-loss rate estimates based on X-ray line profiles or density squared\ndiagnostics. On the other hand, for main-sequence stars the predicted mass-loss\nrates are still significantly higher than that inferred from Pv or X-ray lines.\nThis indicates that the \"weak wind problem\" recently detected in low-luminosity\nmain-sequence stars may occur to some extent also for the stars with higher\nluminosity. \n\n"}

The structure and radiation spectrum of the\nemerging so-called hot spot have been calculated in the LTE approximation. The\nemission not only in continuum but also in lines has been taken into account\nfor the first time when calculating the spot spectrum. Comparison with\nobservations has shown that the strongest of these lines manifest themselves as\nnarrow components of helium and metal emission lines, while the weaker ones\ndecrease significantly the depth of photospheric absorption lines, although\nuntil now, this effect has been thought to be due to the emission continuum\nalone. The veiling by lines changes the depth of different photospheric lines\nto a very different degree even within a narrow spectral range. Therefore, the\nnonmonotonic wavelength dependence of the degree of veiling r found for some\nCTTS does not suggest a nontrivial spectral energy distribution of the veiling\ncontinuum. In general, it makes sense to specify the degree of veiling r only\nby providing the set of photospheric lines from which this quantity was\ndetermined.

The metallicity of the gas can help distinguish\nbetween these models, and here we report on results that use 138 ks of archival\nChandra data and 92 ks of new XMM-Newton data to measure the temperature and\nmetallicity of the hot halo of the galaxy.

The resulting ejecta are\nchemically stratified, have the same mass and roughly the same asymptotic\nkinetic energy, but exhibit a range in 56Ni mass. We investigate the\ncontemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic properties of a sequence of\ndelayed-detonation models, characterized by 56Ni masses between 0.18 and 0.81\nMsun. Starting at 1d after explosion, we perform the full non-LTE,\ntime-dependent radiative transfer with the code CMFGEN, with an accurate\ntreatment of line blanketing, and compare our results to SNe Ia at bolometric\nmaximum. Despite the 1D treatment, our approach delivers an excellent agreement\nto observations. We recover the range of SN Ia luminosities, colours, and\nspectral characteristics from the near-UV to 1 micron, for standard as well as\nlow-luminosity 91bg-like SNe Ia. Our models predict an increase in rise time to\npeak with increasing 56Ni mass, from ~15 to ~21d, yield peak bolometric\nluminosities that match Arnett's rule to within 10%, and reproduce the much\nsmaller scatter in near-IR magnitudes compared to the optical.

For this purpose we\nstudy the formation properties of spectral lines that belong to a number of\nastrophysically important tracer elements, including neutral and singly ionized\natoms, and molecules. We focus our investigation on a prototypical red giant\nlocated close to the red giant branch (RGB) tip (Teff=3660K, logg=1.0,\n[M/H]=0.0). We used two types of model atmospheres, 3D hydrodynamical and\nclassical 1D, calculated with the CO5BOLD and LHD stellar atmosphere codes,\nrespectively. Both codes share the same atmospheric parameters, chemical\ncomposition, equation of state, and opacities, which allowed us to make a\nstrictly differential comparison between the line formation properties\npredicted in 3D and 1D. The influence of convection on the spectral line\nformation was assessed with the aid of 3D-1D abundance corrections, which\nmeasure the difference between the abundances of chemical species derived with\nthe 3D hydrodynamical and 1D classical model atmospheres.

SNe Iax are spectroscopically\nsimilar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 < |v| < 8000\nkm/s), typically lower peak magnitudes (-14.2 > M_V,peak > -18.9 mag), and most\nhave hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for\ntheir light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and\nlight-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia\nand with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is\nhighly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in\nelliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars\nare white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra,\nlow ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray\ndetections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN\nsites.

The star colours are consistent with either\na main sequence (MS) star close to the turn-off or a lower red giant branch\n(RGB) star, at a pulsar distance of ~5.5 kpc and with a reddening of\nE(B-V)~4.9.

Thus,\nit is possible that it is the companion to PSR J1811-1736.

Of the 2483 stars examined, we detected\nrotation periods in 1570 (63.2%), representing an increase of a factor ~ 30 in\nthe number of rotation period determination for field M-dwarfs. The periods\nrange from 0.37-69.7 days, with amplitudes ranging from 1.0-140.8 mmags. The\nrotation period distribution is clearly bimodal, with peaks at ~ 19 and ~ 33\ndays, hinting at two distinct waves of star formation, a hypothesis that is\nsupported by the fact that slower rotators tend to have larger proper motions.\nThe two peaks of the rotation period distribution form two distinct sequences\nin period-temperature space, with the period decreasing with increasing\ntemperature, reminiscent of the Vaughan-Preston gap. The period-mass\ndistribution of our sample shows no evidence of a transition at the fully\nconvective boundary.

These WD mass distributions are then\ncompared with the observed Galactic WD mass distribution and Monte Carlo\nsimulations of WD-WD binary populations. For collisions, we find that the\naverage mass of the individual components of the WD-WD binary must be peaked at\n~0.75Msun, significantly higher than the average WD mass in binaries or in the\nfield of ~0.55-0.60Msun. Thus, if collisions produce a large fraction of SNe\nIa, then a mechanism must exist that favors large mass WDs. On the other hand,\nin an old stellar population, collisions would naturally result in a class of\nlow luminosity SNe Ia, and we suggest these may be related to 1991bg-like\nevents. For sub-Chandrasekhar detonations, we find that the average mass of the\nexploding WDs must be peaked at ~1.1Msun.

At lower\nmasses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority\nlow-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star\nformation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into\nthe relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At\nz=1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar\nmass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift\nevolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central\ngalaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M*~10^10 Msol, the fraction\nof central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of ten over our\nredshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that\nmass is constant with redshift. We define a \"migration rate\" to the red\nsequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that\nthe migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly\nan order of magnitude from z=1 to z=0. These results imply that the efficiency\nof quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while\nthe mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups\nand clusters is losing efficiency. \n\n"}

Mass Dependence of the Star Formation Rate Abstract: We discuss the dependence of various properties of the star formation rate\n(SFR) and efficiency (SFE) in molecular clouds (MCs) on the maximum mass\nreached by the clouds, based on a previously-published model for MC and SFR\nevolution in which the clouds were assumed to be undergoing global collapse,\nand the SFR was controlled by ioniztion feedback. Because the model neglects\nvarious other processes, the results presented are upper limits. We find that\nclouds with $\\Mmax \\lesssim 10^4 \\Msun$ end their lives with a mini-burst, at\nwhich the SFR reaches a peak of $\\sim 10^4 ~\\Msun \\Myr^{-1}$, although its time\naverage is only $\\SFRavg \\sim \\hbox{ a few} \\times 10^2 \\Msun \\Myr^{-1}$.

For more massive clouds ($\\Mmax \\gtrsim 10^5 ~ \\Msun$), the SFR first\nincreases and then remains roughly constant for $\\sim 10^7$ yr, because the\nclouds are influenced by the stellar feedback since earlier in their evolution.\nWe find that $\\SFRavg$ and $\\SFEavg$ are well represented by the fits $\\SFRavg\n\\approx 100 (1+\\Mmax/2 \\times 10^5 ~ \\Msun)^{2} ~ \\Msun \\Myr^{-1}$ and $\\SFEavg\n\\approx 0.024 (\\Mmax/10^5 ~ \\Msun)^{0.28}$, respectively.

We use 1-D non-LTE RATRAN radiative transfer models of\nthe observed water lines to constrain the infall velocity and chemistry in the\nprotostellar envelopes of these sources.

For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds.

The\nnon-detection of excited water in the inner envelope in 6/7 protostars is\nfurther evidence that water must be heavily depleted from the gas-phase at\nthese radii. Infall in four of the sources is supersonic and infall in all\nsources must take place at the outer edge of the envelope, which may be\nevidence that collapse is global or outside-in rather than inside-out.

We extend the computation of the I-Q relation\nto models rotating up to the mass-shedding limit and show that the universality\nof the relations is lost.

Wind\n  Solutions at the Inner Disk Abstract: The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by\nnon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the\nHall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind\nproperties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned\nand anti-aligned field geometries. Issues with the symmetry of the wind\nsolutions and grain abundance are also discussed. \n\n"}

Those with a more massive\ncomponent filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the\nRoche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes\nthat, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor),\nmass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of\nmass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show\nthat the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive\ncomponent (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the\nvalue determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge\nsticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical)\nmass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting\nfrom the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why\nwe observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to\npredictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the\nThermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass\nequalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with\nthis phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are\ncomparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27\nSD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both\ntypes of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer. Total\nmasses, orbital angular momenta and orbital periods of SD1 and SD2 binaries are\nindistinguishable from each other whereas they differ substantially from the\ncorresponding parameters of CBs.

Towards\n  asteroseismically calibrated age-rotation relations Abstract: Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations\nprovides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be\nstudied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have\nindependently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and\nactivity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity\nrelations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good\ncalibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars\nis uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric\nmagnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence and\nthe subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The\nrotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different\nanalysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the\ntime-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the light\ncurves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the\nresults from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two\ncomplementary analyses. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets\n(excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements\nspan a range of 1 to 100 days.

We prove that a\nparticular gauge always measures the winding with respect to a fixed frame, and\npropose that this is normally the best choice. For periodic fields, this choice\nis equivalent to measuring relative helicity with respect to a potential\nreference field.

Hydrodynamic simulations\nshow a transition from SL to AS rotation as the influence of rotation on\nconvection is reduced, but the opposite transition occurs at a different point\nin the parameter space. The system is bistable, i.e., SL and AS rotation\nprofiles can both be stable.

We solve the hydromagnetic equations\nnumerically in a rotating spherical shell for a set of different radiative\nconductivities controlling the relative importance of convection. In agreement\nwith earlier findings, our models display SL rotation profiles when the\nrotational influence on convection is strong and a transition to AS when the\nrotational influence decreases.

We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times\nfaster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized\nin a completely different region of space. These ideas lead -- for both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes -- to a natural connection between the\nglobal MRI and the local shearing box approximation. By illustrating that the\nfastest growing global structure is well described by the ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) governing a single shear wave, we find that the shearing box\nis a very sensible approximation for the linear MRI, contrary to many previous\nclaims.

If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge.

A large sample of red giant stars was observed with FORS2@VLT/ESO at\nR ~ 2,000. The method for derivation of stellar parameters is presented with\napplication to six reference clusters. We aim at deriving the stellar\nparameters effective temperature, gravity, metallicity and alpha-element\nenhancement, as well as radial velocity, for membership confirmation of\nindividual stars in each cluster. We analyse the spectra collected for the\nreference globular clusters NGC 6528, NGC 6553, M 71, NGC 6558, NGC 6426 and\nTerzan 8. They cover the full range of globular cluster metallicities, and are\nlocated in the bulge, disc and halo. Full spectrum fitting techniques are\napplied, by comparing each target spectrum with a stellar library in the\noptical region at 4560-5860 A. We employed the library of observed spectra\nMILES, and the synthetic library by Coelho et al. (2005). Validation of the\nmethod is achieved through recovery of the known atmospheric parameters for 49\nwell-studied stars that cover a wide range in the parameter space. We adopted\nas final stellar parameters (effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities)\nthe average of results using MILES and Coelho et al. libraries.

Using a magnetic-field power spectrum with Gaussian\nrandom fields, the NE2001 model for the thermal electrons and the Galactic\ncosmic-ray electron distribution from the current GALPROP model we derive\nfull-sky maps for the total and polarized synchrotron intensity as well as the\nFaraday rotation-measure distribution.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that\nthe transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's\norbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing\nthe outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold\ntransiting planets. \n\n"}

For validation purposes, we also provide\nanalytical approximations to the DR in the low-frequency limit and in the\nvicinity of $\\omega_{\\rm c}$, the critical angular frequency separating trapped\nfrom leaky waves. In contrast to the standing case, propagating sausage waves\nare allowed for $\\omega$ much lower than $\\omega_{\\rm c}$. However, while able\nto direct their energy upwards, these low-frequency waves are subject to\nsubstantial spatial attenuation.

In some cases the tight binary system can survive, in other it is\ndestroyed. The tight binary system might breakup with one star leaving the\nsystem. In an alternative evolution, one of the stars of the brook-up tight\nbinary system falls toward the AGB envelope with low specific angular momentum,\nand drowns in the envelope. In a different type of destruction process the drag\ninside the AGB envelope causes the tight binary system to merge. This releases\ngravitational energy within the AGB envelope, leading to a very asymmetrical\nenvelope ejection, with an irregular and `messy' planetary nebula as a\ndescendant. The evolution of the triple-stellar system can be in a full common\nenvelope evolution (CEE) or in a grazing envelope evolution (GEE).

This would explain observed exoplanets with significant inclination\nrespect to the equatorial plane of their host star. We have used two different\nSPH codes, vine and phantom, to model the evolution of a system\nstar+disk+planet and companion star with time. After an initial coupled\nevolution, the inclination of the disk and that of the planet begin to differ\nsignificantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, respect to\nthe initial plane, is shorter than that of the planet which evolves\nindependently after about 10^4 yr following a perturbed N-body behavior.\nHowever, the planet keeps migrating towards the star because during its orbital\nmotion it crosses the disk plane and the friction with the gas causes angular\nmomentum loss. Disk and planet in a significantly inclined binary system are\nnot dynamically coupled for small binary separations but evolve almost\nindependently. The planet abandons the disk and, due to the onset of a\nsignificant mutual inclination, it interacts with the gas only when its orbit\nintersects the disk plane. The drift of the planet towards the star is not due\nto type I/II with the planet embedded in the disk but to the friction with the\ngas during the disk crossing. \n\n"}

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves.

We propose new standard dust opacities for disk\nmodels, we present a simplified treatment of PAHs sufficient to reproduce the\nPAH emission features, and we suggest using a simple treatment of dust\nsettling. We roughly adjust parameters to obtain a model that predicts typical\nClass II T Tauri star continuum and line observations. We systematically study\nthe impact of each model parameter (disk mass, disk extension and shape, dust\nsettling, dust size and opacity, gas/dust ratio, etc.) on all continuum and\nline observables, in particular on the SED, mm-slope, continuum visibilities,\nand emission lines including [OI] 63um, high-J CO lines, (sub-)mm CO\nisotopologue lines, and CO fundamental ro-vibrational lines.

This effect has been found in all the investigated GCs. It affects\nmost (but not all) AGB stars and, in some cases, also some RGB stars. It is\nparticularly evident for iron and titanium lines (i.e., the elements providing\nthe largest number of both neutral and ionized lines). The deep understanding\nof the detected phenomenon is of paramount importance since it has a huge\nimpact on the proper determination of GC chemistry and enrichment history (for\ninstance, it can mimic spurious iron spreads). \n\n"}

We investigate the effects of turbulent\nmagnetic diffusivity and $\\alpha$ effect profiles as well as different\nlatitudinal boundary conditions to isolate parameter regimes where oscillatory\nsolutions are found. Finally, we add shear along with a damping term mimicking\nradial gradients to study the resulting dynamo regimes. We find that the\ncommonly used perfect conductor boundary condition leads to oscillatory\n$\\alpha^2$ dynamo solutions only if the wedge boundary is at least one degree\naway from the poles. Other boundary conditions always produce stationary\nsolutions. By varying the profile of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity alone,\noscillatory solutions are achieved with models extending to the poles, but the\nmagnetic field is strongly concentrated near the poles and the oscillation\nperiod is very long. By introducing radial shear and a damping term mimicking\nradial gradients, we again see oscillatory dynamos, and the direction of drift\nfollows the Parker--Yoshimura rule.

This new ROACH-based system enables\nbandwidths up to 500 MHz to be recorded, significantly more than what was\npossible with its predecessor, the Effelsberg-Berkeley Pulsar Processor (EBPP).\nWe review the first four years of PSRIX timing data for 33 pulsars collected as\npart of the monthly European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) observations. We\ndescribe the automated data analysis pipeline, CoastGuard, that we developed to\nreduce these observations. We also introduce TOASTER, the EPTA timing database\nused to store timing results, processing information and observation metadata.\nUsing these new tools, we measure the phase-averaged flux densities at 1.4 GHz\nof all 33 pulsars. For 7 of these pulsars, our flux density measurements are\nthe first values ever reported. For the other 26 pulsars, we compare our flux\ndensity measurements with previously published values. By comparing PSRIX data\nwith EBPP data, we find an improvement of ~2-5 times in signal-to-noise ratio\nachievable, which translates to an increase of ~2-5 times in pulse\ntime-of-arrival (TOA) precision. We show that such an improvement in TOA\nprecision will improve the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground. Finally, we showcase the flexibility of the new PSRIX backend by\nobserving several millisecond-period pulsars (MSPs) at 5 and 9 GHz. Motivated\nby our detections, we discuss the potential for complementing existing pulsar\ntiming array data sets with MSP monitoring campaigns at these frequencies. \n\n"}

By\nconsidering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that\nturbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter\nthe expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for\nthe mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter. This new model is expected to open up the possibility\nof the mean-field or turbulence closure dynamo approaches. \n\n"}

Mainly three particular profiles are considered: the Rayleigh limit,\nquasi-Keplerian, and solid-body rotation. In each case we begin by computing\nlinear instability curves and their dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number\nPm. For the azimuthal wavenumber m=1 modes, the instability curves always scale\nwith the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. For sufficiently small Pm\nthese modes therefore only become unstable for magnetic Mach numbers less than\nunity, and are thus not relevant for most astrophysical applications. However,\nmodes with m>10 can behave very differently.

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored.

In this process, rotational energy of the magnetar is radiated via\nmagnetic dipole radiation and heats the supernova ejecta. However, if magnetars\nare highly distorted in their geometric shape, rotational energy is mainly lost\nas gravitational wave radiation and thus such magnetars cannot power SLSNe.

This\npolarization signal should be considered in polarimetry microlensing of fast\nrotating stars. For moderate rotating stars, lensing can magnify or even\ncharacterize small polarization signals due to the stellar rotation through\npolarimetry observations. The gravity-darkening effect due to a rotating source\nstar makes asymmetric perturbations in polarimetry and photometry microlensing\ncurves whose maximum happens when the lens trajectory crosses the projected\nposition of the rotation pole on the sky plane. The stellar ellipticity makes a\ntime shift (i) in the position of the second peak of the polarimetry curves in\ntransit microlensing events and (ii) in the peak position of the polarimetry\ncurves with respect to the photometry peak position in bypass microlensing\nevents.

We study the\ninfluence of the turbulent expansion, chemical composition, and magnetic fields\non the stratification in the upper layers of the solar models in comparison\nwith solar observations.

We also\ndeveloped depth-dependent corrections for the solar 1D model, for which we\nexpanded the geometrical depth to match the pressure stratification of the\nsolar <3D> model, and we reduced the density that is caused by the turbulent\npressure.

Yet, the full star\nformation and enrichment history of a galaxy can be traced directly only if two\nkey observables can be determined for large stellar samples - age and chemical\ncomposition. While spectroscopy is a powerful method to analyse the detailed\nabundances of stars, stellar ages are the \"missing link in the chain\", since\nthey are not a direct observable. However, spectroscopy should be able to\nestimate stellar masses, which for red giants directly infer ages provided\ntheir chemical composition is known.\n  Here we establish a new empirical relation between the shape of the hydrogen\nline in the observed spectra of red giants and stellar mass determined from\nasteroseismology. The relation allows to determine stellar masses and ages with\nthe accuracy of 10-15%.

This hybrid model is constructed by allowing\nthe surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to\nprovide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a\nmeridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key\naspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing\nthe probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of\nthe internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to\ncalibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed\ncycle 21 emergence data.

The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the\nquenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed\nstatistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a\nsource of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations.

Using\nthree energy bins spanning $0.3 - 1$, $1 - 3$ and $3 - 10$ GeV, we identify\n$270\\substack{+30 \\\\ -10}$ point sources inside a $40^\\circ \\times 40^\\circ$\nregion around the NGP above our point-source inclusion limit of $3 \\times\n10^{-11}$/cm$^2$/s/sr/GeV at the $1-3$ GeV energy bin.

These uncertainties in the flux distribution are\nfully marginalized over the number as well as the spatial and spectral\nproperties of the unresolved point sources.

The active region emergence was detected in deep layers of\nthe convection zone about 12 hours before the first bipolar magnetic structure\nappeared on the surface, and 2 days before the emergence of most of the\nmagnetic flux. The speed of emergence determined by tracking the flow\ndivergence with depth is about 1.4 km/s, very close to the emergence speed in\nthe deep layers. As the emerging magnetic flux becomes concentrated in sunspots\nlocal converging flows are observed beneath the forming sunspots. These flows\nare most prominent in the depth range 1-3 Mm, and remain converging after the\nformation process is completed. On the larger scale converging flows around\nactive region appear as a diversion of the zonal shearing flows towards the\nactive region, accompanied by formation of a large-scale vortex structure. This\nprocess occurs when a substantial amount of the magnetic flux emerged on the\nsurface, and the converging flow pattern remains stable during the following\nevolution of the active region. The Carrington synoptic flow maps show that the\nlarge-scale subsurface inflows are typical for active regions. In the deeper\nlayers (10-13 Mm) the flows become diverging, and surprisingly strong beneath\nsome active regions. In addition, the synoptic maps reveal a complex evolving\npattern of large-scale flows on the scale much larger than supergranulation. \n\n"}

The results show that the\nvolatile prestellar fingerprint is modified by the chemistry en route into the\ndisc.

Complex organic molecules are produced during\ntransport through the envelope at the expense of CH3OH ice. Their abundances\ncan be comparable to that of methanol ice (few % of water ice) at large disc\nradii (R > 30 AU). Current Class II disc models may be underestimating the\ncomplex organic content.

This ~1\nGyr-old 400K dwarf is at a distance of 8pc and has a mass around 5 M_Jupiter.\nWe observed W1738 using two near-infrared filters at lambda~1um, Y and J, on\nGemini observatory, and two mid-infrared filters at lambda~4um, [3.6] and\n[4.5], on the Spitzer observatory. Twenty-four hours were spent on the source\nby Spitzer on each of June 30 and October 30 2013 UT. Between these\nobservations, around 5 hours were spent on the source by Gemini on each of July\n17 and August 23 2013 UT. The mid-infrared light curves show significant\nevolution between the two observations separated by four months. We find that a\ndouble sinusoid can be fit to the [4.5] data, where one sinusoid has a period\nof 6.0 +/- 0.1 hours and the other a period of 3.0 +/- 0.1 hours. The\nnear-infrared observations suggest variability with a ~3.0 hour period,\nalthough only at a <~2 sigma confidence level. We interpret our results as\nshowing that the Y dwarf has a 6.0 +/- 0.1 hour rotation period, with one or\nmore large-scale surface features being the source of variability. The\npeak-to-peak amplitude of the light curve at [4.5] is 3%. The amplitude of the\nnear-infrared variability, if real, may be as high as 5 to 30%. Intriguingly,\nthis size of variability and the wavelength dependence can be reproduced by\natmospheric models that include patchy KCl and Na_2S clouds and associated\nsmall changes in surface temperature.

The test data sets together include lightcurves of 127539 objects,\namong them 1251 variable stars of various types and represent a range of\nobserving conditions often found in ground-based variability surveys. The real\ndata are complemented by simulations. We propose a combination of two indices\nthat together recover a broad range of variability types from photometric data\ncharacterized by a wide variety of sampling patterns, photometric accuracies,\nand percentages of outlier measurements. The first index is the interquartile\nrange (IQR) of magnitude measurements, sensitive to variability irrespective of\na time-scale and resistant to outliers. It can be complemented by the ratio of\nthe lightcurve variance to the mean square successive difference, 1/h, which is\nefficient in detecting variability on time-scales longer than the typical time\ninterval between observations. Variable objects have larger 1/h and/or IQR\nvalues than non-variable objects of similar brightness. Another approach to\nvariability detection is to combine many variability indices using principal\ncomponent analysis. We present 124 previously unknown variable stars found in\nthe test data. \n\n"}

Summary of the astrometric, photometric, and survey\n  properties Abstract: At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data\nrelease, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion\nsources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics.

We carry out\nhigh-resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of this scenario,\nincluding the effects of dust feedback. We find that, although feedback weakens\nthe vortices and slows down the process of dust accumulation, the dust\ndistribution in the disk can nonetheless remain asymmetric for many thousands\nof orbits. We show that even after $10^4$ orbits, or $2.5$ Myr when scaled to\nthe parameters of Oph IRS 48 (a significant fraction of its age), the dust is\nnot dispersed into an axisymmetric ring, in contrast to the case of a vortex\nformed by a planet. This is because accumulation of mass at the dead zone edge\nconstantly replenishes the vortex, preventing it from being fully destroyed. We\nproduce synthetic dust emission images using our simulation results. We find\nthat multiple small clumps of dust may be distributed azimuthally. These\nclumps, if not resolved from one another, appear as a single large feature.

A\nphysics based preconditioning technique which can be adjusted to target varying\nphysics is used to improve the performance of the solver. The problems used for\nthis benchmark study include the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities, and the decay of the Taylor-Green vortex. Additionally we show a\ntest of hydrostatic equilibrium, in a stellar environment which is dominated by\nradiative effects.

Theory and simulations have suggested that\nthese arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a\nquantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet\nmass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer\nsimulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in\ndisks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio\n($h/r$): $\\delta_{\\rm max}\\approx((M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.\nWith current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum\nplanet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\\odot$\nstar at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more\nmassive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in\nobserved disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates\nfrom a different planet.

With the TEE, it is straightforward to\nestimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future\ninstruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.\n  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit\nshape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using\nMonte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in\nparticular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.\n  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to\nthe correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit\ningress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.\n  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing\nerrors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to\nestimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of\nlong-coverage observations are possible as well.

High\nspatial resolution imaging revealed the star is single, and radial velocity\nmonitoring indicated that the dimming events can not be due to an eclipsing\nstellar or brown dwarf companion. Archival and follow-up photometry suggest the\ndimming events are transient in nature. The variable morphology of the dimming\nevents suggests they are not due to a single, spherical body. The ingress of\neach dimming event is always shallower than egress, as one would expect for an\norbiting body with a leading tail. The dimming events are periodic and\nsynchronous with the stellar rotation. However, we argue it is unlikely the\ndimming events could be attributed to anything on the stellar surface based on\nthe observed depths and durations. Variable obscuration by a protoplanetary\ndisk is unlikely on the basis that the star is not actively accreting and lacks\nthe infrared excess associated with an inner disk. Rather, we explore the\npossibilities that the dimming events are due to magnetospheric clouds, a\ntransiting protoplanet surrounded by circumplanetary dust and debris, eccentric\norbiting bodies undergoing periodic tidal disruption, or an extended field of\ndust or debris near the corotation radius. \n\n"}
{"id": "1612.05264", "contents": "Title: The Dynamics of Charged Dust in Magnetized Molecular Clouds Abstract: We study the dynamics of large, charged dust grains in turbulent giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs). Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in\nprimarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale\nfluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling\nof dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on\ngrain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order\ncorrection. We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three\ndimensionless numbers in the limit of weak background magnetic fields: the\nturbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional to grain size) and a\ndust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to\ngeneralize our simulations to a wide range of conditions. \n\n"}

The Case of a Herbig Ae Star Abstract: Observationally measuring the location of the H$_{2}$O snowline is crucial\nfor understanding the planetesimal and planet formation processes, and the\norigin of water on Earth. In disks around Herbig Ae stars ($T_{\\mathrm{*}}\\sim$\n10,000K, $M_{\\mathrm{*}}\\gtrsim$ 2.5$M_{\\bigodot}$), the position of the\nH$_{2}$O snowline is further from the central star compared with that around\ncooler, and less massive T Tauri stars. Thus, the H$_{2}$O emission line fluxes\nfrom the region within the H$_{2}$O snowline are expected to be stronger. In\nthis paper, we calculate the chemical composition of a Herbig Ae disk using\nchemical kinetics. Next, we calculate the H$_{2}$O emission line profiles, and\ninvestigate the properties of candidate water lines across a wide range of\nwavelengths (from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter) that can locate the position\nof the H$_{2}$O snowline. Those line identified have small Einstein $A$\ncoefficients ($\\sim 10^{-6} -10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$) and relatively high upper state\nenergies ($\\sim$ 1000K). The total fluxes tend to increase with decreasing\nwavelengths. We investigate the possibility of future observations (e.g., ALMA,\nSPICA/SMI-HRS) to locate the position of the H$_{2}$O snowline.

Carbon-enhanced metal-poor 3D model\n  atmospheres Abstract: Context. Tighter constraints on metal-poor stars we observe are needed to\nbetter understand the chemical processes of the early Universe. Computing a\nstellar spectrum in 3D allows one to model complex stellar behaviours, which\ncannot be replicated in 1D. Aims. We examine the effect that the intrinsic CNO\nabundances have on a 3D model structure and the resulting 3D spectrum\nsynthesis. Methods. Model atmospheres were computed in 3D for three distinct\nCNO chemical compositions using the CO 5 BOLD model atmosphere code, and their\ninternal structures were examined. Synthetic spectra were computed from these\nmodels using Linfor3D and they were compared. New 3D abundance corrections for\nthe G-band and a selection of UV OH lines were also computed. Results. The\nvarying CNO abundances change the metal content of the 3D models. This had an\neffect on the model structure and the resulting synthesis. However, it was\nfound that the C/O ratio had a larger effect than the overall metal content of\na model. Conclusions. Our results suggest that varying the C/O ratio has a\nsubstantial impact on the internal structure of the 3D model, even in the hot\nturn-off star models explored here. This suggests that bespoke 3D models, for\nspecific CNO abundances should be sought. Such effects are not seen in 1D at\nthese temperature regimes. \n\n"}

In contrast, the `solar wind laboratory' is directly measured in situ by\na fleet of spacecraft measuring the properties of the plasma and magnetic\nfields at specific points in space.

Abstract: Elemental abundances of stars are the result of the complex enrichment\nhistory of their galaxy. Interpretation of observed abundances requires\nflexible modeling tools to explore and quantify the information about Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) stored in such data. Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the\nposterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test\ndata-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets. We find that of the IMF $11.6_{-1.6}^{+2.1}$ %\nexplodes as core-collapse SN, compatible with Salpeter 1955. We also constrain\nthe incidence of SN Ia per 10^3 Msun to 0.5-1.4. At the same time, this Chempy\napplication shows persistent discrepancies between predicted and observed\nabundances for some elements, irrespective of the chosen yield set. These\ncannot be remedied by any variations of Chempy's parameters and could be an\nindication for missing nucleosynthetic channels. Chempy should be a powerful\ntool to confront predictions from stellar nucleosynthesis with far more complex\nabundance data sets. \n\n"}

We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio\nprofile in the dust halo using the fact that partial dust condensation\nregulates the temperature to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust\nhalo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available\nsilicate gas condenses out.

The\nresulting surface density profile of the disc is investigated for one\ndimensional and two dimensional disc models and, in agreement with previous\nwork, it is found that one dimensional gaps are significantly deeper than their\ntwo dimensional counterparts for the same initial conditions. We find, by\napplying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs\ncontaining no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and\nthe formation of Rossby vortices play a critical role in setting the\nequilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is\nabsent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium gap\ndepth there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by\ntorque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present,\nand two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is\npresent. This can be understood if the planet gap is maintained at marginal\nstability, even when there is no obvious Rossby wave instability present.\nFurther investigation shows the final equilibrium gap depth is very sensitive\nto the form of the applied torque density distribution, and using improved one\ndimensional approximations from three dimensional simulations can go even\nfurther to reducing the discrepancy between one and two dimensional models,\nespecially for lower mass planets.

This balance has been studied extensively in the context of gases\nwith constant mean density. However, many astrophysical systems are contracting\nunder the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between\ndriving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that\nresembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some\ncircumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a\nrate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized\ngas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,\nmagnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than\nwould be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case.

Based on the\nfrequency and depth of penetrating convective structures, we observe two\ndistinct layers that form between the convection zone and the stable radiative\nzone. We show that the probability density function of the maximal depth of\nconvective penetration at any time corresponds closely in space with the radial\nposition where internal waves are excited. We find that the maximal penetration\ndepth can be modeled by a Weibull distribution with a small shape parameter.\nUsing these results, and building on established scalings for diffusion\nenhanced by large-scale convective motions, we propose a new form for the\ndiffusion coefficient that may be used for one-dimensional stellar evolution\ncalculations in the large P\\'eclet number regime.

Flare\nproductivity is empirically known to be correlated with the size and complexity\nof active regions. Several indicators, based on magnetic-field data from active\nregions, have been tested for flare forecasting in recent years. None of these\nindicators, or combinations thereof, have yet demonstrated an unambiguous\neruption or flare criterion. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been only\nbarely used to test the predictability of these parameters. In this context, we\nused the 3D parametric MHD numerical simulations of the self-consistent\nformation of the flux emergence of a twisted flux tube, inducing the formation\nof stable and unstable magnetic flux ropes of Leake (2013, 2014). We use these\nnumerical simulations to investigate the eruptive signatures observable in\nvarious magnetic scalar parameters and provide highlights on data analysis\nprocessing.

We carry out a series of two-dimensional simulations and develop\ndiagnostics to separate fluctuations from an evolving background. It is found\nthat the fluctuation amplitude starts to grow only when the linear growth rate\nis sufficiently large ($\\gamma_{max}\\tau_{A}>O(1)$) to overcome convective\nlosses. The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids\nbecome comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory. Using direct numerical simulations, in\nthis paper we investigate the nonlinear development and saturation properties\nof the helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) -- a relative of the\nstandard MRI -- in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow at very low magnetic\nPrandtl number (correspondingly at low magnetic Reynolds number) relevant to\nliquid metals. For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature. Although the contribution of non-axisymmetric modes increases\nmoderately with the Elsasser number, their total energy remains much smaller\nthan that of the axisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

For star-star\nsystems, we find that more than 30% of systems reach high eccentricity within a\nHubble time, potentially forming triple systems via stellar mergers or close\nbinaries.

Furthermore,\nwe encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist.\nWhile these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they\nare in conflict with observations in the LMC. While our results confirm in\nparticular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that\nonly part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of\nthe standard assumptions of a smooth transonic flow and compact stellar core.\nThis means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inflated wind\nstructure, or deviations from the diffusion limit at the sonic point may have\nto be invoked. Qualitatively, the existence of mass limits for the formation of\nWR-type winds may be relevant for the non-detection of low-mass WR stars in\nbinary systems, which are believed to be progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae.\nThe sonic-point conditions derived in this work may provide a possibility to\ninclude optically-thick winds in stellar evolution models in a more physically\nmotivated form than in current models. \n\n"}

The stars have mass accretion rates\nspanning from 10^{-12} to 10^{-7} Mo/yr. The line profile was deconvolved into\na low velocity component (LVC, < 40 km/s) and a high velocity component (HVC, >\n40 km/s ), originating from slow winds and high velocity jets, respectively.\nThe LVC is by far the most frequent component, with a detection rate of 77%,\nwhile only 30% of sources have a HVC. The [OI]6300 luminosity of both the LVC\nand HVC, when detected, correlates with stellar and accretion parameters of the\ncentral sources (i.e. Lstar , Mstar , Lacc , Macc), with similar slopes for the\ntwo components. The line luminosity correlates better with the accretion\nluminosity than with the stellar luminosity or stellar mass. We suggest that\naccretion is the main drivers for the line excitation and that MHD disc-winds\nare at the origin of both components. In the sub-sample of Lupus sources\nobserved with ALMA a relationship is found between the HVC peak velocity and\nthe outer disc inclination angle, as expected if the HVC traces jets ejected\nperpendicularly to the disc plane. Mass loss rates measured from the HVC span\nfrom ~ 10^{-13} to ~10^{-7} Mo/yr. The corresponding Mloss/Macc ratio ranges\nfrom ~0.01 to ~0.5, with an average value of 0.07.

Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising\nsources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger\nresults because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this\nwork, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the\nsources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear\ncomposition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the\nnuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the\nmass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the\nconnection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider\nthe hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR\nnuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is\neasier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically\npropagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models\nand compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results\nshow that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the\nAuger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in\nfitting the spectrum. We argue that our model is consistent with the newly\nreported cross correlation between the UHECRs and starburst galaxies, since\nboth LL GRBs and hypernovae are expected to be tracers of the star-formation\nactivity. LL GRBs have also been suggested as the dominant origin of IceCube\nneutrinos in the PeV range, and the LL GRB origin of UHECRs can be critically\ntested by near-future multimessenger observations. \n\n"}

The desorption energy distributions of\nthese two molecules were calculated from TPD measurements using a set of\nindependent Polanyi-Wigner equations. The maximum of the desorption of\nformamide from both graphite and ASW ice surfaces occurs at 176 K after the\ndesorption of H2O molecules, whereas the desorption profile of methylamine\ndepends strongly on the substrate. Solid methylamine starts to desorb below 100\nK from the graphite surface. Its desorption from the water ice surface occurs\nafter 120 K and stops during the water ice sublimation around 150 K. It\ncontinues to desorb from the graphite surface at temperatures higher than 160\nK. More than 95 % of NH2CHO diffuses through the water ice surface towards the\ngraphitic substrate and is released into the gas phase with a desorption energy\ndistribution (7460-9380 K), which is measured with the best-fit pre-exponential\nfactor A=10^18 s-1. However, the desorption energy distribution of methylamine\nfrom the np-ASW ice surface (3850-8420 K) is measured with the best-fit\npre-exponential factor A=10^12 s-1. A fraction of solid methylamine monolayer\nof roughly 0.15 diffuses through the water ice surface towards the HOPG\nsubstrate. This small amount desorbs later with higher binding energies\n(5050-8420 K). \n\n"}

But the role of magnetic fields and charged dust has not\nyet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas which obeys ideal MHD and\nis coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external\nacceleration (e.g., gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas.

The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The\nthird is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading\ndirectly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that\nis simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect.\nFor concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in\naccretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical\nwork directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic\n(\"viscous\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective\nradiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission\nproblem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar\nto breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar,\npermitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow\nthan otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent,\ntangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an\nangular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve.\nMoreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate\nbut to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then\nvertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

We explore the\nvariation in chromospheric activity of cool stars along the main sequence for\nstars with different effective temperatures. Additionally, we also perform an\nactivity-cycle period search and investigate its relation with rotation. The\nchromospheric activity index, S-index, was measured for 304 main-sequence stars\nfrom archived high-resolution HARPS spectra. Additionally, the measured and\narchived S-indices were converted into the chromospheric flux ratio log R'HK.\nThe activity-cycle periods were determined using the generalised Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram to study the active and inactive branches on the\nrotation-activity-cycle period plane. The global sample shows that the\nbimodality of chromospheric activity, known as the Vaughan-Preston gap, is not\nprominent, with a significant percentage of the stars at an\nintermediate-activity level around log R'HK = -4.75. Independently, the cycle\nperiod search shows that stars can lie in the region intermediate between the\nactive and inactive branch, which means that the active branch is not as\nclearly distinct as previously thought. The weakening of the Vaughan-Preston\ngap indicates that cool stars spin down from a higher activity level and settle\nat a lower activity level without a sudden break at intermediate activity. Some\ncycle periods are close to the solar value between the active and inactive\nbranch, which suggests that the solar dynamo is most likely a common case of\nthe stellar dynamo. \n\n"}

It has\nbeen postulated that strong magnetic fields in the cores of some red giants are\nresponsible for their anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes (the \"dipole\ndichotomy\" problem), but a detailed understanding of how gravity waves interact\nwith strong fields is thus far lacking. In this work, we attack the problem\nthrough a variety of analytical and numerical techniques, applied to a\nlocalised region centred on a null line of a confined axisymmetric magnetic\nfield which is approximated as being cylindrically symmetric. We uncover a rich\nvariety of phenomena that manifest when the field strength exceeds a critical\nvalue, beyond which the symmetry is drastically broken by the Lorentz force.\nWhen this threshold is reached, the spatial structure of the g-modes becomes\nheavily altered. The dynamics of wave packet propagation transitions from\nregular to chaotic, which is expected to fundamentally change the organisation\nof the mode spectrum. In addition, depending on their frequency and the\norientation of field lines with respect to the stratification, waves impinging\non different parts of the magnetised region are found to undergo either\nreflection or trapping.

The radial velocity of a star is\nobtained through a fit of the RVS spectrum relative to an appropriate synthetic\ntemplate spectrum. An additional task of the spectroscopic pipeline was to\nprovide 1st-order estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters required to\nselect such template spectra.

A necessary\ncondition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical\nstability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler\nCBPs using numerical $N$-body integrations. We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,\nthe evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons\nin dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering\nstrong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct\ncollisions.

To address this problem we\ninvestigate two closely-related problems, namely: (i) 1D, pinched anti-parallel\nmagnetic fields and (ii) 2D, null point containing fields which are locally\nimbalanced ('null-collapse' or 'X-point collapse').

We find that the halting of the implosions occurs rapidly after\nreaching the diffusion scale by sudden Ohmic heating of the dense plasma within\nthe current sheet, which provides a pressure gradient sufficient to oppose\nfurther collapse and decelerate the converging flow.

Three-dimensional non-linear\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations present the advantage of having only a small\nnumber of tunable parameters, and produce in a dynamically self-consistent\nmanner the flows and the dynamo magnetic fields pervading stellar interiors. We\nconducted a series of such simulations within the EULAG-MHD framework, varying\nthe rotation rate and luminosity of the modeled solar-like convective\nenvelopes.

Here we investigate SU Lyncis, a recently\ndiscovered example of a purely accretion-powered symbiotic star, using the\nfirst reliable X-ray spectroscopy, obtained with NuSTAR, and UV photometry\nobtained with Swift. SU Lyn has hard, thermal, X-ray emission that is strongly\naffected by a variable local absorber - that has little impact on the UV\nemission.

Their strong mass-loss furthermore\nprovides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds.\nThus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for\nseveral astrophysical fields.

In this work, we re-examine the sample from Sander\net al. (2012) to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All\nquantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral\nanalyses remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields\nthat WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude.\nWith Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex:\nWe obtain luminosities ranging from log L = 4.9 to 6.0 with one outlier having\nlog L = 4.7.

Instead, we found that the long periodic family of\n10.5-11.4 d (presumably) quasi-periods showing light variations up to 0.07 mag\nmay arise owing to the rotational revolution of disc inhomogeneities located\nbetween 16-20 solar radii.

Annual parallax and binarity could\nbe separated and robustly measured from the wing and the peak data,\nrespectively. We find matching model light curves that involve either a binary\nlens or a binary source. Our binary-lens models indicate a planet of mass $M_2$\n= (45 $\\pm$ 9) $M_\\oplus$, orbiting a star of mass $M_1$ = (0.35 $\\pm$ 0.06)\n$M_\\odot$, located at a distance $D_\\mathrm{L}$ = (1.7 $\\pm$ 0.3) kpc from\nEarth, whereas our binary-source models suggest a brown-dwarf lens of $M$ =\n(0.046 $\\pm$ 0.007) $M_\\odot$, located at a distance $D_\\mathrm{L}$ = (5.7\n$\\pm$ 0.9) kpc, with the source potentially being a (partially) eclipsing\nbinary involving stars predicted to be of similar colour given the ratios\nbetween the luminosities and radii. The ambiguity in the interpretation would\nbe resolved in favour of a lens binary by observing the luminous lens star\nseparating from the source at the predicted proper motion of $\\mu$ = (1.6 $\\pm$\n0.3) mas yr$^{-1}$, whereas it would be resolved in favour of a source binary\nif the source could be shown to be a (partially) eclipsing binary matching the\nobtained model parameters. We experienced that close binary source stars pose a\nchallenge for claiming the detection of planets by microlensing in events where\nthe source passes very close to the lens star hosting the planet. \n\n"}

In this study we have used a small representative sample of eclipsing\nbinary stars with $1.25 \\leq M/\\text{M}_\\odot < 4.2$ to test how precisely this\nmethod can constrain the overshooting and whether the data support a universal\nstellar mass--overshooting relation. We do not recover the previously reported\nstellar mass dependence for the extent of overshooting and in each case we find\nthere is a substantial amount of uncertainty, that is, the same binary pair can\nbe matched by models with different amounts of overshooting. Models with a\nmoderate overshooting parameter $0.013 \\leq f_\\text{os} \\leq 0.014$ (using the\nscheme from Herwig et al. 1997) are consistent with all eight systems studied.\nGenerally, a much larger range of $f_\\text{os}$ is suitable for individual\nsystems.

Since our 8 mm\ndata trace a population of larger dust grains which radially drift towards the\nprotostar and are lower limits on true disk sizes, large disks at early times\ndo not seem to be particularly rare.

We analyse whether this lack of\ndetections is due to observational effects. To that end we simulate the double\nwhite dwarf binary population in the Galaxy and obtain synthetic spectra for\nthe SNIa progenitors. We demonstrate that their identification, based on the\ndetection of Halpha double-lined profiles arising from the two white dwarfs in\nthe synthetic spectra, is extremely challenging due to their intrinsic\nfaintness. This translates into an observational probability of finding double\nwhite dwarf SNIa progenitors in the Galaxy of (2.1+-1.0)x10^{-5} and\n(0.8+-0.4)x10^{-5} for the classical Chandrasekhar and the sub-Chandrasekhar\nprogenitor populations, respectively.

However, the\noptimal parametrisation of the free time-dependent functions inherent to the\nformalism is still unresolved. It should respect a multitude of requirements,\nranging from simplicity, generality, and representativity of known theories to\ncomputational efficiency.

We have\nrecently proposed an inherently stable effective field theory with physical\nbasis of Planck mass evolution, sound speed of the scalar field fluctuation,\nkinetic coefficient, and background expansion, which covers Horndeski models\nwith luminal speed of gravity.

Henceforth, the new stars increase the census of stars\ncoming from different environments that can be used to asses the advantages and\nlimitations of using dwarf Cepheids as standard candles in populations for\nwhich the metallicity is not necessarily known. The dwarf Cepheids found in\nSextans have a mean period of 0.066 days, and a mean $g$ amplitude of 0.87\nmags. They are located below the horizontal branch spanning a range of 0.8 mag,\nbetween $21.9 < g < 22.7$. The number of dwarf Cepheids in Sextans is low\ncompared with other galaxies such as Carina, which have a strong\nintermediate-age population. On the other hand, the number and ratio of RR\nLyrae stars to dwarf Cepheids is quite similar to Sculptor, a galaxy which, as\nSextans, is dominated by an old stellar population. The dwarf Cepheid stars\nfound in Sextans follow a well constrained Period-Luminosity relationship with\nan rms=0.05 mag in the $g$ band, which was set up by anchoring to the distance\nmodulus given by the RR Lyrae stars. Although the majority of the variable\nstars in Sextans are located toward the center of the galaxy, we have found 2\nRR Lyrae stars and 1 Anomalous Cepheid in the outskirts of the galaxy, which\nmay be extra-tidal stars and suggest this galaxy may be undergoing tidal\ndestruction.

A target can be monitored from there for over 40 days without diurnal\ninterruption during a polar winter. This makes Kunlun station a perfect site to\nsearch for short-period transiting exoplanets.

These stars are\nassumed to form in binary systems when their expanding hydrogenic envelopes are\npromptly lost just after helium ignition. Significant differences are found\nwith single star evolution, chiefly because the helium core loses mass during\nhelium burning rather than gaining it from hydrogen shell burning. Consequently\npresupernova stars for a given initial mass function have considerably smaller\nmass when they die and will be easier to explode. Even accounting for this\ndifference, the helium stars with mass loss develop more centrally condensed\ncores that should explode more easily than their single-star counterparts. The\nproduction of low mass black holes may be diminished. Helium stars with initial\nmasses below 3.2 Msun experience significant radius expansion after helium\ndepletion, reaching blue supergiant proportions. This could trigger additional\nmass exchange or affect the light curve of the supernova. The most common black\nhole masses produced in binaries is estimated to be about 9 Msun.

Nevertheless, assuming that planetary cores are present in\nthe inner disc, we then investigate the accretion of atmospheres onto cores and\ntheir subsequent photoevaporation.

The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star.

More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

We propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution of\ngas rich, rotationally supported dIrrs, mostly found at the outskirts of the\nLocal Group (LG), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dSphs)\nor dwarf ellipticals (dEs), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals.\nThe initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive dark\nmatter halos and reproduce nearby dIrrs. Repeated tidal shocks at the\npericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and trigger\ndynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component.\nAfter only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (LSB) dIrrs are transformed into\ndSphs, while high surface brightness (HSB) dIrrs evolve into dEs. This\nevolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relation\nobserved for LG dwarfs. Dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, like\nthe archetypical dIrr GR8, are turned into Draco or Ursa Minor, the faintest\nand most dark matter dominated among LG dSphs.

However, Levin\nlater argued that the equilibrium between spin-up due to accretion and\nspin-down due to gravitational radiation is unstable, because the growth rate\nof the r-modes and consequently the rate of gravitational wave emission is an\nincreasing function of the core temperature of the star. The system executes a\nlimit cycle, spinning up for several million years and spinning down in less\nthan a year. However, the duration of the spin-down portion of the limit cycle\ndepends sensitively on the amplitude at which the nonlinear coupling between\ndifferent r-modes becomes important.

The resonant energy\ntransfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and\ninduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A\ntidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the\norbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS\nmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance\nand nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,\nthese spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal\ncoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital\ncycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for\n(33,3)- resonance. Such resonant effects, if present, must be included in\nconstructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wave\nsignals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but\nN_orb<0.1. For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation\n(nu_s<100Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonance\nto a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling, N_orb\nlies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the NS EOS) and is probably\nnegligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. R-mode resonances\nrequire misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances\ncorrespond to (22,3) and (22,1).
