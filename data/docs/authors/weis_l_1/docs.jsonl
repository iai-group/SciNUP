In this article, we bring these\nlines of research together, first developing a framework for the analysis of\nvariational crimes in abstract Hilbert complexes, and then applying this\nabstract framework to the setting of finite element exterior calculus on\nhypersurfaces.

We find that two such algebras are\nisometrically isomorphic if and only if the defining polynomial relations are\nthe same up to a unitary change of variables, and that this happens if and only\nif the associated subproduct systems are isomorphic. The proof makes use of the\ncomplex analytic structure of the character space, together with some recent\nresults on subproduct systems. Restricting attention to commutative operator\nalgebras defined by radical relations yields strong resemblances with classical\nalgebraic geometry. These commutative operator algebras turn out to be algebras\nof analytic functions on algebraic varieties. We prove a projective\nNullstellensatz connecting closed ideals and their zero sets. Under some\ntechnical assumptions, we find that two such algebras are isomorphic as\nalgebras if and only if they are similar, and we obtain a clear geometrical\npicture of when this happens. This result is obtained with tools from algebraic\ngeometry, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and some new complex-geometric\nrigidity results of independent interest. The C*-envelopes of these algebras\nare also determined.

Consider the following question:\ndoes a small change of the sites, e.g., of their position or shape, yield a\nsmall change in the corresponding Voronoi cells? This question is by all means\nnatural and fundamental, since in practice one approximates the sites either\nbecause of inexact information about them, because of inevitable numerical\nerrors in their representation, for simplification purposes and so on, and it\nis important to know whether the resulting Voronoi cells approximate the real\nones well.

This class of\nprocesses has the property that the intensity of single large jumps dominates\nthe intensity of all multiple large jumps.

We prove\nthat the conditions of the jump-paring class imply that for all eigenvalues the\ncorresponding positive eigenfunctions decay at most as rapidly as the L\\'evy\nintensity. This condition is sharp in the sense that if the jump-paring\nproperty fails to hold, then eigenfunction decay becomes slower than the decay\nof the L\\'evy intensity.

The complete family of separability tests it generates,\noften referred to as the hierarchy of $k$-extendibility tests, has already\nproved to be most promising. The goal of this paper is to try and quantify the\nefficiency of this separability criterion in typical scenarios. For that, we\nessentially take two approaches. First, we compute the average width of the set\nof $k$-extendible states, in order to see how it scales with the one of\nseparable states. And second, we characterize when random-induced states are,\ndepending on the ancilla dimension, with high probability violating or not the\n$k$-extendibility test, and compare the obtained result with the corresponding\none for entanglement vs separability. The main results can be precisely phrased\nas follows: on $\\mathbf{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbf{C}^d$, when $d$ grows, the average\nwidth of the set of $k$-extendible states is equivalent to $(2/\\sqrt{k})/d$,\nwhile random states obtained as partial traces over an environment\n$\\mathbf{C}^s$ of uniformly distributed pure states are violating the\n$k$-extendibility test with probability going to $1$ if $s<((k-1)^2/4k)d^2$.\nBoth statements converge to the conclusion that, if $k$ is fixed,\n$k$-extendibility is asymptotically a weak approximation of separability, even\nthough any of the other well-studied separability relaxations is outperformed\nby $k$-extendibility as soon as $k$ is above a certain (dimension independent)\nvalue. \n\n"}

The consistency condition, the only efficient tool\nfor verifying subnormality of unbounded composition operators, is intensively\nstudied in the context of $\\mathscr G_{2,0}$, which leads to a constructive\nmethod of solving the problem. The method itself is partly based on\ntransforming the Krein and the Friedrichs measures coming either from shifted\nAl-Salam-Carlitz $q$-polynomials or from a quartic birth and death process. \n\n"}

To avoid this situation, we introduce in this paper a broader\ndefinition of superunitary representation, relying on a new definition of\nHilbert superspace. The latter is inspired by the notion of Krein space and was\ndeveloped initially for noncommutative supergeometry. For Heisenberg\nsupergroups, this new approach yields a smooth generalization, whatever the\nsignature, of the unitary representation theory of the classical Heisenberg\ngroup. First, we obtain Schrodinger-like representations by quantizing generic\ncoadjoint orbits. They satisfy the new definition of irreducible superunitary\nrepresentations and serve as ground to the main result of this paper: a\ngeneralized Stone-von Neumann theorem. Then, we obtain the superunitary dual\nand build a group Fourier transformation, satisfying Parseval theorem. We\neventually show that metaplectic representations, which extend Schrodinger-like\nrepresentations to metaplectic supergroups, also fit into this definition of\nsuperunitary representations. \n\n"}

{"id": "1704.03636", "contents": "Title: Energy Propagation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Abstract: Many practical machine learning tasks employ very deep convolutional neural\nnetworks. Such large depths pose formidable computational challenges in\ntraining and operating the network. It is therefore important to understand how\nfast the energy contained in the propagated signals (a.k.a. feature maps)\ndecays across layers. In addition, it is desirable that the feature extractor\ngenerated by the network be informative in the sense of the only signal mapping\nto the all-zeros feature vector being the zero input signal. This \"trivial\nnull-set\" property can be accomplished by asking for \"energy conservation\" in\nthe sense of the energy in the feature vector being proportional to that of the\ncorresponding input signal. This paper establishes conditions for energy\nconservation (and thus for a trivial null-set) for a wide class of deep\nconvolutional neural network-based feature extractors and characterizes\ncorresponding feature map energy decay rates.

In other words, one could say that a regular\nfunction is locally modelled by the set of polynomials. The theory of\nregularity structures due to Hairer generalizes this observation and provides\nan abstract setup, which in the application of singular SPDE extends the set of\npolynomials by functionals constructed from, e.g., white noise. In this\ncontext, the notion of Taylor polynomials is lifted to the notion of so-called\nmodelled distributions.

This answers a question of Gromov (1993) and is in\ncontrast to the fact that any metric space embeds coarsely into an Alexandrov\nspace of nonnegative curvature, as shown by Andoni, Naor and Neiman (2015). We\nestablish this statement by proving that a metric space which is\n$q$-barycentric for some $q\\in [1,\\infty)$ has metric cotype $q$ with sharp\nscaling parameter. Our proof utilizes nonlinear (metric space-valued)\nmartingale inequalities and yields sharp bounds even for some classical Banach\nspaces.

{"id": "math/9908056", "contents": "Title: A Generalized Index Theorem for Morse-Sturm Systems and Applications to\n  semi-Riemannian Geometry Abstract: We prove an extension of the Index Theorem for Morse-Sturm systems of the\nform $-V''+RV=0$, where R is symmetric with respect to a (non positive)\nsymmetric bilinear form, and thus the corresponding differential operator is\nnot self-adjoint. The result is then applied to the case of a Jacobi equation\nalong a geodesic in a Lorentzian manifold, obtaining an extension of the Morse\nIndex Theorem for Lorentzian geodesics with variable initial endpoints. Given a\nLorentzian manifold (M,g), we consider a geodesic $\\gamma$ in M starting\northogonally to a smooth submanifold P of M. Under suitable hypotheses,\nsatisfied, for instance, if (M,g) is stationary, the theorem gives an equality\nbetween the index of the second variation of the action functional f at\n$\\gamma$ and the sum of the {\\em Maslov index} of $\\gamma$ with the index of\nthe metric g on P. Under generic circumstances, the Maslov index of $\\gamma$ is\ngiven by an algebraic count of the P-focal points along $\\gamma$. Using the\nMaslov index, we obtain the global Morse relations for geodesics between two\nfixed points in a stationary Lorentzian manifold. \n\n"}

The limiting algebra is defined in terms\nof a continuous family of generators being Fourier harmonics of Gauss\ncoordinates of the $L$-operator.

Traces of\nvertex operators can be used for calculation of correlation functions and\nformfactors of integrable models (XXZ, Sine-Gordon, etc.), that is why we are\ninterested in this problem. Also we show that Fredholm's minor and determinant\ncan be expressed by such traces. We obtain a short proof of the Fredholm's\nformula for the solution of an integral equation.
