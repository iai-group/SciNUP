There is a\ndetailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions\nwithout disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to\nbeat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause\ndelocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume.

{"id": "0704.2706", "contents": "Title: The Dynamical Discrete Web Abstract: The dynamical discrete web (DDW), introduced in recent work of Howitt and\nWarren, is a system of coalescing simple symmetric one-dimensional random walks\nwhich evolve in an extra continuous dynamical parameter s. The evolution is by\nindependent updating of the underlying Bernoulli variables indexed by discrete\nspace-time that define the discrete web at any fixed s. In this paper, we study\nthe existence of exceptional (random) values of s where the paths of the web do\nnot behave like usual random walks and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of\nsuch exceptional s. Our results are motivated by those about exceptional times\nfor dynamical percolation in high dimension by H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif,\nand in dimension two by Schramm and Steif. The exceptional behavior of the\nwalks in DDW is rather different from the situation for dynamical random walks\nof Benjamini, H\\\"aggstrom, Peres and Steif. In particular, we prove that there\nare exceptional values of s for which the walk from the origin S^s(n) has\nlimsup S^s(n)/\\sqrt n \\leq K with a nontrivial dependence of the Hausdorff\ndimension on K. We also discuss how these and other results extend to the\ndynamical Brownian web, a natural scaling limit of DDW.

This is a toy model for 'extreme' non-equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics. We provide a full picture of the long-time behaviour of\nsuch a system, including the existence / non-existence of a non-equilibrium\nsteady state, the precise tail behaviour of the energy in such a state, as well\nas the speed of convergence toward the steady state.\n  Despite its apparent simplicity, this model exhibits a surprisingly rich\nvariety of long time behaviours, depending on the parameter regime: if the\nsurrounding potential is 'too stiff', then no stationary state can exist. In\nthe softer regimes, the tails of the energy in the stationary state can be\neither algebraic, fractional exponential, or exponential. Correspondingly, the\nspeed of convergence to the stationary state can be either algebraic, stretched\nexponential, or exponential. Regarding both types of claims, we obtain matching\nupper and lower bounds. \n\n"}

We may think of x as a trap, and tau_x as the depth of the trap\nat x. We are interested in the trap process, namely the process that associates\nto time t the depth of the currently visited trap. Our first result is the\nconvergence of the law of that process under suitable scaling. The limit\nprocess is given by the jumps of a certain alpha-stable subordinator at the\ninverse of another alpha-stable subordinator, correlated with the first\nsubordinator. For that result, the requirements for the embedded random walk\nare a) the validity of a law of large numbers for its range, and b) the slow\nvariation at infinity of the tail of the distribution of its time of return to\nthe origin: they include all transient random walks as well as all planar\nrandom walks, and also many one dimensional random walks.

The\nsecond model is the space-time percolation process, which is closely related to\nthe contact model for the spread of disease. We consider a `space-time'\nrandom-cluster model and explore a range of useful probabilistic techniques for\nstudying it. The space-time Potts model emerges as a natural generalization of\nthe quantum Ising model. The basic properties of the phase transitions in these\nmodels are treated, such as the fact that there is at most one unbounded\nFK-cluster, and the resulting lower bound on the critical value in $\\ZZ$. We\nalso develop an alternative graphical representation of the quantum Ising\nmodel, called the random-parity representation.

The performance of the system is measured by the fraction of reneged\nwork (the residual work lost due to elapsed deadlines) which is shown to be\nminimized by the EDF policy.

The interaction\nin this multiparameter BTBS-PDEs connection is novel, leads to an\nintimately-connected linear system variant of the celebrated\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, and is not shared with its one-time-parameter\ncounterpart. It also means that these PDEs systems are to be solved for a\nfamily of functions, a feature exhibited in well known fluids dynamics models.\nOn the other hand, the memory-preserving interaction between the PDE solution\nand the initial data is common to both the single and the multi parameter\nBrownian-time PDEs. Here, we introduce a new---even in the one parameter\ncase---proof that judiciously combines stochastic analysis with analysis and\nfractional calculus to simultaneously link BTBS to a new system of temporally\nhalf-derivative interacting PDEs as well as to the fourth order system proved\nearlier and differently by Allouba.

The results hereafter shed new light on the connection\nbetween both the volatility of the continuous component and the jump parameters\nand the behavior of ATM option prices near expiration.

Here, we focus on the regularizing effect of a large\nclass of memoryful high-order or time-fractional PDEs---through their\nfundamental solutions---on stochastic integral equations (SIEs) driven by\nspace-time white noise. Surprisingly, we show that maximum spatial regularity\nis achieved in the fourth-order-bi-Laplacian case; and any further increase of\nthe spatial-Laplacian order is entirely translated into additional temporal\nregularization of the SIE.

By combining\nspatial and probabilistic averaging we define Minkowski tensor densities of a\nBoolean model. These densities are global characteristics of the union set\nwhich can be estimated from observations. In contrast local characteristics\nlike the mean Minkowski tensor of a single random particle cannot be observed\ndirectly, since the particles overlap.

Goldberg and Jerrum showed that approximating the partition function of\nthe ferromagnetic Potts model is at least as hard as approximating the number\nof independent sets in bipartite graphs (#BIS-hardness). We improve this\nhardness result by establishing it for bipartite graphs of maximum degree D. We\nfirst present a detailed picture for the phase diagram for the infinite\nD-regular tree, giving a refined picture of its first-order phase transition\nand establishing the critical temperature for the coexistence of the disordered\nand ordered phases. We then prove for all temperatures below this critical\ntemperature that it is #BIS-hard to approximate the partition function on\nbipartite graphs of maximum degree D. As a corollary, it is #BIS-hard to\napproximate the number of k-colorings on bipartite graphs of maximum degree D\nwhen k <= D/(2 ln D).\n  The #BIS-hardness result for the ferromagnetic Potts model uses random\nbipartite regular graphs as a gadget in the reduction. The analysis of these\nrandom graphs relies on recent connections between the maxima of the\nexpectation of their partition function, attractive fixpoints of the associated\ntree recursions, and induced matrix norms.

This is done via the\nPoisson Process Calculus as it now relates to latent feature models.

In this metaphor dishes corresponds to latent features, attributes,\npreferences shared by individuals. The IBP, and its generalizations, represent\nan exciting class of models well suited to handle high dimensional statistical\nproblems now common in this information age. The IBP is based on the usage of\nconditionally independent Bernoulli random variables, coupled with completely\nrandom measures acting as Bayesian priors, that are used to create sparse\nbinary matrices.

Recently,\nthere has been significant progress in developing useful inference tools for\nsuch general models.

A distributed recursive estimator of the\n\\emph{consensus} + \\emph{innovations} type, namely $\\mathcal{CIWNLS}$, is\nproposed, in which the agents update their parameter estimates at each\nobservation sampling epoch in a collaborative way by simultaneously processing\nthe latest locally sensed information~(\\emph{innovations}) and the parameter\nestimates from other agents~(\\emph{consensus}) in the local neighborhood\nconforming to a pre-specified inter-agent communication topology. Under rather\nweak conditions on the connectivity of the inter-agent communication and a\n\\emph{global observability} criterion, it is shown that at every network agent,\nthe proposed algorithm leads to consistent parameter estimates. Furthermore,\nunder standard smoothness assumptions on the local observation functions, the\ndistributed estimator is shown to yield order-optimal convergence rates, i.e.,\nas far as the order of pathwise convergence is concerned, the local parameter\nestimates at each agent are as good as the optimal centralized nonlinear least\nsquares estimator which would require access to all the observations across all\nthe agents at all times. In order to benchmark the performance of the proposed\ndistributed $\\mathcal{CIWNLS}$ estimator with that of the centralized nonlinear\nleast squares estimator, the asymptotic normality of the estimate sequence is\nestablished and the asymptotic covariance of the distributed estimator is\nevaluated. Finally, simulation results are presented which illustrate and\nverify the analytical findings. \n\n"}

Both classes were introduced---with Brownian-time-type\nkernel formulations---by Allouba in a series of articles starting in 2006,\nwhere he presented class (2) in its rigorous stochastic integral equations\nform. He proved existence, uniqueness, and sharp spatio-temporal H\\\"older\nregularity for the above two classes of equations in $d=1,2,3$. We show that\nboth classes are $(1/2)^-$ H\\\"older continuously differentiable in space when\n$d=1$, and we give the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity for the\ngradient in both cases. This is unprecedented for SPDEs driven by space-time\nwhite noise. Our results on exact moduli show that the half-derivative SPIDE is\na critical case.

To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical\nmodels, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak\nabout, e.g., \"quantum cognition\"). These novel applications generate a number\nof foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science -\nfoundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was\nmainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the\nprobabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive\npsychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical\nprobability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by\nthe formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another\nquestion attracted some attention.

Far from the edge, near the center of the trap (the so\ncalled \"bulk regime\"), physical properties of the fermions have traditionally\nbeen understood using the Local Density Approximation. However, this\napproximation drastically fails near the edge where the density vanishes. In\nthis paper we show that, even near the edge, novel universal properties emerge,\nindependently of the details of the confining potential. We show that for large\n$N$, these fermions in a confining trap, in arbitrary dimensions and at finite\ntemperature, form a determinantal point process. As a result, any $n$-point\ncorrelation function can be expressed as an $n \\times n$ determinant whose\nentry is called the kernel. Near the edge, we derive the large $N$ scaling form\nof the kernels. In $d=1$ and $T=0$, this reduces to the so called Airy kernel,\nthat appears in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) of random matrix theory. In\n$d=1$ and $T>0$ we show a remarkable connection between our kernel and the one\nappearing in the $1+1$-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation at finite time.\nConsequently our result provides a finite $T$ generalization of the Tracy-Widom\ndistribution, that describes the fluctuations of the rightmost fermion at\n$T=0$. In $d>1$ and $T \\geq 0$, while the connection to GUE no longer holds,\nthe process is still determinantal whose analysis provides a new class of\nkernels, generalizing the $1d$ Airy kernel at $T=0$ obtained in random matrix\ntheory. Some of our finite temperature results should be testable in\npresent-day cold atom experiments, most notably our detailed predictions for\nthe temperature dependence of the fluctuations near the edge. \n\n"}

These distributions form natural statistical models for\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) problems throughout the sciences. Baik, Ben\nArous and P\\'ech\\'e showed that the spiked Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp\nphase transition asymptotically: when the signal strength is above a critical\nthreshold, it is possible to detect the presence of a spike based on the top\neigenvalue, and below the threshold the top eigenvalue provides no information.\nSuch results form the basis of our understanding of when PCA can detect a\nlow-rank signal in the presence of noise.\n  However, not all the information about the spike is necessarily contained in\nthe spectrum. We study the fundamental limitations of statistical methods,\nincluding non-spectral ones. Our results include:\n  I) For the Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA achieves the optimal\ndetection threshold for a variety of benign priors for the spike. We extend\nprevious work on the spherically symmetric and i.i.d. Rademacher priors through\nan elementary, unified analysis.\n  II) For any non-Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA is always\nsuboptimal for detection. However, a variant of PCA achieves the optimal\nthreshold (for benign priors) by pre-transforming the matrix entries according\nto a carefully designed function. This approach has been stated before, and we\ngive a rigorous and general analysis.\n  III) For both the Gaussian Wishart ensemble and various synchronization\nproblems over groups, we show that inefficient procedures can work below the\nthreshold where PCA succeeds, whereas no known efficient algorithm achieves\nthis. This conjectural gap between what is statistically possible and what can\nbe done efficiently remains open. \n\n"}

We begin by defining a new kind of abstract\nlimit object, called \"partitioned subprobability measure\", to describe the\nlimits of endpoint distributions of directed polymers. Inspired by a recent\nwork of Mukherjee and Varadhan on large deviations of the occupation measure of\nBrownian motion, we define a suitable topology on the space of partitioned\nsubprobability measures and prove that this topology is compact.

We also prove a conjecture about the detection\nproblem in the stochastic block model that has received considerable attention\n[Decelle et al.: Phys. Rev. E 2011]. \n\n"}

By well-posedness in\nlow regularity Sobolev spaces we mean that less regularity than the one imposed\nby the energy methods is required (the energy methods do not exploit the\ndispersive properties of the linear part of the equation). In many cases these\nmethods to prove well-posedness in low regularity Sobolev spaces lead to\noptimal results in terms of the regularity of the initial data. By optimal we\nmean that if one requires slightly less regularity then the corresponding\nCauchy problem becomes ill-posed in the Hadamard sense. We call the Sobolev\nspaces in which these ill-posedness results hold spaces of supercritical\nregularity.\n  More recently, methods to prove probabilistic well-posedness in Sobolev\nspaces of supercritical regularity were developed. More precisely, by\nprobabilistic well-posedness we mean that one endows the corresponding Sobolev\nspace of supercritical regularity with a non degenerate probability measure and\nthen one shows that almost surely with respect to this measure one can define a\n(unique) global flow. However, in most of the cases when the methods to prove\nprobabilistic well-posedness apply, there is no information about the measure\ntransported by the flow. Very recently, a method to prove that the transported\nmeasure is absolutely continuous with respect to the initial measure was\ndeveloped. In such a situation, we have a measure which is quasi-invariant\nunder the corresponding flow.\n  The aim of these lectures is to present all of the above described\ndevelopments in the context of the nonlinear wave equation. \n\n"}

In traditional non-machine-learning (ML) based\napproaches the parameters required for noise reduction are estimated blindly\nfrom the noisy observation while the actual filter functions are derived\nanalytically based on statistical assumptions. Even though such approaches\ngeneralize well to many different acoustic conditions, the noise suppression\ncapability in transient noises is low. To amend this shortcoming,\nmachine-learning (ML) methods such as deep learning have been employed for\nspeech enhancement. However, due to their data-driven nature, the\ngeneralization of ML based approaches to unknown noise types is still\ndiscussed. To improve the generalization of ML based algorithms and to enhance\nthe noise suppression of non-ML based methods, we propose a combination of both\napproaches.

The main feature of the equation is\nthe dependence of the driving vector field and boundary condition on a\nnon-local order parameter related to the excess mass of the system.\n  The first main result concerns the well-posedness and regularity of the\nCauchy problem. The well-posedness is based on a fixed point argument, and the\nregularity on Schauder estimates. The first a priori estimates yield H\\\"older\nregularity of the non-local order parameter, which is improved by an iteration\nargument.\n  The asymptotic behavior of solutions depends on some order parameter $\\rho$\ndepending on the initial data. The system shows different behavior depending on\na value $\\rho_s>0$, determined from the potentials and diffusion coefficient.\nFor $\\rho \\leq \\rho_s$, there exists an equilibrium solution\n$c^{\\text{eq}}_{(\\rho)}$. If $\\rho\\le\\rho_s$ the solution converges strongly to\n$c^{\\text{eq}}_{(\\rho)}$, while if $\\rho > \\rho_s$ the solution converges\nweakly to $c^{\\text{eq}}_{(\\rho_s)}$. The excess $\\rho - \\rho_s$ gets lost due\nto the formation of larger and larger clusters. In this regard, the model\nbehaves similarly to the classical Becker-D\\\"oring equation.\n  The system possesses a free energy, strictly decreasing along the evolution,\nwhich establishes the long time behavior. In the subcritical case $\\rho<\\rho_s$\nthe entropy method, based on suitable weighted logarithmic Sobolev inequalities\nand interpolation estimates, is used to obtain explicit convergence rates to\nthe equilibrium solution.\n  The close connection of the presented model and the Becker-D\\\"oring model is\noutlined by a family of discrete Fokker-Planck type equations interpolating\nbetween both of them. This family of models possesses a gradient flow\nstructure, emphasizing their commonality. \n\n"}

However, an often\nignored characteristic is the {\\em sound} produced during the inhalation phase\nof this cycle. Intra-speech inhalation is rapid and energetic, performed with\nopen mouth and glottis, effectively exposing the entire vocal tract to enable\nmaximum intake of air. This results in vocal tract resonances evoked by\nturbulence that are characteristic of the speaker's speech-producing apparatus.\nConsequently, the sounds of inhalation are expected to carry information about\nthe speaker's identity.

The difficulty lies in the intrinsic multi-level and multi-modal\ncharacter of music representation (which is very different from image\nrepresentation). As a result, depending on their interpretation of \"music\nstyle\", current studies under the category of \"music style transfer\", are\nactually solving completely different problems that belong to a variety of\nsub-fields of Computer Music. Also, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which aims\nat dealing with all levels of music representation at once by directly adopting\nthe method of image style transfer, leads to poor results.

From the perspective of systemic\nrisk it is important to understand the influence of this network structure on\ndefault contagion. Using sparse random graphs to model the financial network,\nasymptotic methods turned out powerful to analytically describe the contagion\nprocess and to make statements about resilience. So far, however, they have\nbeen limited to so-called {\\em rank one} models in which informally the only\nnetwork parameter is the degree sequence (see (Amini et. al. 2016) and\n(Detering et. al. 2019) for example) and the contagion process can be described\nby a one dimensional fix-point equation. These networks fail to account for a\npronounced block structure such as core/periphery or a network composed of\ndifferent connected blocks for different countries.

Each node of the\ntorus is connected to all the nodes located in an $l_\\infty$-ball of radius $w$\nin the toroidal space centered at itself and we assume that $h$ is\nexponentially larger than $w^2$.

We\ndevelop a novel sparse pursuit algorithm that can match the discrete frequency\nspectra from the recorded signal with the continuous spectra delivered by the\nmodel. We first use this algorithm to convert an STFT spectrogram from the\nrecording into a novel form of log-frequency spectrogram whose resolution\nexceeds that of the mel spectrogram. We then make use of the pitch-invariant\nproperties of that representation in order to identify the sounds of the\ninstruments via the same sparse pursuit method.

The model is formulated as a conditional\ngenerative model based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, with two\nlevels of hierarchical latent variables. The first level is a categorical\nvariable, which represents attribute groups (e.g. clean/noisy) and provides\ninterpretability. The second level, conditioned on the first, is a multivariate\nGaussian variable, which characterizes specific attribute configurations (e.g.\nnoise level, speaking rate) and enables disentangled fine-grained control over\nthese attributes. This amounts to using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the\nlatent distribution. Extensive evaluation demonstrates its ability to control\nthe aforementioned attributes. In particular, we train a high-quality\ncontrollable TTS model on real found data, which is capable of inferring\nspeaker and style attributes from a noisy utterance and use it to synthesize\nclean speech with controllable speaking style. \n\n"}

The\nproposed method, called ConvS2S-VC, has three key features. First, it uses a\nmodel with a fully convolutional architecture. This is particularly\nadvantageous in that it is suitable for parallel computations using GPUs. It is\nalso beneficial since it enables effective normalization techniques such as\nbatch normalization to be used for all the hidden layers in the networks.\nSecond, it achieves many-to-many conversion by simultaneously learning mappings\namong multiple speakers using only a single model instead of separately\nlearning mappings between each speaker pair using a different model. This\nenables the model to fully utilize available training data collected from\nmultiple speakers by capturing common latent features that can be shared across\ndifferent speakers.

The\nsystem is heavily loaded in the Halfin-Whitt regime, and the scheduling\npolicies are work-conserving and preemptive. We provide a unified approach via\na Lyapunov function method that establishes Foster-Lyapunov equations for both\nthe limiting diffusion and the prelimit diffusion-scaled queueing processes\nsimultaneously.\n  We first study the limiting controlled diffusion, and we show that if the\nspare capacity (safety staffing) parameter is positive, then the diffusion is\nexponentially ergodic uniformly over all stationary Markov controls, and the\ninvariant probability measures have uniform exponential tails. This result is\nsharp, since when there is no abandonment and the spare capacity parameter is\nnegative, then the controlled diffusion is transient under any Markov control.\nIn addition, we show that if all the abandonment rates are positive, the\ninvariant probability measures have sub-Gaussian tails, regardless whether the\nspare capacity parameter is positive or negative.\n  Using the above results, we proceed to establish the corresponding ergodic\nproperties for the diffusion-scaled queueing processes.

{"id": "math/0608756", "contents": "Title: Quantum stochastic convolution cocycles Abstract: A concept of quantum stochastic convolution cocycle is introduced and studied\nin two different contexts -- purely algebraic and operator space theoretic. A\nquantum stochastic convolution cocycle is a quantum stochastic process on a\ncoalgebra satisfying the convolution cocycle relation and the initial condition\ngiven by the counit. The notion generalises that of quantum Levy process, which\nin turn is a noncommutative probability counterpart of classical Levy process\non a group.\n  Convolution cocycles arise as solutions of quantum stochastic differential\nequations. In turn every sufficiently regular cocycle satisfies an equation of\nthat type. This is proved along with the corresponding existence and uniqueness\nof solutions for coalgebraic quantum stochastic differential equations. The\nstochastic generators of unital *-homomorphic cocycles are characterised in\nterms of structure maps on a *-bialgebra. This yields a simple proof of the\nSchurmann Reconstruction Theorem for a quantum Levy process; it also yields a\ntopological version for a quantum Levy process on a C*-bialgebra. Precise\ncharacterisation of the stochastic generators of completely positive and\ncontractive quantum stochastic convolution cocycles in the C*-algebraic context\nis given, leading to some dilation results.
