A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat.

In the case of\na system initially consisting of nu_e and anti-nu_e with the same energy\nspectrum but different number densities, the mean field is very well\napproximated by the total angular momentum of a neutrino gyroscope. Assuming\nthat NFIS evolution is independent of the initial neutrino emission angle, the\nso-called single-angle approximation, we find that the evolution is governed by\ntwo types of resonances driven by precession and nutation of the gyroscope,\nrespectively. The net flavor transformation crucially depends on the\nadiabaticity of evolution through these resonances.

I begin to consider the secular changes induced in galactic\nsystems by such presumed variations, assumed adiabatic. It is important to\nunderstand these effects, in isolation from other evolutionary influences, in\norder to identify or constrain a0 variations by detection of induced effects,\nor lack thereof. I find that as long as the system is fully in the deep-MOND\nregime -- as applies to many galactic systems -- the adiabatic response of the\nsystem obeys simple scaling laws. For example, in a system that would be\nstationary for fixed a0, the system expands homologously as a0^{-1/4}, while\ninternal velocities decrease uniformly as a0^{1/4}. If a0 is proportional to cH\nat all relevant times, this change amounts to a factor of ~ 2.5 since redshift\n10. For a system stationary in a rotating frame, the angular frequency\ndecreases as a0^{1/2}. The accelerations increase relative to a0 as a0^{-1/4},\npushing the system towards the Newtonian regime. All this follows from the\nappearance of a0 in MOND and the scale invariance of the deep-MOND limit -- two\nbasic tenets of MOND. More complicated evolution ensues when parts of the\nsystem become Newtonian, or are so from inception.

Obtaining a $125\\gev$ for the mass of the\nlightest Higgs boson has also been difficult. Additional issues with the\nsupersoft scenario arise from the fact that these models contain new scalars in\nthe adjoint representation of the standard model, which may obtain negative\nsquared-masses, breaking color and generating too large a $T$-parameter. In\nthis work we introduce new operators into supersoft models which can\npotentially solve all these issues. A novel feature of this framework is that\nthe new $\\mu$-term can give unequal masses to the up and down type Higgs\nfields, and the Higgsinos can be much heavier than the Higgs boson without\nfine-tuning. However, unequal Higgs and Higgsino masses also remove some\nattractive features of supersoft susy. \n\n"}

The observed behavior\nof antineutron-nucleus annihilations is similar to what would be expected for\nantiproton-nucleus annihilations, where Coulomb attraction focusses antiproton\ntrajectories towards the nucleus, enhancing the inelastic cross section by a\nfactor O(1/p) with respect to antineutrons on the same target. This results in\na 1/p^2 behavior at small energies. The presence of a similar enhancement in\nthe antineutron case may only be justified by an interaction with a longer\nrange than strong interactions.

This can be explained if the\nSU(2)$_R$ charged gauge bosons $W_R^\\pm$ have a mass of around 2 TeV and a\nright-handed neutrino with a mass of ${\\cal O}(1)$ TeV mainly decays to\nelectron.

This suggests that\nthere is a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty Principle or\nCompton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary particles in the $M\n< M_{P}$ regime and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the presence of\n$n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$, one expects $R_S\n\\propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R < R_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may\nbe restored in some circumstances because the effective Compton wavelength\ndepends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is\nspherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \\propto M^{-1}$, as in the\n$3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the\nPlanck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black\nhole production at the LHC.

In this case, the\neffective Planck length is reduced but the Planck mass is unchanged, so TeV\nquantum gravity is precluded and black holes cannot be generated in collider\nexperiments. Nevertheless, the extra dimensions could still have consequences\nfor the detectability of black hole evaporations and the enhancement of\npair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$.

This is illustrated by a new limit on the corresponding cross\nsection that we derive from public IceCube data. In this context, we study\nwhich DM models could produce an observable flux of monochromatic neutrinos\nfrom DM annihilations. To this end, we proceed in two steps. First, within a\nset of simple and minimal assumptions concerning the properties of the DM\nparticle, we determine the models that could give rise to a significant\nannihilation into monochromatic neutrinos at the freeze-out epoch. The list of\nmodels turns out to be very limited as a result of various constraints, in\nparticular direct detection and neutrino masses at loop level. Given the fact\nthat, even if largely improved, the sensitivities will be far from reaching the\nthermal annihilation cross section soon, a signal could only be observed if the\nannihilation into neutrinos today is boosted with respect to the freeze-out\nepoch. This is why, in a second step, we analyze the possibility of having such\na large enhancement from the Sommerfeld effect. For each scenario, we also\ncompute the cross sections into other annihilation products and confront our\nresults with experimental constraints. We find that, within our simple and\nminimal assumptions, the expectation to observe monochromatic neutrinos is only\npossible in very specific scenarios. Some will be confirmed or excluded in the\nnear future because they predict signals slightly below the current\nexperimental sensitivities. We also discuss how these prospects change by\nrelaxing our assumptions as well as by considering other types of sharp\nspectral features. For the latter, we consider boxed-shaped and bremsstrahlung\nspectra and provide the corresponding limits from IceCube data. \n\n"}

Our framework\nincorporates four major components. (i) The recently established existence of\nspace-time order at all scales (fundamental structure) observed directly in\ntypical configurations of regularized path-integral ensembles. (ii) The notion\nof scale-dependent vacuum structure (effective structure) providing the means\nfor representing and quantifying the influence of fluctuations at various\nscales on physical observables (phenomena). (iii) The unified description of\ngauge and fermionic aspects of the theory which facilitates a high level of\nspace-time order in the path-integral ensembles. (iv) The strict ``Bottom-Up''\napproach wherein the process of identifying the vacuum structure proceeds\ninductively, using the information from valid lattice QCD ensembles as the only\ninput. In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of\nspace-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of\nthe path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the\nalgorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained\ndescriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure. The\ncorresponding ensemble averages define the ranking of different lattice\ntheories at given cutoff by the degree of space-time order generated via their\ndynamics. We then introduce the set of local transformations of a\nconfiguration, chiral orderings, in which the transformed gauge connection\nrepresents an effective matrix phase acquired by chiral fermion when hopping\nover a given link. It is proposed that chiral orderings facilitate the\nevolution in the set of actions which increases the degree of space-time order\nwhile preserving the physical content of the theory, and should thus be used in\nthe search for the fundamental QCD vacuum structure.

The linear coupling of\nSU(2)-doublet Higgs superfields, which is indispensable to the superpotential\nof the minimal supersymmetric standard model, is replaced by a trilinear\ncoupling of the Higgs superfields, so that there is no mass parameter in the\nsuperpotential.
