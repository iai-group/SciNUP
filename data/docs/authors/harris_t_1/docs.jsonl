Furthermore,\ncarrying out a perturbative computation, we demonstrate that the spectral\nfunction corresponding to this correlator is relatively flat at small\nfrequencies. Therefore, unlike in the case of several other transport\ncoefficients, for which the narrowness of the transport peak makes analytic\ncontinuation from Euclidean lattice data susceptible to severe systematic\nuncertainties, it appears that the determination of the heavy quark\nthermalization rate could be relatively well under control. \n\n"}

The continuous high-lying\nhadronic mass spectrum is populated at first by the unitary Hagedorn states.\nThen the spectrum turns to be dominated by the colorless orthogonal states as\nthe dilute system is heated up. Subsequently, the liquid/gas of orthogonal\nHagedorn states undergoes higher order deconfinement phase transition to\nquark-gluon plasma.

First, the\napplication of sophisticated matrix algorithms to the numerical solution of\nboth the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and the inhomogeneous vertex\nBSE is discussed, and the advantages of these methods are described in detail.\nTurning to the finite temperature formalism, the rainbow-truncated quark\nDyson-Schwinger equation is used to investigate the impact of different forms\nof the effective interaction on the chiral transition temperature. A strong\nmodel dependence and no overall correlation of the value of the transition\ntemperature to the strength of the interaction is found. Within one model,\nhowever, such a correlation exists and follows an expected pattern. In the\ncontext of the BSE at zero temperature, a representation of the inhomogeneous\nvertex BSE and the quark-antiquark propagator in terms of eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the homogeneous BSE is given.

In the\nsemiclassical small-L regime, a deconfinement transition occurs at T_c <<1/L.\nThe transition is due to a competition between non-perturbative topological\n\"molecules\"---magnetic and neutral bion-instantons---and electrically charged\nW-bosons and superpartners. Compared to deconfinement in non-supersymmetric\nQCD(adj) arXiv:1112.6389, the novelty is the relevance of the light modulus\nscalar field. It mediates interactions between neutral bions (and W-bosons),\nserves as an order parameter for the Z_2^{L} center symmetry associated with\nthe non-thermal circle, and explicitly breaks the electric-magnetic\n(Kramers-Wannier) duality enjoyed by non-supersymmetric QCD(adj) near T_c. We\nshow that deconfinement can be studied using an effective two-dimensional gas\nof electric and magnetic charges with (dual) Coulomb and Aharonov-Bohm\ninteractions, or, equivalently, via an XY-spin model with a symmetry-breaking\nperturbation, where each system couples to the scalar field.

The dual-Coulomb gas simulations are a novel way to analyze\ndeconfinement and provide a new venue to study the phase structure of a class\nof two-dimensional condensed matter models that can be mapped into dual-Coulomb\ngases.

The advantage of our\nreformulations is that the original non-Abelian gauge field variables can be\nchanged into the new field variables such that one of them called the\nrestricted field gives the dominant contribution to quark confinement in the\ngauge-independent way. Our reformulations can be combined with the $SU(N)$\nextension of the Diakonov-Petrov version of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for\nthe Wilson loop operator to give a gauge-invariant definition for the magnetic\nmonopole in the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory without the scalar field.

This may determine the universality class of the chiral\nphase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is\nessentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to\naddress this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor\ndynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also\noptimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is\nknown that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the\nscaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region. We observe\nthat the anomalous U(1) is not effectively restored in the chiral crossover\nregion.

By\nintroducing an auxiliary field, we can replace the nonlocal operator with a\npair of local operators in an extended theory. On the lattice, this is closely\nrelated to the static quark theory.

We\nfirst identify that the conventional DQW can't exactly simulate Dirac Cellular\nAutomaton (DCA), a discretized theory of free Dirac Hamiltonian (DH). We found\nsome choice of coin parameters of the split-step (SS) DQW, a generalization of\nDQW can fully simulate single-particle DCA. Next we question whether the same\nSS-DQW can simulate dynamics of free Dirac particle with extra degrees of\nfreedom like colors, flavors besides the spin or chirality. One such example is\nNeutrino oscillation. By moving from the U(2) coined SS-DQW to the U(6) coined\nSS-DQW we have simulated the exact probability profile of Neutrino flavor\ntransitions. We further probe towards simulating single particle massive DH in\npresence of background potentials and space-time curvature. By using a SS-DQW\nwith position-time dependent coin parameters, and we realize that it will give\nus an unbounded effective Hamiltonian, at the continuum limit of position-time.\nSo we have introduced a modified version of SS-DQW which will produce a bounded\neffective Hamiltonian.

Introducing higher dimensional---U(N) coin operations in\nthe modified SS-DQW we can include non-abelian potentials in the same DH. In\norder to simulate two-particle DH in presence of curved space-time and external\npotentials, we have used two particle modified SS-DQW, where the shift\noperations act separately on each particle, the coin operations which act\nsimultaneously on both particles contain all kinds of interactions. \n\n"}

Our framework\nincorporates four major components. (i) The recently established existence of\nspace-time order at all scales (fundamental structure) observed directly in\ntypical configurations of regularized path-integral ensembles. (ii) The notion\nof scale-dependent vacuum structure (effective structure) providing the means\nfor representing and quantifying the influence of fluctuations at various\nscales on physical observables (phenomena). (iii) The unified description of\ngauge and fermionic aspects of the theory which facilitates a high level of\nspace-time order in the path-integral ensembles. (iv) The strict ``Bottom-Up''\napproach wherein the process of identifying the vacuum structure proceeds\ninductively, using the information from valid lattice QCD ensembles as the only\ninput. In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of\nspace-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of\nthe path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the\nalgorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained\ndescriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure. The\ncorresponding ensemble averages define the ranking of different lattice\ntheories at given cutoff by the degree of space-time order generated via their\ndynamics. We then introduce the set of local transformations of a\nconfiguration, chiral orderings, in which the transformed gauge connection\nrepresents an effective matrix phase acquired by chiral fermion when hopping\nover a given link. It is proposed that chiral orderings facilitate the\nevolution in the set of actions which increases the degree of space-time order\nwhile preserving the physical content of the theory, and should thus be used in\nthe search for the fundamental QCD vacuum structure. The relation to\nrenormalization group ideas is discussed, and the first step in general\nformulation of effective lattice QCD realizing the notion of scale-dependent\nvacuum structure is given. \n\n"}
