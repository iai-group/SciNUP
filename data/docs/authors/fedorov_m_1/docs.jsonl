This entanglement of the subsystems, although\narising from mathematical principles, is no mere abstract concept, but can be\ntested in experiment, and be utilized in modern quantum information theory\nprocedures, such as quantum teleportation. In particular, entangled states play\na crucial role in testing our understanding of reality, by violating Bell\ninequalities. While the role of entanglement is well studied in the realm of\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics, its significance in a relativistic quantum\ntheory is a relatively new field of interest. In this work the consequences of\na relativistic description of quantum entanglement are discussed.

Dynamical\ndecoupling (DD) is an effective method for reducing decoherence with a low\ncontrol overhead. It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where\nfor instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of\nequidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,\nUhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance\nDD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the\nenvironment has a sharp frequency cutoff. On the other hand, equidistant\nsequences outperform UDD for soft cutoffs. The relative advantage provided by\nUDD for intermediate regimes is not clear. In this paper, we analyze the\nrelative DD performance in this regime experimentally, using solid-state\nnuclear magnetic resonance. Our system-qubits are 13C nuclear spins and the\nenvironment consists of a 1H nuclear spin-bath whose spectral density is close\nto a normal (Gaussian) distribution. We find that in the presence of such a\nbath, the CPMG sequence outperforms the UDD sequence. An analogy between\ndynamical decoupling and interference effects in optics provides an intuitive\nexplanation as to why the CPMG sequence performs superior to any\nnon-equidistant DD sequence in the presence of this kind of environmental\nnoise. \n\n"}

In particular, we develop a nonperturbative\ntheory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter,\nfor arbitrary initial states. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained\nfor the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable, which hold\nto all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in\naddition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to\ndescribe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the\ngeneralized Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new\nregimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the\ninverted region, where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer\ndeflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal\nconditions for weak PPS measurements are achieved in the strongly-nonlinear\nregime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close\nto the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being\ntypically of the order of the pointer uncertainty.

The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence.

To address this issue, we continuously transfer the angular\nmomentum from electron spin to nuclear spins, and pump the nuclear spin bath to\na polarized state under Hartman-Hahn condition.

A three-dimensional gapped lattice spin model is found\nwhich demonstrates for the first time that a reliable quantum memory at finite\ntemperature is possible, at least to some extent. When quantum information is\nencoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to\nthermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without\nany active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors\nwell localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved\nfaithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the\ninverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological\nquantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales\nexponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square.\n  This spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order,\nin which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are\nimmobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the\nHamiltonian. The degeneracy of the ground state, though also insensitive to\nperturbations, is a complicated number-theoretic function of the system size,\nand the system bifurcates into multiple noninteracting copies of itself under\nreal-space renormalization group transformations. The degeneracy, the\nexcitations, and the renormalization group flow can be analyzed using a\nframework that exploits the spin model's symmetry and some associated free\nresolutions of modules over polynomial algebras. \n\n"}

The answer may follow from the observation that in quantum theory,\nunlike in other theories, whenever there is an experiment to measure $A$\nsimultaneously with $B$, another to measure $B$ with $C$, and another to\nmeasure $A$ with $C$, there is always an experiment to measure all of them\nsimultaneously. This property implies that quantum theory satisfies a seemingly\nirrelevant restriction called the exclusivity (E) principle which,\nsurprisingly, explains the set of quantum correlations in some fundamental\nscenarios. An open problem is whether the E principle explains the maximum\nquantum violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Here we show experimentally that\nthe E principle imposes an upper bound to the violation of the Bell-CHSH\ninequality that matches the maximum predicted by quantum theory. For that, we\nuse the result of an independent experiment testing a specific\nnon-contextuality inequality. We perform both experiments: the Bell-CHSH\ninequality experiment on polarization entangled states of pairs of photons in\nStockholm and, to demonstrate independence, the non-contextuality inequality\nexperiment on single photons' orbital angular momentum states in Rome. The\nobserved results provide the first experimental evidence that the E principle\ndetermines the limits of quantum correlations and prove that hypothetical\nsuper-quantum violations for either experiment would violate the E principle.\nThis supports the conclusion that the E principle captures a fundamental\nlimitation of nature. If this is true, much of quantum theory trivially follow\nfrom merely taking the E principle to be a fundamental truth, and various\ninformation-theoretic postulates are also simplified and/or strengthened. \n\n"}

There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently\nwell understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired\nquantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in\nquantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to\ndescribe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems\ngenerally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a\nmicroscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and\nmolecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of\nmany-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding\nof open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body\ncontext.

Motivated by our previous study aiming at the suppression\nof work fluctuations, here we obtain a principle of minimal work fluctuations.\nIn brief, adiabatic processes as treated in quantum and classical adiabatic\ntheorems yield the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\\beta W}$. In the quantum\ndomain, if a system initially prepared at thermal equilibrium is subject to a\nwork protocol but isolated from a bath during the time evolution, then a\nquantum adiabatic process without energy level crossing (or an assisted\nadiabatic process reaching the same final states as in a conventional adiabatic\nprocess) yields the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\\beta W}$, where $W$ is the\nquantum work defined by two energy measurements in the beginning and at the end\nof the process.

Conditions for a measurement to be MPE were\nderived by Yuen, Kennedy and Lax (YKL). MPE measurements have been found for\nstates that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a\ntransitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed\ngeometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good\nmeasurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability\nof error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set\ninvolves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general. Our first\ncontribution is a formula for the MPE and conditional probabilities of GU sets,\nusing group representation theory. Next, we consider sets of pure states that\nhave multiple orbits under the group action. Such states are termed compound\ngeometrically uniform (CGU). MPE measurements for general CGU sets are not\nknown. In this paper, we show how our representation-theoretic description of\noptimal measurements for GU sets naturally generalizes to the CGU case. We show\nhow to compute the MPE measurement for CGU sets by reducing the problem to\nsolving a few simultaneous equations.

Most of the discussion in the last years has been focused on the\ndetermination of the jet quenching parameter, $\\hat q$. We present here an\nextraction of this parameter using data of inclusive particle suppression at\nRHIC and LHC energies for different centralities. Our approach consists of\nfitting a $K$ factor that quantifies the departure of this parameter from an\nideal estimate, $K\\equiv \\hat q/(2\\epsilon^{3/4})$, where $\\hat q$ is\ndetermined by the local medium quantities as provided by hydrodynamical\ncalculations.

This\ndynamical property of open quantum systems assumes an important role in quantum\ninformation theory from both fundamental and practical perspectives.

This\nproperty holds for both continuous dynamical systems as well as for discrete\nones defined in discrete space-time. Possibly the simplest example in the\ndiscrete case is that of a linear quadrilateral lattice equation, which can be\nviewed as a linearised version of the well-known lattice potential Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation. In spite of the linearity, the MDC property is\nnon-trivial in terms of the parameters of the system. The Lagrangian aspects of\nsuch equations, and their nonlinear analogues, has led to the notion of\nLagrangian multiform structures, where the Lagrangians are no longer scalar\nfunctions (or volume forms) but genuine forms in a multidimensional space of\nindependent variables. The variational principle involves variations not only\nwith respect to the field variables, but also with respect to the geometry in\nthe space of independent variables.

Such a scheme could be\nappealing in practice since a single coherent communication system can be used\nfor multiple purposes.

The analysis using paramagnetic systems, only, is improved\nsubstantially by the inclusion of the recent measurement on HfF+ ions, but\ncomplicated by the fact that the corresponding constraints are largely aligned,\nowing to a general relation between the coefficients for the two contributions.\nSince this same relation does not hold in diamagnetic systems, it is possible\nto find atoms that provide essentially orthogonal constraints to those from\npara\\-magnetic ones.

To date, most\njet modification studies have been based on comparing the jet properties\nmeasured in heavy-ion collisions to a proton-proton baseline at the same\nreconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$). We\ndemonstrate that this strategy both provides a complementary way to study jet\nmodification and mitigates the effect of $p_T$ migration in heavy-ion\ncollisions. \n\n"}

In particular: The action of\nthe Sasaki hook $(a\\stackrel{S}{\\to}-)$ for fixed antecedent $a$ assigns to\nsome property ``the weakest cause before the measurement of actuality of that\nproperty after the measurement'', i.e. ${(a\\stackrel{S}{\\to}b)}$ is the weakest\nproperty that guarantees actuality of $b$ after performing the measurement\nrepresented by the projector that has the `subspace $a$' as eigenstates for\neigenvalue 1, say, the measurement that `tests' $a$ .

In an information theoretic approach proposed by us earlier (Quantum\nInformation Processing 2, 153, 2003), which we clarify and elaborate here, QMP\nis understood to signal a fundamental finite resolution of quantum states, or,\nequivalently, a discreteness of Hilbert space.

We write down master equations\nfor both cases and, averaging out the noise, obtain expressions for the heating\nof the ion. We compare our results to previous results for far-off resonance\noptical traps and heating in ion traps. The effect of fluctuating external\nelectrical fields for a quantum gate operation (controlled-NOT) is determined\nand the fidelity for that operation derived. \n\n"}

We also show\nthat a non-uniformity in this gaseous matter distribution leads to an\n(apparent) spatial anisotropy in the blackbody radiation. \n\n"}

The four nuclear spins in each\nmolecule r epresent a four-qubit register. The qubits are ``labeled'' by the\ncharacteristic frequencies, $\\omega_k$, ($k=0$ to 3) due to the Zeeman\ninteraction of the nuclear spins with the magnetic field. The qubits interact\nwith each other through an Ising interaction of strength $J$.
