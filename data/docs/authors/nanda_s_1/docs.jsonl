I demonstrate that\nunder quite natural assumptions about the dynamics of heavy ion collisions this\nleads to a universal (i.e. independent of the initial parton energy, but\ndependent on flavor and centrality) upper bound on the energy of the partons\nescaping from the plasma. This bound is a Yang--Mills analog of the Pomeranchuk\nbound in classical electrodynamics, where it is a consequence of radiation in a\nstrong external field acting on a relativistic charge. Since as a result the\nmassive constituent partons are slowed down to a velocity v < c, the angular\ndistribution of the emitted radiation exhibits a broad \"dead cone\".

This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate\nhydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.\nEvent-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the\nnon-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and\nstring fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional\nideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons\nvia the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation\nwithin UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a\nrealistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic\ntransport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same\ninitial conditions and freeze-out procedure. The effects of the change in the\nunderlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory\n- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are\ninvestigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the\nbaryon density and particle yields are discussed.

In this energy regime the effective break-up cross\nsection for a c-cbar dipole depends on energy and nuclear path length, and\nagrees well with data from fixed target experiments, both in magnitude and\nenergy dependence. At higher energies of RHIC and LHC coherence in c-cbar pair\nproduction leads to charm quark shadowing which is a complement to the high\ntwist break up cross section. These two effects explain well with no adjusted\nparameters the magnitude and rapidity dependence of nuclear suppression of\nJ/Psi observed at RHIC in dAu collisions, while the contribution of leading\ntwist gluon shadowing is found to be vanishingly small.

In addition, the (\\alpha, n_1) channel has been\nmeasured independently by observation of the characteristic 1633 keV\n\\gamma-transition in Ne-20. The reaction cross section was determined with a\nsimultaneous R-matrix fit to both channels.

Analytical solutions of the stationary\nneutron transport equation are given using inelastic neutron scattering cross\nsections derived in an appendix. They neglect any inelastic process except the\nparamagnetic scattering and hence still underestimate very-cold neutron\ndensities. Molecular oxygen with its triplet ground state appears particularly\npromising, notably as a host in fully deuterated oxygen-clathrate hydrate, or\nmore exotically, in dry oxygen-He4 van der Waals clusters. At a neutron\ntemperature about 6 K, for which neutron conversion to ultra-cold neutrons by\nsingle-phonon emission in pure superfluid He4 works best, conversion rates due\nto paramagnetic scattering in the clathrate are found to be a factor 9 larger.\nWhile in conversion the neutron imparts only a single energy quantum to the\nmedium, the multi-step paramagnetic cooling cascade leads to further strong\nenhancements of very-cold neutron densities, e.g., by a factor 14 (57) for an\ninitial neutron temperature of 30 K (100 K), for the moderator held at about\n1.3 K.

This approach yields transition operators that are\nconsistent with the Hamiltonian, and the power counting of the effective theory\nprovides us with theoretical uncertainty estimates.

Jets are collimated sprays of charged and\nneutral particles, which are produced in the fragmentation of hard scattered\npartons in an early stage of the collision. The measurement of jet spectra in\np-Pb collisions provides an important way of quantifying the effects of cold\nnuclear matter in the initial state on jet production, fragmentation, and\nhadronization. Unlike in Pb-Pb collisions, strong hot nuclear matter effects -\ne.g. from quark-gluon plasma formation - are not expected to occur in p-Pb\ncollisions. Hence, cold nuclear matter effects can be investigated in\nisolation. The impact of cold nuclear matter effects on charged jet spectra is\nexpected to depend on the event centrality. Higher event centralities are\nprincipally connected to a higher probability for an interaction of proton and\nlead-nucleus and therefore also for a possible nuclear modification.

These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large\nazimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$. Theoretical models, including hydrodynamic\nmodels, struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large low $p_{T}$ direct\nphoton excess and $v_{2}$ in a self-consistent manner.

This production mechanism will generate photons that\nfollow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$\nvalue of two for direct photons. $\\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published PHENIX\ndirect photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements finds that\n$n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value\n$n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases.

Among them is the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME) -- the generation of electric current along an external\nmagnetic field induced by chirality imbalance. Because the chirality imbalance\nis related to the global topology of gauge fields, the CME current is\ntopologically protected and hence non-dissipative even in the presence of\nstrong interactions. As a result, the CME and related quantum phenomena affect\nthe hydrodynamical and transport behavior of strongly coupled quark-gluon\nplasma, and can be studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions where strong\nmagnetic fields are created by the colliding ions. Evidence for the CME and\nrelated phenomena has been reported by the STAR Collaboration at Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider at BNL, and by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron\nCollider at CERN. The goal of the present review is to provide an elementary\nintroduction into the physics of anomalous chiral effects, to describe the\ncurrent status of experimental studies in heavy ion physics, and to outline the\nfuture work, both in experiment and theory, needed to eliminate the existing\nuncertainties in the interpretation of the data. \n\n"}

Through suitably chosen generators, it is possible to\nextract eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian in a given nucleus, or drive the\nHamiltonian matrix in configuration space to specific structures, e.g., band-\nor block-diagonal form.\n  Exploiting this flexibility, we describe two complementary approaches for the\ndescription of closed- and open-shell nuclei: The first is the Multireference\nIM-SRG (MR-IM-SRG), which is designed for the efficient calculation of nuclear\nground-state properties.

The spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented with\ndoublets, triplets and bidoublet scalars. The fermion sector is extended with\nan extra sterile neutrino per generation that helps in implementing the seesaw\nmechanism. The presence of extra particles in the model exactly cancels type-I\nseesaw and allows large value for Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$. The key\nfeature of this work is that all the physical masses and mixing are expressed\nin terms of neutrino oscillation parameters and lightest neutrino mass thereby\nfacilitating to constrain light neutrino masses from $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay.\nWith this large value of $M_D$ new contributions arise due to; i) purely\nleft-handed current via exchange of heavy right-handed neutrinos as well as\nsterile neutrinos, ii) the so called $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ diagrams. New physics\ncontributions also arise from right-handed currents with right-handed gauge\nboson $W_R$ mass around $3$~TeV.

In this paper, we\nconsider one simple DM model where the DM candidate is a complex scalar and\ninteracts with the SM particles via exchange of the Higgs particle and an extra\nquark, named bottom partner. The extra quark carries the same quantum number as\nthe right-handed down-type quarks and has Yukawa couplings with the DM\ncandidate and the right-handed down-type quarks. The Yukawa interactions are\nnot only relevant to the thermal relic density of the DM, but also contribute\nto the flavor physics, such as the $\\Delta F=2$ processes.

The strange quark mass is tuned to its\nphysical value and we use two strange to light quark mass ratios $m_s/m_l=20$\nand $27$, which in the continuum limit correspond to a pion mass of about $160$\nMeV and $140$ MeV espectively. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion\ncoefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order\nexpansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical\npotentials less then twice the temperature ($\\mu_B\\le 2T$). The fourth-order\nequation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in\nheavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim\n12$ GeV.

Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the\ninfluence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities\n$\\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\\epsilon_n)$, $p(\\epsilon_n,\\epsilon_m)$ and\n$p(N,\\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle\ncumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation\nis established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the\nreference subevent. In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle\nproduction sources is strongly distorted, we find these cumulants exhibit rich\nsign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity in the\nunderlying distributions.

Simultaneous comparison of these different types\ncumulants between model prediction and experimental data can be used to\nconstrain the CF and particle production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.\nSince the concept of centrality and CF are expected to fluctuate in the\nlongitudinal direction within a single event, we propose to use\npseudorapidity-separated subevent cumulant method to explore the nature of\nintra-event fluctuations of centrality and collective dynamics.

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

Method: The $^{27}$S ions were\nimplanted into a double-sided silicon strip detector array surrounded by the\nhigh-purity germanium detectors, where the $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\gamma$\nrays were measured simultaneously. Results: The improved spectroscopic\nproperties including the precise half-life of $^{27}$S, the excitation\nenergies, $\\beta$-decay branching ratios, log~$ft$ values, and $B$(GT) values\nfor the states of $^{27}$P populated in the $\\beta$ decay of $^{27}$S were\nmeasured and compared to the $^{27}$Mg mirror states and the shell-model\ncalculations. The present work has expanded greatly on the previously\nestablished decay scheme of $^{27}$S. Conclusions: The precise\nproton-separation energy of $^{27}$P, the energy and the ratio between $\\gamma$\nand proton partial widths of the $3/2^+$ resonance were obtained, thereby\ndetermining the $^{26}$Si$(p,\\gamma)^{27}$P reaction rate based mainly on\nexperimental constraints. The first evidence for the observation of a large\nisospin asymmetry for the mirror decays of $^{27}$S and $^{27}$Na is also\nprovided. The experimental spectroscopic information can be reproduced by the\nshell-model calculation taking the weakly bound effect of the proton $1s_{1/2}$\norbit into account. \n\n"}

We\nevaluate for the first time the sensitivity (partial derivative) of each solar\nneutrino flux with respect to the surface abundance of each element. We then\ncalculate the uncertainties in each neutrino flux using `conservative\n(preferred)' and `optimistic' estimates for the uncertainties in the element\nabundances. The total conservative (optimistic) composition uncertainty in the\npredicted 8B neutrino flux is 11.6% (5.0%) when sensitivities to individual\nelement abundances are used. The traditional method that lumps all abundances\ninto a single quantity (total heavy element to hydrogen ratio, Z/X) yields a\nlarger uncertainty, 20%.

Allowing for collisions, these oscillations\nare damped on a time-scale, tau_r, determined by the collision frequency.\nPlasma oscillations cannot affect the early stages of the formation of a\nquark-gluon plasma unless tau_r >> tau_pl and tau_pl approx. 1/Lambda_QCD\napprox 1 fm/c. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/9908013", "contents": "Title: Looking For Disoriented Chiral Condensates From Pion Distributions Abstract: We suggest two methods for the detection of the formation of disoriented\nchiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the\nnumber of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a\nsignature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}. The effects of multi-domain D$\\chi$C\nformation and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically\nincorporated. Potential applications to experiments and their limitations are\nbriefly discussed. \n\n"}

Abstract: The directed flow of protons is studied in the quark-gluon string model as a\nfunction of the impact parameter for S+S and Pb+Pb reactions at 160 AGeV/c. A\nsignificant reduction of the directed flow in midrapidity range, which can lead\nto the development of the antiflow, is found due to the absorption of early\nemitted particles by massive spectators (shadowing effect). This effect can\nmimic the formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). However, in the absorption\nscenario the antiflow is stronger for the system of light colliding nuclei than\nfor the heavy ones, while in the case of the plasma creation the effect should\nbe opposite. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0106015", "contents": "Title: Staggering effects in nuclear and molecular spectra Abstract: It is shown that the recently observed Delta J = 2 staggering effect (i.e.\nthe relative displacement of the levels with angular momenta J, J+4, J+8, ...,\nrelatively to the levels with angular momenta J+2, J+6, J+10, ...) seen in\nsuperdeformed nuclear bands is also occurring in certain electronically excited\nrotational bands of diatomic molecules (YD, CrD, CrH, CoH), in which it is\nattributed to interband interactions (bandcrossings). In addition, the Delta J\n= 1 staggering effect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels with even\nangular momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J) is\nstudied in molecular bands free from Delta J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from\ninterband interactions/bandcrossings). Bands of YD offer evidence for the\nabsence of any Delta J = 1 staggering effect due to the disparity of nuclear\nmasses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD demonstrate that Delta J\n= 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational behaviour,\ndue in this particular case to the spin-rotation and spin-spin interactions. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0603231", "contents": "Title: High Voltage Test Apparatus for a Neutron EDM Experiment and Lower Limit\n  on the Dielectric Strength of Liquid Helium at Large Volumes Abstract: A new search for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron is\nunderway using ultracold neutrons produced and held in a bath of superfluid\nhelium. Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}
