The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts.

The shape and orientation of this\ndistribution are particularly interesting, as they provide a snapshot of the\nevolving source and reflect the space-time aspect of anisotropic flow.\nExperimentally, this information is extracted by measuring pion HBT radii as a\nfunction of angle with respect to the reaction plane.

The ground state energy of nuclear\nmatter $\\alpha$ clusters is the same as for nucleons, thus it is degenerate.

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength. \n\n"}

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a\ncoalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the\ngreater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of\npartons from the highly flowing midrapidity region. Intriguingly, purely\nhadronic dynamics has a similar dependence of baryon-anti-baryons $v_2$ as\npurely partonic dynamics, again because antibaryons tend to come from regions\nwhere the deviation of the system from hydrodynamic behavior is at its\nsmallest.

We calculate the two-gluon production cross section while\nincluding all-order saturation effects in the heavy nucleus with the\nlowest-order rescattering in the lighter nucleus.

The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence.

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to\nobtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with\nmasses below 1.6 solar masses. In particular, we find that if the neutron-skin\nthickness of 208Pb falls within the (0.20-0.26) fm range, large enough\ntransition pressures can be generated to explain the large Vela glitches\nwithout invoking an additional angular-momentum reservoir beyond that confined\nto the solid crust.

One of the proposals to upgrade IMS is that the\nvelocity of secondary ions could be directly measured by using two\ntime-of-flight (double TOF) detectors installed in a straight section of a\nstorage ring. In this paper, we outline the principle of IMS with double TOF\ndetectors and the method to correct the momentum spread of stored ions. \n\n"}

One compelling interpretation of the data is that it\ncaptures an $x_p$-dependent decrease in the average interaction strength of the\nnucleon in the projectile undergoing a hard scattering. A weakly interacting or\n\"shrinking\" nucleon in the projectile strikes fewer nucleons in the nucleus,\nresulting in a particular pattern of centrality-dependent modifications to\nhigh-$p_T$ processes. We describe a simple one-parameter geometric\nimplementation of this picture within a modified Monte Carlo Glauber model\ntuned to $d$$+$Au jet data, and explore two of its major consequences. First,\nthe model predicts a particular projectile-species dependence to the centrality\ndependence at high-$x_p$, opposite to that expected from an energy loss effect.\nSecond, we find that some of the large centrality dependence observed for\nforward di-hadron production in $d$$+$Au collisions at RHIC may arise from the\nphysics of the \"shrinking\" projectile nucleon, in addition to impact\nparameter-dependent shadowing or saturation effects at low nuclear-$x$.

Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the\ninfluence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities\n$\\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\\epsilon_n)$, $p(\\epsilon_n,\\epsilon_m)$ and\n$p(N,\\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle\ncumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation\nis established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the\nreference subevent. In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle\nproduction sources is strongly distorted, we find these cumulants exhibit rich\nsign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity in the\nunderlying distributions.

Simultaneous comparison of these different types\ncumulants between model prediction and experimental data can be used to\nconstrain the CF and particle production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.\nSince the concept of centrality and CF are expected to fluctuate in the\nlongitudinal direction within a single event, we propose to use\npseudorapidity-separated subevent cumulant method to explore the nature of\nintra-event fluctuations of centrality and collective dynamics.

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

The\nrapidity-odd directed flow at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions originates\nfrom a tilt in the reaction plane of the thermalized medium caused by the\nasymmetry between the number of participants from projectile and target nuclei\nas a function of rapidity. Recently, it has been predicted that the slope of\nthe directed flow at mid-rapidity for $D^0$ mesons, arising from the transport\nof charm quarks in the tilted medium, can be several times larger than that of\nlight flavor hadrons. The magnitude of the slope is expected to be sensitive to\nthe magnitude of the tilt and the charm quark drag coefficient in the medium.\nIt has also been predicted that the transient electromagnetic field generated\nat early time can induce a much larger directed flow for heavy quarks than for\nlight quarks. In these proceedings, we will report on the first measurement of\nthe directed flow for the $D^0$ and $\\bar{D}^0$ mesons as a function of\nrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using high\nstatistics data collected with the Heavy Flavor Tracker in 2014 and 2016 RHIC\nruns. \n\n"}

Special emphasis is put on its relation to the\nfluctuation of the chiral order parameter $<\\bar{q}q>$. In the vacuum, the\n$\\sigma$-meson is an elusive resonance corresponding to a pole deep in the\nsecond Riemann sheet of the $\\pi$-$\\pi$ scattering matrix in the $I$=$J$=0\nchannel. This is because the the amplitude fluctuation of $<\\bar{q}q>$\n(corresponding to {\\rm ur}-$\\sigma$) and the phase fluctuation of $<\\bar{q}q>$\n(2 pion states) mix strongly in the vacuum. As the temperature and/or density\nof the system increase, however, there arises a softening of this complex pole\ndue to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Such soft modes play a key\nrole to understand the QCD phase structure. We demonstrate that even a slight\nsoftening of the $\\sigma$ mode could induce strong spectral enhancement and\nstrong $\\pi$-$\\pi$ correlation near the 2$m_{\\pi}$ threshold in the $I$=$J$=0\nchannel, which thereby can be a signature of the partial restoration of chiral\nsymmetry.

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/9908013", "contents": "Title: Looking For Disoriented Chiral Condensates From Pion Distributions Abstract: We suggest two methods for the detection of the formation of disoriented\nchiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the\nnumber of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a\nsignature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}. The effects of multi-domain D$\\chi$C\nformation and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically\nincorporated.
