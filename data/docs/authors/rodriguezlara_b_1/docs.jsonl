Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature.

The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based\non physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the\npossibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional\ngate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate\nto what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the\nnumber of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we\nrelate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal\ncomputation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit\noptimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an\nefficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which\nhas monotonic convergence property.

A\nprominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser\ninduces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The\nconcomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can\ngive rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of\nprobe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a\ncomplete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium.\nHere, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally\nequivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved\nsideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the\ncavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical\ndegrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of\nexcitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of\ntransparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met.

The scenario considered corresponds to a pump-probe scheme, in which\nthe first (pump) pulse excites the molecular ion to the first excited\ndissociative state and the second (probe) pulse ionizes the electron as the ion\ndissociates. The results of our numerical simulations for the ionization yield\nas a function of the time delay between the two pulses exhibit characteristic\noscillations due to interferences between the partial electron waves emerging\nfrom the two protons in the dissociating hydrogen molecular ion.

Much of this work has focused on\nachieving strong third-order nonlinearities, such as by using single atoms or\nother quantum emitters while the possibility of achieving strong second-order\nnonlinearities remains unexplored. Here, we describe a novel technique to\nrealize such nonlinearities using graphene, exploiting the strong per-photon\nfields associated with tightly confined graphene plasmons in combination with\nspatially nonlocal nonlinear optical interactions. We show that in properly\ndesigned graphene nanostructures, these conditions enable extremely strong\ninternal down-conversion between a single quantized plasmon and an entangled\nplasmon pair, or the reverse process of second harmonic generation. A separate\nissue is how such strong internal nonlinearities can be observed, given the\nnominally weak coupling between these plasmon resonances and free-space\nradiative fields. On one hand, by using the collective coupling to radiation of\nnanostructure arrays, we show that the internal nonlinearities can manifest\nthemselves as efficient frequency conversion of radiative fields at extremely\nlow input powers.

It is quite well known\nfrom the \"No-Broadcasting theorem\" that perfect broadcasting of quantum\ncorrelation is not possible. However it does not rule out the possibility of\npartial broadcasting of correlations where we can get lesser correlated states\nfrom a given correlated state. In order to have a holistic view of\nbroadcasting, we investigate this problem by starting with most general\nrepresentation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the Bloch vectors. As a\ncloning transformation we have used universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery\n(B-H) cloner both locally and nonlocally. More specifically, we obtain a set of\nranges in terms of Bloch vectors for which broadcasting of entanglement will be\npossible. In addition to the idea of broadcasting of entanglement for general\ntwo qubit mixed states, we explore broadcasting of quantum correlations that go\nbeyond entanglement with the help of both local and nonlocal cloners.\nRemarkably, we find that it is impossible to even partially broadcast such\ncorrelations by using both local and nonlocal quantum copying machines.

We propose a new resolution\nto the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling\nobserver in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the\nhorizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition\n(we call it \"little drama\") which is the \"complementarity dual\" of scrambling\nof information on the stretched horizon. When translated to the description of\nthe black hole interior, this implies that the fine-grained quantum information\nof infalling matter is rapidly diffused across the entire interior while\nclassical observables and coarse-grained geometry remain unaffected.

However, the\nintrinsically probabilistic nature of these sources is a major limitation for\nrealizing large-scale quantum networks. Active feedforward switching of photons\nfrom multiple probabilistic sources is a promising approach that can be used to\nbuild a deterministic source. However, previous implementations of this\napproach that utilize spatial and/or temporal multiplexing suffer from rapidly\nincreasing switching losses when scaled to a large number of modes. Here, we\nbreak this limitation via frequency multiplexing in which the switching losses\nremain fixed irrespective of the number of modes. We use the third-order\nnonlinear process of Bragg scattering four-wave mixing as an efficient\nultra-low noise frequency switch and demonstrate multiplexing of three\nfrequency modes. We achieve a record generation rate of $4.6\\times10^4$\nmultiplexed photons per second with an ultra-low $g^{2}(0)$ = 0.07, indicating\nhigh single-photon purity. Our scalable, all-fiber multiplexing system has a\ntotal loss of just 1.3 dB independent of the number of multiplexed modes, such\nthat the 4.8 dB enhancement from multiplexing three frequency modes markedly\novercomes switching loss.

We demonstrate that steady state formation is a manifestation of\nthe Gibbs phenomenon well-known in signal processing and in truncated discrete\nFourier expansions. Each particle separately develops into an individual steady\nstate due to the spreading of its wave packet in energy. The rise to the steady\nstate for an individual particle depends on the particle energy - and thus can\nbe slow - and ringing oscillations appear due to filtering of the response\nthrough the electronic bandwidth. However, the rise to the total steady state -\nthe one from all particles - is rapid, with timescale $\\pi/W$, where $W$ is the\nbandwidth. Ringing oscillations are now also filtered through the bias window,\nand they decay with a higher power. The Gibbs constant - the overshoot of the\nfirst ring - can appear in the simulation error. These results shed light on\nthe formation of the steady state and support the practical use of explicit\nreservoirs to simulate transport at the nanoscale or using ultracold atomic\nlattices. \n\n"}

For this purpose, we utilize the codes' description\nin terms of stabilizers in order to calculate general efficiencies for the\nloss-free case, but also for specific cases including photon loss. These\nefficiencies can be, for instance, used for obtaining transmission rates of\nall-optical quantum repeaters. In the loss-free case, we demonstrate that the\nimportant class of CSS codes with identical physical-qubit support for the two\nlogical Pauli ($Z$ and $X$) operators can only achieve a logical BM efficiency\nof $\\frac{1}{2}$ if one always employs the same ancilla-free static linear\noptical BMs on the physical level.

If $F$ is one-to-one and the size of its domain and range is the same,\nthen our problem can be formulated as follows: Given an oracle $f(a,x):\n\\{0,1\\}^n\\times\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ and a fixed (but hidden) value $a_0$, we\nwish to obtain the value of $a_0$ by querying the oracle $f(a_0,x)$. Our goal\nis to minimize the number of such oracle calls (the query complexity) using a\nquantum mechanism.\n  Two popular oracles are the EQ-oracle defined as $f(a,x)=1$ iff $x=a$ and the\nIP-oracle defined as $f(a,x)= a\\cdot x \\mod 2$. It is also well-known that the\nquery complexity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ ($N=2^n$) for the EQ-oracle while only\nO(1) for the IP-oracle. The main purpose of this paper is to fill this gap or\nto investigate what causes this large difference. To do so, we introduce a\nparameter $K$ as the maximum number of 1's in a single column of $T_f$ where\n$T_f$ is the $N\\times N$ truth-table of the oracle $f(a,x)$. Our main result\nshows that the (quantum) query complexity is heavily governed by this parameter\n$K$: ($i$) The query complexity is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N/K})$. ($ii$) This lower\nbound is tight in the sense that we can construct an explicit oracle whose\nquery complexity is $O(\\sqrt{N/K})$.

The appearance of such optomechanical instabilities is the\nresult of the nonlinear interplay between the motion of the mirrors and the\noptical field dynamics.

We start by solving the quantum dynamics\nanalytically when the system is initially in a Fock state. We show how the two\nmodes get entangled by evolution to produce a coherent superposition of vortex\nstates in general, and a single vortex state under certain conditions. The\ndegree of entanglement between the modes is measured by finding the explicit\nanalytical dependence of the Von Neumann entropy on the system parameters. The\nreduced state of each mode is analyzed by means of its correlation function and\nspatial coherence function. Remarkably, our analysis is shown to be equally as\nvalid for a variety of initial states that can be prepared from a two-mode Fock\nstate via a unitary transformation and for which the results can be obtained by\nmere inspection of the corresponding results for an initial Fock state.

{"id": "quant-ph/9611025", "contents": "Title: Fault Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Error Abstract: Recently Shor showed how to perform fault tolerant quantum computation when\nthe error probability is logarithmically small. We improve this bound and\ndescribe fault tolerant quantum computation when the error probability is\nsmaller than some constant threshold. The cost is polylogarithmic in time and\nspace, and no measurements are used during the quantum computation. The result\nholds also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To\nachieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting\ncodes. The scheme presented is general, and works with all quantum codes that\nsatisfy some restrictions, namely that the code is ``proper''.\n  We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first example of\nproper quantum codes generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The\nsecond uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code.\nThis class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum\nparticle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''. With our codes, the threshold is about\n10^(-6). Hopefully, this paper motivates a search for proper quantum codes with\nhigher thresholds, at which point quantum computation becomes practical. \n\n"}

An orthomodular lattice of propositions,\ncharacteristic of quantum logic, is constructed for manifolds in Einstein's\ntheory of general relativity. A particle is modelled by a topologically\nnon-trivial 4-manifold with closed timelike curves - a 4-geon, rather than as\nan evolving 3-manifold. It is then possible for both the state preparation and\nmeasurement apparatus to constrain the results of experiments. It is shown that\npropositions about the results of measurements can satisfy a non-distributive\nlogic rather than the Boolean logic of classical systems. Reasonable\nassumptions about the role of the measurement apparatus leads to an\northomodular lattice of propositions characteristic of quantum logic. \n\n"}
