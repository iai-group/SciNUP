The analysis is based primarily on optical spectroscopic datasets\nsecured between 1999 and 2000 from the Bulgarian NAO, Tartu, and Ritter\nObservatories. The temporal behaviour of HD 199478 is characterised by three\nkey empirical properties: (i) systematic central velocity shifts in the\nphotospheric absorption lines, including C II and He I, over a characteristic\ntime-scale of abou 20 days; (ii) extremely strong, variable H alpha emission\nwith no clear modulation signal, and (iii) the occurrence in 2000 of a (rare)\nhigh-velocity absorption (HVA) event in H alpha, which evolved over about 60\ndays, showing the clear signature of mass infall and outflows. In these\nproperties HD 199478 resembles few other late-B SGs with peculiar emission and\nHVAs in H alpha (HD 91619, HD 34085, HD 96919).

In\nthe HRM a quark of one nucleon knocked out by an incoming photon rescatters\nwith a quark of the other nucleon leading to the production of two nucleons\nwith large relative momentum. Assuming the dominance of the quark-interchange\nmechanism in a hard NN scattering, the HRM allows to express the amplitude of a\ntwo-nucleon break-up reaction through the convolution of photon-quark\nscattering, $NN$ hard scattering amplitude and nuclear spectral function. The\nphoton-quark scattering amplitude can be explicitly calculated in the high\nenergy regime, whereas for $NN$ scattering one uses the fit of the available\nexperimental data. The HRM predicts several specific features for the hard\nbreakup reaction. First, the cross section will approximately scale as\n$s^{-11}$. Secondly, the $s^{11}$ weighted cross section will have the shape of\nenergy dependence similar to that of $s^{10}$ weighted $NN$ elastic scattering\ncross section. Also one predicts an enhancement of the $pp$ breakup relative to\nthe $pn$ breakup cross section as compared to the results from low energy\nkinematics. Another result is the prediction of different spectator momentum\ndependencies of $pp$ and $pn$ breakup cross sections. This is due to the fact\nthat same-helicity $pp$-component is strongly suppressed in the ground state\nwave function of $^3$He. Because of this suppression the HRM predicts\nsignificantly different asymmetries for the cross section of polarization\ntransfer $NN$ breakup reactions for circularly polarized photons. For the $pp$\nbreakup this asymmetry is predicted to be zero while for the $pn$ it is close\nto ${2\\over 3}$. \n\n"}

Each radius in the hot flow\nproduces fluctuations, and we further assume that these are damped on the\nviscous frequency. Integrating over radii gives broad band continuum noise\npower between low and high frequency breaks which are set by the viscous\ntimescale at the outer and inner edge of the hot flow, respectively.\nLense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the entire hot flow superimposes the\nlow frequency QPO on this continuum power.\n  We test this model on the power spectra seen in the neutron star systems\n(atolls) as these have the key advantage that the (upper) kHz QPO most likely\nindependently tracks the truncation radius. These show that this model can give\na consistent solution, with the truncation radius decreasing from 20-8 Rg while\nthe inner radius of the flow remains approximately constant at ~4.5 Rg i.e. 9.2\nkm.

Our sample is composed of\n20 z-dropouts, 15 Y-dropouts, and 20 J-dropouts. The surface densities of the\nz-dropouts are close to what predicted by earlier studies, however, those of\nthe Y- and J-dropouts are quite unexpected. While no Y- or J-dropouts have been\nfound at AB < 28.0 mag, their surface densities seem to increase sharply at\nfainter levels. While some of these candidates seem to be close to foreground\ngalaxies and thus could possibly be gravitationally lensed, the overall surface\ndensities after excluding such cases are still much higher than what would be\nexpected if the luminosity function does not evolve from z~7 to 10. Motivated\nby such steep increases, we tentatively propose a set of Schechter function\nparameters to describe the LFs at z~8 and 10. As compared to their counterpart\nat z~7, here L* decreases by ~ 6.5x and Phi* increases by 17--90x. Although\nsuch parameters are not yet demanded by the existing observations, they are\nallowed and seem to agree with the data better than other alternatives. If\nthese LFs are still valid beyond our current detection limit, this would imply\na sudden emergence of a large number of low-luminosity galaxies when looking\nback in time to z~10, which, while seemingly exotic, would naturally fit in the\npicture of the cosmic hydrogen reionization. These early galaxies could easily\naccount for the ionizing photon budget required by the reionization, and they\nwould imply that the global star formation rate density might start from a very\nhigh value at z~10, rapidly reach the minimum at z~7, and start to rise again\ntowards z~6.

{"id": "1001.5172", "contents": "Title: Observing the Structure of the Landscape with the CMB Experiments Abstract: Assuming that inflation happened through a series of tunneling in the string\ntheory landscape, it is argued that one can determine the structure of vacua\nusing precise measurements of the scalar spectral index and tensor\nperturbations at large scales. It is shown that for a vacuum structure where\nthe energy gap between the minima is constant, i.e. $\\epsilon_i=i m_f^4$, one\nobtains the scalar spectral index, $n_s$, to be $\\simeq 0.9687$, for the modes\nthat exit the horizon 60 e-folds before the end of inflation. Alternatively,\nfor a vacuum structure in which the energy gap increases linearly with the\nvacuum index, i.e. $\\epsilon_i=\\frac{i^2}{2} m_f^4$, $n_s$ turns out to be\n$\\simeq 0.9614$. Both these two models are motivated within the string theory\nlandscape using flux-compactification and their predictions for scalar spectral\nindex are compatible with WMAP results. For both these two models, the results\nfor the scalar spectral index turn out to be independent of $m_f$. Nonetheless,\nassuming that inflation started at Planckian energies and that there had been\nsuccessful thermalization at each step, one can constrain $m_f<2.6069\\times\n10^{-5} m_P$ and $m_f<6.5396\\times 10^{-7} m_P$ in these two models,\nrespectively. Violation of the single-field consistency relation between the\ntensor and scalar spectra is another prediction of chain inflation models. This\ncorresponds to having a smaller tensor/scalar ratio at large scales in\ncomparison with the slow-roll counterparts. Similar to slow-roll inflation, it\nis argued that one can reconstruct the vacuum structure using the CMB\nexperiments. \n\n"}

The thus obtained theoretical\ndistributions of type Ia supernova delay times are compared to those that are\nobserved, both in morphological shape and absolute number of events. The\ncritical influence of certain parameters on these distributions is used to\nconstrain their values. The single degenerate scenario alone is found to be\nunable in reproducing the morphological shape of the observational delay time\ndistribution, while use of the double degenerate one (or a combination of both)\ndoes result in fair agreement.

We first\ndevelop the general linear scalar perturbations of the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with arbitrary spatial curvature, and\nfind that an immediate by-product of the setup is that, in all the inflationary\nmodels described by a scalar field, the FRW universe is necessarily flat.\nApplying them to the case of the Minkowski background, we find that it is\nstable, and, similar to the case $\\lambda = 1$, the spin-0 graviton is\neliminated. The vector perturbations vanish identically in the Minkowski\nbackground. Thus, similar to general relativity, a free gravitational field in\nthis setup is completely described by a spin-2 massless graviton even with\n$\\lambda \\not= 1$.

To explain this, we simulate three-dimensional, magnetized\nturbulence, including simplified treatments of non-equilibrium chemistry and\nthe propagation of dissociating radiation, to follow the formation of H_2 from\ncold atomic gas. The formation time scale for H_2 is sufficiently long that\nequilibrium is not reached within the 20-30 Myr lifetimes of molecular clouds.\nThe equilibrium balance between radiative dissociation and H_2 formation on\ndust grains fails to predict the time-dependent molecular fractions we find. A\nsimple, time-dependent model of H_2 formation can reproduce the gross behavior,\nalthough turbulent density perturbations increase molecular fractions by a\nfactor of few above it. In contradiction to equilibrium models, radiative\ndissociation of molecules plays little role in our model for diffuse radiation\nfields with strengths less than ten times that of the solar neighborhood,\nbecause of the effective self-shielding of H_2.

We have\nstudied systematically the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for relaxed\nclusters in the LambdaCDM cosmology using one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations.

A new look at the morphology of nearby\n  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation Abstract: We look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.\nEdge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies\nwith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals with\ndisky isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of\nbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are\ngenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical\ngalaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it\ngives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the\nkinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to\nreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than\nusing classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density\nenvironments [f(SR)<2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR)~4%] of\nthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with\nthe exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR)~20%].

The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma\nrelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as\nmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in\nlow-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local\neffects at the small-group scale.

We find that blazar\nheating produces an inverted temperature-density relation in the IGM and\nnaturally resolves many of the problems present in previous simulations of the\nforest that included photoheating alone. In particular, our simulations with\nblazar heating simultaneously reproduce the observed effective optical depth\nand temperature as a function of redshift, the observed probability\ndistribution functions of the transmitted flux, and the observed flux power\nspectra, over the full redshift range 2<z<3 analysed here. Additionally, by\ndeblending the Lyman-alpha forest into a sum of thermally broadened individual\nlines, we find superb agreement with the observed lower cutoff of the\nline-width distribution and abundances of neutral hydrogen column densities.\nUsing the most recent constraints on the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background,\nthis excellent agreement with observations does not require rescaling the\namplitude of the UV background; a procedure that was routinely used in the past\nto match the observed level of transmitted flux. We also show that our\nblazar-heated model matches the data better than standard simulations even when\nsuch a rescaling is allowed. This concordance between Lyman-alpha data and\nsimulations, which are based on the most recent cosmological parameters,\nsuggests that the inclusion of blazar heating alleviates previous tensions on\nconstraints for sigma_8 derived from Lyman-alpha measurements and other\ncosmological data.

Spectral modeling of correlated multiwavelength data gives the comoving\nmagnetic field strength, the bulk outflow Lorentz factor and the emission\nregion size. Assuming the validity of the SSC model, the Hillas condition shows\nthat only in rare cases can such sources accelerate protons to much above 10^19\neV, so > 10^20 eV ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are likely to be heavy\nions if powered by this type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nSurvival of nuclei is shown to be possible in TeV BL Lacs and misaligned\ncounterparts with weak photohadronic emissions. Another signature of hadronic\nproduction is intergalactic UHECR-induced cascade emission, which is an\nalternative explanation of the TeV spectra of some extreme non-variable blazars\nsuch as 1ES 0229+200 or 1ES 1101-232.

The\nlatter, able to describe lattice QCD thermodynamics, implies a \"chemical\"\nequilibrium ratio between quarks and gluons strongly increasing as\n$T\\rightarrow T_c$, the phase transition temperature.

The quark to gluon\nratio can be modified by about a factor of $\\sim 20$ in the bulk of the system\nand appears to be large also in the high $p_T$ region.\n  We discuss how this aspect, often overflown, can be important for a\nquantitative study of several key issues in the QGP physics: shear viscosity,\njet quenching, quarkonia suppression.

The formation\nof a deformed, oscillating, differentially rotating very massive NS is the\ntypical outcome of the coalescence of two stars with 1.35 $M_{\\odot}$ for most\ncandidate EoSs. The oscillations of this object imprint a pronounced peak in\nthe gravitational-wave (GW) spectra, which is used to characterize the emission\nfor a given model. The peak frequency of this postmerger GW signal correlates\nvery well with the radii of nonrotating NSs, and thus allows to constrain the\nhigh-density EoS by a GW detection. In the case of 1.35-1.35 $M_{\\odot}$\nmergers the peak frequency scales particularly well with the radius of a NS\nwith 1.6 $M_{\\odot}$, where the maximum deviation from this correlation is only\n60 meters for fully microphysical EoSs which are compatible with NS\nobservations.

By means of fully hydrodynamical N-body simulations\nperformed with the code EvoL we produce twelve self-similar models of\nearly-type galaxies of different initial masses and over-densities, following\ntheir evolution from z \\geq 20 down to z \\leq 1. The simulations include\nradiative cooling, star formation, stellar energy feedback, a reionizing\nphotoheating background, and chemical enrichment of the ISM. We find a strong\ncorrelation between the initial properties of the proto-haloes and their star\nformation histories. Massive (10^13M\\odot) haloes experience a single, intense\nburst of star formation (with rates \\geq 10^3M\\odot/yr) at early epochs,\nconsistently with observations, with a less pronounced dependence on the\ninitial over-density; intermediate mass (10^11M\\odot) haloes histories strongly\ndepend on their initial over-density, whereas small (10^9M\\odot) haloes always\nhave fragmented histories, resulting in multiple stellar populations, due to\nthe \"galactic breathing\" phenomenon. The galaxy models have morphological,\nstructural and photometric properties comparable to real galaxies, often\nclosely matching the observed data; even though some disagreement is still\nthere, likely a consequence of some numerical choices.

Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a\ncosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star\nformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9\nM_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing\nand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly\naccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 Gyr\nago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their\ntime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the\nevolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we\nconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of\nsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant\nprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then\nconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'\nquenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall,\nafter which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8\nGyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do\nnot depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent\nfraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a\nlower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible\nfor up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long\ntime delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar\nmass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact\nprovides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method. \n\n"}

Given the age of the system, this\nplanet should have been tidally circularized a long time ago. Many attempts to\nexplain this were proposed in recent years, either involving abnormally weak\ntides, or the perturbing action of a distant companion. We address here the\nlatter issue based on Kozai migration. We propose that GJ 436b was formerly\nlocated further away from the star and that it underwent a migration induced by\na massive, inclined perturber via Kozai mechanism. In this context, the\nperturbations by the companion trigger high amplitude variations to GJ 436b\nthat cause tides to act at periastron. Then the orbit tidally shrinks to reach\nits present day location. We numerically integrate the 3-body system including\ntides and General Relativity correction. We first show that starting from the\npresent-day location of GJ 436b inevitably leads to damping the Kozai\noscillations and to rapidly circularizing the planet. Conversely, starting from\n5-10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak\neccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major axis of the planet. The net\nresult is an evolution characterized by two phases: a first one with Kozai\ncycles and a slowly shrinking semi-major axis, and a second one once the planet\ngets out of the Kozai resonance characterized by a more rapid decrease. The\ntimescale of this process appears in most cases much longer than the standard\ncircularization time of the planet by a factor larger than 50. This model can\nprovide a solution to the eccentricity paradox of GJ 436b. Depending on the\nvarious orbital configurations, it can take several Gyrs to GJ 436b to achieve\na full orbital decrease and circularization. According to this scenario, we\ncould be witnessing today the second phase of the scenario where the semi-major\naxis is already reduced while the eccentricity is still significant. We then\nexplore the parameter space and derive in which conditions this model can be\nrealistic given the age of the system. This yields constraints on the\ncharacteristics of the putative companion. \n\n"}

A gap-opening secondary close to the primary will\nleave an imprint in the broad component of the FeKa emission line, which varies\nin a unique and predictable manner. If the gap persists into the innermost\ndisk, the effect consists of a pair of dips in the broad line which ripple\nblue-ward and red-ward from the line centroid energy respectively, as the gap\nmoves closer to the primary. This ripple effect could be unambiguously\ndetectable and allow an electromagnetic monitoring of massive black hole\nmergers as they occur. As the mass ratio of the secondary to primary black hole\nincreases to q>0.01, we expect the gap to widen, possibly clearing a central\ncavity in the inner disk, which shows up in the broad FeKa line component. If\nthe secondary stalls at >100r_{g} in its in-migration, due to low co-rotating\ngas mass, a detectable ripple effect occurs in the broad line component on the\ndisk viscous timescale as the inner disk drains and the outer disk is dammed.\nIf the secondary maintains an accretion disk within a central cavity, due to\ndam bursting or leakage, a periodic 'see-saw' oscillation effect is exhibited\nin the observed line profile. Here we demonstrate the range of ripple effect\nsignatures potentially detectable with Astro-H and IXO/Athena, and oscillation\neffects potentially detectable with XMM or LOFT for a wide variety of merger\nand disk conditions. Observations of the ripple effect and periodic\noscillations can be used to provide an early warning of gravitational radiation\nemission from the AGN. \n\n"}

Over the last six years, the IceCube Observatory has\ncollected 150 billion cosmic ray induced muon events. This large data sample\nmade it possible to detect anisotropies in the southern hemisphere, down to the\n10$^{-5}$ level, at primary energies in excess of 10 TeV.

We demonstrate how these\ncouplings can be determined by future Delta F=2 and b->s mu^+ mu^- observables.\nThe correlations between various observables can test these NP scenarios. We\npresent the results as functions of Delta M_q/Delta M_q^SM, S_{psi phi} and\nS_{psi K_S} which should be precisely determined in this decade. We calculate\nthe violation of the CMFV relation between BR(B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^-) and Delta\nM_{s,d} in these scenarios. We find that the data on B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- from\nCMS and LHCb can be reproduced in both scenarios but in the case of Z, Delta\nM_s and S_{psi phi} have to be very close to their SM values. As far as\nB_d->K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies are concerned the Z' scenario can significantly\nsoften these anomalies while the Z boson fails because of the small vector\ncoupling to muons. We also point out that recent proposals of explaining these\nanomalies with the help of a real Wilson coefficient C^NP_9 implies uniquely an\nenhancement of Delta M_s with respect to its SM value, while a complex C^NP_9\nallows for both enhancement and suppression of Delta M_s and simultaneously\nnovel CP-violating effects. We also discuss briefly scenarios in which the Z'\nboson has RH FCNC couplings. In this context we point out a number of\ncorrelations between angular observables measured in B_d->K^*mu^+ mu^- that\narise in the absence of new CP-violating phases in scenarios with only LH or RH\ncouplings or scenarios in which LH and RH couplings are equal to each other or\ndiffer by sign. \n\n"}

No anti-correlation in Na-O abundances is present, and\nwe find a strong positive Mg-Al relationship, similar to that observed in the\nthick disk.

Often they show\ncoordinated variability at different frequencies, suggesting that in these\ncases the same population of electrons is at work, in a single zone of the jet.\nThe location of this region along the jet is a matter of debate. The jet power\ncorrelates with the mass accretion rate, with jets existing at all values of\ndisk luminosities, measured in Eddington units, sampled so far. The most\npowerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this\nhas revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by\nmodelling a disk spectrum to the data. Being so luminous, blazars can be\ndetected also at very high redshift, and therefore are a useful tool to explore\nthe far universe. One interesting line of research concerns how heavy are their\nblack holes at high redshifts. If we associate the presence of a relativistic\njet with a fastly spinning black hole, then we naively expect that the\naccretion efficiency is larger than for non-spinning holes. As a consequence,\nthe black hole mass in jetted systems should grow at a slower rate. In turn,\nthis would imply that, at high redshifts, the heaviest black holes should be in\nradio-quiet quasars.

As these systems are expected to be\nCompton-thick, photons above 13.6 eV are largely absorbed and re-processed into\nlower energy bands. It follows that direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are\nvery bright in the LW/NIR bands, typically outshining small high-redshift\ngalaxies by more than 10 times. Once the first DCBHs form, they then trigger a\nrunaway process of further DCBH formation, producing a sudden rise in their\ncosmic mass density. The universe enters the \"DCBH era\" at $z \\approx 20$ when\na large fraction of atomic-cooling halos are experiencing DCBH formation.

The mechanism is based on the production of vector quanta from a\nrolling pseudo-scalar field. Both the vector and the pseudo-scalar are only\ngravitationally coupled to the inflaton, to keep the production of inflaton\nquanta at an unobservable level (the overproduction of non-gaussian scalar\nperturbations is a generic difficulty for mechanisms that aim to generate a\nvisible GW signal from particle production during inflation).

Adopting a coplanar analog of Kepler-16 as an example, we\nfind that circumbinary planets can transit the same star more than once during\na single planetary orbit, a phenomenon we call \"tight transits\". In certain\ngeometric, the projected orbital velocity of the planet and the secondary star\ncan approach zero and change sign, resulting in very long transits and/or 2-3\ntransits during a single binary orbit. Whether tight transits are possible for\na particular system depends primarily on the binary mass ratio and the orbital\narchitecture of both the binary and the planet. We derive a time-dependent\ncriterion to judge when tight transits are possible for any circumbinary\nsystem. These results are verified with full dynamical integrations that also\nreveal other tight transit characteristics, i.e., the transit durations and the\nintervals between tight transits. For the seven currently known circumbinary\nsystems, we estimate these critical parameters both analytically and\nnumerically. Due to the mutual inclination between the planet and the binary,\ntight transits can only occur across the less massive star B in Kepler-16, -34,\n-35, and -47 (for both planets). The long-term average frequency of tight\ntransits (compared to typical transits) for Kepler-16, -34, and -35 are\nestimated to be several percent. Using full numerical integrations, the next\ntight transit for each system is predicted and the soonest example appears to\nbe Kepler-47b and -47c, which are likely to have tight transits before 2025.\nThese unique and valuable events often deserve special observational scrutiny. \n\n"}

Our analysis utilizes Jeans\nequations to generate two-dimensional acceleration maps throughout the volume;\nthis approach is thoroughly tested on a cosmologically derived N-body+SPH\nsimulation of a MW-like galaxy. We show that the known accelerations (gradients\nof the gravitational potential) can be successfully recovered in such a\nrealistic system. Leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential derived by\nBovy & Rix (2013), we show that the gravitational potential implied by the SDSS\nobservations cannot be explained, assuming Newtonian gravity, by visible matter\nalone: the gravitational force experienced by stars at galactocentric distances\nof 20 kpc is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed to\npurely visible matter. We also show that the SDSS data provide a strong\nconstraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential. Within\ngalactocentric distances of 20 kpc, the dark matter halo potential is well\ndescribed as an oblate halo with axis ratio qDM=0.7+/-0.1; this corresponds to\nan axis ratio qDM=0.4+/-0.1 for the dark matter density distribution. Because\nof our precise two-dimensional measurements of the acceleration of the halo\nstars, we can reject several MOND models as an explanation of the observed\nbehavior. \n\n"}

After removing residual dipoles and\ngalactic foregrounds, the residual difference maps exhibit a quadrupole and\nother large-scale systematic structure.

SID corresponds to the deep MOdified Newtonian\nDynamics (MOND) limit. The MDA data emerging in cold/warm dark matter (C/WDM)\ncosmological simulations disagree significantly with the tight MDA correlation\nof the observed galaxies. Therefore, the most modern simulated disc galaxies,\nwhich are delicately selected to have a quiet merging history in a standard\ndark-matter-cosmological model, still do not represent the correct rotation\ncurves. Also, the observed tight correlation contradicts the postulated\nstochastic formation of galaxies in low-mass DM halos. Moreover, we find that\nSID predicts a baryonic to apparent virial halo (dark matter) mass relation\nwhich agrees well with the correlation deduced observationally assuming\nNewtonian dynamics to be valid, while the baryonic to halo mass relation\npredicted from CDM models does not.

In earlier work, it has been\nsuggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the\nmagnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines\nanchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles\nand produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity\nAGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation\nbetween the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$\norders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but\nalso their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast\nreconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the\ncore region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model\nis able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the\nother hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend\nas that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray\nemission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another\npopulation of relativistic particles, as expected. \n\n"}

The observed cores of clusters (and groups) show instead a strong\ndeficit of soft X-ray emission: $dL_{\\rm x}/dT \\propto (T/T_{\\rm\nhot})^{\\alpha=2\\pm1}$. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such\ndeficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability\ncondensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN\noutflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The\nresultant average distribution slope is $\\alpha \\simeq 2$, oscillating within\nthe observed $1<\\alpha<3$. In the absence of thermal instability, the X-ray\nspectrum remains isothermal ($\\alpha > 8$), while unopposed cooling drives a\ntoo shallow slope, $\\alpha<1$.

The decrease is larger in the\nmore peripheral collisions.

Part I Abstract: In the early seventies, Alan Sandage defined cosmology as the search for two\nnumbers: Hubble parameter ${{H}_{0}}$ and deceleration parameter ${{q}_{0}}$.\nThe first of the two basic cosmological parameters (the Hubble parameter)\ndescribes the linear part of the time dependence of the scale factor. Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

However, these methods are\nknown to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late\ntimes, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC\ncan indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are\nmade. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small. The second modification is the introduction\nof a particle remapping procedure that periodically re-expresses the dark\nmatter distribution function using a new set of particles. We describe a\nremapping algorithm that is third-order accurate and adaptive in phase space.\nThis procedure prevents the accumulation of numerical errors in integrating the\nparticle trajectories from growing large enough to significantly degrade the\nsolution. Once both of these changes are made, PIC converges at second order on\nthe Zel'dovich Pancake problem, even at late times, after many caustics have\nformed. Furthermore, the resulting scheme does not suffer from the unphysical,\nsmall-scale \"clumping\" phenomenon known to occur on the Pancake problem when\nthe perturbation wave vector is not aligned with one of the Cartesian\ncoordinate axes. \n\n"}

Interest in this has been rekindled by recent studies in non-linear\nrelativistic perturbation theory that find biases in both the area of a surface\nof constant redshift and in the mean distance to this surface, with a\nfractional bias in both cases on the order of the mean squared convergence\n$\\langle \\kappa^2 \\rangle$. Any such area bias could alter CMB cosmology, and\nthe corresponding bias in mean flux density could affect supernova cosmology.\nHere we show that, in an ensemble averaged sense, the perturbation to the area\nof a surface of constant redshift is in reality much smaller, being on the\norder of the cumulative bending angle squared, or roughly a part-in-a-million\neffect. This validates the arguments of Weinberg (1976) that the mean\nmagnification $\\mu$ of sources is unity and of Kibble \\& Lieu (2005) that the\nmean direction-averaged inverse magnification is unity. It also validates the\nconventional treatment of lensing in analysis of CMB anisotropies.

By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants\nat 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4\nsigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino\nspectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six\noscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\\%. Neutrino burst from a\ntypical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000\ninverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic\nscattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information\non the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino\nenergy spectrum.

Our models start\neither tidally filling or underfilling, and either with or without primordial\nmass segregation.

In\nparticular, we address its subtle issues as well. Unlike the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard model (MSSM), the Next to MSSM (NMSSM) can be scale\ninvariant and has no mass parameter in its Lagrangian before SUSY and gauge\nsymmetry breakings. Therefore, the NMSSM is a perfect framework for\nsuper-natural SUSY. To give the SUSY breaking soft mass to the singlet, we\nconsider the moduli and dilaton dominant SUSY breaking scenarios in M-theory on\n$S^1/Z_2$. In these scenarios, SUSY is broken by one and only one $F$-term of\nmoduli or dilaton, and the SUSY breaking soft terms can be determined via the\nK\\\"ahler potential and superpotential from Calabi-Yau compactification of\nM-theory on $S^1/Z_2$. Thus, as predicted by super-natural SUSY, the SUSY\nelectroweak fine-tuning measure is of unity order. In the moduli dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the right-handed sleptons are relatively light around 1 TeV,\nstau can be even as light as 580 GeV and degenerate with the lightest\nneutralino, chargino masses are larger than 1 TeV, the light stop masses are\naround 2 TeV or larger, the first two-generation squark masses are about 3 TeV\nor larger, and gluinos are heavier than squarks.

For instance, if the Fermi-LAT Galactic centre GeV gamma-ray excess\nwas due to WIMP annihilation, its morphology would be incompatible with the\nStandard Halo Model that is usually used to interpret data from direct\ndetection experiments.

Methods: Using high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise UVES\nspectra of nine solar twins, we obtained precise estimates of stellar ages and\nchemical abundances. These determinations have been integrated with additional\naccurate age and abundance determinations from recent spectroscopic studies of\nsolar twins existing in the literature, comprising superb abundances with\n0.01~dex precision.

The $\\alpha$-elements are characterised by a [X/Fe]\ndecrement as time goes on. Strikingly, an opposite behaviour is observed for\nCa.

The multi-band radio observations carry such valuable information. In\nthis paper, we study two bright pulsars, (PSRs B0329+54 and B1642-03) and\nobserve them in high frequency (2.5 GHz, 5 GHz, and 8 GHz). The newly acquired\ndata together with historical archive provide an atlas of multi-frequency\nprofiles spanning from 100 MHz to 10 GHz. We study the frequency evolution of\npulse profiles and the radiation regions with the these data. We firstly fit\nthe pulse profiles with Gaussian functions to determine the phase of each\ncomponent, and then calculate the radiation altitudes of different emission\ncomponents and the radiation regions. We find that the inverse Compton\nscattering (ICS) model can reproduce the radiation geometry of these two\npulsars. But for PSR B0329+54 the radiation can be generated in either annular\ngap (AG) or core gap (CG), while the radiation of PSR B1642-03 can only be\ngenerated in the CG. This difference is caused by the inclination angle and the\nimpact angle of these two pulsars. The relation of beaming angle (the angle\nbetween the radiation direction and the magnetic axis) and the radiation\naltitudes versus frequency is also presented by modelling the beam-frequency\nevolution in the ICS model. The multi-band pulse profiles of these two pulsars\ncan be described well by the ICS model combined with the CG and AG. \n\n"}

Various physical variables have different\ncorrelation lengths in the warm phase: $40 pc$, $50 pc$, and $60 pc$ for random\nmagnetic field, density, and velocity, respectively, in the midplane. The\ncorrelation time of the random velocity is comparable to the eddy turnover\ntime, about $10^7 yr$, although it may be shorter in regions with higher star\nformation rate. The random magnetic field is anisotropic, with the standard\ndeviations of its components $b_x/b_y/b_z$ having approximate ratios\n$0.5/0.6/0.6$ in the midplane. The anisotropy is attributed to the global\nvelocity shear from galactic differential rotation, and locally inhomogeneous\noutflow to the galactic halo.

We present a photometric survey of PNe in the galaxy's\nextended halo to characterise its PN population, as well as the surrounding\nintragroup light (IGL) of the Subcluster B.

We\nidentify 738 PNe out to a radius of 155 kpc from M49's centre from which we\ndefine a complete sample of 624 PNe within a limiting magnitude of m_5007=28.8.\nComparing the PN number density to the broad-band stellar surface brightness\nprofile, we find a variation of the PN-specific frequency (alpha-parameter)\nwith radius. The outer halo beyond 60 kpc has a 3.2 times higher\nalpha-parameter compared to the main galaxy halo, which is likely due to\ncontribution from the surrounding blue IGL. We use the Planetary Nebulae\nLuminosity Function (PNLF) as an indicator of distance and stellar population.\nIts slope, which correlates empirically with galaxy type, varies within the\ninner halo. In the eastern quadrant of M49, the PNLF slope is shallower,\nindicating an additional localised, bright PN population following an accretion\nevent, likely that of the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC1249.

This is especially true for massive stars, which\nare important for the chemical enrichment of the universe. It is therefore\nimportant to constrain their physical parameters and internal angular momentum\ndistribution to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar\ninternal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally\nsplit oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars\nmore massive than the Sun.

This is because the model itself\ncontains additional new particles that may serve as Dark Matter (DM)\ncandidates. These particles interact with the Standard Model via a scalar\nmediator boson $S$. More interesting still, the conjectured mass range for the\nDM candidate ($65$ - $100$ GeV) lies within the region of models viable to try\nexplain the recent Galactic Centre (GC) gamma-ray excess seen by Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS).\nTherefore, assuming $S$ decays promptly, it should be possible to check what\nconstraints are imposed upon the effective DM annihilation cross-section in the\nMadala scenario by hunting signatures of $S$ decay that follows DM annihilation\nwithin dense astrophysical structures. In order to make use of existing data,\nwe use the Reticulum II dwarf galaxy and the galactic centre gamma-ray excess\ndata sets from Fermi-LAT, and compare these to the consequences of various\ndecay paths for $S$ in the aforementioned environments.

It weakens the overall sensitivity by\nup to a factor of 3 and 1.5 for $w$ and $\\Omega_m$, respectively, with the\nbispectrum worst affected. However, combining geometry and growth information\nalleviates the degeneracy between $\\Omega_m$ and $w$ from either effect alone.\nAs a result, the magnitude of marginalized errors remain similar to those\nobtained from growth-only effects, but with the correlation between the two\nparameters switching sign.

We perform numerical simulations of\ncollapsing clouds of $1000 M_\\odot$ for various gas equation of state (eos),\npaying great attention to the numerical resolution and convergence. The initial\nconditions of these numerical experiments are varied in the companion paper. We\nalso develop analytical models that we confront to our numerical results. If an\nisothermal eos is used, we show that the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses\nwith improved numerical resolution. When an adiabatic eos is employed,\nnumerical convergence is obtained. The peak position varies with the eos and we\nfind that the peak position is about ten times the mass of the first Larson\ncore. By analyzing the stability of non-linear density fluctuations in the\nvicinity of a point mass and then summing over a reasonable density\ndistribution, we find that tidal forces exert a strong stabilizing effect and\nlikely lead to a preferential mass several times larger than that of the first\nLarson core.

Bright QSOs are known to ionize their\nsurrounding neighborhood, but they are too few to ensure the required HI\nionizing background. A significant contribution by faint AGNs, however, could\nsolve the problem, as recently advocated on the basis of a relatively large\nspace density of faint active nuclei at z>4. We have carried out an exploratory\nspectroscopic program to measure the HI ionizing emission of 16 faint AGNs\nspanning a broad U-I color interval, with I~21-23 and 3.6<z<4.2. These AGNs are\nthree magnitudes fainter than the typical SDSS QSOs (M1450<~-26) which are\nknown to ionize their surrounding IGM at z>~4. The LyC escape fraction has been\ndetected with S/N ratio of ~10-120 and is between 44 and 100% for all the\nobserved faint AGNs, with a mean value of 74% at 3.6<z<4.2 and\n-25.1<M1450<-23.3, in agreement with the value found in the literature for much\nbrighter QSOs (M1450<~-26) at the same redshifts. The LyC escape fraction of\nour faint AGNs does not show any dependence on the absolute luminosities or on\nthe observed U-I colors. Assuming that the LyC escape fraction remains close to\n~75% down to M1450~-18, we find that the AGN population can provide between 16\nand 73% (depending on the adopted luminosity function) of the whole ionizing UV\nbackground at z~4, measured through the Lyman forest. This contribution\nincreases to 25-100% if other determinations of the ionizing UV background are\nadopted. Extrapolating these results to z~5-7, there are possible indications\nthat bright QSOs and faint AGNs can provide a significant contribution to the\nreionization of the Universe, if their space density is high at M1450~-23. \n\n"}

A detection of this signature provides compelling evidence for a\nsignificantly neutral Universe, and enables measurements of the hydrogen\nneutral fraction $x_{\\rm HI}(z)$ at that epoch.

We find that the\nCOBE constraint becomes more stringent in comparison with that using only the\nangular power spectrum, if the likelihood is marginalized over the orientation\nof the observer. For some limited choices of orientations, the fit to the COBE\ndata is considerably better than that of the infinite counterpart. The best-fit\nmatter normalization is increased because of large-angle suppression in the\npower and the global anisotropy of the temperature fluctuations.

The amount of uncorrelated\nnoise between the two polarization senses is limited to the quantum limit of\nthermal and photon shot noise, while drifts in the relative responsivity to\northogonal polarizations are limited to the effect of non-uniformity in the\nthin film deposition of the leads and the intrinsic thermistor properties.\nDevices using NTD Ge thermistors have achieved NEPs of 2 x 10^{-17} W/sqrt{Hz}\nwith a 1/f knee below 100 mHz at a base temperature of 270 mK.

On the whole, the models reproduce the properties of\npresent-day spirals (such as SFRs, SFHs, scale sizes, metallicities, and gas\nfractions) rather well. In particular, we find that once the effects of dust\nand variations in stellar populations have been taken into account, published\nspiral galaxy scale-size distributions derived from optical data (with\nlogarithmic widths ~0.3) can be reconciled with the width of the stellar mass\nscale-size distribution predicted by the semi-analytic model (~0.5). There are\nsome illuminating discrepancies between the observations and the model\npredictions. The model colours of luminous spiral galaxies are somewhat too\nblue and those of faint galaxies somewhat too red, most likely indicating\nshortcomings in the way that gas is accreted by spiral galaxies.

Using several existing models for the clumping of ionized gas,\nwe find that the expected free-free distortion to the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) blackbody spectrum is at a level detectable with upcoming\nexperiments such as the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and\nDiffuse Emission (ARCADE). However, the dominant contribution to the distortion\ncomes from clumpy gas at z < 3, and the integrated signal does not strongly\nconstrain the epoch of reionization.

The grain model of this code has recently undergone a comprehensive\nupgrade. Part of this is the newly developed hybrid grain charge model, which\nwill be described in detail. This model allows discrete charge states of very\nsmall grains to be modelled accurately while simultaneously avoiding the\noverhead of fully resolving the charge distribution of large grains, thus\nmaking the model both accurate and computationally efficient.

Using\nanalytical models and numerically simulated clusters, we explore the key\nfactors involved in using cluster arcs as a probe of dark energy. We quantify\nthe sensitivity to lens mass, concentration and ellipticity with analytical\nmodels that include the effects of dark energy on halo structure. We show with\nsimple examples how degeneracies between mass models and cosmography may be\nbroken using arcs at multiple redshifts or additional constraints on the lens\ndensity profile.

Isothermal models have previously shown an\ninitial decline in the mass accretion rate \\dot{M}, due to a gradient of infall\nspeed that develops in the prestellar phase. Our results show that: (1) in the\nidealized limit of optically thin cooling, a positive temperature gradient is\npresent in the prestellar phase which effectively cancels out the effect of the\nvelocity gradient, producing a near constant \\dot{M} in the early accretion\nphase; (2) in the more realistic case including cooling saturation at higher\ndensities, \\dot{M} may initially be either weakly increasing or weakly\ndecreasing with time, for low (T_d ~ 6 K) and high dust temperature (T_d ~ 10\nK) cases, respectively.

This is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the inner disc\n(bar), and is absorbed by near-resonant material in the outer disc and in the\nhalo. As a result of this, the bar becomes stronger and rotates slower. Bulges\nare not a homogeneous class of objects. Based on their formation history, one\ncan distinguish three types. Classical bulges are mainly formed before the\nactual disc component, from collapses or mergers and the corresponding\ndissipative processes.

We propose a new statistical\napproach to examine the dependence of time delays on the complexity of lens\npotentials, such as higher-order perturbations, non-isothermality, and\nsubstructures. Specifically, we introduce a reduced time delay and explore its\nbehavior as a function of the image configuration that is characterized by the\nasymmetry and opening angle of the image pair. In particular we derive a\nrealistic conditional probability distribution. We find that the probability\ndistribution is sensitive to the image configuration such that more asymmetric\nand/or smaller opening angle image pairs are more easily affected by\nperturbations on the primary lens potential. On average time delays of double\nlenses are less scattered than those of quadruple lenses.

The H I surface mass density decreases with increasing positive tidal\nindex, which is expected in strong tidal encounters. There are no strong trends\nbetween oxygen abundances or yields and projected distances of galaxies within\ntheir respective groups.

For DDO 47,\nthe [O III]4363 oxygen abundance (7.92 +/- 0.06) for the H II region SHK91 No.\n18 agrees with recently published values. For Sextans B, the [O III]4363 oxygen\nabundance (7.80 +/- 0.13) for H II region SHK91 No. 5 agrees with published\nwork in which O^+ abundances were determined entirely from [O II]7320,7330\nfluxes. \n\n"}

I emphasize the importance of using the Sun as an astrophysical\nlaboratory in studying these physical processes, especially the roles magnetic\nfields play in them; it is quite likely that magnetic activities dominate the\nfundamental physical processes in all of these systems.\n  As a case study, I show that X-ray lightcurves from solar flares, black hole\nbinaries and gamma-ray bursts exhibit a common scaling law of non-linear\ndynamical properties, over a dynamical range of several orders of magnitudes in\nintensities, implying that many basic X-ray emission nodes or elements are\ninter-connected over multi-scales.

We\nuse an extensively-tested analytic model for subhalo infall and evolution and\nempirical constraints from galaxy survey data to set the stellar mass in each\naccreted subhalo to model diffuse light. We add stellar mass to the diffuse\nlight as subhalos become disrupted due to interactions within their host halos.\nWe predict that the stellar mass fraction in diffuse, intrahalo light should\nrise on average from ~0.5% to approximately 20% from small galaxy halos to poor\ngroups. The trend with mass flattens considerably beyond the group scale,\nincreasing weakly from a fraction of ~20% in poor galaxy clusters (~10^14\nM_sun) to roughly ~30% in massive clusters (~10^15 M_sun). The mass-dependent\ndiffuse light fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that the\nmass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass.\nGalaxy halos have little diffuse light because they accrete most of their mass\nin small subhalos that themselves have high mass-to-light ratios; stellar halos\naround galaxies are built primarily from disrupted dwarf-irregular-type\ngalaxies with M*~10^8.5 M_sun. The diffuse light in group and cluster halos is\nbuilt from satellite galaxies that form stars efficiently and have\ncorrespondingly low mass-to-light ratios; intracluster light is dominated by\nmaterial liberated from massive galaxies with M*~10^11 M_sun. Our results are\nconsistent with existing observations spanning the galaxy, group, and cluster\nscale; however, they can be tested more rigorously in future deep surveys for\nfaint diffuse light. \n\n"}

The study is carried out using samples of haloes at different\ndistances from their nearest massive {\\em cluster} halo. We find that the\nfraction of haloes with substructure typically increases in high density\nregions. The halo mean axial ratio $<c/a>$ also increases in overdense regions,\na fact which is true for the whole range of halo mass studied. This can be\nexplained as a reflection of an earlier halo formation time in high-density\nregions, which gives haloes more time to evolve and become more spherical.\nMoreover, this interpretation is supported by the fact that, at a given\nhalo-cluster distance, haloes with substructure are more elongated than their\nequal mass counterparts with no substructure, reflecting that the virialization\n(and thus sphericalization) process is interrupted by merger events. The\nvelocity dispersion of low mass haloes with strong substructure shows a\nsignificant increase near massive clusters with respect to equal mass haloes\nwith low-levels of substructure or with haloes found in low-density\nenvironments.

Such research is of direct\nrelevance to gravitational-wave sources for space-based detectors (such as\nLISA). We present here a study of the radiative evolution of circular (i.e.,\nconstant Boyer-Lindquist coordinate radius), non-equatorial Kerr black hole\norbits. Recent theorems have shown that, at least in an adiabatic evolution,\nsuch orbits evolve from one circular configuration into another, changing only\ntheir radius and inclination angle. This constrains the system's evolution in\nsuch a way that the change in its Carter constant can be deduced from knowledge\nof gravitational wave fluxes propagating to infinity and down the black hole's\nhorizon. Thus, in this particular case, a local radiation reaction force is not\nneeded. In accordance with post-Newtonian weak-field predictions, we find that\ninclined orbits radiatively evolve to larger inclination angles (although the\npost-Newtonian prediction overestimates the rate of this evolution in the\nstrong field by a factor $\\lesssim 3$). We also find that the gravitational\nwaveforms emitted by these orbits are rather complicated, particularly when the\nhole is rapidly spinning, as the radiation is influenced by many harmonics of\nthe orbital frequencies. \n\n"}

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/9908013", "contents": "Title: Looking For Disoriented Chiral Condensates From Pion Distributions Abstract: We suggest two methods for the detection of the formation of disoriented\nchiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the\nnumber of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a\nsignature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}.
