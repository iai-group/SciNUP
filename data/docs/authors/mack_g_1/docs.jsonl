From an observational point of view\nthis may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common\nstars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations\nof an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due\nto dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars\nmay populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass\nthe stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if\none is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a\ntelescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by\ntheir luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical\nevolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the\ndynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,\nNBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters\nfrom this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library.

The flares were sometimes intense, had rapid rise and\ndecay phases, and occurred late relative to the ``prompt'' phase. Some\nremarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB\nfluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short,\nintense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the\ncontext of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the\nprompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for\nflares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the\nflare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. In this\nwork, we have analyzed all significant X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs\nobserved by Swift. From this sample 33 GRBs were found to have significant\nX-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3$\\sigma$ level. In\naddition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety of\nspectral models have been fit to each flare.

The microscopic equations of motion for\nstrings in this background include potential and friction terms, which attract\nthe strings towards the bottom of the warping throat. However, by considering\nthe resulting macroscopic equations for the velocities of strings in the\nvicinity of the throat, we note the absence of enough classical damping to\nguarantee that the strings actually reach the warped minimum and stabilise\nthere. Instead, our classical analysis supports a picture in which the strings\nexperience mere deflections and bounces around the tip, rather than strongly\ndamped oscillations. Indeed, 4D Hubble friction is inefficient in the internal\ndimensions and there is no other classical mechanism known, which could provide\nefficient damping.

The multi-field DBI-inflation is shown to be a\nspecial case where both sound speeds are the same due to a special form of the\nkinetic term. We derive the exact second and third order actions including\nmetric perturbations. In the small sound speed limit and at leading order in\nthe slow-roll expansion, we derive the three point function for the curvature\nperturbation which depends on both adiabatic and entropy perturbations. The\ncontribution from the entropy perturbations has a different momentum dependence\nif the sound speed for the entropy perturbations is different from the\nadiabatic one, which provides a possibility to distinguish the multi-field\nmodels from single field models. On the other hand, in the multi-field DBI\ncase, the contribution from the entropy perturbations has the same momentum\ndependence as the pure adiabatic contributions and it only changes the\namplitude of the three point function.

This feature has previously been\ninterpreted as an indirect signature of rapid photo-heating in the IGM during\nthe epoch of HeII reionisation. We examine this interpretation using a\nsemi-analytic model of inhomogeneous HeII reionisation and high resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations of the Lya forest. We instead find that a rapid\n(\\Delta z ~ 0.2) boost to the IGM temperature (\\Delta T ~ 10^4 K) beginning at\nz=3.4 produces a well understood and generic evolution in the Lya effective\noptical depth, where a sudden reduction in the opacity is followed by a\ngradual, monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the low\ndensity IGM. This behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow feature in the\nobservational data. If photo-heating during HeII reionisation is instead\nextended over several redshift units, as recent theoretical studies suggest,\nthen the Lya opacity will evolve smoothly with redshift. We conclude that the\nsharp dip observed in the Lya forest effective optical depth is instead most\nlikely due to a narrow peak in the hydrogen photo-ionisation rate around z=3.2,\nand suggest that it may arise from the modulation of either reprocessed\nradiation during HeII reionisation, or the opacity of Lyman limit systems. \n\n"}

The intention was\nto find out whether it would be possible to conduct a large-scale survey for\nmass-loss rates using, for example, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).\nSuch a survey would increase our understanding of the evolution of the Galactic\nbulge.\n  Methods: Two millimetre-wave instruments were used: the Nobeyama Millimeter\nArray at 115 GHz and the Submillimeter Array at 230 GHz. An interferometer is\nnecessary as a `spatial filter' in this region of space because of the\nconfusion with interstellar CO emission.\n  Results: Towards two of the stars, CO emission was detected with positions\nand radial velocities coinciding within the statistical errors with the\ncorresponding data of the associated OH sources.

Weak lensing\nobservables are sensitive to both the distance-redshift relation and the growth\nof structure in the Universe. If the cause of accelerated cosmic expansion is\ndark energy within general relativity (GR), both cosmic distances and structure\ngrowth are governed by the properties of dark energy. Consequently, one may use\nlensing to check for this consistency and test GR. After reviewing the\nphenomenology of such tests, we address one major challenge to such a program.\nThe evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe is highly uncertain and\ncan influence lensing observables, manifesting as modified structure growth for\na fixed cosmic distance scale. Using two proposed methods, we show that one\ncould be led to reject the null hypothesis of GR when it is the true theory if\nthis uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected.

We assume that these functions are of the same\nform as in the $\\Lambda$CDM model.

The topological features of a network are commonly\nrelated to the network's functionality. However, the topology alone does not\naccount for the nature of the interactions in the network and their strength.\nHere we introduce a method for evaluating the correlations between pairs of\nnodes in the network. These correlations depend both on the topology and on the\nfunctionality of the network. A network with high connectivity displays strong\ncorrelations between its interacting nodes and thus features small-world\nfunctionality. We quantify the correlations between all pairs of nodes in the\nnetwork, and express them as matrix elements in the correlation matrix. From\nthis information one can plot the correlation function for the network and to\nextract the correlation length. The connectivity of a network is then defined\nas the ratio between this correlation length and the average path length of the\nnetwork.

We have analyzed the aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)\nemission features in the infrared spectra of a sample of 53 Herbig Ae stars,\nobtained with the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. We\nconfirm that the PAH-to-stellar luminosity ratio is higher in targets with a\nflared dust disk. However, a few sources with a flattened dust disk still show\nrelatively strong PAH emission. Since PAH molecules trace the gas disk, this\nindicates that gas disks may still be flared, while the dust disk has settled\ndue to grain growth. There are indications that the strength of the 11.3 um\nfeature also depends on dust disk structure, with flattened disks being less\nbright in this feature.

Two\ntypes of integration kernels in the FESR are used to suppress the contribution\nof the kaon radial excitations to the hadronic spectral function, one with\nlocal and the other with global constraints. The result for the pseudoscalar\ncurrent correlator at zero momentum is $\\psi_5(0) = (2.8 \\pm 0.3) \\times\n10^{-3} GeV^{4}$, leading to the chiral corrections to GMOR: $\\delta_K = (55\n\\pm 5)%$. The resulting uncertainties are mostly due to variations in the upper\nlimit of integration in the FESR, within the stability regions, and to a much\nlesser extent due to the uncertainties in the strong coupling and the strange\nquark mass.

However on the\nbasis of the mass limitation $m\\leq m_{max}$ we obtain that the domain $m_1\\geq\nm_2$ consists of two different parametric sectors: i) $0\\leq m_2 \\leq\nm_1/\\sqrt{2}$ -this values of mass parameters $m_1,m_2$ correspond to the\ntraditional particles for which in the limit $m_{max}\\rightarrow \\infty$ the\nmodified models are converting to the ordinary Dirac theory with the physical\nmass $m$; ii)$m_1/\\sqrt{2}\\leq m_2 \\leq m_1$ - this is the case of the unusual\nparticles for which equations of motion does not have a limit, when\n$m_{max}\\rightarrow \\infty$. The presence of this possibility lets hope for\nthat in Nature indeed there are some \"exotic fermion fields\".\n  As a matter of fact the formulated criterions may be used as a major test in\nthe process of the division of considered models into ordinary and exotic\nfermion theories.

In recent years, several studies\ninvestigated the effects of noise on Turing patterns and showed that the\nparameter regimes, for which stochastic Turing patterns are observed, can be\nlarger than the parameter regimes predicted by deterministic models, which are\nwritten in terms of partial differential equations for species concentrations.\nA common stochastic reaction-diffusion approach is written in terms of\ncompartment-based (lattice-based) models, where the domain of interest is\ndivided into artificial compartments and the number of molecules in each\ncompartment is simulated. In this paper, the dependence of stochastic Turing\npatterns on the compartment size is investigated. It has previously been shown\n(for relatively simpler systems) that a modeller should not choose compartment\nsizes which are too small or too large, and that the optimal compartment size\ndepends on the diffusion constant. Taking these results into account, we\npropose and study a compartment-based model of Turing patterns where each\nchemical species is described using a different set of compartments. It is\nshown that the parameter regions where spatial patterns form are different from\nthe regions obtained by classical deterministic PDE-based models, but they are\nalso different from the results obtained for the stochastic reaction-diffusion\nmodels which use a single set of compartments for all chemical species. In\nparticular, it is argued that some previously reported results on the effect of\nnoise on Turing patterns in biological systems need to be reinterpreted. \n\n"}

A set of relativistic nuclear energy density\nfunctionals, characterized by systematic variation of the density dependence of\nthe symmetry energy of nuclear matter, is used to constrain possible values for\n$(n_t,P_t)$. By comparing the calculated excitation energies of giant\nresonances, energy weighted pygmy dipole strength, and dipole polarizability\nwith available data, we obtain the weighted average values: $n_t = 0.0955 \\pm\n0.0007$ fm$^{-3}$ and $P_t = 0.59 \\pm 0.05$ MeV fm$^{-3}$. \n\n"}

The distribution of the quasars at 0.15<z<3.5 covers the redshift\nrange where we expect most of the CIB to originate. We detect the sub-mm\nemission of the quasars, which dominates on small scales, as well as correlated\nemission from dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) dominant on larger scales.\nThe mean sub-mm flux densities of the DR7 quasars (median redshift <z>=1.4) is\n$11.1^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$, $7.1^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$ and $3.6^{+1.4}_{-1.0}$ mJy at 250,\n350 and 500 microns, respectively, while the mean sub-mm flux densities of the\nDR9 quasars (<z>=2.5) is $5.7^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$, $5.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ and\n$1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ mJy.

We employ an approximation scheme where \"one-loop\" diagrams are\ncomputed using fully dressed gluon and ghost propagators, and tree-level\nvertices. When a suitable kinematical configuration depending on a single\nmomentum scale $p$ is chosen, only two structures emerge: the tree-level\nfour-gluon vertex, and a tensor orthogonal to it. A detailed numerical analysis\nreveals that the form factor associated with this latter tensor displays a\nchange of sign (zero-crossing) in the deep infrared, and finally diverges\nlogarithmically. The origin of this characteristic behavior is proven to be\nentirely due to the masslessness of the ghost propagators forming the\ncorresponding ghost-loop diagram, in close analogy to a similar effect\nestablished for the three-gluon vertex. However, in the case at hand, and under\nthe approximations employed, this particular divergence does not affect the\nform factor proportional to the tree-level tensor, which remains finite in the\nentire range of momenta, and deviates moderately from its naive tree-level\nvalue.

Using 3D high-resolution simulations, we probe the impact of\nrotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a typical massive galaxy. In the\nhot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a\ngeometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the accretion rate to ~1/3\nof the Bondi rate. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure\nsupport and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk. In the more common state\nof a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas\nvelocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor\nnumber < 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via\nthermal instability and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate\nup to 100 times the Bondi rate. Initially, turbulence broadens the angular\nmomentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with\nprograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold\nfilaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of\nangular momentum, leading to high accretion rates. The simulated sub-Eddington\naccretion rates cover the range inferred from AGN cavity observations. CCA\npredicts inner flat X-ray temperature and $r^{-1}$ density profiles, as\nrecently discovered in M 87 and NGC 3115.

In\nearlier work, standard disk model was used and we refine the model by focussing\non the sub-Eddington regime to address the fundamental plane of black hole\nactivity. The results do not change substantially with regard to previous work\nensuring that the details of the accretion physics are not relevant in the\nmagnetic reconnection process occurring in the corona.

However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the\npredictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are\nbased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe\ntwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded\nprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a\nrange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star.

In one set of simulations velocity forcing is\nentirely solenoidal ($\\nabla\\cdot \\delta {\\vec u} = 0$), while in the other it\nis entirely compressive ($\\nabla\\times \\delta {\\vec u} = 0$). Both cases\ndevelop a mixture of solenoidal and compressive turbulent motions, since each\ngenerates the other. The development of compressive turbulent motions leads to\nshocks, even when the turbulence is solenoidally forced and subsonic. Shocks,\nin turn, produce and amplify vorticity, which is especially important in\ncompressively forced turbulence. To clarify those processes we include a pair\nof appendices that look in detail at vorticity evolution in association with\nshocks.

We point out the severe repercussions: differentiable Dirac\nobservables and a reduced phase space do not exist in non-integrable\nconstrained systems and are thus unlikely to occur in a generic general\nrelativistic context. Instead, gauge invariant quantities generally become\ndiscontinuous, thus not admitting Poisson-algebraic structures and posing\nserious challenges to a quantization. Non-integrability also renders the\nparadigm of relational dynamics cumbersome, thereby straining common\ninterpretations of the dynamics. We illustrate these conceptual and technical\nchallenges with simple toy models. In particular, we exhibit reparametrization\ninvariant models which fail to be integrable and, as a consequence, can either\nnot be quantized with standard methods or lead to sick quantum theories without\na semiclassical limit. These troubles are qualitatively distinct from\nsemiclassical subtleties in unconstrained quantum chaos and can be directly\ntraced back to the scarcity of Dirac observables. As a possible resolution, we\npropose to change the method of quantization by refining the configuration\nspace topology until the generalized observables become continuous in the new\ntopology and can acquire a quantum representation. This leads to the polymer\nquantization method underlying loop quantum cosmology and gravity. Remarkably,\nthe polymer quantum theory circumvents the problems of the quantization with\nsmooth topology, indicating that non-integrability and chaos, while a\nchallenge, may not be a fundamental obstruction for quantum gravity. \n\n"}

For the time being there is a long-lasting controversy on how\nthese long-term variations, observed for more than 50 years in the inner\nheliosphere, are formed. It is widely believed that the 11-year variation is\ndue entirely to the toroidal branch of solar activity (the area and number of\nsunspots, the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field etc) because of the\ndiffusion, convection and adiabatic energy loss, while the much smaller 22-year\nvariation is caused by the particle drifts connected with the poloidal branch\nof solar activity (the high-latitude solar magnetic fields). At the same time,\nboth past and more recent numerical simulations indicate that the contribution\nof particle drifts could be significant for both 22- and 11-year variations in\nthe GCR intensities.

Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of\nbinary systems among the CEMP-s stars, which exhibit strong enhancements of\nneutron-capture elements associated with the s-process. This allows us to test\nwhether local mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary and sufficient\nto explain their dramatic carbon excesses. Eighteen of the 22 stars exhibit\nclear orbital motion, yielding a binary frequency of 82+-10%, while four stars\nappear to be single (18+-10%). We thus confirm that the binary frequency of\nCEMP-s stars is much higher than for normal metal-poor giants, but not 100% as\npreviously claimed. Secure orbits are determined for 11 of the binaries and\nprovisional orbits for six long-period systems (P > 3,000 days), and orbital\ncircularisation time scales are discussed. The conventional scenario of local\nmass transfer from a former AGB binary companion does appear to account for the\nchemical composition of most CEMP-s stars. However, the excess of C and\ns-process elements in some single CEMP-s stars was apparently transferred to\ntheir natal clouds by an external (distant) source.

Physical properties of low\n  luminosity FIR sources at $z <$ 0.5 Abstract: The Star formation rate (SFR) is a crucial parameter to investigate galaxy\nevolution.

We investigate the properties of a sample of low\nluminosity Far-Infrared (FIR) sources selected at 250 microns from Pappalardo\net al. (2015). We have collected data from Ultraviolet to FIR to perform a\nmulti-wavelengths analysis. The main goal is to investigate the correlation\nbetween SFR, stellar mass, and dust mass for a galaxy population with a wide\nrange in dust content and stellar mass, including the low mass regime that most\nprobably dominates the SFR density at low z. We define a main sample of ~800\nsources with full Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) coverage between 0.15 <\nlambda < 500 microns and an extended sample with ~5000 sources in which we\nremove the constraints on the Ultraviolet and Near-Infrared bands.

This can be\nregarded as a 3D generalization of the 2D Bais-Slingerland condensation\nmechanism. Charge fractionalization results from a Debye-H\\\"uckel-like\nscreening cloud formed by the condensed composite particles. Within our general\nframework, we explore two aspects of symmetry-enriched 3D Abelian topological\nphases. First, we construct a new fermionic state of matter with time-reversal\nsymmetry and $\\Theta\\neq \\pi$, the fractional topological insulator. Second, we\ngeneralize the notion of anyonic symmetry of 2D Abelian topological phases to\nthe charge-loop excitation symmetry ($\\mathsf{Charles}$) of 3D Abelian\ntopological phases. We show that line twist defects, which realize\n$\\mathsf{Charles}$ transformations, exhibit non-Abelian fusion properties. \n\n"}

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) have recently re-emerged as attractive candidates for\nmediating feedback in galaxies because of their long cooling timescales. They\ncan have energy densities comparable to the thermal gas, but do not suffer\ncatastrophic cooling losses. Recent simulations have shown that the momentum\nand energy deposited by CRs moving with respect to the ambient medium can drive\ngalactic winds. However, simulations are hampered by our ignorance of the\ndetails of CR transport. Two key limits previously considered model CR\ntransport as a purely diffusive process (with a constant diffusion coefficient)\nand as an advective streaming process. With a series of GADGET simulations, we\ncompare and contrast the results of these different assumptions. In idealised\nthree-dimensional galaxy formation models, we show that these two cases result\nin significant differences for the galactic wind mass loss rates and star\nformation suppression in dwarf galaxies with halo masses\n$M\\approx10^{10}\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$: diffusive CR transport results in more\nthan ten times larger mass loss rates compared to CR streaming models. We\ndemonstrate that this is largely due to the excitation of Alfv\\'en waves during\nthe CR streaming process that drains energy from the CR population to the\nthermal gas, which is subsequently radiated away.

Overlapping Properties Abstract: Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are classified into long and short categories based\non their durations. Broad band studies suggest that these two categories of\nobjects roughly correspond to two different classes of progenitor systems, i.e.\ncompact star mergers (Type I) vs. massive star core collapse (Type II).\nHowever, the duration criterion sometimes leads to mis-identification of the\nprogenitor systems. We perform a comprehensive multi-wavelength comparative\nstudy between duration-defined long GRBs and short GRBs as well as the\nso-called \"consensus\" long GRBs and short GRBs (which are believed to be more\nclosely related to the two types of progenitor systems). The parameters we\nstudy include two parts: the prompt emission properties including duration\n($T_{90}$), spectral peak energy ($E_{\\rm p}$), low energy photon index\n($\\alpha$), isotropic $\\gamma$-ray energy ($E_{\\rm \\gamma, iso}$), isotropic\npeak luminosity ($L_{\\rm p,iso}$), and the amplitude parameters ($f$ and\n$f_{\\rm eff}$); and the host galaxy properties including stellar mass ($M_*$),\nstar formation rate (SFR), metallicity ([X/H]), half light radius ($R_{50}$),\nangular and physical ($R_{\\rm off}$) offset of the afterglow from the center of\nthe host galaxy, the normalized offset ($r_{\\rm off}=R_{\\rm off}/R_{50}$), and\nthe brightness fraction $F_{\\rm light}$.

This simple equation captures many key challenges of nonlinear\nwave dynamics in confining geometries, while a conformal transformation relates\nit to a self-interacting conformally coupled scalar in four-dimensional anti-de\nSitter spacetime (AdS$_4$) and connects it to various questions of AdS\nstability.

However, such a group is not securely confirmed yet.\nStrangely, concerning the spectral hardness, the observations from the Swift\nand RHESSI satellites give different results. For the Swift/BAT database it is\nfound that the intermediate-duration bursts might well be related to so-called\nX-ray flashes (XRFs). On the other hand, for the RHESSI dataset the\nintermediate-duration bursts seem to be spectrally too hard to be given by\nXRFs. The connection of the intermediate-duration bursts and XRFs for the BATSE\ndatabase is not clear as well. The purpose of this article is to check the\nrelation between XRFs and GRBs for the BATSE and RHESSI databases,\nrespectively.

Despite\nnumerous observational and theoretical efforts, the nature of such flares still\nremains poorly understood, although a few phenomenological scenarios have been\nproposed. In this work, we develop the Yuan et al. (2009) scenario into a\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for Sgr A$^\\star$ flares. This model is\nanalogous with the theory of solar flares and coronal mass ejection in solar\nphysics. In the model, magnetic field loops emerge from the accretion flow onto\nSgr A$^\\star$ and are twisted to form flux ropes because of shear and\nturbulence. The magnetic energy is also accumulated in this process until a\nthreshold is reached. This then results in a catastrophic evolution of a flux\nrope with the help of magnetic reconnection in the current sheet. In this\ncatastrophic process, the magnetic energy is partially converted into the\nenergy of non-thermal electrons. We have quantitatively calculated the\ndynamical evolution of the height, size, and velocity of the flux rope, as well\nas the magnetic field in the flare regions, and the energy distribution of\nrelativistic electrons in this process.

In the context of chiral\nquark models, in particular the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and the spectral quark\nmodel, we apply this method to compute the low-energy chiral Lagrangian at\nfinite temperature. The coupling of the Polyakov loop with these models allows\nto solve some inconsistencies appearing in the standard treatment at finite\ntemperature: generation of multi-quark states, large $N_c$ counting, etc. On\nthe other hand, we show that recent available lattice data for the renormalized\nPolyakov loop above the deconfinement phase transition exhibit unequivocal\ninverse power temperature corrections driven by a dimension 2 gluon condensate.\nThis simple ansatz provides a good overall description of the data throughout\nthe deconfinement phase until near the critical temperature with just two\nparameters.

With the advent of high\nprecision astrometry, new horizons have been opened for detecting the\nkinematics associated with the warp and constraining possible warp formation\nscenarios for the Milky Way. The aim of this contribution is to establish\nwhether the first Gaia data release (DR1) shows significant evidence of the\nkinematic signature expected from a long-lived Galactic warp in the kinematics\nof distant OB stars. As the first paper in a series, we present our approach\nfor analyzing the proper motions and apply it to the sub-sample of Hipparcos\nstars. We select a sample of 989 distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars\nfrom the New Reduction of Hipparcos, of which 758 are also in Gaia DR1,\ncovering distances from 0.5 to 3 kpc from the Sun. We develop a model of the\nspatial distribution and kinematics of the OB stars from which we produce the\nprobability distribution functions of the proper motions, with and without the\nsystematic motions expected from a long-lived warp. A likelihood analysis is\nused to compare the expectations of the models with the observed proper motions\nfrom both Hipparcos and Gaia DR1. We find that the proper motions of the nearby\nOB stars are consistent with the signature of a warp, while those of the more\ndistant stars (parallax<1 mas) are not. The kinematics of our sample of young\nOB stars suggests that systematic vertical motions in the disk cannot be\nexplained by a simple model of a stable long-lived warp. The Galactic warp may\neither be a transient feature, or additional phenomena are acting on the\ngaseous component of the Milky Way, causing systematic vertical motions that\nare masking the expected warp signal.

First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use the absence\nof dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems\ncomposed of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for\nNSs, to derive the most stringent constraints on the two free parameters of the\nDEF scalar-tensor theory.

Then, we investigate if these scalarization windows could\nbe closed and if pulsar-timing constraints could be improved by\nlaser-interferometer GW detectors, when spontaneous (or dynamical)\nscalarization sets in during the early (or late) stages of a binary NS (BNS)\nevolution.

On the lower\nvelocity side the CO emission spatially corresponds with the bright 8 {\\mu}m\nfilament at the western rim of Sh2-48, while the CO emission at higher\nvelocities is separated at the eastern and western sides of the 8{\\mu}m\nfilament.

The\nsimulations showed that distortions of line profiles, such as those recently\nobserved in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the\ndifferential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR.\nWhile the magnification of the emission line $\\mu^{BLR}$ sets an upper limit on\nthe BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum $\\mu^{cont}$\nsets an upper limit on the size of the continuum source, the line profile\ndistortions mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics.

The main insight from this study is\nthat LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing\nM*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and\nmetallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and\nvice versa. Furthermore, we find that the bulge-to-disk age and metallicity\ncontrast, as well as the bulge-to-disk mass ratio increase with M*T, raising\nfrom, respectively, ~0 Gyr, 0 dex and 0.25 to ~3 Gyr, ~0.3 dex and 0.67 across\nthe mass range covered by our sample. Whereas gas excitation in lower-mass\nbulges is invariably dominated by star formation (SF), LINER- and\nSeyfert-specific emission-line ratios were exclusively documented in high-mass,\nhigh-S* bulges. The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves\nand in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that\nthese components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a\ncontinuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics.

We present response curves for G, G_BP, and G_RP\nthat differ from the previously published curves, and which provide a better\nagreement between synthetic Gaia photometry and Gaia observations. \n\n"}

As an example of\nthe use of this technique, we explicitly calculate the rate at which neutrinos\nand antineutrinos annihilate in a highly magnetized plasma, and compare that to\nthe rate in an unmagnetized plasma. The most important channel for energy\ndeposition is the gyromagnetic absorption of a neutrino-antineutrino pair on an\nelectron or positron in the plasma ($\\nu\\bar{\\nu} e^\\pm\\leftrightarrow e^\\pm$).\nOur results show that the rate of annihilation increases with the magnetic\nfield strength once it reaches a certain critical value, which is dependent on\nthe incident neutrino energies and the ambient temperature of the plasma.

Similarly to what shown in Del\nPopolo & Gambera (1999, 2000) (hereafter DG99, DG00), Del Popolo et al.

The spectral\nenergy distribution matches that expected from a heavy-element dominated\natmosphere, but not from a uniform temperature blackbody. Non-magnetic light\nelement atmospheres cannot be simultaneously reconciled with the optical and\nX-ray data. We extend previous studies, which were limited to one fixed neutron\nstar mass and radius. For uniform temperature models dominated by heavy\nelements, the redshift z is constrained to be 0.3 < z < 0.4 and the best-fit\nmass and radius are M approx 0.9 solar masses and R approx 6 km (for a 61 pc\ndistance).

The dividing line N_crit(Omega) between configurations with one\nand two phases is correlated to a local maximum of the moment of inertia and\ncan thus be subject to experimental verification by observation of the\nrotational behavior of accreting compact stars. Another characteristic line,\nwhich also can be measured is the transition line to black holes that of the\nmaximum mass configurations.

Observations suggest that some neutron stars are born with magnetic\nfields of at least 10^15 G while theoretical considerations give an upper limit\nof 10^18 G for the protoneutron star magnetic fields.

As a result, the cooling rate can be\ngreatly reduced by magnetic fields of 10^16 G for typical conditions below the\nstalled shock and a nonuniform protoneutron star magnetic field (e.g., a dipole\nfield) can introduce a large angular dependence of the cooling rate.

The simple estimator used is the peak of the smoothed\ncorrelation function, which provides a variance in the BAO scale that is close\nto optimal, if appropriate low-pass filtering is applied to the density field.\nWhile maximum-likelihood estimators can eliminate biases if the form of the\nsystematic error is fully modeled, we estimate the potential effects of un- or\nmis-modelled systematic errors. Non-linear structure growth using the Smith et\nal. (2003) prescription biases the acoustic scale by <0.3% at z>1 under the\ncorrelation-function estimator. The biases due to representative but simplistic\nmodels of scale-dependent galaxy bias are below 1% at z>1 for bias behaviour in\nthe realms suggested by halo model calculations, which is expected to be below\nstatistical errors for a 1000 sq.degs. spectroscopic survey.

These young stellar groups are nearby ($\\leq$ 1 kpc) and still embedded\nwithin their molecular clouds. In order to identify the young stellar objects\nin our sample, we use the color-color diagram of J - [3.6] vs. Ks - [4.5]. The\nSpitzer images of our sample show that the groups around HAEBEs, spectral types\nearlier than B8, are usually associated with bright infrared nebulosity. Within\nthis, there are normally 10 - 50 young stars distributed close to the HAEBEs\n($<$ 1 pc). Not only are there young stars around the HAEBEs, there are also\nyoung stellar populations throughout the whole cloud, some are distributed and\nsome are clumped. The groups around the HAEBEs are sub-structures of the large\nyoung population within the molecular cloud. The sizes of groups are also\ncomparable with those sub-structures seen in massive clusters. Young stars in\ngroups around HAEBEs have generally larger SED slopes compared to those\noutside, which suggests that the young stars in groups are probably younger\nthan the distributed systems. This might imply that there is usually a higher\nand more continuous star forming rate in groups, that the formation of groups\ninitiates later, or that low mass stars in groups form slower than those\noutside. Finally, there is no obvious trend between the SED slopes and the\ndistance to the HAEBEs for those young stars within the groups. This suggests\nthat the clustering of young stars dominates over the effect of massive stars\non the low-mass young stars at the scale of our study. \n\n"}

This state (measured by us by the position on the X-ray\ncolour-colour diagram) is tightly coupled to the accretion rate, which, in\nturn, is coupled to the phase of the 170-d superorbital cycle of this source.\nThe modulation depth is much stronger in the high-luminosity, so-called banana,\nstate than in the low-luminosity, island, state. We find the X-ray modulation\nis independent of energy, which rules out bound-free X-ray absorption in an\noptically thin medium as the cause of the modulation. We also find a\nsignificant dependence of the offset phase of the orbital modulation on the\nspectral state, which favours the model in which the modulation is caused by\nscattering in hot gas around a bulge at the disc edge, which both size and the\nposition vary with the accretion rate. Estimates of the source inclination\nappear to rule out a model in which the bulge itself occults a part of an\naccretion disc corona.

This effect is\nparticularly important for measurements of weak gravitational lensing, for\nwhich the sought image distortions are typically of the order of only 1%. We\ncompute the effect of correlated noise on two-dimensional gaussian fits in full\ngenerality. The noise properties are naturally quantified by the noise\nautocorrelation function (ACF), which is easily measured in practice. We\ncompute the resulting bias on the mean, variance and covariance of the source\nparameters, and the induced correlation between the shapes of neighboring\nsources. We show that these biases are of second order in the inverse\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the source, and could thus be overlooked if bright\nstars are used to monitor systematic distortions. Radio interferometric surveys\nare particularly prone to this effect because of the long-range pixel\ncorrelations produced by the Fourier inversion involved in their image\nconstruction. As a concrete application, we consider the search for weak\nlensing by large-scale structure with the FIRST radio survey.

Clearly, this formula requires amendments, as it predicts an\ninfinitely large monopole C_0, and a dipole moment C_1 only 6/2 times larger\nthan the quadrupole C_2, both predictions in conflict with observations. We\nrestore the terms omitted in the course of the derivation of this formula, and\narrive at a new expression. According to the corrected formula, the monopole\nmoment is finite and small, while the dipole moment is sensitive to\nshort-wavelength perturbations, and numerically much larger than the\nquadrupole, as one would expect on physical grounds. At the same time, the\nfunction l(l +1)C_l deviates from a horizontal line and grows with l, for l\n\\geq 2. We show that the inclusion of the modulating (transfer) function\nterminates the growth and forms the first peak, recently observed. We fit the\ntheoretical curves to the position and height of the first peak, as well as to\nthe observed dipole, varying three parameters: red-shift at decoupling,\nred-shift at matter-radiation equality, and slope of the primordial spectrum.\nIt appears that there is always a deficit, as compared with the COBE\nobservations, at small multipoles, l \\sim 10. We demonstrate that a reasonable\nand theoretically expected amount of gravitational waves bridges this gap at\nsmall multipoles, leaving the other fits as good as before. We show that the\nobservationally acceptable models permit somewhat `blue' primordial spectra.\nThis allows one to avoid the infra-red divergence of cosmological\nperturbations, which is otherwise present. \n\n"}

It appears that in the case of the EcoRI dodecamer certain\nsequence specific hydration patterns in the minor groove earlier known from\nexperimental data are formed spontaneously in the course of MD simulations.
