Solar\nangle predicted by tri-bimaximal mixings and also values lower than this, do\nnot lead to stability of the model. Similarly, the evolution of the atmospheric\nmixing angle with energy scale at large $\\tan\\beta$ values, shows sharp\ndecrease for the case with non-zero value of m_3. We apply these mass matrices\nto estimate the baryon asymmetry of the universe in a self consistent way and\nfind that normal hierarchical model leads to the best result.

The inflaton field is described in a supergravity framework where\nthe conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field is generically and\nnaturally broken. For each class of inflationary scenarios, we determine the\nfunctional dependence of the gauge coupling that is consistent with the\nobservations on the magnetic field strength at various astrophysical scales\nand, at the same time, avoid a back-reaction problem. Then, we study whether\nthe required coupling functions can naturally emerge in well-motivated,\npossibly string-inspired, models. We argue that this is non trivial and can be\nrealized only for a restricted class of scenarios. This includes power-law\ninflation where the inflaton field is interpreted as a modulus. However, this\nscenario seems to be consistent only if the energy scale of inflation is low\nand the reheating stage prolonged. Another reasonable possibility appears to be\nsmall field models since no back-reaction problem is present in this case but,\nunfortunately, the corresponding scenario cannot be justified in a stringy\nframework. Finally, large field models do not lead to sensible model building. \n\n"}

Within the\ncontext of standard cosmology, the Universe must therefore contain a third\n`dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. However, the current\ndata are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark\nenergy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmological\nconstant. In this paper, we examine the role played by our cosmic horizon R0 in\nour interrogation of the data, and reach the rather firm conclusion that the\nexistence of a cosmological constant is untenable. The observations are telling\nus that R0=c t0, where t0 is the perceived current age of the Universe, yet a\ncosmological constant would drive R0 towards ct (where t is the cosmic time)\nonly once, and that would have to occur right now. In contrast, scaling\nsolutions simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model,\nincluding the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well for\nthe fact that R0=c t0. We show here that for such dynamical dark energy models,\neither R0=ct for all time (thus eliminating the apparent coincidence\naltogether), or that what we believe to be the current age of the universe is\nactually the horizon time th=R0/c, which is always shorter than t0. Our best\nfit to the Type Ia supernova data indicates that t0 would then have to be ~16.9\nbillion years. Though surprising at first, an older universe such as this would\nactually eliminate several other long-standing problems in cosmology, including\nthe (too) early appearance of supermassive black holes (at a redshift > 6) and\nthe glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group. \n\n"}

This attractive potential depresses the CMB\nquadrupole moment for the curvature and B-mode spectra.

While the conversion of\nobserved velocities into true recession velocities has only a small effect on\nthe result, the derivation of unbiased distances which rest on a solid zero\npoint and cover a useful range of about 4-30 Mpc is crucial. A list of 279 such\ngalaxy distances within v<2000 km/s is given which are derived from the tip of\nthe red-giant branch (TRGB), from Cepheids, and from supernovae of type Ia (SNe\nIa).

Additional 62 distant SNe Ia confirm the linearity\nto at least 20,000 km/s. The dispersion about the Hubble line is dominated by\nrandom peculiar velocities, amounting locally to <100 km/s but increasing\noutwards. Due to the linearity of the expansion field the Hubble constant H_0\ncan be found at any distance >4.5 Mpc. RR Lyr star-calibrated TRGB distances of\n78 galaxies above this limit give H_0=63.0+/-1.6 at an effective distance of 6\nMpc.

Thus bulk flow estimates are generally not\nstrictly comparable between surveys, even those whose effective depths are\nsimilar. In addition, the sparseness of typical surveys can lead to aliasing of\nsmall scale power into what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. Here\nwe introduce a new method of calculating bulk flow moments where velocities are\nweighted to give an optimal estimate of the bulk flow of an idealized survey,\nwith the variance of the difference between the estimate and the actual flow\nbeing minimized. These \"minimum variance\" estimates can be designed to estimate\nthe bulk flow on a particular scale with minimal sensitivity to small scale\npower, and are comparable between surveys. We compile all major peculiar\nvelocity surveys and apply this new method to them. We find that most surveys\nwe studied are highly consistent with each other.

These\nabundance ratios are confirmed by co-adding low S/N HIRES spectra of 19 stars\nalong the red giant branch.\n  Results: Pal 3 shows alpha-enhanced abundance patterns, and also its Fe-peak\nand neutron-capture element ratios, are fully compatible with those found in\nhalo field stars and representative inner halo GCs of the same metallicity\n(such as M 13). The heavy elements in Pal 3 appear to be governed by r-process\nnucleosyn-thesis. Our limited sample does not show any significant star-to-star\nabundance variations in this cluster, although a weak Na-O anti-correlation\ncannot be ruled out by the present data.\n  Conclusions: Pal 3 thus appears as an archetypical GC with abundance ratios\ndissimilar to dwarf spheroidal stars, ruling out a direct connection to such\nexternal systems. This conclusion is underscored by the lack of significant\nabundance spreads in this GC, in contrast to the broad abundance distributions\nseen in the dwarf galaxies.

In our scenario the dark energy is due to\nthe Veneziano ghost (which solves the $U(1)_A$ problem in QCD). The Veneziano\nghost couples through the triangle anomaly to the electromagnetic field with a\nconstant which is unambiguously fixed in the standard model.

It has\nresisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent\nnumber of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It\nappears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in\nstudy. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to\nobjectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We\nhave undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56\nlow-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four\nparameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged\nover effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with\nseven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not\nacross its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane,\nwhich is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the\nglobal fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of\nseveral groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different\nthicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification\nscenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number\nand the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the\nresult of several transforming events. We also show that our classification,\nnot the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 -\n0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes\npresumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese)\nmerger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low\nmetallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone\ndry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly\noccupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and\nmight also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least\ndiversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been\nstrongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of\nthese groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on\nspecific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they\nare truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables,\nthus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario\nrelating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but\nis objectively provided by the cladistic analysis.

The quiescent emission of XTE\nJ1810-197 is composed of two thermal components, one arising from the whole\nstar surface, and the other from a small warm spot on it.

We study the detector requirements\nfor a beta beam, a neutrino factory beam, and a superbeam, where we consider\nboth the cases of small theta_13 and large theta_13, as suggested by the recent\nT2K and Double Chooz results. We illustrate that a flavor-clean beta beam best\nsuits the requirements of such a detector, in particular, that PINGU may\nreplace a magic baseline detector for small values of theta_13 -- even in the\nabsence of any energy resolution capability. For large theta_13, however, a\nsingle-baseline beta beam experiment cannot compete if it is constrained by the\nCERN-SPS.

In this paper we present the first results for Classical Cepheids, from\nthe VMC observations of two fields in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The VMC\nKs-band light curves of the Cepheids are well sampled (12-epochs) and of\nexcellent precision. We were able to measure for the first time the Ks\nmagnitude of the faintest Classical Cepheids in the LMC (Ks\\sim17.5 mag), which\nare mostly pulsating in the First Overtone (FO) mode, and to obtain FO\nPeriod-Luminosity (PL), Period-Wesenheit (PW), and Period-Luminosity-Color\n(PLC) relations, spanning the full period range from 0.25 to 6 day. Since the\nlongest period Cepheid in our dataset has a variability period of 23 day, we\nhave complemented our sample with literature data for brighter F Cepheids. On\nthis basis we have built a PL relation in the Ks band that, for the first time,\nincludes short period pulsators, and spans the whole range from 1.6 to 100 days\nin period. We also provide the first ever empirical PW and PLC relations using\nthe (V-Ks) color and time-series Ks photometry. The very small dispersion\n(\\sim0.07 mag) of these relations makes them very well suited to study the\nthree-dimensional (3D) geometry of the Magellanic system.

Systems are stable on\nthe MS if the planets are separated by more than ~9 Hill radii. Most systems\nsurviving the MS will remain stable until the WD phase, although planets\nscattered onto small pericentres in unstable systems can be swallowed by the\nexpanding stellar envelope when the star ascends the giant branches. Mass loss\nat the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many\nsystems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a\nfew 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's\nprevious evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent\nscattering instabilities. The outcome of such instability around WDs is\noverwhelmingly the ejection of one of the planets from the system, with several\ntimes more ejections occurring during the WD phase than during the MS.\nFurthermore, few planets are scattered close to the WD, just outside the Roche\nlimit, where they can be tidally circularised. Hence, we predict that planets\nin WD systems rarely dynamically evolve to become \"hot Jupiters\".

This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where\nthe drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse\nprofile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population.\nVarious tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of\nperiodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and\npolarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the\nradio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the\nfluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly\ndemonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a\ncompletely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be\ndetermined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint\non the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission\nmodes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being\npresent only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation\ncycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for\nthe bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that\nthe variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking\nimplies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.\nPhase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically\nproposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown\nto be implausible. It is argued that within the framework of circulating\nbeamlets, bi-drifting could occur if the circulation were severely distorted,\npossibly by distortions in the magnetic field. \n\n"}

Abstract: Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to trace merger shock fronts. If\ncosmological structure formation determines the luminosity, size and shape\ndistributions of radio relics then merger shocks need to be lighted up in a\nhomogeneous way. We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed\ngalaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured\nin the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known\nto date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply\nthe same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock\nrelic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,\nsuggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS\nand mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend\nto be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.\nBesides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio\nrelics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest\nlinear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are\nlargely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations.

During inflation, the vacuum remains\nin the unbroken GUT phase, and GUT symmetry breaking occurs later when a field\nwith a flat direction (the flaton) acquires a vacuum expectation value.\nInflaton decay and the reheating process depend crucially on GUT symmetry\nbreaking, as decay channels open and close, depending on the value of the\nflaton vacuum expectation value. Here, we consider the simultaneous\ncosmological evolution of both the inflaton and flaton fields after inflation.\nWe distinguish weak, moderate and strong reheating regimes, and calculate in\neach case the entropy produced as all fields settle to their global minima.\nThese three reheating scenarios differ in the value of a Yukawa coupling that\nintroduces mass mixing between the singlets and the ${\\bf 10}$s of SU(5).

Up to now, in calculation of\nthe turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no back\nreaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic\nenergy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the\nkinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of this theory to\nprotogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies the\ntemperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by magnetized ions. As\nthe magnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes\nshorter than the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly\nmagnetized. As a result, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity.\nThus, in protogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field\nstrengths much lower than those which correspond to field-turbulence energy\nequipartition, and the turbulent dynamo becomes what we call the magnetized\nturbulent dynamo. In this paper we lay the theoretical groundwork for the\nmagnetized turbulent dynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy\ngrowth rate in the magnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that\nin the kinematic dynamo theory.

We argue\nthat in most realistic models of inflation the coupling of the inflaton to\nnormal matter is determined by the vacuum expectation values of fields in the\ntheory. If those fields are light during inflation (this is a generic situation\nin the minimal models of supersymmetric inflation) they will fluctuate leading\nto density perturbations through the proposed mechanism. We show that these\nfluctuations could easily dominate over the ones generated through the standard\nmechanism. The new scenario has several consequences for inflation model\nbuilding and observations. The proposed mechanism allows to generate the\nobserved level of density perturbations with a much lower scale of inflation\nand thus generically predicts a smaller level of gravitational waves. The\nrelation between the slope of the spectrum of the produced density\nperturbations and the potential of the inflaton field is different from the\nstandard relations obtained in the context of slow roll inflation. Because the\nfield responsible for the fluctuations is not the inflaton, it can have\nsignificantly larger self couplings and thus density perturbations could be\nnon-Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity can be large enough to be detectable by CMB\nand Large Scale Structure observations. \n\n"}

So far relativistic gravitation theories\nproposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of\ngeneral relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or\nviolated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an\n\\textit{a priori} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory\nwhich resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a\nscalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of\nits free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic\ndynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are\nsmall.

We present results for three different approaches -- a\ngrid search in a subset of the overall parameter space, a Fisher matrix\nestimate of the likely error ellipses, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain fit to a\nsimulated CMB sky.

We clarify the Lyth bound which\nrelates the tensor/scalar ratio and the value of phi/M_P.Effective field theory\nis valid for V(phi)<<M_P^4 allowing inflaton fields phi well beyond M_P.Thus,\nno bounds based on the value of phi/M_P appear on r.In case one wishes to\nrestrict oneself to chi < 1 in the above potential, values for r larger than\nthe previous bounds are allowed thanks to the new factor sqrt{N}~7.Finally,it\nis conjectured that inflation is hovering near a trivial gaussian infrared\nfixed point during slow roll.

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff\nconsistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy\nvariation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses\nnear the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance\nwith holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square\nroot of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only\nundetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give\nearly deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of\nfurther improvement of the model is also briefly indicated. \n\n"}

The recent\nproposal that the endpoint of gravitational collapse can be a \"dark energy\nstar\" implies that the mass-energy of the nucleons undergoing gravitational\ncollapse can be converted to vacuum energy when one gets near to conditions\nwhere classical general relativity predicts that a trapped surface would form.\nThe negative pressure associated with a large vacuum energy prevents an event\nhorizon from forming, thus resolving the long-standing puzzle as to why\ngravitational collapse always leads to an explosion. An indirect consequence is\nthat the reverse process - creation of matter from vacuum energy - should also\nbe possible. Indeed this process may be responsible for the \"big bang\".

Combining the assumptions that\nOmega_0 = 1 and that the intial perturbations were Gaussian with the observed\nX-ray temperature function at low redshift, we show that the probability of\nthis cluster occurring in the volume sampled by the EMSS is less than a few\ntimes 10^{-5}.

In the presence of weak symmetry breaking terms, such as arise\nnaturally when using the O(4) model for hadrodynamics, the strings become the\nboundary of a new kind of cosmic sigma membrane, with tension given by the pion\nmass. The string current would then make it possible for a loop to attain a\n(classically) stable equilibrium state that differs from an ``ordinary'' vorton\nstate by the presence of a sigma membrane stretched across it in a drum like\nconfiguration. Such defects will however be entirely destabilised if the\nsymmetry breaking is too strong, as is found to be the case -- due to the\nrather large value of the pion mass -- in the hadronic application of the O(4)\nsigma model. \n\n"}

Two\ndifferent types of models are examined: monomial or equivalently chaotic type\npotentials, and hybrid like models where the energy density during inflation is\ndominated by the false vacuum.

Three sets of single particle level schemes are\nused, ranging in size from 9 to 23 orbits. When the strength of the\nparticle-particle interaction is adjusted so that the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay\nrate is correctly reproduced, the resulting $M^{0\\nu}$ values become\nessentially independent on the size of the basis, and on the form of different\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. Thus, one of the main reasons for\nvariability of the calculated $M^{0\\nu}$ within these methods is eliminated. \n\n"}

The experimental $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay\nrate is used to adjust the most relevant parameter, the strength of the\nparticle-particle interaction. New results confirm that with such procedure the\n$M^{0\\nu}$ values become essentially independent on the size of the\nsingle-particle basis. Furthermore, the matrix elements are shown to be also\nrather stable with respect to the possible quenching of the axial vector\nstrength parametrized by reducing the coupling constant $g_A$, as well as to\nthe uncertainties of parameters describing the short range nucleon\ncorrelations. Theoretical arguments in favor of the adopted way of determining\nthe interaction parameters are presented. Furthermore, a discussion of other\nimplicit and explicit parameters, inherent to the QRPA method, is presented.\nComparison is made of the ways these factors are chosen by different authors.\nIt is suggested that most of the spread among the published $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay nuclear matrix elements can be ascribed to these choices. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/0506062", "contents": "Title: Relativistic Model of Triquark Structure Abstract: At this point it is still unclear whether pentaquarks exist. While they have\nbe seen in some experiments there are many experiments in which they are not\nfound. On the assumption that pentaquarks exist, several authors have studied\nthe properties of pentaquarks. One description considered is that of\npentaquarks which consist of a diquark coupled to a triquark. There is a quite\nextensive literature concerning the properties of diquarks and their importance\nin the description of the nucleon has been considered by several authors. On\nthe other hand, there is little work reported concerning the description of\ntriquarks. In the present work we study a model for the triquark in which it is\ncomposed of a component which contains a quark coupled to a scalar diquark and\nanother two components in which there is a quark coupled to a kaon. We solve\nfor the wave function of the triquark and obtain a mass for the triquark of\n0.81 GeV which is quite close to the value of 0.80 GeV obtained in a QCD sum\nrule study of triquark properties. \n\n"}
