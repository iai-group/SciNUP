The main features of the early anisotropic phase is (1) a\ndependence of the spectra on the direction of the modes, (2) a coupling between\ncurvature perturbations and gravity waves, and (3) the fact that the two\ngravity waves polarisations do not share the same spectrum on large scales. All\nthese effects are significant only on large scales and die out on small scales\nwhere isotropy is recovered. They depend on a characteristic scale that can,\nbut a priori must not, be tuned to some observable scale. To fix the initial\nconditions, we propose a procedure that generalises the one standardly used in\ninflation but that takes into account the fact that the WKB regime is violated\nat early times when the shear dominates. We stress that there exist modes that\ndo not satisfy the WKB condition during the shear-dominated regime and for\nwhich the amplitude at the end of inflation depends on unknown initial\nconditions. On such scales, inflation loses its predictability. This study\npaves the way to the determination of the cosmological signature of a\nprimordial shear, whatever the Bianchi I spacetime. It thus stresses the\nimportance of the WKB regime to draw inflationary predictions and demonstrates\nthat when the number of e-folds is large enough, the predictions converge\ntoward those of inflation in a Friedmann-Lemaitre spacetime but that they are\nless robust in the case of an inflationary era with a small number of e-folds. \n\n"}

Namely, in our previous works\nwe demonstrated that all well-known important thermodynamical characteristics\nof the black hole (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein entropy/surface\nquantization and Hawking temperature) can be effectively reproduced starting by\nsimple supposition that black hole horizon circumference holds integer number\nof reduced Compton wave lengths corresponding to mass (energy) spectrum of a\nsmall quantum system. (Obviously it is conceptually analogous to Bohr\nquantization postulate interpreted by de Broglie relation in Old,\nBohr-Sommerfeld, quantum theory.)

Such a wide range of experimental evidences from cosmology to local\ngravity suggests the necessity of a comprehensive analysis of the dark matter\ngravitational field per se, regardless of any other attributes that dark matter\nmay eventually possess.\n  In this paper we introduce and apply Nash's theory of perturbative geometry\nto the study of the dark matter gravitational field alone, in a\nhigher-dimensional framework.

The\noscillatory motion is influenced by the strong interaction between the shear\nmodes of the crust and Alfven-like modes in the core. We study the dynamics\nwhich arises through this interaction, and present several new results: (1) We\nshow that global {\\it edge modes} frequently reside near the edges of the core\nAlfven continuum. (2) We compute the magnetar's oscillatory motion for\nrealistic axisymmetric magnetic field configurations and core density profiles,\nbut with a simplified model of the elastic crust. We show that one may\ngenerically get multiple gaps in the Alfven continuum. One obtains discrete\nglobal {\\it gap modes} if the crustal frequencies belong to the gaps. (3) We\nshow that field tangling in the core enhances the role of the core discrete\nAlfven modes and reduces the role of the core Alfven continuum in the overall\noscillatory dynamics of the magnetar.

As a\nquantum theory the conformal theory is both renormalizable and unitary, with\nunitarity being obtained because the theory is a $PT$ symmetric rather than a\nHermitian theory. We show that in the theory there can be no a priori classical\ncurvature, with all curvature having to result from quantization. In the\nconformal theory gravity requires no independent quantization of its own, with\nit being quantized solely by virtue of its being coupled to a quantized matter\nsource. Moreover, because it is this very coupling that fixes the strength of\nthe gravitational field commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy\ndensity and pressure fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the\nzero-point fluctuations associated with the matter sector. In addition, we show\nthat when the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the zero-point\nstructure automatically readjusts so as to identically cancel the cosmological\nconstant term that dynamical mass generation induces. We show that the\nmacroscopic classical theory that results from the quantum conformal theory\nincorporates global physics effects that provide for a detailed accounting of a\ncomprehensive set of 138 galactic rotation curves with no adjustable parameters\nother than the galactic mass to light ratios, and with the need for no dark\nmatter whatsoever.

We employ a\nfinite-temperature nuclear equation of state, parameterized electron capture in\nthe collapse phase, and a multi-species neutrino leakage scheme after bounce.\nThe latter captures the important effects of deleptonization, neutrino cooling\nand heating and enables approximate predictions for the neutrino luminosities\nin the early evolution after core bounce. We consider 12-solar-mass and\n40-solar-mass presupernova models and systematically study the effects of (i)\nrotation, (ii) progenitor structure, and (iii) postbounce neutrino leakage on\ndynamics, GW, and, neutrino signals. We demonstrate, that the GW signal of\nrapidly rotating core collapse is practically independent of progenitor mass\nand precollapse structure. Moreover, we show that the effects of neutrino\nleakage on the GW signal are strong only in nonrotating or slowly rotating\nmodels in which GW emission is not dominated by inner core dynamics. In rapidly\nrotating cores, core bounce of the centrifugally-deformed inner core excites\nthe fundamental quadrupole pulsation mode of the nascent protoneutron star. The\nensuing global oscillations (f~700-800 Hz) lead to pronounced oscillations in\nthe GW signal and correlated strong variations in the rising luminosities of\nantineutrino and heavy-lepton neutrinos. We find these features in cores that\ncollapse to protoneutron stars with spin periods <~ 2.5 ms and rotational\nenergies sufficient to drive hyper-energetic core-collapse supernova\nexplosions. Hence, joint GW + neutrino observations of a core collapse event\ncould deliver strong evidence for or against rapid core rotation. [abridged] \n\n"}

He calculated the work necessary to keep the\ncavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded\nthat the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that E =\n3/8 mc^2. Also in 1904, Hasenohrl achieved the same result by computing the\nforce necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early\n1905, he corrected the latter result to E = 3/4 mc^2. In this paper,\nHasenohrl's papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an\nattempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first\npaper was, ironically, that he didn't account for the loss of mass of the\nblackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking\nthis into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent\nof m = 4/3 E/c^2 or m = 5/3 E/c^2 depending on whether one equates the momentum\nor kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an\nequivalent mass.

Both of\nthese problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to\nbe relevant to the \"4/3 problem\" in classical models of the electron.

{"id": "1306.3166", "contents": "Title: A Closer Earth and the Faint Young Sun Paradox: Modification of the Laws\n  of Gravitation, or Sun/Earth Mass Losses? Abstract: Given a solar luminosity L_Ar = 0.75 L_0 at the beginning of the Archean 3.8\nGyr ago, where L_0 is the present-day one, if the heliocentric distance r of\nthe Earth was r_Ar = 0.956 r_0, the solar irradiance would have been as large\nas I_Ar = 0.82 I_0. It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial\nsurface which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical\nevidence. By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently\ndisplaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the\nirradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr\nto 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \\dot r/r \\simeq 3.4 x\n10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required. Although such a figure is roughly of the\nsame order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar =\n1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out\ncosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate.\nInstead, a class of modified theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling\nbetween the matter and the metric naturally predicts a secular variation of the\nrelative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially\nviable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit.\nAnother competing mechanism of classical origin which could, in principle,\nallow for the desired effect is the mass loss which either the Sun or the Earth\nitself may have experienced during the Archean. On the one hand, this implies\nthat our planet should have lost 2% of its present mass in the form of\neroded/evaporated hydrosphere which, thus, should have been two orders of\nmagnitude larger than now. On the other hand, it is widely believed that the\nSun could have lost mass at an enhanced rate due to a stronger solar wind in\nthe past for not more than \\sim 0.2-0.3 Gyr. \n\n"}

By weakly coupling the CFT to an auxiliary system, such a\nblack hole can be made to evaporate. In a case where the auxiliary system is a\nsecond identical CFT, it is possible (for specific initial states) that the\nsystem evolves to precisely the thermofield double state as the original black\nhole evaporates. In this case, the dual geometry should include the \"late-time\"\npart of the eternal AdS black hole spacetime which includes smooth spacetime\nbehind the horizon of the original black hole.

The most prominent of these is a\nparity-violating asymmetry that beams energy and linear momentum preferentially\nalong or opposite to the orbital angular momentum, leading to recoil of the\nbinary. The asymmetry will appear as amplitude and phase modulations at the\norbital frequency. For strongly precessing systems, it accounts for at least 3%\namplitude modulation for binaries in the sensitivity band of ground-based\ngravitational-wave detectors, and can exceed 50% for massive systems. Such\nasymmetric features are also clearly visible when the waves are decomposed into\nmodes of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, and are inherent in the waves\nthemselves---rather than resulting from residual eccentricity in numerical\nsimulations, or from mode-mixing due to precession. In particular, there is\ngenerically no instantaneous frame for which the mode decomposition will have\nany symmetry. We introduce a method to simplify the expressions for waveforms\ngiven in analytical relativity, which can be used to combine existing\nhigh-order waveforms for nonprecessing systems with expressions for the\nprecessing contributions, leading to improved accuracy and a unified treatment\nof precessing and nonprecessing binaries.

Einstein's\nequations on the brane reduces to a 6-dim Hamiltonian dynamical system with\nadditional terms that implement nonsingular bounces in the model. The phase\nspace of the model has two critical points (a saddle-center-center and a\ncenter-center-center) in a finite region of phase space, and two asymptotic de\nSitter critical points, one acting as an attractor to late-time dynamics.

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources.

The motivation for this work was to achieve a more balanced\ntreatment of the position and momentum variables (aka. holonomies and fluxes).\nIndeed, states in the AL Hilbert spaces describe discrete quantum excitations\non top of a vacuum which is an eigenstate of the flux variables (a\n`no-geometry' state): in such states, most holonomies are totally spread,\nmaking it difficult to approximate a smooth, classical 4-geometry. However,\ngoing beyond the AL sector does not fully resolve this difficulty: one uncovers\na deeper issue hindering the construction of states semi-classical with respect\nto a full set of observables. In the present article, we analyze this issue in\nthe case of real-valued holonomies (we will briefly comment on the heuristic\nimplications for other gauge groups, eg. $\\mathcal{SU}(2)$). Specifically, we\nshow that, in this case, there does not exist any state on the holonomy-flux\nalgebra in which the variances of the holonomies and fluxes observables would\nall be finite, let alone small. It is important to note that this obstruction\ncannot be bypassed by further enlarging the quantum state space, for it arises\nfrom the structure of the algebra itself: as there are too many (uncountably\nmany) non-vanishing commutators between the holonomy and flux operators, the\ncorresponding Heisenberg inequalities force the quantum uncertainties to blow\nup uncontrollably. A way out would be to suitably restrict the algebra of\nobservables. In a companion paper we take the first steps in this direction by\ndeveloping a general framework to perform such a restriction without giving up\nthe universality and diffeomorphism invariance of the theory. \n\n"}

For\ndetecting CBC signals it is of vital importance to characterize and identify\nnon-Gaussian and non-stationary noise in these detectors. In this work we model\ntwo important classes of transient artifacts that contribute to this noise and\nadversely affect the detector sensitivity to CBC signals. One of them is the\nsine-Gaussian glitch, characterized by a central frequency $f_0$ and a quality\nfactor $Q$ and the other is the chirping sine-Gaussian glitch, which is\ncharacterized by $f_0$, $Q$ as well as a chirp parameter. We study the response\na bank of compact binary inspiral templates has to these two families of\nglitches when they are used to match-filter data containing any of these\nglitches. Two important characteristics of this response are the distributions\nof the signal-to-noise ratio and the timelag of individual templates.

What will happen if strong interaction is introduced to this\nsystem? Will the interaction wash out the characteristic features of Weyl\nsemimetals such as the Hall response?

The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives.

We numerically compute the evolution of accreting neutron\nstars through a series of outburst and quiescent phases considering the drastic\nvariation of the accretion rate and the standard disk-magnetosphere\ninteraction. We find that, for the same long-term average accretion rate, X-ray\ntransients can spin up pulsars to rates several times higher than can\npersistent accretors, even when the spin down due to electromagnetic radiation\nduring quiescence is included. We also compute an analytical expression for the\nequilibrium spin frequency in transients, by taking spin equilibrium to mean\nthat no net angular momentum is transferred to the neutron star in each\noutburst cycle. We find that the equilibrium spin rate for transients, which\ndepends on the peak accretion rate during outbursts, can be much higher than\nthat for persistent sources.

Even with this extension, the propagating degrees of freedom\nremain unchanged on the isotropic cosmological background without an\nOstrogradski instability. We study the cosmology in beyond-generalized Proca\ntheories by paying particular attention to the dynamics of late-time cosmic\nacceleration and resulting observational consequences.

The propagation speeds of those\nperturbations are subject to modifications beyond the domain of generalized\nProca theories.

These standard\nprocedures, based on either the Hamiltonian or the path integral, however, do\nnot work in the case of a relativistic particle. As a result we do not have a\nsingle particle description of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM). Instead,\nthe correct approach requires a transmutation of dynamical variables from the\nposition and momentum of a single particle to a field and its canonical\nmomentum. Particles, along with antiparticles, reappear in a very non-trivial\nmanner as the excitations of the field. The fact that one needs to adopt\ncompletely different languages to describe relativistic and non-relativistic\nfree particle implies that obtaining the NRQM limit of QFT is conceptually\nnon-trivial. I examine this limit in several approaches (like, for e.g.,\nHamiltonian dynamics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian path integrals, field\ntheoretic description etc.) and identify the precise issues which arise when\none attempts to obtain the NRQM from QFT in each of these approaches. The\ndichotomy of description between NRQM and QFT does not originate just from the\nsquare root in the Hamiltonian or from the demand of Lorentz invariance, as it\nis sometimes claimed. The real difficulty has its origin in the necessary\nexistence of antiparticles to ensure a particular notion of relativistic\ncausality. Because of these conceptual issues, it turns out that one cannot, in\nfact, obtain some of the popular descriptions of NRQM by any sensible limiting\nprocedure applied to QFT. To obtain NRQM from QFT in a seamless manner, it is\nnecessary to work with NRQM expressed in a language closer to that of QFT.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible.

In the coordinate frame in which these observers\nare at rest, the horizon manifests itself as a (coordinate) singularity in the\nmetric tensor. Regularization of this singularity removes the inaccessible\nregion, and leads to the following consequences: (a) The non-trivial\ntopological structure for the effective manifold allows one to obtain the\nstandard results of quantum field theory in curved space-time. (b) In case of\ngravity, this principle requires that the effect of the unobserved degrees of\nfreedom should reduce to a boundary contribution $A_{\\rm boundary}$ to the\ngravitational action. When the boundary is a horizon, $A_{\\rm boundary}$\nreduces to a single, well-defined term proportional to the area of the horizon.\nUsing the form of this boundary term, it is possible to obtain the full\ngravitational action in the semiclassical limit.

The essential observation is that from a given\nasymptotically flat space-time with a given Bondi shear, one can find (by\nintegrating a partial differential equation) a class of asymptotically\nshear-free (but, in general, twistiing) null geodesic congruences. The class is\nuniquely given up to the arbitrary choice of a complex analytic world-line in a\nfour-parameter complex space.

The\nimprovement due to the higher order corrections to the phasing formula is\nexamined by calculating the errors in the estimation of mass parameters at each\norder. The estimation of the mass parameters ${\\cal M}$ and $\\eta$ are\nsignificantly enhanced by using the 3.5PN waveform instead of the 2PN one.

This has an immediate\napplication to the reheating problem in inflationary universe models. The\nlinear regime analysis offers a rationale for the standard approach to the\nreheating problem, but we make a distinction between relaxation and\nthermalization.

The most probable tunneling trajectory corresponds\nto a zero value of the inflaton field; large values, necessary for the second\nperiod of inflation inside the bubble, only arise as localized fluctuations.\nThe interior of each nucleated bubble will contain an infinite number of such\ninflating regions of comoving size of order $\\gamma^{-1}$, where $\\gamma$\ndepends on the parameters of the model.

Based on a\nparticular ansatz for the effective potential for the inflaton and radion\n(which may emerge in string theory), we show that the early expansion of the\nUniverse may proceed in three stages. First, the radion becomes trapped at a\nvalue much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions today. Second, the\nUniverse expands exponentially, but with a Planck mass smaller than its present\nvalue. Because the Planck mass during inflation is small, density fluctuations\nin agreement with observations can arise naturally. Third, when inflation ends,\nthe Universe reheats, and the radion becomes free to expand once more. During\nthe third phase the Universe is ``radiation-dominated'' and tends toward a\nfixed-point evolutionary model in which the radion grows but the temperature\nremains unchanged. Ultimately, the radion becomes trapped once again at its\npresent value, and a short period of exponential expansion, which we identify\nwith the electroweak phase transition, ensues. Once this epoch is over, the\nUniverse reheats to a temperature of order the electroweak scale, and the\nmature Universe evolves as in standard cosmological models.

We review the analogous procedure between higher order\ngravities and GR, as described in our previous works, in order to highlight its\nimportant achievements. Amongst which are presentation of an easy\nclassification of higher order Lagrangians and its employment as a\n\\emph{criteria} in order to distinguish correct metric theories of gravity. For\nexample, it does not permit the inclusion of only one of the second order\nLagrangians in \\emph{isolation}. But, it does allow the inclusion of the\ncosmological term. We also discuss on the compatibility of our procedure and\nthe Mach idea. We derive a dimensional dependent version of Duff's trace\nanomaly relation, which in \\emph{four}-dimension is the same as the usual Duff\nrelation. The Lanczos Lagrangian satisfies this new constraint in \\emph{any}\ndimension. The square of the Weyl tensor identically satisfies it independent\nof dimension, however, this Lagrangian satisfies the previous relation only in\nthree and four dimensions. \n\n"}

Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and\n  Conservation Laws Abstract: Emmy Noether proved two deep theorems, and their converses, on the connection\nbetween symmetries and conservation laws. Because these theorems are not in the\nmainstream of her scholarly work, which was the development of modern abstract\nalgebra, it is of some historical interest to examine how she came to make\nthese discoveries. The present paper is an historical account of the\ncircumstances in which she discovered and proved these theorems which\nphysicists refer to collectively as Noether's Theorem. The work was done soon\nafter Hilbert's discovery of the variational principle which gives the field\nequations of general relativity. The failure of local energy conservation in\nthe general theory was a problem that concerned people at that time, among them\nDavid Hilbert, Felix Klein, and Albert Einstein. Noether's theorems solved this\nproblem. With her characteristically deep insight and thorough analysis, in\nsolving that problem she discovered very general theorems that have profoundly\ninfluenced modern physics. \n\n"}

A similar result is obtained\nnumerically for the quantum adiabatic evolution Exact Cover algorithm, which\nalso shows universality of the quantum phase transition the system evolves\nnearby. On the other hand, entanglement in Grover's adiabatic algorithm remains\na bounded quantity even at the critical point. A classification of scaling of\nentanglement appears as a natural grading of the computational complexity of\nsimulating quantum phase transitions. \n\n"}

Recently, there has been work on\ndeveloping a consistent way of including constraints into the phase space path\nintegral that naturally arises in coherent state quantization. This new\napproach has many advantages over other approaches, including the lack of any\nGribov problems, the independence of gauge fixing, and the ability to handle\nsecond-class constraints without any ambiguous determinants.
