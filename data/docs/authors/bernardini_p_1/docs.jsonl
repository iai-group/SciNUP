Abstract: Using accurate and fully general-relativistic simulations we assess the\neffect that magnetic fields have on the gravitational-wave emission produced\nduring the inspiral and merger of magnetized neutron stars. In particular, we\nshow that magnetic fields have an impact after the merger, because they are\namplified by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but also during the inspiral, most\nlikely because the magnetic tension reduces the stellar tidal deformation for\nextremely large initial magnetic fields, B_0>~10^{17}G. We quantify the\ninfluence of magnetic fields by computing the overlap, O, between the waveforms\nproduced during the inspiral by magnetized and unmagnetized binaries. We find\nthat for any realistic magnetic field strength B_0<~10^{14}G the overlap during\nthe inspiral is O>~0.999 and is quite insensitive to the mass of the neutron\nstars. Only for unrealistically large magnetic fields like B_0~10^{17}G the\noverlap does decrease noticeably, becoming at our resolutions O<~0.76/0.67 for\nstars with baryon masses M_b~1.4/1.6 Msun, respectively.

{"id": "0905.0904", "contents": "Title: Inhomogeneity in the Supernova Remnants as a Natural Explanation of the\n  PAMELA/ATIC Observations Abstract: Recent measurements of the positron/electron ratio in the cosmic ray (CR)\nflux exhibits an apparent anomaly, whereby this ratio increases between 10 and\n100 GeV. In contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standard\nscenario, in which CR positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactions\nbetween the primary CR protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The positron\nexcess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay of\nweakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source of\npairs. The common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke new\nphysics or new astrophysical sources. However, this line of argumentation\nrelies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source\ndistribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can\nnaturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc\naway, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies\n(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nbefore reaching the solar vicinity. Pairs formed in the local vicinity through\nthe proton/ISM interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,\nthus increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source\ninhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiral\narms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and\ntaking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we\nconsistently predict the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV,\nwhile abiding to different constraints such as the observed electron spectrum\nand the CRs cosmogenic age. An ATIC like spectral excess at ~600 GeV can be\nexplained, in this picture, as the contribution of a few known nearby SNRs. \n\n"}

The calculation is carried out in the Lorenz\ngauge: For a given geodesic orbit, we decompose the Lorenz-gauge metric\nperturbation equations (sourced by the delta-function particle) into tensorial\nharmonics, and solve for each harmonic using numerical evolution in the time\ndomain (in 1+1 dimensions). The physical self-force along the orbit is then\nobtained via mode-sum regularization. The total self-force contains a\ndissipative piece as well as a conservative piece, and we describe a simple\nmethod for disentangling these two pieces in a time-domain framework. The\ndissipative component is responsible for the loss of orbital energy and angular\nmomentum through gravitational radiation; as a test of our code we demonstrate\nthat the work done by the dissipative component of the computed force is\nprecisely balanced by the asymptotic fluxes of energy and angular momentum,\nwhich we extract independently from the wave-zone numerical solutions. The\nconservative piece of the self force does not affect the time-averaged rate of\nenergy and angular-momentum loss, but it influences the evolution of the\norbital phases; this piece is calculated here for the first time in eccentric\nstrong-field orbits.

In three dimensions,\nthis Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) can develop spiral modes that\nspin-up the protoneutron star. Here we study these non-axisymmetric modes by\ncombining linear stability analysis and three-dimensional, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic simulations with Zeus-MP, focusing on characterizing their spatial\nstructure and angular momentum content. We do not impose any rotation on the\nbackground accretion flow, and use simplified microphysics with no neutrino\nheating or nuclear dissociation. Spiral modes are examined in isolation by\nchoosing flow parameters such that only the fundamental mode is unstable for a\ngiven polar index, leading to good agreement with linear theory. We find that\nany superposition of sloshing modes with non-zero relative phases survives in\nthe nonlinear regime and leads to angular momentum redistribution. It follows\nthat the range of perturbations required to obtain spin-up is broader than that\nneeded to obtain the limiting case of a phase shift of pi/2. The bulk of the\nangular momentum redistribution occurs during a phase of exponential growth,\nand arises from internal torques that are second order in the perturbation\namplitude.

The tracker\nis surrounded by the former UA1/Nomad dipole magnet and the TPCs measure the\ncharges, momenta, and particle types of charged particles passing through them.\nNovel features of the TPC design include its rectangular box layout constructed\nfrom composite panels, the use of bulk micromegas detectors for gas\namplification, electronics readout based on a new ASIC, and a photoelectron\ncalibration system. This paper describes the design and construction of the\nTPCs, the micromegas modules, the readout electronics, the gas handling system,\nand shows the performance of the TPCs as deduced from measurements with\nparticle beams, cosmic rays, and the calibration system. \n\n"}

As the neutron star spirals towards the center of its companion\nit spins up via disk accretion. Depending on the specific angular momentum of\ngas captured by the neutron star via the Bondi-Hoyle mechanism, it may reach\nmillisecond periods either when it is still inside the common envelope or after\nit has merged with the companion core. The high accretion rate may result in\nstrong differential rotation of the neutron star and generation of the\nmagnetar-strength magnetic field. The magnetar wind can blow away the common\nenvelope if its magnetic field is as strong as $10^{15}\\,$G, and can destroy\nthe entire companion if it is as strong as $10^{16}\\,$G.

However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric\ngravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In\nthis paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse\nmodels leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of\ncollapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior\nrestrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show\nthat when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the\nenergy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus\noffering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of\nvarious possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy\nparticles from the vicinity of naked singularity.

This is due\nto the large radial velocity of the ADAF. It is found that the magnetic\npressure can be as high as ~50% of the gas pressure in the inner region of the\nADAF close to the black hole horizon, even if the external imposed vertical\nfield strength is <5% of the gas pressure at the outer radius of the ADAF,\nwhich is caused by the gas plunging rapidly to the black hole within the\nmarginal stable circular orbit. In the inner region of the ADAF, the flow is\nsignificantly pressured in the vertical direction by the magnetic field, and\ntherefore its gas pressure can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in\nthe ADAF without magnetic fields. This means that the magnetic field strength\nnear the black hole is underestimated by assuming equipartition between\nmagnetic and gas pressure with the conventional ADAF model. Our results show\nthat the magnetic field strength of the flow near the black hole horizon can be\nmore than one order of magnitude higher than that in the ADAF at 6GM/c^2, which\nimplies the Blandford-Znajek mechanism could be more important than the\nBlandford-Payne mechanism for ADAFs. We find that the accretion flow is\ndecelerated near the black hole by the magnetic field when the external imposed\nfield is strong enough or the gas pressure of the flow is low at the outer\nradius, or both. This corresponds to a critical accretion rate, below which the\naccretion flow will be arrested by the magnetic field near the black hole for a\ngiven external imposed field. In this case, the gas may accrete as magnetically\nconfined blobs diffusing through field lines in the region very close to the\nblack hole horizon, which is similar to those in compact stars. \n\n"}

The resulting ultra-relativistic pairs are assumed to lose\nenergy through inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons. In Broderick et al.\n(2011, Paper I of this three paper series), we argued that instead powerful\nplasma instabilities in the ultra-relativistic pair beam dissipate the kinetic\nenergy of the TeV-generated pairs locally, heating the intergalactic medium\n(IGM). Here, we explore the effect of this heating upon the thermal history of\nthe IGM. We collate the observed extragalactic VHEGR sources to determine a\nlocal VHEGR heating rate and correct for the pointed nature of VHEGR\nobservations using Fermi observations of high and intermediate peaked BL Lacs.\nBecause the local extragalactic VHEGR flux is dominated by TeV blazars, we tie\nthe TeV blazar luminosity density to the quasar luminosity density, and produce\na VHEGR heating rate as a function of redshift. This heating is relatively\nhomogeneous for z<~4 with increasing spatial variation at higher redshift\n(order unity at z~6). This new heating process dominates photoheating at low\nredshift and the inclusion of TeV blazar heating qualitatively and\nquantitatively changes the structure and history of the IGM. TeV blazars\nproduce a uniform volumetric heating rate that is sufficient to increase the\ntemperature of the mean density IGM by nearly an order of magnitude, and at low\ndensities by substantially more, naturally producing an inverted equation of\nstate inferred by observations of the Ly-alpha forest, a feature that is\ndifficult to reconcile with standard reionization models. Finally, we close\nwith a discussion on the possibility of detecting this hot low-density IGM, but\nfind that such measurements are currently not feasible. (abridged) \n\n"}

This scheme combines\ntools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which\nprovides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and\ncurrent octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since\nwe are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for\nthe computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH\nperturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of\nself-adjusting Kerr geodesics.

While both\nthe Virgo and the Field samples feature highly sub-Eddington X-ray luminosities\n(log L_x/L_Edd between -8 and -4), we find that after accounting for the\ninfluence of host galaxy stellar mass, the field early-type galaxies tend\ntoward marginally greater (0.38+/-0.14 dex) nuclear X-ray luminosities, at a\ngiven black hole mass, than their cluster counterparts. This trend is\nqualitatively consistent with the field black holes having access to a greater\nreservoir of fuel, plausibly in the form of cold gas located near the nucleus.\nWe are able to rule out at high confidence the alternative of enhanced X-ray\nactivity within clusters. Presuming nuclear X-ray emission correlates with the\ntotal energy and momentum output of these weakly accreting black holes, this\nindicates that low-level active galactic nucleus feedback is not generally\nstronger within typical cluster galaxies than in the field.

For example, imagine a researcher looking at a 3D volume visualization\nof simulated or observed data, and simultaneously viewing statistical displays\nof the data set's properties (such as an x-y plot of temperature vs. velocity,\nor a histogram of vorticities).

Electrons reach energies sufficient for\nproduction of hard $\\gamma$-ray spectra in the curvature radiation process. Due\nto different curvature radii of the leading and trailing magnetic field lines,\nthe $\\gamma$-ray spectra from separate pulses should extend to different\nmaximum energies.

The main goal of this analysis was to study the effect of initial\nhighly-anisotropic stages on the final soft hadronic observables typically\nmeasured in the experiment. The study was done in the context of the heavy-ion\nmeasurements performed at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) in Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory. Starting from the general assumption about the form of the\nphase-space distribution function, thermodynamic properties of locally\nanisotropic systems of particles have been studied and the form of the\ngeneralized equation of state has been formulated. The dynamic equations\ndetermining the evolution of a highly-anisotropic fluid have been introduced.\nThe form of the entropy source related to the mechanisms leading to\nthermalization of the system has been defined. In the simplest case of\npurely-longitudinal and boost-invariant expansion, different features of the\nmodel have been analyzed.

The dissipative photosphere models are also challenged if the\ncosmic ray luminosity from GRBs is at least 10 times larger than the gamma-ray\nluminosity. If the neutrino flux upper limit continues to go down in the next\nfew years, then it would suggest the following possibilities: 1. the\nphoton-to-proton luminosity ratio in GRBs is anomalously high for shocks, which\nmay be achieved in some dissipative photosphere models and magnetic dissipation\nmodels; or 2. the GRB emission site is at a larger radius than the internal\nshock radius, as expected in some magnetic dissipation models such as the\nICMART model. \n\n"}

We study the prospects of this resolution by the current T2K and\nupcoming NOvA experiments. Because of the hierarchy-deltacp degeneracy and the\noctant-deltacp degeneracy, the impact of hierarchy on octant resolution has to\nbe taken into account. As in the case of hierarchy determination, there exist\nfavorable (unfavorable) values of deltacp for which octant resolution is easy\n(challenging). However, for octant resolution the unfavorable deltacp values of\nthe neutrino data are favorable for the anti-neutrino data and vice-verse. This\nis in contrast to the case of hierarchy determination. In this paper, we\ncompute the combined sensitivity of T2K and NOvA to resolve the octant\nambiguity. If sin^2\\theta23 =0.41, then NOvA can rule out all the values of\ntheta23 in HO at 2 sigma C.L., irrespective of the hierarchy and deltacp.\nAddition of T2K data improves the octant sensitivity.

This\nresult, if confirmed by the upcoming Planck data, has deep implications on the\ndiscovery of the nature of neutrinos. In particular, the values of the\neffective neutrino mass involved in neutrinoless double beta decay (bb0nu) are\nseverely constrained for both the direct and inverse hierarchy, making a\ndiscovery much more likely.

We here treat this\ntheory as an effective model, working to leading order in the Chern-Simons\ncoupling. We first construct isolated neutron star solutions in the\nslow-rotation expansion to quadratic order in spin. We find that isolated\nneutron stars acquire a scalar dipole charge that corrects its spin angular\nmomentum to linear order in spin and corrects its mass and quadrupole moment to\nquadratic order in spin, as measured by an observer at spatial infinity. We\nthen consider neutron stars binaries that are widely separated and solve for\ntheir orbital evolution in this modified theory. We find that the evolution of\npost-Keplerian parameters is modified, with the rate of periastron advance\nbeing the dominant correction at first post-Newtonian order.

During the accretion stage, the system is\ncalled a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the\nrate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these\nbinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the\nneutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by\nthe detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron\nstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered\nmillisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may\ntemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.\nOnly indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here we\nreport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a\nneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few\ndays after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This\nnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered\nmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the two\nstates on very short timescales. \n\n"}

We allow for both the\ninclusion and the omission of the effects of magnetic fields in the angular\nmomentum transport and in chemical mixing, resulting in slowly-rotating and\nrapidly-rotating final carbon-oxygen cores, respectively. Increased rotation\nfor carbon-oxygen cores of the same mass and chemical stratification leads to\nless energetic PISN explosions that produce smaller amounts of Ni-56 due to the\neffect of the angular momentum barrier that develops and slows the dynamical\ncollapse. We find a non-monotonic dependence of Ni-56 production on rotational\nvelocity in situations when smoother composition gradients form at the outer\nedge of the rotating cores. In these cases, the PISN energetics are determined\nby the competition of two factors: the extent of chemical mixing in the outer\nlayers of the core due to the effects of rotation in the progenitor evolution\nand the development of angular momentum support against collapse.

The\ncause of this low radio detection rate has previously been attributed to\nlimited observing sensitivity.

Short GRBs have long been suspected on\ntheoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (NS-NS or\nNS-BH). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005, provided the first\ninsight into their energy scale and environments, established a cosmological\norigin, a mix of host galaxy types, and an absence of associated supernovae. In\nthis review I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host galaxy\nobservations, and use this information to shed light on the nature and\nproperties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the\nrelativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments.

Abstract: The detectors of the UltraViolet Spectrographs (UVS) on Voyager 1/2 are\nrecording a background that was earlier assigned to disintegrations in the RTG.\nWe show that it arises instead from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). We show the\n1992-2013 GCR flux measured by UVS on V1 and, by comparing with data from the\nGCR dedicated detectors, we estimate the energy range responsible for this UVS\nsignal, around 300 MeV, and the response of UVS to the GCR anisotropy. After\nthe abrupt jumps of May and August 2012 the count rate has been fluctuating\nonly slightly around a constant value, but comparing with data from the LECP\nand the CRS instruments shows that those small variations are only responses to\na varying anisotropy and not to a flux change. Taking advantage of the\nsimilarity in energy range to one of the products of the CRS instrument suite,\nwe use the ratio between the two independent signals as a proxy for the\ntemporal evolution of the GCR spectral slope around the 300 MeV range. We show\nthat this slope has remained unchanged since Aug 2012 and find strong evidence\nthat it will no longer vary, implying the end of the modulation at those\nenergies and that V1 at this date is near or past the heliopause. The origin of\nthis narrow and stagnating inner heliosheath is still unclear, and we discuss\nthe potential effects of low solar wind speed episodes and subsequent\nself-amplified charge-exchange with interstellar neutrals, as a source of\ndeceleration and collapse. We suggest that the quasi-static region encountered\nby V1 may be related to such effects, triggered by the strong post\nsolar-maximum variability. This did not happen for V2 due to its trajectory at\nan angle further from the heliosphere axis and a later termination shock\ncrossing.

Abstract: We reconsider the possibility that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the sources of\nthe ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) within the internal shock model,\nassuming a pure proton composition of the UHECRs. For the first time, we\ncombine the information from gamma-rays, cosmic rays, prompt neutrinos, and\ncosmogenic neutrinos quantitatively in a joint cosmic ray production and\npropagation model, and we show that the information on the cosmic energy budget\ncan be obtained as a consequence. In addition to the neutron model, we consider\nalternative scenarios for the cosmic ray escape from the GRBs, i.e., that\ncosmic rays can leak from the sources. We find that the dip model, which\ndescribes the ankle in UHECR observations by the pair production dip, is\nstrongly disfavored in combination with the internal shock model because a)\nunrealistically high baryonic loadings (energy in protons versus energy in\nelectrons/gamma-rays) are needed for the individual GRBs and b) the prompt\nneutrino flux easily overshoots the corresponding neutrino bound.

As the emission comes from a finite distance of a few\nkilometers, the incident wavefront is non-planar.

The thermodynamic structure of the tail strongly supports an overall\nnorthwestward motion. We propose, that a sloshing-induced tangential, ambient,\ncoherent gas flow is bending the tail eastward. The brightest galaxy of this\nsubcluster is at the leading edge of the dense core, and is trailed by the tail\nof stripped gas, suggesting that the cool core of the subcluster has been\nalmost completely destroyed by the time it reached its current radius of r ~\n500 kpc. The surface-brightness excess, likely associated with gas stripped\nfrom the infalling southern subcluster, extends toward the southeast out to at\nleast r_500 of the main cluster, indicating that the stripping of infalling\nsubclusters may seed gas inhomogeneities. The second merging subcluster appears\nto be a diffuse non-cool core system. Its merger is likely supersonic with a\nMach number of ~ 1.4. \n\n"}

Raw count maps show a superposition\nof diffuse and point-like emission structures and are subject to shot noise and\ninstrumental artifacts. Using the D3PO inference algorithm, we model the\nobserved photon counts as the sum of a diffuse and a point-like photon flux,\nconvolved with the instrumental beam and subject to Poissonian shot noise. D3PO\nperforms a Bayesian inference in this setting without the use of spatial or\nspectral templates;i.e., it removes the shot noise, deconvolves the\ninstrumental response, and yields estimates for the two flux components\nseparately. The non-parametric reconstruction uncovers the morphology of the\ndiffuse photon flux up to several hundred GeV. We present an all-sky spectral\nindex map for the diffuse component. We show that the diffuse gamma-ray flux\ncan be described phenomenologically by only two distinct components: a soft\ncomponent, presumably dominated by hadronic processes, tracing the dense, cold\ninterstellar medium and a hard component, presumably dominated by leptonic\ninteractions, following the hot and dilute medium and outflows such as the\nFermi bubbles.

In this paper, we continue our study by investigating the\ndetailed properties of wind, such as mass flux and poloidal speed, and the\nmechanism of wind production. For this aim, we make use of a three dimensional\nGRMHD simulation of hot accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. The\nsimulation is designed so that the magnetic flux is not accumulated\nsignificantly around the black hole. To distinguish real wind from turbulent\noutflows, we track the trajectories of the virtual Largrangian particles from\nsimulation data. We find two types of real outflows, i.e., a quasi-relativistic\njet close to the axis and a sub-relativistic wind subtending a much larger\nsolid angle. Most of the wind originates from the surface layer of the\naccretion flow. The poloidal wind speed almost remains constant once they are\nproduced, but the flux-weighted wind speed roughly follows $v_{\\rm p,\nwind}(r)\\approx 0.25 v_k(r)$. The mass flux of jet is much lower but the speed\nis much higher, $v_{\\rm p,jet}\\sim (0.3-0.4) c$. Consequently, both the energy\nand momentum fluxes of the wind are much larger than those of the jet.

This can happen if the process\ninvolves a particle on an outgoing trajectory very close to the black hole.\nClearly such a particle cannot emerge from the black hole.

Most of the\nexisting directional dark matter detectors utilize particle tracking methods in\na low-pressure gas time projection chamber.

For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios\nconsidered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and\nnutation during the evolution.

Our lightest model, which is the most\nastrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is\nstable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated\nduring the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment\nof black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with\nconstant specific angular momentum l.

Abstract: A very general cosmological consideration suggests that, along with galactic\ndark matter halos, much smaller dark matter structures may exist. These\nstructures are usually called 'clumps', and their mass extends to $10^{-6}\nM_\\odot$ or even lower. The clumps should give the main contribution into the\nsignal of dark matter annihilation, provided that they have survived until the\npresent time. Recent observations favor a cored profile for low-mass\nastrophysical halos. We consider cored clumps and show that they are\nsignificantly less firm than the standard NFW ones. In contrast to the standard\nscenario, the cored clumps should have been completely destroyed inside $\\sim\n20$~{kpc} from the Milky Way center.

On the other hand, even under the most pessimistic\nassumption about the clump structure, the clumps should have survived in the\nMilky Way at a distance exceeding $50$~{kpc} from the center, as well as in\nlow-density cosmic structures.

We model the\ncontribution of Galactic MSPs to the terrestrial cosmic-ray electron / positron\nflux by using a population synthesis code to predict the source properties of\npresent-day MSPs. We simulate pair spectra assuming an offset-dipole magnetic\nfield which boosts pair creation rates. We also consider positrons and\nelectrons that have additionally been accelerated to very high energies in the\nstrong intrabinary shocks in black widow (BW) and redback (RB) binary systems.\nWe transport these particles to Earth by calculating their diffusion and the\nradiative energy losses they suffer in the Galaxy using a model. Our model\nparticle flux increases for non-zero offsets of the magnetic polar caps. We\nfind that pair cascades from MSP magnetospheres contribute only modestly around\na few tens of GeV to the measured fluxes.

Originally consisting of just four\nidentical IACTs (CT1-4) with an effective mirror diameter of 12$\\,$m each, it\nwas expanded with a fifth IACT (CT5) with a mirror diameter of 28$\\,$m in 2012.\nBeing the largest IACT worldwide, CT5 allows to lower the energy threshold of\nH.E.S.S., making the array sensitive at energies where space-based detectors\nrun out of statistics. Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable.

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion.

We investigate the DM interpretation of the Galactic Center\ngamma-ray excess by searching for the associated synchrotron in the WMAP-Planck\ndata. Considering various magnetic field and cosmic-ray propagation models, we\npredict the synchrotron emission due to DM annihilation in our Galaxy, and\ncompare it with the WMAP-Planck data at 23-70GHz. In addition to standard\nmicrowave foregrounds, we separately model the microwave counterpart to the\nFermi Bubbles and the signal due to DM, and use component separation techniques\nto extract the signal associated with each template from the total emission. We\nconfirm the presence of the Haze at the level of 7% of the total sky intensity\nat 23GHz in our chosen region of interest, with a harder spectrum $I \\sim\n\\nu^{-0.8}$ than the synchrotron from regular cosmic-ray electrons.

Abstract: By using subsets of the HATNet and K2 (Kepler two-wheel) Campaign 1\ndatabases, we examine the effectiveness of filtering out systematics from\nphotometric time series while simultaneously searching for periodic signals. We\ncarry out tests to recover simulated sinusoidal and transit signals added to\ntime series with both real and artificial noise. We find that the simple (and\nmore traditional) method that performs correction for systematics first and\nsignal search thereafter, produces higher signal recovery rates on the average,\nwhile also being substantially faster than the simultaneous method.\nIndependently of the method of search, once the signal is found, a far less\ntime consuming full-fledged model, incorporating both the signal and\nsystematics, must be employed to recover the correct signal shape. As a\nby-product of the tests on the K2 data, we find that for longer period\nsinusoidal signals the detection rate decreases (after an optimum value is\nreached) as the number of light curves used for systematics filtering\nincreases. The decline of the detection rate is observable in both methods of\nfiltering, albeit the simultaneous method performs better in the regime of\nrelative high template number. We suspect that the observed phenomenon is\nlinked to the increased role of low amplitude intrinsic stellar variability in\nthe space-based data. This assumption is also supported by the substantially\nhigher stability of the detection rates for transit signals against the\nincrease of the template number. \n\n"}

Six months of radio observations of\nthe 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with\nSwift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered,\nnon-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ of\nfreely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical\nspectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away\n(3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low\nfrequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high\nradio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard ($kT_x > 33$ keV)\nX-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the\nconclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal. Unlike most other\nnovae with strong shock-powered radio emission, V5589 Sgr is not embedded in\nthe wind of a red-giant companion. Based on the similar inclinations and\noptical line profiles of V5589 Sgr and V959 Mon, we propose that shocks in\nV5589 Sgr formed from collisions between a slow flow with an equatorial density\nenhancement and a subsequent faster flow. We speculate that the relatively high\nspeed and low mass of the ejecta led to the unusual radio emission from V5589\nSgr, and perhaps also to the non-detection of $\\gamma$-rays. \n\n"}

The dense ISM and high star formation rates of\nluminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) imply that\nthey should be strong gamma-ray emitters, but so far only two LIRGs have been\ndetected. Theoretical models for their emission depend on the unknown fraction\nof cosmic ray protons that escape these galaxies before interacting. We analyze\nFermi-LAT data for 82 of the brightest IRAS LIRGs and ULIRGs. We examine each\nsystem individually and carry out a stacking analysis to constrain their\ngamma-ray fluxes. We report the detection of the nearest ULIRG Arp 220\n(~4.6sigma). We observe a gamma-ray flux (0.8--100 GeV) of 2.4e-10 phot cm^-2\ns^-1 with photon index of 2.23 (8.2e10^41 ergs s^-1 at 77 Mpc) We also derive\nupper limits for the stacked LIRGs and ULIRGs. The gamma-ray luminosity of\nArp~220 and the stacked upper limits agree with calorimetric predictions for\ndense star-forming galaxies.

Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have commonly been considered as a source of the\nobserved PeV cosmic rays (CRs) or a Galactic PeV particle accelerator\n(\"Pevatron\"). In this work, we study Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which is the\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, as another\npossible canditate of the Pevatron, because it sometimes became very active in\nthe past. We assume that a large number of PeV CRs were injected by Sgr A* at\nthe outburst about 10^7 yr ago when the Fermi bubbles were created. We\nconstrain the diffusion coefficient for the CRs in the Galactic halo on the\ncondition that the CRs have arrived on the Earth by now, while a fairly large\nfraction of them have escaped from the halo. Based on a diffusion-halo model,\nwe solve a diffusion equation for the CRs and compare the results with the CR\nspectrum on the Earth. The observed small anisotropy of the arrival directions\nof CRs may be explained if the diffusion coefficient in the Galactic disk is\nsmaller than that in the halo. Our model predicts that a boron-to-carbon ratio\nshould be energy-independent around the knee, where the CRs from Sgr A* become\ndominant.

The helium concentration profile in galaxy\nclusters is unfortunately not directly observable. Current models addressing\nthe putative sedimentation are one-dimensional and parametrize the presence of\nmagnetic fields in a crude way, ignoring the weakly-collisional, magnetized\nnature of the medium.

In a series of\nrecent papers, we have developed the local, linear theory of these\ninstabilities and addressed their non-linear development with a modified\nversion of Athena.

The reflected/reprocessed radiation comes\nto us with a delay corresponding to the light propagation time that depends on\nthe 3D position of molecular clouds with respect to Sgr A*. We suggest a novel\nway of determining the age of the outburst and positions of the clouds by\nstudying characteristic imprints left by the outburst in the spatial and time\nvariations of the reflected emission. We estimated the age of the outburst that\nilluminates the Sgr A molecular complex to be ~110 yr. This estimate implies\nthat we see the gas located ~10 pc further away from us than Sgr A*. If the Sgr\nB2 complex is also illuminated by the same outburst, then it is located ~130 pc\ncloser than our Galactic Center. The outburst was short (less than a few years)\nand the total amount of emitted energy in X-rays is $\\displaystyle \\sim\n10^{48}\\rho_3^{-1}$ erg, where $\\rho_3$ is the mean hydrogen density of the\ncloud complex in units of $10^3 {\\rm cm^{-3}}$.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has the largest field of\nview (FOV) for detecting GRBs as it views the entire unocculted sky, but as a\nnon-imaging instrument it relies on the relative count rates observed in each\nof its 14 detectors to localize transients. Improving its ability to accurately\nlocate GRBs and other transients is vital to the paradigm of multi-messenger\nastronomy, including the electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave\nsignals. Here we present the BAyesian Location Reconstruction Of GRBs ({\\tt\nBALROG}) method for localizing and characterising GBM transients. Our approach\neliminates the systematics of previous approaches by simultaneously fitting for\nthe location and spectrum of a source. It also correctly incorporates the\nuncertainties in the location of a transient into the spectral parameters and\nproduces reliable positional uncertainties for both well-localized sources and\nthose for which the GBM data cannot effectively constrain the position. While\ncomputationally expensive, {\\tt BALROG} can be implemented to enable quick\nfollow-up of all GBM transient signals. Also, we identify possible response\nproblems that require attention as well as caution when using standard, public\nGBM DRMs. Finally, we examine the effects of including the variance in location\non the spectral parameters of GRB 080916C. We find that spectral parameters\nchange and no extra components are required when these effects are included in\ncontrast to when we use a fixed location. This finding has the potential to\nalter both the GRB spectral catalogs as well as the reported spectral\ncomposition of some well-known GRBs. \n\n"}

So a telescope that merely achieves its stated science goals is\nnot achieving its potential scientific productivity. Several next-generation\nastronomical survey telescopes are currently being designed and constructed\nthat will significantly expand the volume of observational parameter space, and\nshould in principle discover unexpected new phenomena and new types of object.\nHowever, the complexity of the telescopes and the large data volumes mean that\nthese discoveries are unlikely to be found by chance.

To this end, we introduce the\nfree energy exploration (FrEE) strategy for numerical information field theory\n(NIFTy) applications. The FrEE strategy is to let the mathematical structure of\nthe inference problem determine the dynamics of the numerical solver.

Tycho's SNR\nis a particularly good target because it is a young, type Ia SNR that is\nwell-studied over a wide range of energies and located in a relatively clean\nenvironment. Since the detection of gamma-ray emission from Tycho's SNR by\nVERITAS and Fermi-LAT, there have been several theoretical models proposed to\nexplain its broadband emission and high-energy morphology. We report on an\nupdate to the gamma-ray measurements of Tycho's SNR with 147 hours of VERITAS\nand 84 months of Fermi-LAT observations, which represents about a factor of two\nincrease in exposure over previously published data. About half of the VERITAS\ndata benefited from a camera upgrade, which has made it possible to extend the\nTeV measurements toward lower energies. The TeV spectral index measured by\nVERITAS is consistent with previous results, but the expanded energy range\nsoftens a straight power-law fit. At energies higher than 400 GeV, the\npower-law index is $2.92 \\pm 0.42_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 0.20_{\\mathrm{sys}}$.

This evidence is\nbased on both the wave-like morphology of the filament as well as the\nkinematics of the gas and stars, where the characteristic velocities of the\nstars require a dynamical heating mechanism. As proposed by Stutz and Gould\n(2016), such a heating mechanism (the \"Slingshot\") may be the result of an\noscillating gas filament in a gas-dominated (as opposed to stellar-mass\ndominated) system. Here we test this hypothesis with the first\nstellar-dynamical simulations in which the stars are subjected to the influence\nof an oscillating cylindrical potential. The accelerating, cylindrical\nbackground potential is populated with a narrow distribution of stars. By\ncoupling the potential to N-body dynamics, we are able to measure the influence\nof the potential on the stellar distribution. The simulations provide evidence\nthat the slingshot mechanism can successfully reproduce several stringent\nobservational constraints. These include the stellar spread (both in projected\nposition and in velocity) around the filament, the symmetry in these\ndistributions, and a bulk motion of the stars with respect to the filament.\nUsing simple considerations we show that star-star interactions are incapable\nof reproducing these spreads on their own when properly accounting for the gas\npotential. Thus, properly accounting for the gas potential is essential for\nunderstanding the dynamical evolution of star forming filamentary systems in\nthe era of Gaia. \n\n"}

Results are presented on the reconstruction of Michel\nelectrons produced by the decay at rest of cosmic-ray muons. Michel electrons\nare abundantly produced in the TPC, and given their well known energy spectrum\ncan be used to study MicroBooNE's detector response to low-energy electrons\n(electrons with energies up to ~50 MeV).

The fragment\npresents a bowshock-like shape with its anti-apex pointing to the center of the\nremnant.

We did not detect any rebrightening behaviour, suggesting\nthat the physical mechanism behind the rebrightening events is not always\nactive after each outburst of the source. Any model attempting to explain these\nrebrightenings should thus be able to reproduce the different outburst profiles\nof the source at different times. Surprisingly, our Swift/XRT observations were\nunable to detect the source, contrary to previous Swift/XRT observations in\nquiescence.

Strangeon\nstars would be solidified during cooling, and the solid stars would be natural\nto have glitches as the result of starquakes. Based on the starquake model\nestablished before, we proposed that when the starquake occurs, the inner\nmotion of the star which changes the moment of inertia and has impact on the\nglitch sizes, is divided into plastic flow and elastic motion. The plastic flow\nwhich is induced in the fractured part of the outer layer, would move\ntangentially to redistribute the matter of the star and would be hard to\nrecover. The elastic motion, on the other hand, changes its shape and would\nrecover significantly.

We model the CR spectra at the heliopause as sums of\nGalactic and local components based on observational data as much as possible.\nThe initial Galactic CR electron and proton spectra are deduced from the\ngamma-ray emissivity, the local electron spectrum from the hard X-ray spectra\nat the CVs, and the local proton spectrum inferred by gamma-ray spectrum at\nnovae. These spectral shapes are then expressed in a simple set of polynomial\nfunctions of CR energy and regressively fitted until the high-energy ($>$100\nGeV) CR spectra near Earth and the Voyager-1 spectra at the heliopause are\nreproduced. We then extend the modeling to nuclear CR spectra and find that one\nspectral shape fits all local nuclear CRs and the apparent hardening of the\nnuclear CR spectra is caused by the roll-down of local nuclear spectra around\n100 - 200 GeV. All local CR spectra populate in a limited energy band below 100\n- 200 GeV and enhance gamma-ray emissivity below $\\sim$10 GeV.

Free-free\nabsorption is affected by the mass, geometry, temperature, and ionisation\nconditions in the absorbing gas.

To reconcile our low frequency absorption measurements with\nmodels that predict little mass in the unshocked ejecta we need the ejecta to\nbe very clumped, or the temperature in the cold gas to be low ($\\sim10$ K).\nBoth conditions can jointly contribute to the high absorption. \n\n"}

The evolution of the\nmerger rate across redshifts $0 < z \\lesssim 1$ is directly tied to the\nformation and evolutionary processes, providing insight regarding the\nprogenitor formation rate together with the distribution of time delays between\nformation and merger. Because the limiting distance to which BBHs are detected\ndepends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected\nbinaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider\nthe mass and redshift distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate\ndensity, ${dN}/{dm_1\\,dm_2\\,dz}$. Our constraints on the mass distribution\nagree with previously published results, including evidence for an upper mass\ncutoff at $\\sim 40 \\ M_\\odot$.

A\nparticularly predictive model for the self-interactions is resonant short-range\ninteractions with an S-wave scattering length that is much larger than the\nrange. The velocity dependence of the cross section in such a model provides an\nexcellent fit to self-interaction cross sections inferred from dark-matter\nhalos of galaxies and clusters of galaxies if the dark-matter mass is about 19\nGeV and the scattering length is about 17 fm. Such a model makes definite\npredictions for the few-body physics of weakly bound clusters of the\ndark-matter particles. The formation of the two-body bound cluster is a\nbottleneck for the formation of larger bound clusters.

We focus and extend the\nstudy of the screening effect on the tidal deformability, which we found\npreviously for hybrid star models, to various theoretical two-layer compact\nstar models. We show that the screening effect of these two-layer models in\ngeneral depends on the thickness of the envelope and the ratio between the\ndensity gap and the core density at the core-envelope interface. However, for\nmodels with a fluid envelope and a vanishing small density gap, the screening\neffect remains strong even as the thickness of the envelops tends to zero if\nthe quark matter core has a fairly uniform density. The relevance of our study\nto GW170817 is also discussed. Our study advocates that the tidal deformability\nnot only provides us information on the EOS, but may also give insights into\nthe multi-layer structure and elastic properties of compact star models\ncomposed of CCS quark matter. \n\n"}

Abstract: Mass accretion rate is a key parameter in accretion disk theory. It\ndetermines black hole accretion mode. In large scale cosmological simulations\nstudying galaxy formation and evolution, Bondi radius can at most be marginally\nresolved. In those simulations, Bondi accretion formula is always used to\nestimate black hole accretion rate. Bondi solution is too simple, which cannot\nrepresent the real accretion process. We perform simulations of hot accretion\nflow at parsec scale irradiated by a low luminosity active galactic nucleus\n(AGN). We perform 77 simulations with varying density and temperature at outer\nboundary (10 parsec). Our purpose is to find a formula to calculate real black\nhole accretion rate based on the gas density and temperature at parsec scale.\nWe define Eddington accretion rate to be $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}=10L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$,\nwith $L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $c$ been Eddington luminosity and speed of light\nrespectively. We set black hole mass to be $10^8M_{\\odot}$, $M_{\\odot}$ is\nsolar mass.

The relativistic bound state problem for three quarks is considered.\nDiquarks are introduced as separable correlations in the two-quark correlation\nfunction and thereby baryons are described by a Bethe-Salpeter equation for\nbound states of quark and diquark which interact by quark exchange. In analogy\nto the meson spectrum, scalar and axialvector diquarks are considered to be the\nmost important two-quark configurations within baryons. The numerical solutions\nof the covariant Bethe-Salpeter equation are subsequently employed in the\ncalculation of electromagnetic, strong and axial form factors of the nucleons.\nThe construction of the electromagnetic current operator in the diquark-quark\nmodel respects gauge invariance. Invariance under chiral symmetry\ntransformations is slightly violated for vector diquarks have been neglected,\nleading to a modest violation of the Goldberger-Treiman relation. The\npossibility of an effective parametrization of confinement by suitable\nmodifications of the quark and diquark propagators is investigated. It is shown\nthat the modelling of confinement chosen here is suitable for the calculation\nof the octet and devuplet spectrum and spacelike nucleon properties, but its\napplicability breaks down for processes where large energies are transferred to\nthe nucleon as it is the case in certain meson production processes. Model\nsolutions for nucleon wave functions and observables are compared between the\nfull relativistic treatment and a widely used semi-relativistic approximation.\nThe considerable deviations in the results illustrate the inadequacy of\nemploying the semi-relativistic treatment. \n\n"}
