Our derivation relies on the techniques\ndeveloped in the semiclassical analysis of the Wigner $9j$ symbol [L. Yu and R.\nG. Littlejohn, Phys. Rev.

First, the\napplication of sophisticated matrix algorithms to the numerical solution of\nboth the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and the inhomogeneous vertex\nBSE is discussed, and the advantages of these methods are described in detail.\nTurning to the finite temperature formalism, the rainbow-truncated quark\nDyson-Schwinger equation is used to investigate the impact of different forms\nof the effective interaction on the chiral transition temperature.

The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models.

When quantum information is\nencoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to\nthermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without\nany active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors\nwell localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved\nfaithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the\ninverse temperature.

We start with a short review of the\nhistorical milestones on the path of constructing statistical-thermal models\nfor heavy-ion physics. We discovered that Heinz Koppe formulated in 1948 an\nalmost complete recipe for the statistical-thermal models. In 1950, Enrico\nFermi generalized this statistical approach, in which he started with a general\ncross-section formula and inserted into it simplifying assumptions about the\nmatrix element of the interaction process that likely reflects many features of\nthe high-energy reactions dominated by density in the phase space of final\nstates. In 1964, Hagedorn systematically analysed the high-energy phenomena\nusing all tools of statistical physics and introduced the concept of limiting\ntemperature based on the statistical bootstrap model. It turns to be quite\noften that many-particle systems can be studied with the help of\nstatistical-thermal methods. The analysis of yield multiplicities in\nhigh-energy collisions gives an overwhelming evidence for the chemical\nequilibrium in the final state. The strange particles might be an exception, as\nthey are suppressed at lower beam energies. However, their relative yields\nfulfill statistical equilibrium, as well. We review the equilibrium\nstatistical-thermal models for particle production, fluctuations and collective\nflow in heavy-ion experiments. We also review their reproduction of the lattice\nQCD thermodynamics at vanishing and finite chemical potential. During the last\ndecade, five conditions have been suggested to describe the universal behavior\nof the chemical freeze out parameters. \n\n"}

The usual attempts to resolve this conflict\nfor instance by appealing to decoherence or eigenstate thermalization are\nriddled with problems. This paper considers theoretical physics of thermalized\nsystems as it is done in practise and shows that all approaches to thermalized\nsystems presuppose in some form limits to linear superposition and\ndeterministic time evolution. These considerations include, among others, the\nclassical limit, extensivity, the concepts of entropy and equilibrium, and\nsymmetry breaking in phase transitions and quantum measurement. As a\nconclusion, the paper argues that the irreversibility and stochasticity of\nstatistical mechanics should be taken as a true property of nature.

From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity.

At the leading order O(p^2) the g-factor of the charged rho meson is\nfixed to be 2, implying that the rho meson at this order is treated just like a\npoint-like spin-1 particle. Beyond the leading order, one finds anomalous\nmagnetic interactions of the charged rho meson, involving the anomalous\nmagnetic moment, which give corrections to the effective mass. It is then\nsuggested that up to O(p^4) the charged rho meson tends to become massless. Of\ninterest is that nontrivial magnetic-dependence of neutral mesons emerges to\ngive rise to the significant mixing among neutral mesons. Consequently, it\nleads to the dramatic enhancement of the omega meson mass, which is testable in\nfuture lattice simulations. Corrections from terms beyond O(p^4) are also\naddressed. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, compiling\n(embedding) an optimization problem into the annealing hardware is itself a\ndifficult optimization problem and a major bottleneck currently preventing\nwidespread adoption. Additionally, while finding a single embedding is\ndifficult, no generalized method is known for tuning embeddings to use minimal\nhardware resources.

This is performed through next-to-next-to-leading\norder in the chiral power counting, in both the Weinberg and pionless schemes.\nAt next-to-next-to-leading order, the amplitude receives additional\ncontributions from the exchange of ultrasoft neutrinos, which can be expressed\nin terms of nuclear matrix elements of the weak current and excitation energies\nof the intermediate nucleus. These quantities also control the two-neutrino\ndouble beta-decay amplitude. Finally, we outline strategies to determine the\nlow-energy constants that appear in the potentials, by relating them to\nelectromagnetic couplings and/or by matching to lattice QCD calculations. \n\n"}

A dominant overhead in\nfault-tolerant quantum computation is the production of high-fidelity encoded\nqubits, called magic states, which enable reliable error-corrected computation.\nWe present the first detailed designs of hardware functional units that\nimplement space-time optimized magic-state factories for surface code\nerror-corrected machines. Interactions among distant qubits require surface\ncode braids (physical pathways on chip) which must be routed. Magic-state\nfactories are circuits comprised of a complex set of braids that is more\ndifficult to route than quantum circuits considered in previous work [1]. This\npaper explores the impact of scheduling techniques, such as gate reordering and\nqubit renaming, and we propose two novel mapping techniques: braid repulsion\nand dipole moment braid rotation. We combine these techniques with graph\npartitioning and community detection algorithms, and further introduce a\nstitching algorithm for mapping subgraphs onto a physical machine.

The cost is polylogarithmic in time and\nspace, and no measurements are used during the quantum computation. The result\nholds also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To\nachieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting\ncodes. The scheme presented is general, and works with all quantum codes that\nsatisfy some restrictions, namely that the code is ``proper''.\n  We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first example of\nproper quantum codes generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The\nsecond uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code.\nThis class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum\nparticle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''.
