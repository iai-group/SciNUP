The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\nrigidity regime that was not studied here.

The microscopic mechanism behind the glass\ntransition is still poorly understood.

In the model considered, Boolean networks\nevolve via a competition between nodes that punishes those in the majority. It\nis found that finite size networks evolve in a fundamentally different way than\ninfinitely large networks do. The symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics of\ninfinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is\nbroken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size\nnetworks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions\nthat output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are\nrevealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency\nof occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions\nare found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the\nsymmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant\nsymmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by\nutilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite\nsize and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the\nevolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size\nnetworks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system\ncollectively performs as well as possible. The results suggest that both finite\nsize effects and symmetry are important for understanding the evolution of\nreal-world complex networks, including genetic regulatory networks. \n\n"}

Further insight is obtained imposing small\ntemperature steps, so-called $T$-shifts. The average response as a function of\n$t/t_{\\rm w,eff}$, where $t_{\\rm w,eff}$ is the effective age, is similar to\nthe response of a system aged isothermally at the final temperature. Using an\nIsing model with plaquette interactions, the applicability of analytic formulae\nfor the average isothermal magnetization is confirmed.

A similar effect emerges in statistical physics, where the force\nacting, e.g., on colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture is\naffected by the classical thermal fluctuations occurring in the surrounding\nmedium. The resulting Casimir-like force acquires universal features upon\napproaching a critical point of the medium and becomes long-ranged at\ncriticality.

Heuristic scaling arguments\nbased on random walk properties show that the typical cluster size scales as\n(t/ln(t))^z, with z=1/(k+2). The initial symmetric flux of particles between\nneighboring clusters is followed by an effectively assymmetric flux due to the\nunbalanced detachement rates, which leads to the above logarithmic correction.\nSmall clusters have densities of order t^{-mz(1)}, with z(1) = k/(k+2). Thus,\nfor k<1, the small clusters (mass of order unity) are statistically dominant\nand the average cluster size does not scale as the size of typically large\nclusters does. We also solve the Master equation of the model under an\nindependent interval approximation, which yields cluster distributions and\nexponent relations and gives the correct dominant coarsening exponent after\naccounting for the effects of correlations.

The forward movement,\nhowever, is characterized by an alternating sequence of translocation and\npause. Using a quantitative model, which captures the mechanochemical cycle of\nan individual ribosome, we derive an {\\it exact} analytical expression for the\ndistribution of its dwell times at the successive positions on the mRNA track.\nInverse of the average dwell time satisfies a ``Michaelis-Menten-like''\nequation and is consistent with the general formula for the average velocity of\na molecular motor with an unbranched mechano-chemical cycle.

The number of paths contributing to the\npartition function strongly increases around and above a specific temperature\n$T^*_c$ whereas the fraction of unbound base pairs grows continuosly around and\nabove $T^*_c$. The latter is identified with the denaturation temperature.\nThus, the separation of the two complementary strands appears as a highly\ncooperative phenomenon displaying a smooth crossover versus $T$.

Specifically, we study tracer diffusivities, static structure, and\nthermodynamic properties of a variety of one- and two-component model fluid\nsystems with either additive or non-additive interactions of the hard-sphere or\nGaussian-core form.

In particular, the\nnumber of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse\nsize, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate.

However, they do not establish that the entropy loss during the\nglass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to\nmaintain the second law. They use a novel statistical formulation of entropy\nbased on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate, but do not\ncompare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy. The formulation is\ndesigned to show the entropy loss. Its subsequent rise not only contradicts our\nresult but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative\nabsolute temperature.

Abstract: Microbiology is the science of microbes, particularly bacteria. Many bacteria\nare motile: they are capable of self-propulsion. Among these, a significant\nclass execute so-called run-and-tumble motion: they follow a fairly straight\npath for a certain distance, then abruptly change direction before repeating\nthe process. This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is\ndiffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically,\nmotility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local\nenvironment and hence can vary in space. When they do so, even if a steady\nstate is reached, this is not generally invariant under time-reversal: the\nprinciple of detailed balance, which restores the microscopic time-reversal\nsymmetry of systems in thermal equilibrium, is mesoscopically absent in motile\nbacteria. This lack of detailed balance (allowed by the flux of chemical energy\nthat drives motility) creates pitfalls for the unwary modeller. Here I review\nsome statistical mechanical models for bacterial motility, presenting them as a\nparadigm for exploring diffusion without detailed balance. I also discuss the\nextent to which statistical physics is useful in understanding real or\npotential microbiological experiments. \n\n"}

It is therefore\nimportant to develop multilayer generalizations of network concepts. In this\npaper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize the idea of transitivity to\nmultiplex networks.

Second, the fluid velocity and the\npressure are linear on the swimmer force dipoles, and averaging over the\nswimmer orientations would lead to a vanishing effect. However, being the\nsuspension a discrete system, the noise terms of the coarse grained equations\ndepend on the density, which itself fluctuates, resulting in effective\nnon-linear dynamics.

Specifically, we derive general exact\nrelations for thermodynamic properties that apply to any ground-state ensemble\nas a function of $\\rho$ in any $d$, and show how disordered degenerate ground\nstates arise as part of the ground-state manifold. We then specialize our\nresults to the canonical ensemble by exploiting an ansatz that stealthy states\nbehave remarkably like \"pseudo\" equilibrium hard-sphere systems in Fourier\nspace. Our theoretical predictions for the structure and thermodynamic\nproperties of the stealthy disordered ground states and associated excited\nstates are in excellent agreement with computer simulations across the first\nthree space dimensions. The development of this theory provides provide new\ninsights regarding our fundamental understanding of the nature and formation of\nlow-temperature states of amorphous matter. Our work also offers challenges to\nexperimentalists to synthesize stealthy ground states at the molecular level. \n\n"}

Despite the nonequilibrium\nnature of the transition, we find that thermally induced fluctuations and\nmechanical responses obey equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations near\njamming, provided the appropriate fluctuating component of the particle\ndisplacements is analysed. This shows that mechanical moduli can be directly\nmeasured from particle positions in mechanically unperturbed packings, and\nsuggests that the definition of a \"nonequilibrium index\" is unnecessary for\namorphous materials.

First we prove that the DS critical exponents are robust, so\nlong as the polymer does not cross itself: they can arise in a generic lattice\nmodel, and do not require fine tuning. This resolves a longstanding theoretical\nquestion. However there is an apparent paradox: two different lattice models,\napparently both in the DS universality class, show different numbers of\nrelevant perturbations, apparently leading to contradictory conclusions about\nthe stability of the DS exponents. We explain this in terms of subtle\ndifferences between the two models, one of which is fine-tuned (and not\nstrictly in the DS universality class).

In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS)\nsimulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the\nthermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved. We analyze the\nstandard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active\nconfigurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics\nreturns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where\nthe most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an\nabsorbing state.

Given the enormous size of\nthe space of all possible Ising model realizations, the question arises as to\nhow to choose a reasonable number of samples that will form physically\nmeaningful and non-intersecting training and testing datasets. Here, we propose\na sampling technique called ID-MH that uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\ncreating Markov process across energy levels within the predefined\nconfiguration subspace.

To order $1/N$,\nmoments are given by those of the weight function of the Q-Hermite polynomials.\nRepresenting Wick contractions by rooted chord diagrams, we show that the\n$1/N^2$ correction for each chord diagram is proportional to the number of\ntriangular loops of the corresponding intersection graph, with an extra grading\nfactor when $q$ is odd. Therefore the problem of finding $1/N^2$ corrections is\nmapped to a triangle counting problem. Since the total number of triangles is a\npurely graph-theoretic property, we can compute them for the $q=1$ and $q=2$\nSYK models, where the exact moments can be obtained analytically using other\nmethods, and therefore we have solved the moment problem for any $q$ to $1/N^2$\naccuracy.

The orientation (which is formally\nlike a spin degree of freedom) determines the self-propulsion direction. The\nbonds represent the possibility to make transitions: to hop between locations;\nor to switch the orientation. In systems of experimental interest (Janus\nparticles), the self-propulsion is induced by illumination. An emergent aspect\nis the topological stochastic disorder (TSD).

In this work, we propose a\ngeneral theory of hypostatic amorphous packings and the associated jamming\ntransition. First, we show that many systems fall into a same universality\nclass.

Consequently, we here present a particle-scale statistical\napproach of circle-swimmer suspensions in terms of a dynamical density\nfunctional theory.

Quadratic density fluctuations are\nonly considered in the saddle-point approximation of two-body fields as well as\ndensity field.

Unlike previously proposed\nmodels of mound formation, the Ehrlich-Schwoebel step-edge barrier, usually\nmodeled as a linear instability in growth equations, is absent in our models.\nMound formation in our models occurs due to a nonlinear instability in which\nthe height (depth) of spontaneously generated pillars (grooves) increases\nrapidly if the initial height (depth) is sufficiently large.

Second, we find that an addition\nof monovalent salt ions results in an increase of the charge density in the\nminor groove while the total charge density of ions adsorbed in the major\ngroove stays unchanged. The adsorbed ion densities are highly structured along\nthe minor groove while they are almost smeared along the major groove.\nFurthermore, for a fixed amount of added salt, the major groove cationic charge\nis independent on the counterion valency. For increasing salt concentration the\nmajor groove is neutralized while the total charge adsorbed in the minor groove\nis constant. DNA overcharging is detected for multivalent salt. Simulations for\na larger ion radii, which mimic the effect of the ion hydration, indicate an\nincreased adsorbtion of cations in the major groove. \n\n"}

Its cornerstone is a smooth free-energy functional, designed so that\nthe stable solutions connecting any two phases are completely free of the third\nphase. For the simplest choice of this functional, the equations of motion for\neach of the two solid-liquid interfaces can be mapped to the standard\nphase-field model of single-phase solidification, and all thin-interface\ncorrections to the dynamics of the solid-liquid interfaces can be eliminated.\nThis means that simulation results become independent of the thickness W of the\ndiffuse interfaces. As a consequence, accurate results can be obtained using\nvalues of W much larger than the physical interface thickness, which makes\nsimulations for realistic experimental parameters feasible. Convergence of the\nsimulation outcome with decreasing W is explicitly demonstrated. The results\nare also compared to a boundary-integral formulation of the corresponding\nfree-boundary problem.

The SFR takes into account two\ncrucial features of granular materials - discreteness and randomness - via\ndiffusing \"spots\" of local fluidization, which act as carriers of plasticity.\nWe postulate that spots perform random walks biased along slip-lines with a\ndrift direction determined by the stress imbalance upon a local switch from\nstatic to dynamic friction. In the continuum limit (based on a Fokker-Planck\nequation for the spot concentration), this simple model is able to predict a\nvariety of granular flow profiles in flat-bottom silos, annular Couette cells,\nflowing heaps, and plate-dragging experiments -- with essentially no fitting\nparameters -- although it is only expected to function where material is at\nincipient failure and slip-lines are inadmissible.

This problem raises an interest because, unlike bosons,\nfermions in general do not behave cooperatively, so that the collective\nconversion of, say, two million atoms into one million molecules is not to be\nexpected. Nevertheless, we find that the coupled Fermi system displays\ncollective Rabi-like oscillations and adiabatic passage between atoms and\nmolecules, thereby mimicking Bose-Einstein statistics.

While the process\nof exploring such networks in many cases resembles a random walk, it becomes a\nkey issue to investigate and characterize how effectively the nodes and edges\nof such networks can be covered by different strategies. At the same time, it\nis critically important to infer how well can topological measurements such as\nthe average node degree and average clustering coefficient be estimated during\nsuch network explorations. The present article addresses these problems by\nconsidering random and Barab\\'asi-Albert (BA) network models with varying\nconnectivity explored by three types of random walks: traditional, preferential\nto untracked edges, and preferential to unvisited nodes. A series of relevant\nresults are obtained, including the fact that random and BA models with the\nsame size and average node degree allow similar node and edge coverage\nefficiency, the identification of linear scaling with the size of the network\nof the random walk step at which a given percentage of the nodes/edges is\ncovered, and the critical result that the estimation of the averaged node\ndegree and clustering coefficient by random walks on BA networks often leads to\nheavily biased results.

In general, therefore, molecular evolution takes\nplace in a dynamic rather than a static fitness landscape. We incorporate\ndynamic replication and decay rates into the standard quasispecies theory of\nmolecular evolution, and show that for periodic time-dependencies, a system of\nevolving molecules enters a limit cycle for $t\\to\\infty$. For fast periodic\nchanges, we show that molecules adapt to the time-averaged fitness landscape,\nwhereas for slow changes they track the variations in the landscape arbitrarily\nclosely. We derive a general approximation method that allows us to calculate\nthe attractor of time-periodic landscapes, and demonstrate using several\nexamples that the results of the approximation and the limiting cases of very\nslow and very fast changes are in perfect agreement. We also discuss landscapes\nwith arbitrary time dependencies, and show that very fast changes again lead to\na system that adapts to the time-averaged landscape.

This area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non-critical\nharmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension, for general\nfinite-ranged harmonic interactions, regions of arbitrary shape and states of\nnonzero temperature. For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the\nKlein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be\nstated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of\n[Phys.
