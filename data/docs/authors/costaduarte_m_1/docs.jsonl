In\naddition, feedback due to mechanical and thermal deposition of energy from jets\nand winds emitted by the accretion disk around the central SMBH is also\nexpected to occur. In this paper we improve and extend the accretion and\nfeedback physics explored in our previous papers to include also a physically\nmotivated mechanical feedback. We study the evolution of an isolated elliptical\ngalaxy with the aid of a high-resolution 1-D hydrodynamical code, where the\ncooling and heating functions include photoionization and Compton effects, and\nrestricting to models which include only radiative or only mechanical feedback.\nWe confirm that for Eddington ratios above 0.01 both the accretion and\nradiative output are forced by feedback effects to be in burst mode, so that\nstrong intermittencies are expected at early times, while at low redshift the\nexplored models are characterized by smooth, very sub-Eddington mass accretion\nrates punctuated by rare outbursts. However, the explored models always fail\nsome observational tests.

Those\nHI-deficient galaxies with normal H2 content have lost HI mainly from outside\ntheir optical disks, where the H2 content is low in all galaxies. This finding\nis consistent with theoretical models in which the molecular fraction in a\ngalaxy is determined primarily by its gas column density. Our result is\nsupported by indirect evidence that molecular deficient galaxies form stars at\na lower rate or have dimmer far infrared fluxes than gas rich galaxies, as\nexpected if the star formation rate is determined by the molecular hydrogen\ncontent. Our result is consistent with a scenario in which, when the atomic gas\ncolumn density is lowered inside the optical disk below the critical value\nrequired to form molecular hydrogen and stars, spirals become quiescent and\npassive evolving systems. We speculate that this process would act on the\ntime-scale set by the gas depletion rate and might be a first step for the\ntransition between the blue and red sequence observed in the color-magnitude\ndiagram. \n\n"}

Subhaloes with masses\nlarger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two\norders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. We incorporate a baryonic\ncomponent modelled as a Hernquist profile and account for the response of the\ndark matter via adiabatic contraction. We focus on the \"anomalous\" flux ratio\nproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to\nsubstructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux\nratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same\nhalo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is\ncomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is\nnot.

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties.

The regions have overdensities that\ndeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the\nrms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass\nresolution of up to 10^6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale\nenvironments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h)^3\nMillennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising\nbackground, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR\ndensity at z <~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an\norder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces\nobservational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the\nGOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear\nin the underdense regions until z~3. These environmental variations are not\ncaused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but\nrather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to\nanother, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.\nAt all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250\nkm/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of \"downsizing\" (even\nin the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have\nmostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form\nat later times. However, additional feedback is required to limit star\nformation in massive galaxies at late times. \n\n"}

Then, through\nthe Jeans equation, the mass profile is derived in terms of double integrals of\nobservable quantities. Single integral formulas for both deprojection and mass\ninversion are provided for several simple anisotropy models (isotropic, radial,\ncircular, general constant, Osipkov-Merritt, Mamon-Lokas and\nDiemand-Moore-Stadel).

Remarkably, its numerical value mu_{0 D} = 140\nM_{sun}/pc^2 = (18.6 Mev)^3 is approximately the same (up to a factor of two)\nin all these systems. First, we present the physical consequences of the\nindependence of mu_{0 D} on r_0: the energy scales as the volume sim r_0^3\nwhile the mass and the entropy scale as the surface ~ r_0^2 and the surface\ntimes log r_0, respectively. Namely, the entropy scales similarly to the\nblack-hole entropy but with a much smaller coefficient. Second, we compute the\nsurface gravity and the density profile for small scales from first principles\nand the evolution of primordial density fluctuations since the end of inflation\ntill today using the linearized Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. The density profile\nrho_{lin}(r) obtained in this way decreases as r^{-1-n_s/2} for intermediate\nscales where n_s = 0.964 is the primordial spectral index.

The\nfolding, which becomes increasingly complex with time, leads to an apparent\nvelocity dispersion increase and thickening of the stream. We measure the\nequivalent velocity dispersion around the local mean in the simulations,\nfinding that it rises to about 10 km/s after 5 Gyr and 20 km/s after 13 Gyr.\nThe currently available measurements of the velocity dispersion of halo star\nstreams range from as small as 2 km/s to slightly over 20 km/s. The streams\nwith velocity dispersions of 15-20 km/s are compatible with what sub-halo\nheating would produce. A dynamical understanding of the low velocity dispersion\nstreams depends on the time since the progenitor's tidal disruption into a thin\nstream.

However, the dynamical age of\nthe streams can be significantly less than the stars. If the three lowest\nvelocity streams are assigned ages of 3 Gyr, they are in conflict with the\nsub-halo heating.

Such global\nCompton scattering has previously been shown to be important for the dynamics\nof accretion flows. Here, we extend previous treatments of this problem by\nusing accurate global general relativistic Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on\nan inner region of the accretion flow (R < 600R_g), for which we obtain a\nglobal self-consistent solution. As compared to the initial, not\nself-consistent solution, the final solution has both the cooling rate and the\nelectron temperature significantly reduced at radii >=10 gravitational radii.\nOn the other hand, the radiation spectrum of the self-consistent solution has\nthe shape similar to that of the initial iteration, except for the high-energy\ncut-off being at an energy lower by a factor of ~2 and the bolometric\nluminosity decreased by a factor of ~2.

We find that\nthe slab model approximates the global model significantly better than the\nspherical one. Still, neither local model gives a good approximation to the\nradial profile of the cooling rate, and the differences can be up to two orders\nof magnitude.

Statistics of\n  Spectra and Luminosity Abstract: We combine a cosmological reionization simulation with box size of 100Mpc/h\non a side and a Monte Carlo Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiative transfer code to model\nLyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) at z~5.7. The model introduces Lya radiative\ntransfer as the single factor for transforming the intrinsic Lya emission\nproperties into the observed ones. Spatial diffusion of Lya photons from\nradiative transfer results in extended Lya emission and only the central part\nwith high surface brightness can be observed. Because of radiative transfer,\nthe appearance of LAEs depends on density and velocity structures in\ncircumgalactic and intergalactic media as well as the viewing angle, which\nleads to a broad distribution of apparent (observed) Lya luminosity for a given\nintrinsic Lya luminosity. Radiative transfer also causes frequency diffusion of\nLya photons. The resultant Lya line is asymmetric with a red tail. The peak of\nthe Lya line shifts towards longer wavelength and the shift is anti-correlated\nwith the apparent to intrinsic Lya luminosity ratio. The simple radiative\ntransfer model provides a new framework for studying LAEs. It is able to\nexplain an array of observed properties of z~5.7 LAEs in Ouchi et al.

The broad distribution of apparent Lya\nluminosity at fixed UV luminosity provides a natural explanation for the\nobserved UV LF, especially the turnover towards the low luminosity end. The\nmodel also reproduces the observed distribution of Lya equivalent width (EW)\nand explains the deficit of UV bright, high EW sources.

The\nother is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution.

Combining these\nresults with individual measurements for clusters, groups, and galaxies from\nthe literature, we find a break in the baryon fraction at ~1 keV. Above this\ntemperature, the baryon fraction scales with temperature as f_b \\propto\nT^0.20\\pm0.03. We see significantly smaller baryon fractions below this\ntemperature, and the baryon fraction of poor groups joins smoothly onto that of\nsystems with still shallower potential wells such as normal and dwarf galaxies\nwhere the baryon fraction scales with the inferred velocity dispersion as f_b\n\\propto \\sigma^1.6. The small scatter in the baryon fraction at any given\npotential well depth favors a universal baryon loss mechanism and a preheating\nmodel for the baryon loss.

Finally, we note that although the broken power-law relation can be\ninferred from data points in the literature alone, the consistency between the\nbaryon fractions for poor groups and massive galaxies inspires us to fit the\ntwo categories of objects (galaxies and clusters) with one relation. \n\n"}

We argue that previous\nattempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universal\nadoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies.\nUnless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar medium\nduring supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulge\ndominated S0/Sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3. We show\nthat a low efficiency of star-formation more closely models the subparsec\nphysical processes, especially at high redshift. We highlight the successful\nformation of extended disc galaxies with scale lengths r_d=4-5 kpc, flat\nrotation curves and bulge to disc ratios of B/D~1/4.

This power-law index is found to vary from -3.1 to -4.0,\ndepending on the mass of the helium star. The small range of this index\nbrackets values found previously for hydrogen-rich companions, suggesting that\nthe dependence of the unbound mass on orbital separation is not strongly\nsensitive to the nature of the binary companion.

In this paper we\nshed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low mass galaxy by\npresenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of\nQ2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z=2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and\nunusual properties: BX418 is young (<100 Myr), low mass (M_star ~ 10^9 Msun),\nlow in metallicity (Z ~ 1/6 Zsun), and unreddened (E(B-V)~0.02, UV continuum\nslope beta=-2.1). We infer a metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.9 +/- 0.2 from the\nrest-frame optical emission lines. We also determine the metallicity via the\ndirect, electron temperature method, using the ratio O III] 1661, 1666/[O III]\n5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12+ log(O/H)=7.8 +/-\n0.1. These measurements place BX418 among the most metal-poor galaxies observed\nin emission at high redshift. The rest-frame UV spectrum contains strong\nemission from Lya (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 A), He II 1640 (both\nstellar and nebular), C III] 1907, 1909 and O III] 1661, 1666.

It remains to be determined how many of BX418's unique spectral\nfeatures are due to its global properties, such as low metallicity and dust\nextinction, and how many are indicative of a short-lived phase in the early\nevolution of an otherwise normal star-forming galaxy. \n\n"}

The FUV and HI maps\nshow a stunning spatial correlation out to almost 4 optical radii (r25),\nroughly the extent of our maps. This underscores that HI traces the gas\nreservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at least\nlow level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere HI is observed. Whereas\nthe average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before\nleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low\nHI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\nwhich is not the case within r25. The time for star formation to consume the\navailable HI, inferred from the ratio of HI to FUV intensity, rises with\nincreasing radius before leveling off at ~100 Gyr, i.e., many Hubble times,\nnear ~1.7 r25. Assuming the relatively short H2 depletion times observed in the\ninner parts of galaxies hold in outer disks, the conversion of HI into bound,\nmolecular clouds seems to limit star formation in outer galaxy disks.

The formation of NSCs is inevitable in\nthe context of normal star formation in which a majority of stars form in\nclusters. A young, mass-losing cluster embedded in an isolated star-forming\ngalaxy remains gravitationally bound over a period determined by its initial\nmass and the galactic tidal field. The cluster migrates radially toward the\ncenter of the galaxy and becomes integrated in the NSC if it reaches the\ncenter. The rate at which the NSC grows by accreting young clusters can be\nestimated from empirical cluster formation rates and dissolution times. We\nmodel cluster migration and dissolution and find that the NSCs in late-type\ndisks and in spheroidals could have assembled from migrating clusters. The\nresulting stellar nucleus contains a small fraction of the stellar mass of the\ngalaxy; this fraction is sensitive to the high-mass truncation of the initial\ncluster mass function (ICMF). The resulting NSC masses are consistent with the\nobserved values, but generically, the final NSCs are surrounded by a spatially\nmore extended excess over the inward-extrapolated exponential (or Sersic) law\nof the outer galaxy. We suggest that the excess can be related to the\npseudobulge phenomenon in disks, though not all of the pseudobulge mass\nassembles this way. Comparison with observed NSC masses can be used to\nconstrain the truncation mass scale of the ICMF and the fraction of clusters\nsuffering prompt dissolution. We infer truncation mass scales of <~ 10^6 M_sun\n(>~ 10^5 M_sun) without (with 90%) prompt dissolution. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, extinction is highly degenerate with\nstellar effective temperature when estimated from broad band optical/infrared\nphotometry. To address this problem, I introduce a Bayesian method for\nestimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction.\nIt uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to\nprovide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the\nparameters. The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the\nHertzsprung--Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure that\nthey respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by using it to\nestimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK data for a set of\nartificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which accurate effective\ntemperatures have been estimated from high resolution spectroscopy. Using just\nthe four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation)\nbetween the temperature and extinction.

Based on this, the\nequivalent width (EW) of [OIII] should provide a direct measure of theta. Here\nwe analyze the distribution of EW([OIII]) in a sample of ~6,000 SDSS quasars,\nand find that it can be accurately reproduced assuming a relatively small\nintrinsic scatter and a random distribution of inclination angles. This result\nhas several implications: 1) it is a direct proof of the disc-like emission of\nthe optical continuum of quasars; 2) the value of EW([OIII]) can be used as a\nproxy of the inclination, to correct the measured continuum emission and then\nestimate the bolometric luminosity of quasars; 3) the presence of almost\nedge-on discs among broad line quasars implies that the accretion disc is not\naligned with the circumnuclear absorber, and/or that the covering fraction of\nthe latter is rather small.

The approach employs a\ndirect discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with\nadjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the\noptically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of\nthe scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of\ndirectional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of\nthese \"cone-fields\" is transported independently, with constant intensity as a\nfunction of direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light\n(or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger\ntimesteps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer\nequation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well\nas with scattering.

The great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it does\nnot significantly intersect the disk of M31, means that it is unusually well\nsuited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a test\nfor the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. The main result of this\npaper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about three\ntimes the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. The probability that\nthe variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.\nAs a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the same\nlocation in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [Fe/H]=[0, -0.5] and\nfind no variations above the expected shot noise. The lumpiness of the stream\nis not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,\nnor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible M31\nsatellite galaxies.

We carry out simulations without and with radiative heating by a\ncentral X-ray corona and radiative cooling. For an adiabatic case, the radial\nprofiles of hydrodynamical properties match the Bondi solution, except near the\ninner and outer radius of the computational domain. We find that adiabatic\nBondi accretion can be reproduced for durations of a few dynamical times at the\nBondi radius, and for longer times if the outer radius is increased. With\nradiative heating and cooling included, the spherically accreting gas takes a\nlonger time to reach a steady-state than the adiabatic Bondi accretion runs,\nand in some cases does not reach a steady-state even within several hundred\ndynamical times. We find that artificial viscosity in the GADGET code causes\nexcessive heating near the inner radius, making the thermal properties of the\ngas inconsistent with a physical solution. This overheating occurs typically\nonly in the supersonic part of the flow, so that it does not affect the mass\naccretion rate. We see that increasing the X-ray luminosity produces a lower\ncentral mass inflow rate, implying that feedback due to radiative heating is\noperational in our simulations. With a sufficiently high X-ray luminosity, the\ninflowing gas is radiatively heated up, and an outflow develops.

At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly.

Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is a\npromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. However,\nprevious attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or\nonly approximated it crudely. This paper re-examines the effects of peculiar\nvelocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment and\naddressing several issues for the first time. (1) We show that properly\naccounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of\n21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the IGM found by previous\nwork that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) The\napproximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightness\ntemperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the power\nspectrum on all scales. (3) The observed power spectrum in redshift-space\nremains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properly\naccounts for the redshift-space distortion. However, results that take full\naccount of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accurate\nin the limit of high spin temperature. (4) The linear theory for redshift-space\ndistortion results in ~30% error in the observationally relevant wavenumber\nrange, at the 50% ionized epoch. (5) We describe and test two numerical schemes\nto calculate the 21cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporate\npeculiar velocity effects in the optically-thin approximation accurately.

Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) can be detected out to very high redshifts\nduring the epoch of reionization. The evolution of the LAE luminosity function\nwith redshift is a direct probe of the Ly-alpha transmission of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), and therefore of the IGM neutral-hydrogen fraction.\nMeasuring the Ly-alpha luminosity function (LF) of LAEs at redshift z = 7.7\ntherefore allows us to constrain the ionizing state of the Universe at this\nredshift.\n  Methods. We observed three 7.5'x7.5' fields with the HAWK-I instrument at the\nVLT with a narrow band filter centred at 1.06 $\\mu$m and targeting LAEs at\nredshift z ~ 7.7. The fields were chosen for the availability of\nmultiwavelength data. One field is a galaxy cluster, the Bullet Cluster, which\nallowed us to use gravitational amplification to probe luminosities that are\nfainter than in the field. The two other fields are subareas of the GOODS\nChandra Deep Field South and CFHTLS-D4 deep field. We selected z=7.7 LAE\ncandidates from a variety of colour criteria, in particular from the absence of\ndetection in the optical bands.\n  Results. We do not find any LAE candidates at z = 7.7 in ~2.4 x 10^4 Mpc^3\ndown to a narrow band AB magnitude of ~ 26, which allows us to infer robust\nconstraints on the Ly-alpha LAE luminosity function at this redshift.\n  Conclusions.

Our new observations extend the wavelength\ncoverage to include the [OII] 3726,3729 doublet, which adds leverage in oxygen\nabundance estimates and allows measurements of N/O ratios. All four spectra are\nlow excitation, with relatively high N/O ratios (N/O >~ 0.10), each of which\ntend to bias estimates based on strong emission lines toward high oxygen\nabundances.

The central tenet of this model,\ndifferent from many of the earlier models, is that the star-formation in Lya\nemitters is proportional to the mass accretion rate rather than the total halo\nmass. We find that at z~3, nearly 35% of the Lya emitters accrete their mass\nthrough major (3:1) mergers, and this fraction increases to about 50% at z~7.\nThis imply that the star-formation in a large fraction of high-redshift Lya\nemitters is driven by mergers.

Abstract: Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are galaxies that have been selected on the basis\nof a strong Ly{\\alpha} emission line in their spectra. Observational campaigns\nhave dramatically increased the sample of known LAEs, which now extends out to\nz=7. These discoveries have motivated numerous theoretical studies on the\nsubject, which usually define LAEs in their models based on sharp Ly{\\alpha}\nluminosity and equivalent width (EW) cuts. While broadly representative, this\nprocedure does not mimic the selection from observational programs in detail,\nwhich instead use cuts in various colour-spaces. We investigate what\nimplications this disjoint may have for studies that aim to model LAEs. We\nconstruct an empirical model for the number density of star forming galaxies as\na function of their UV and Ly{\\alpha} luminosity, utilising measured\nconstraints on the luminosity functions (LFs) of drop-out galaxies, and their\nluminosity dependent probability distribution function of Ly{\\alpha} EW. In\nparticular, we investigate whether the LAE LFs can be reproduced by defining\nLAEs using a (z-dependent) Ly{\\alpha} luminosity and EW threshold. While we are\nable to reproduce the observed distribution of Ly{\\alpha} EW among LAEs out to\nrestframe EW 200 A, we find that our formalism over-predicts both the UV and\nLy{\\alpha} LFs of LAEs by a factor of 2-3, and is inconsistent with\nobservations at the ~95% level. This tension is partially resolved if we assume\nthe Ly{\\alpha} EW-distribution of drop-out galaxies to be truncated at\nrestframe EW>150 A. However the overprediction indicates that modeling LAEs\nwith simple REW and luminosity cuts does not accurately mimic observed\nselection criteria, and can lead to uncertainties in the predicted number\ndensity of LAEs. On the other hand, the predicted z-evolution is not affected.\nWe apply our formalism to drop-out galaxies at z>6, and predict the LFs of LAEs\nat z=7-9. \n\n"}

Current data analysis techniques can provide us\nwith parameter estimation with very narrow errors. However, an EMRI is not a\ntwo-body problem, since other stellar bodies orbiting nearby will influence the\ncapture orbit. Any deviation from the isolated inspiral will induce a small,\nthough observable deviation from the idealised waveform which could be\nmisinterpreted as a failure of GR. Based on conservative analysis of mass\nsegregation in a Milky Way like nucleus, we estimate that the possibility that\nanother star has a semi-major axis comparable to that of the EMRI is\nnon-negligible, although probably very small. This star introduces an\nobservable perturbation in the orbit in the case in which we consider only loss\nof energy via gravitational radiation.

To place this\nresult in the context of the UV-selected galaxy population, we investigate how\nvarious parameterizations of the Lyman Alpha equivalent width distribution,\nalong with the measured UV-continuum LF, affect shape and normalization of the\nLyman Alpha LF. The nominal model, which uses z~6 equivalent widths from the\nliterature, falls short of the observed space density of LAEs at the bright\nend, possibly indicating a need for higher equivalent widths.

With the proposed CMB experiment PIXIE it might become possible to\nmeasure these distortions and thereby constrain the primordial power spectrum\nat comoving wavenumbers 50 Mpc^{-1} < k < 10^4 Mpc^{-1}. Since primordial\nfluctuations in the CMB on these scales are completely erased by Silk damping,\nthese distortions may provide the only way to shed light on otherwise\nunobservable aspects of inflationary physics. A consistent treatment of the\nprimordial dissipation problem requires going to second order in perturbation\ntheory, while thermalization of these distortions necessitates consideration of\nsecond order in Compton scattering energy transfer. Here we give a full 2x2\ntreatment for the creation and evolution of spectral distortions due to the\nacoustic dissipation process, consistently including the effect of polarization\nand photon mixing in the free streaming regime. We show that 1/3 of the total\nenergy (9/4 larger than previous estimates) stored in small-scale temperature\nperturbations imprints observable spectral distortions, while the remaining 2/3\nonly raises the average CMB temperature, an effect that is unobservable.

It has been extensively observed with ground based\ntelescopes and within the WISH Guaranteed Time Herschel Key Program. We present\nnew observations of the C18O 3-2 and the HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} lines towards NGC\n7129 FIRS 2. Combining these observations with Herschel data and modeling their\nemissions, we constrain the C18O and HDO abundance profiles across the\nprotostellar envelope. In particular, we derive the abundance of C18O and HDO\nin the hot core. The intensities of the C18O lines are well reproduced assuming\nthat the C18O abundance decreases through the protostellar envelope from the\nouter edge towards the centre until the point where the gas and dust reach the\nCO evaporation temperature (~20-25 K) where the C18O is released back to the\ngas phase. Once the C18O is released to the gas phase, the modelled C18O\nabundance is found to be ~1.6x10^{-8}, which is a factor of 10 lower than the\nreference abundance. This result is supported by the non-detection of C18O 9-8,\nwhich proves that even in the hot core (T_k>100 K) the CO abundance must be 10\ntimes lower than the reference value. Several scenarios are discussed to\nexplain this C18O deficiency. One possible explanation is that during the\npre-stellar and protostellar phase, the CO is removed from the grain mantles by\nreactions to form more complex molecules.

Both Type I\n(single exponential) and Type II (down-turning) observed disk\nsurface-brightness profiles can be explained by our findings. We relate these\nresults to the strong angular momentum outward transfer, resulting from torques\nand radial migration associated with multiple patterns, such as central bars\nand spiral waves of different multiplicity. We show that even for stars ending\nup on cold orbits, the changes in angular momentum exhibit complex structure as\na function of radius, unlike the expected effect of transient spirals alone.\nFocussing on one of our models, we find evidence for non-linear coupling among\nm=1, 2, 3 and 4 density waves, where m is the pattern multiplicity. We suggest\nthat the naturally occurring larger resonance widths at galactic radii beyond\nfour scale-lengths may have profound consequences on the formation and location\nof breaks in disk density profiles, provided spirals are present at such large\ndistances. We also consider the effect of gas inflow and show that when\nin-plane smooth gas accretion of ~5 M_sun/yr is included, the outer disks\nbecome more unstable, leading to a strong increase in the stellar velocity\ndispersion.

This latter produces a population of simulated\nsatellites that we compare to the observed satellites of the Milky Way and M31.\nWe find that supernova feedback reduces star formation in the least massive\nsatellites but enhances it in the more massive ones. Photoionisation appears to\nplay a very minor role in suppressing star and galaxy formation in all\nprogenitors of satellite halos. By far the largest effect on the satellite\npopulation is found to be the mass of the host and whether gas cooling is\nincluded in the simulation or not. Indeed, inclusion of gas cooling\ndramatically reduces the number of satellites captured at high redshift which\nsurvive down to z=0. \n\n"}

Abstract: The distribution of QSO radio luminosities has long been debated in the\nliterature. Some argue that it is a bimodal distribution, implying that there\nare two separate QSO populations (normally referred to as 'radio-loud' and\n'radio-quiet'), while others claim it forms a more continuous distribution\ncharacteristic of a single population. We use deep observations at 20 GHz to\ninvestigate whether the distribution is bimodal at high radio frequencies.\nCarrying out this study at high radio frequencies has an advantage over\nprevious studies as the radio emission comes predominantly from the core of the\nAGN, hence probes the most recent activity. Studies carried out at lower\nfrequencies are dominated by the large scale lobes where the emission is built\nup over longer timescales (10^7-10^8 yrs), thereby confusing the sample. Our\nsample comprises 874 X-ray selected QSOs that were observed as part of the 6dF\nGalaxy Survey. Of these, 40% were detected down to a 3 sigma detection limit of\n0.2-0.5 mJy.\n  No evidence of bimodality is seen in either the 20 GHz luminosity\ndistribution or in the distribution of the R_20 parameter: the ratio of the\nradio to optical luminosities traditionally used to classify objects as being\neither radio-loud or radio-quiet. Previous results have claimed that at low\nradio luminosities, star formation processes can dominate the radio emission\nobserved in QSOs. We attempt to investigate these claims by stacking the\nundetected sources at 20 GHz and discuss the limitations in carrying out this\nanalysis. However, if the radio emission was solely due to star formation\nprocesses, we calculate that this corresponds to star formation rates ranging\nfrom ~10 solar masses/yr to ~2300 solar masses/yr. \n\n"}

This result is supported by the H alpha emission which is strongly\ncoincident with the ring, and weaker at the position of the central cluster.\nFrom the derived total H alpha luminosity of the system we constrain the star\nformation rate density to be quite high, e.g. ~ 0.47 Msun/yr/kpc^2.

The FUV is dominantly radiated from\nnewly formed short-lived OB stars, while the FIR is emitted by dust grains\nheated by the FUV radiation field. It is known that dust is always associated\nwith star formation activity. Thus, both FUV and FIR are tightly related to the\nstar formation in galaxies, but in a very complicated manner. In order to\ndisentangle the relation between FUV and FIR emissions, we estimate the UV-IR\nbivariate LF (BLF) of galaxies with {\\sl GALEX} and {\\sl AKARI} All-Sky Survey\ndatasets. Recently we invented a new mathematical method to construct the BLF\nwith given marginals and prescribed correlation coefficient. This method makes\nuse of a tool from mathematical statistics, so called \"copula\". The copula\nenables us to construct a bivariate distribution function from given marginal\ndistributions with prescribed correlation and/or dependence structure. With\nthis new formulation and FUV and FIR univariate LFs, we analyze various FUV and\nFIR data with {\\sl GALEX}, {\\sl Spitzer}, and {\\sl AKARI} to estimate the UV-IR\nBLF.

One mechanism to reconcile the simulations with\nthe observed data is the feedback from star formation, this might be successful\nin isolated dwarf galaxies but its success in LSB galaxies remains unclear.\nAdditionally, including too much feedback in the simulations is a double-edged\nsword, in order to obtain a cored DM distribution from an initially cuspy one,\nthe feedback recipes usually require to remove a large quantity of baryons from\nthe center of galaxies, however, some feedback recipes produce twice more\nsatellite galaxies of a given luminosity and with much smaller mass to light\nratios from those that are observed.

Although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of\n10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, \"subgrid\" scales.\nGreat care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for the\neffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. We investigate the momentum and\nenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and\nstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star\nforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern\ncosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid\nmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds\nfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young\nstar clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star\nforming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density\nmitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernova\nexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. The\ndetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation\nand choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations\nin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of global\nstar formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback\nimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal\nfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formal\ngas cooling time. We find that simulations with maximal momentum injection\nsuppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adopting\nadiabatic thermal feedback. \n\n"}

Photoheating by\nstellar radiation stabilizes gas against Jeans fragmentation, reducing the star\nformation rate. Because we have self-consistently calculated the location of\nionized gas, we are able to make spatially-resolved mock observations of star\nformation tracers, such as H-alpha emission. We can also observe how stellar\nfeedback manifests itself in the correlation between ionized and molecular gas.\nApplying our techniques to the disk in a galactic halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find\nthat the correlation between star formation rate density (estimated from mock\nH-alpha emission) and molecular hydrogen density shows large scatter,\nespecially at high resolutions of <~ 75 pc that are comparable to the size of\ngiant molecular clouds (GMCs). This is because an aperture of GMC size captures\nonly particular stages of GMC evolution, and because H-alpha traces hot gas\naround star-forming regions and is displaced from the molecular hydrogen peaks\nthemselves.

One possible explanation is the increased difficulty of detecting\nthese haloes if most of the visible matter is lost at early evolutionary phases\nthrough galactic winds. In this work we study the current models of triggering\ngalactic winds in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) from supernovae, and study,\nbased on 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations, the correlation of the mass\nloss rates and important physical parameters as the dark matter halo mass and\nits radial profile, and the star formation rate. We find that the existence of\nwinds is ubiquitous, independent on the gravitational potential. Our\nsimulations revealed that the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) may play a\nmajor role on pushing matter out of these systems, even for very massive\nhaloes. The instability is responsible for 5 - 40% of the mass loss during the\nearly evolution of the galaxy, being less relevant at $t > 200$Myrs. There is\nno significant difference in the mass loss rates obtained for the different\ndark matter profiles studied (NFW and logarithmic).

Abstract: Using collisionless N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky\nWay (MW) we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of\nthe Local Group. The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar disks embedded in\ndark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an\neccentric orbit typical for MW subhaloes. After a few Gyr of evolution the\nstellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal\nforces. Observing the simulated dwarfs along three principal axes of the\nstellar component we create mock data sets and determine the their half-light\nradii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. Using the estimator proposed by\nWolf et al. we calculate masses within half-light radii. The masses obtained\nthis way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of two when the line of\nsight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. We then\ndivide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and\ntrace their evolution in time. The two populations, although affected by tidal\nforces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr. We measure the\nhalf-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations\nalong different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass\ndistribution in the dwarfs following the method proposed by Walker &\nPenarrubia.

The models include molecular cooling, star formation at high densities\nin GMCs, and gas recycling and feedback from SNe (I&II), stellar winds, and\nradiation pressure. We study mergers of systems from SMC-like dwarfs and Milky\nWay analogues to z~2 starburst disks. Multi-phase super-winds are generated in\nall passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 M_sun/yr. However, the wind\nmass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by SFR) is similar to that in\nisolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxy\nproperties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of the\nmerger. Winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build up\ncomplex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at a\nrange of radii. The winds have complex velocity and phase structure, with\nmaterial at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,\nionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedback\nmechanisms. These simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,\nwhere simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced\nstarbursts.

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter\nassumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in\na manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets.

Instead of\ninvoking ad hoc correlations between the various components, the system of\nscalar inhomogeneities is diagonalized in terms of two gauge-invariant\nquasi-normal modes whose weighted sum gives the curvature perturbations on\ncomoving orthogonal hypersurfaces.

A faithful reproduction of the observed\ncharacteristics of cluster formation can presently be achieved in numerical\nsimulations. Ideally, this requires turbulent initial conditions to be combined\nwith radiative feedback, protostellar outflows, and magnetic fields. With the\nexciting prospect in mind that our understanding of cluster formation will soon\nbe revolutionized by facilities like ALMA, JWST, and the EVLA, this review also\nidentifies a number of areas that would particularly benefit from a joint\nobservational and theoretical effort. \n\n"}

Consolidating\nthe confidence levels during cross-correlation studies, understanding the\nartefacts induced by sampling irregularities, establishing detection limits for\nfuture observatories are just some of the applications of simulated data sets.\nCurrently, the widely used methodology of amplitude and phase randomisation is\nable to produce artificial light curves which have a given underlying power\nspectral density (PSD) but which are strictly Gaussian distributed. This\nrestriction is a significant limitation, since the majority of the light curves\ne.g. active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts show strong\ndeviations from Gaussianity exhibiting `burst-like' events in their light\ncurves yielding long-tailed probability distribution functions (PDFs).

Until recently, no progenitor has\nbeen directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from\nmassive stars that lose their hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from\nbinary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the\nprimary. Here we analyze recently reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which\ncould possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on\npre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models\nof single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor\ncandidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario. We\nfind that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the\nobserved photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. Our models indicate a very uncertain\nejecta mass of ~8 Msun, which is higher than the average of the SN Ib ejecta\nmass that is derived from the lightcurve (2-4 Msun). This possibly high ejecta\nmass could produce detectable effects in the iPTF13bvn lightcurve and spectrum.\nIf the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest\nthat stars with relatively high initial masses (>30 Msun) can produce visible\nSN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole. \n\n"}

Using\nnon-spinning BBH systems as an example, we demonstrate which regions of the\nmass-parameter plane can be covered with existing numerical BBH waveforms. We\nestimate the required number and required length of BBH simulations to cover\nthe entire non-spinning BBH parameter plane up to mass-ratio 10, thus\nillustrating that our approach can be used to guide parameter placement of\nfuture numerical simulations. We derive error bounds which are independent of\nanalytical waveform models; therefore, our formalism can be used to\nindependently test the accuracy of such waveform models. The resulting template\nbanks are suitable for advanced LIGO searches. \n\n"}

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the\nmulti-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar\nfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly\nfrom stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero\nadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo\nmass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and\nsmall groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the\nstellar mass function for M_star<10^11 M_sun. We predict weak redshift\nevolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to\nz>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only\nsupernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly\nin dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and\nradiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt GMCs and enable efficient coupling\nof later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates agree well with the\nobserved Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt\nrelation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas\ninto stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation via\nstellar feedback. Feedback reduces star formation rates considerably and\nproduces a reservoir of gas that leads to rising late-time star formation\nhistories significantly different from the halo accretion history. Feedback\nalso produces large short-timescale variability in galactic SFRs, especially in\ndwarfs. Many of these properties are not captured by common 'sub-grid' galactic\nwind models. \n\n"}

Synchrotron foregrounds are orders of magnitude larger than the\ncosmological signal, and are the principal challenge faced by these\nexperiments.

The\ndepletion rate of HI once a galaxy enters a more massive halo is more rapid at\nhigher halo mass, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows\nmuch less variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass.

A resonant orbit is defined as a geodesic for which the longitudinal\nand radial orbital frequencies are commensurate. Our analysis is based on\nexpressing the resonance condition in its most symmetric form using Carlson's\nintegrals. We provide a number of concise formulae for the dependence of\nresonances on the system parameters. Resonant effects may be observable during\nthe in-spiral of a compact object into a super-massive black hole. When the\nslowly evolving orbital frequencies pass through a series of low-order\nresonances, rapid changes in the orbital parameters could produce measurable\nphase shifts in the emitted gravitational radiation (GW). Resonant orbits may\nalso capture dust leading to electromagnetic emission. The KAM theorem\nindicates that, low order resonant orbits demarcate the regions where the onset\nof chaos could occur around a perturbed black-hole. We find that the 1/2 and\n2/3 resonances occur at ~4 and 5.4 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) from the event\nhorizon. For compact object in-spirals around super-massive black holes, this\nregion lies within the sensitivity band of space-based GW detectors. For Sgr\nA*, length scales of ~41 and 55 microarcseconds and timescales of 50 and 79 min\nrespectively should be associated with resonant effects, if Sgr A* is\nnon-spinning.

Part I Abstract: In the early seventies, Alan Sandage defined cosmology as the search for two\nnumbers: Hubble parameter ${{H}_{0}}$ and deceleration parameter ${{q}_{0}}$.\nThe first of the two basic cosmological parameters (the Hubble parameter)\ndescribes the linear part of the time dependence of the scale factor. Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

Yet there is currently great\ndebate (and few measurements) about the behaviour of the 1.4-GHz counts in the\nmicroJy regime. One way to push the counts to these levels is via 'stacking',\nthe covariance of a map with a catalogue at higher resolution and (often) a\ndifferent wavelength.

Both\ngalaxies are detected by both Chandra and NuSTAR, which together provide the\nfirst-ever spectra of these two galaxies spanning 0.3-30 keV. The X-ray\nemission from both galaxies is spatially resolved by Chandra; we find that hot\ngas dominates the E < 1-3 keV emission while ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs)\ndominate at E > 1-3 keV. The NuSTAR galaxy-wide spectra of both galaxies follow\nsteep power-law distributions with Gamma ~ 2.6 at E > 5-7 keV, similar to the\nspectra of bright individual ULXs and other galaxies that have been studied by\nNuSTAR. We find that both NGC 3256 and NGC 3310 have X-ray detected sources\ncoincident with nuclear regions; however, the steep NuSTAR spectra of both\ngalaxies restricts these sources to be either low luminosity AGN or non-AGN in\nnature (e.g., ULXs or crowded X-ray sources that reach L2-10 keV ~ 10^40 erg/s\ncannot be ruled out). Combining our constraints on the 0.3-30 keV spectra of\nNGC 3256 and NGC 3310 with equivalent measurements for nearby star-forming\ngalaxies M83 and NGC 253, we analyze the SFR-normalized spectra of these\nstarburst galaxies. The spectra of all four galaxies show sharply declining\npower-law slopes above 3-6 keV due to ULX populations. Our observations\ntherefore constrain the average spectra of luminous accreting binaries (i.e.,\nULXs). This result is similar to the super-Eddington accreting ULXs that have\nbeen studied individually in a targeted NuSTAR ULX program. We also find that\nNGC 3310 exhibits a factor of ~3-10 elevation of X-ray emission over the other\nstar-forming galaxies.

Everywhere along\nthe front, the temperature discontinuity is narrower than 4-8 kpc and the\nmetallicity gradient is narrower than 6 kpc, indicating that diffusion,\nconduction and mixing are suppressed across the interface. Such transport\nprocesses can be naturally suppressed by magnetic fields aligned with the cold\nfront.

In one set of simulations velocity forcing is\nentirely solenoidal ($\\nabla\\cdot \\delta {\\vec u} = 0$), while in the other it\nis entirely compressive ($\\nabla\\times \\delta {\\vec u} = 0$). Both cases\ndevelop a mixture of solenoidal and compressive turbulent motions, since each\ngenerates the other. The development of compressive turbulent motions leads to\nshocks, even when the turbulence is solenoidally forced and subsonic. Shocks,\nin turn, produce and amplify vorticity, which is especially important in\ncompressively forced turbulence. To clarify those processes we include a pair\nof appendices that look in detail at vorticity evolution in association with\nshocks. From our simulation analyses we find that magnetic fields amplified to\nnear saturation levels in predominantly solenoidal turbulence can actually\nenhance vorticity on small scales by concentrating and stabilizing shear. The\nproperties, evolution rates and relative contributions of the kinetic and\nmagnetic turbulent elements depend strongly on the character of the forcing.\nSpecifically, shocks are stronger, but vorticity evolution and magnetic field\namplification are slower and weaker when the turbulence is compressively\nforced. We identify a simple relation to estimate characteristic shock\nstrengths in terms of the turbulence Mach number and the character of the\nforcing.

To assess the quality\nof these constrained simulations, we compare them with random simulations as\nwell as with local observations. The cosmic variance, defined as the mean\none-sigma scatter of cell-to-cell comparison between two fields, is\nsignificantly smaller for the constrained simulations than for the random\nsimulations. Within the inner part of the box where most of the constraints\nare, the scatter is smaller by a factor 2 to 3 on a 5 Mpc/h scale with respect\nto that found for random simulations.

Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully\nreproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the\ninitial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation\nand after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a\nscale-free pure power-law distribution $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto\nM^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by\nintroducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the\ncascade. Our candidate for such physics is a simple model for stellar radiation\nfeedback. Radiative heating, powered by accretion onto forming stars, arrests\nthe fragmentation cascade and imposes a characteristic mass scale that is\nnearly independent of the time-evolution or initial conditions in the\nstar-forming cloud, and that agrees well with the peak of the observed IMF. In\ncontrast, models that introduce a stiff equation of state for denser clouds but\nthat do not explicitly include the effects of feedback do not yield an\ninvariant IMF. \n\n"}

We study the cluster A209 by using the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic data\ncombined with Subaru photometry, yielding to 1916 cluster members down to a\nstellar mass of 10^{8.6} Msun. We determine: i) the stellar mass function of\nstar-forming and passive galaxies; ii) the intra-cluster light and its\nproperties; iii) the orbits of low- and high-mass passive galaxies; and iv) the\nmass-size relation of ETGs. The stellar mass function of the star-forming\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passive\ngalaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. The color distribution of the\nintra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. The\nanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies have\ntangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the BCG. The mass-size\nrelation of low-mass passive ETGs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,\nand its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies. Low-mass\ngalaxies are also more compact within the scale radius of 0.65 Mpc. The ratio\nbetween stellar and number density profiles shows a mass segregation in the\ncenter. The comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profiles\nindicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction.

Our method allows us to convert any constraint on the mass of\nthe MW within a fixed distance to a full circular velocity profile to the MW's\nvirial radius. As primary examples, we take two recent (and discrepant)\nmeasurements of the total mass within 50 kpc of the Galaxy and find they imply\nvery different mass profiles and stellar masses for the Galaxy. The\ndark-matter-only version of the Illustris simulation enables us to compute the\neffects of galaxy formation on such constraints on a halo-by-halo basis; on\nsmall scales, galaxy formation enhances the density relative to\ndark-matter-only runs, while the total mass density is approximately 20% lower\nat large Galactocentric distances.

Abstract: Collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) have recently been invoked as a possible\nmechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using\ncross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration\ntechniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles\ndriving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal.

Recent observations hint at high levels of ionisation and at the\npresence of synchrotron emission in protostellar systems, which leads to an\napparent contradiction.

We analyse three main\nacceleration sites, then we follow the propagation of these particles through\nthe protostellar system up to the hot spot region. We find that jet shocks can\nbe strong accelerators of CR protons, which can be boosted up to relativistic\nenergies. Other promising acceleration sites are protostellar surfaces, where\nshocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough\nto accelerate CR protons. In contrast, accretion flow shocks are too weak to\nefficiently accelerate CRs.

Whereas self-shielded infall\nregions can scatter the Ly$\\alpha$ photons over a much larger area than the\ncommonly used apertures for observing LAEs, the same infalling gas is no longer\noptically thick to the Ly$\\alpha$ emission line after it is ionized by the\nexternal background, making the Ly$\\alpha$ emission more compact and brighter\nwithin the observed apertures. Based on this simple model, we show that the\nobserved drop in the abundance of LAEs at $z>6$ does not imply a rapid increase\nwith redshift of the fraction of the whole IGM volume that is atomic, but is\naccounted for by a rapid increase of the neutral fraction in the infall regions\naround galaxy host halos. \n\n"}

In particular, previous calculations\nhave shown that fast rotating neutron stars, when subjected to a quark-hadron\nphase transition in their interiors, could give rise to the backbending\nphenomenon characterized by a spin-up era. In this work, we use an equation of\nstate composed of two phases, containing nucleons (and leptons) and quarks. The\nhadronic phase is described in a relativistic mean field formalism that takes\nmany-body forces into account, and the quark phase is described by the MIT bag\nmodel with a vector interaction. Stationary and axi-symmetric stellar models\nare obtained in a self-consistent way by solving numerically the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations by means of a pseudo-spectral method. As a result,\nwe obtain the interesting backbending phenomenon for fast spinning neutron\nstars. More importantly, we show that a magnetic field, which is assumed to be\naxi-symmetric and poloidal, can also be enhanced due to the phase transition\nfrom normal hadronic matter to quark matter on highly magnetized neutron stars.\nTherefore, in parallel to the spin-up era, classes of neutron stars endowed\nwith strong magnetic fields may go through a \"magnetic-up era\" in their lives. \n\n"}

Since most of the elements visible in\nX-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae,\nmeasuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis\nproducts of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z~2-3).\nIn this study, we compare the most accurate average X/Fe abundance ratios\n(compiled in a previous work from XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS observations of 44\ngalaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals), representative of the chemical\nenrichment in the nearby ICM, to various SNIa and SNcc nucleosynthesis models\nfound in the literature. The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured\nstandard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our\nabundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly\nunderestimated by the models. We show that the Ca/Fe ratio can be reproduced\nbetter, either by taking a SNIa delayed-detonation model that matches the\nobservations of the Tycho supernova remnant, or by adding a contribution from\nthe Ca-rich gap transient SNe, whose material should easily mix into the hot\nICM.

Our sample of 18 clumps has\nmasses 300 < M < 3000 M_sun, radius 0.54 < R < 1.00 pc, surface densities Sigma\n> 0.05 g cm^-2 and luminosity/mass ratio L/M < 0.3. We show that half of these\n70 micron quiet clumps embed faint 24 micron sources. Comparison with GLIMPSE\ncounterparts shows that 5 clumps embed young stars of intermediate stellar mass\nup to ~5.5 M_sun. We study the clump dynamics with observations of N2H+ (1-0),\nHNC (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) made with the IRAM 30m telescope. Seven clumps have\nblue-shifted spectra compatible with infall signatures, for which we estimate a\nmass accretion rate 0.04 < M_dot < 2.0 x 10^-3 M_sun yr^-1, comparable with\nvalues found in high-mass protostellar regions, and free-fall time of the order\nof t_ff = 3 x 10^5 yr. The only appreciable difference we find between objects\nwith and without embedded 24 micron sources is that the infall rate appears to\nincrease from 24 micron dark to 24 micron bright objects. We conclude that all\n70 micron quiet objects have similar properties on clump scales, independently\nof the presence of an embedded protostar. Based on our data we speculate that\nthe majority, if not all of these clumps may already embed faint, low-mass\nprotostellar cores. If these clumps are to form massive stars, this must occur\nafter the formation of these lower mass stars. \n\n"}

Nonetheless, as a\nresult of their uncertain kinematics, the DM content and astrophysical\nJ-factors of dSphs are usually affected by significant errors. In this paper,\nwe study a sample of 36 dIrrs as prospective targets of interest. In the\nframework of the universal rotation curve, the kinematics of dIrr galaxies\nprovides a good estimation of their DM halo density distribution and,\nconsequently, of their astrophysical J-factors. We calculate the J-factors for\nthese 36 dIrr galaxies. We find a range of values comparable with the J-factors\nof dSph galaxies. However, differently from dSphs an extra astrophysical\ngamma-ray background component is expected in dIrrs, that is due to their\nstar-formation activity. In this paper, we show via a theoretical approach that\nfor galaxies in our sample the extra astrophysical background component is\nnegligible.

Our simulations predict the\npresence of significant hot gas in the halos as early as $z=3-4$, well before\nthe halos ought to be able to sustain hot mode accretion in the conventional\npicture. The nascent coronae grow inside-out and initially do so primarily as a\nresult of outflows from the central galaxies powered by merger-induced shock\nheating and strong supernovae feedback, both of which are elemental features of\ntoday's successful galaxy formation models. Furthermore, the outflows and the\nforming coronae also accelerate the transition from cold to hot mode accretion\nby contributing to the conditions for sustaining stable accretion shocks. They\nalso disrupt the filamentary streams funneling cold gas onto the central\ngalaxies by causing their mouths to fray into a broad delta, detach from the\ngalaxies, and be pushed away to larger radii. And even though at early times\nthe filaments repeatedly re-form, the hot gas and the outflows act to weaken\nthe filaments and accelerate their ultimate disruption.

Along the interaction, galaxies are found to have\nmetallicity gradients and sSFR consistent with observations, on average. Strong\ngas inflows produced during galaxy-galaxy interactions or as a result of strong\nlocal instabilities in gas-rich discs are able to produce both a quick dilution\nof the central gas-phase metallicity and a sudden increase of the sSFR.

Simulated galaxies\nwithout experiencing strong disturbances evolve smoothly without modifying the\nmetallicity gradients. Gas-rich systems show large dispersion along the\ncorrelation.

One significant source of uncertainty is the\ncontribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce\nsubstantial mid-IR (MIR) emission.

When the local\ngravitational interactions between the scalar modes are sufficiently rapid, it\ncan cause the field to re-organize into a BEC of gravitationally bound clumps.\nWhile these clumps are stable when only gravitation is included, the picture is\ncomplicated by the presence of the axion's attractive self-interactions, which\ncan potentially cause the clumps to collapse. Here we perform a detailed\nstability analysis to determine under what conditions the clumps are stable. In\nthis paper we focus on spherical configurations, leaving aspherical\nconfigurations for future work. We identify branches of clump solutions of the\naxion-gravity-self-interacting system and study their stability properties. We\nfind that clumps that are (spatially) large are stable, while clumps that are\n(spatially) small are unstable and may collapse. Furthermore, there is a\nmaximum number of particles that can be in a clump. We map out the full space\nof solutions, which includes quasi-stable axitons, and clarify how a recent\nclaim in the literature of a new ultra-dense branch of stable solutions rests\non an invalid use of the non-relativistic approximation. We also consider\nrepulsive self-interactions that may arise from a generic scalar dark matter\ncandidate, finding a single stable branch that extends to arbitrary particle\nnumber. \n\n"}

It allows us to constrain\ncosmology, bias and stochasticity of galaxies w.r.t. matter density and, in\naddition, the skewness of the matter density field.\n  From a Bayesian model comparison, we find that the data weakly prefer a\nconnection of galaxies and matter that is stochastic beyond Poisson\nfluctuations on <=20 arcmin angular smoothing scale. The two stochasticity\nmodels we fit yield DES constraints on the matter density\n$\\Omega_m=0.26^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $\\Omega_m=0.28^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ that are\nconsistent with each other.

The dark\nmatter particle candidates are axion-like, with masses of order eV and strong\nself-interactions. They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the\ncentral regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn\ncouple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable\nchoice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.\nIn this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological\nconsequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo\nprofile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we\nshow how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can\nbe reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive\nhigh surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law.

Here we study this relation within the\nframework of the modified gravity model MOND. The field equations of MOND\nautomatically imply the radial acceleration relation for spherically symmetric\ngalaxies, but for disk galaxies deviations from the relation are expected. Here\nwe investigate whether these deviations are of sufficient magnitude to bring\nMOND into conflict with the observed relation. In the quasilinear formulation\nof MOND, to calculate the gravitational field of a given distribution of\nmatter, an intermediate step is to calculate the \"pristine field\", which is a\nsimple nonlinear function of the Newtonian field corresponding to the same\ndistribution of matter. Hence, to the extent that the quasilinear gravitational\nfield is approximately equal to the pristine field, the radial acceleration\nrelation will be satisfied. We show that the difference between the quasilinear\nand pristine fields obeys the equations of magnetostatics, the curl of the\npristine field serves as the source for the difference in the two fields, much\nas currents serve as sources for the magnetic field. Using the magnetostatic\nanalogy we numerically study the difference between the pristine and\nquasilinear fields for simple model galaxies with a Gaussian profile.

These structures in the inner kiloparsec are most important to\nexplain and understand the rate of black hole feeding. The aim of this work is\nto investigate the influence of stellar bars in spiral galaxies on the thin\nself-gravitating gas disk.

We conduct\nmulti-scale simulations simultaneously resolving the galactic disk and the\naccretion disk around the central black-hole. We vary in all simulations the\ninitial gas disk mass. As additional parameter we choose either the gas\ntemperature for isothermal simulations or the cooling timescale in case of\nnon-isothermal simulations.

For these systems, we measure a slope in the SFR-dM/dt relation\ngreater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores\nare also cooling more efficiently. We propose that this may be related to, on\naverage, higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which\ncould influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and\ndominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback.

The\nJavalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is a dedicated\nmulti-filter designed to observed ~8500 deg2 using twelve narrow-,\nintermediate- and broad-band filters in the optical range. In this study, we\ntest the potential of the multi-filter observation carried out with J-PLUS to\ninvestigate the properties of spatially-resolved nearby galaxies. We present\ndetailed 2D maps of stellar population properties (age, metallicity,\nextinction, and stellar mass surface density) for two early-type galaxies\nobserved in both, J-PLUS and CALIFA surveys: NGC 5473 and NGC 5485. Radial\nstructures are also compared and luminosity- and mass-weighted profiles are\nderived. We use MUFFIT to process the J-PLUS observations, and two different\ntechniques (STARLIGHT and STECKMAP) to analyze IFU CALIFA data. We demonstrate\nthat this novel technique delivers radial stellar population gradients in good\nagreement with the IFU technique CALIFA/STECKMAP although comparison of the\nabsolute values reveals the existence of intrinsic systematic differences.\nRadial stellar population gradients differ when CALIFA/STARLIGHT methodology is\nused.

Comparison between the three\nmethodologies reveals some discrepancies suggesting that the specific\ncharacteristics of each method causes important differences.

If merging is a non-negligible factor in the\ngrowth of our Galaxy, evidence of such events should be encoded in its stellar\nhalo. Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task\nhowever. The 1st Gaia data release contains the positions, parallaxes and\nproper motions for over 2 million stars, mostly in the Solar neighbourhood.\nGaia DR2 will enlarge this sample to over 1.5 billion stars, the brightest ~5\nmillion of which will have a full phase-space information. Our aim is to\ndevelop a machine learning model to reliably identify halo stars, even when\ntheir full phase-space information is not available. We use the Gradient\nBoosted Trees algorithm to build a supervised halo star classifier. The\nclassifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model\nSnapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected\nuncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the\ncross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are\nlabelled in an entirely model independent way. We then use this model to\nidentify halo stars in TGAS. When full phase- space information is available\nand for Gaia DR2-like uncertainties, our classifier is able to recover 90% of\nthe halo stars with at most 30% distance errors, in a completely unseen test\nset, and with negligible levels of contamination. When line-of-sight velocity\nis not available, we recover ~60% of such halo stars, with less than 10%\ncontamination. When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high\nconfidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the\nexpectation from models given the data uncertainties. The large parallax errors\nare the biggest limitation to identify a larger number of halo stars in all the\ncases studied. \n\n"}

Finally, the data for 4\nGRB hosts are not deep enough to judge whether they are molecule deficient\n(000418, 030329, 031203, and 090423). The median value of the molecular gas\ndepletion time, MH2/SFR, of GRB hosts is ~0.3 dex below that of other\nstar-forming galaxies, but this result has low statistical significance. A\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test performed on MH2/SFR shows an only ~2sigma difference\nbetween GRB hosts and other galaxies.

Given the concentration of atomic gas\nrecently found close to GRB and supernova sites, indicating recent gas inflow,\nour results about the weak molecular deficiency imply that such an inflow does\nnot enhance the SFRs significantly, or that atomic gas converts efficiently\ninto the molecular phase, which fuels star formation. \n\n"}

This is\nthe main question addressed in the present analysis. We also discuss the\nvalidity of Derrick's theorem when scalar fields are embedded in non-trivial\ngravitational backgrounds. In the context of the above question, we consider\nthree global defect configurations: a finite thickness spherical domain wall\nwith a central S-dS black hole, a global string loop with a S-dS black hole in\nthe center and a global monopole near a S-dS black hole. Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a\ncritical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the\nwall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it\ndevelops ghost instabilities. For smaller initial radius, tension dominates and\nthe wall contracts towards the black hole horizon where it also develops ghost\ninstabilities. We also show, using the same analytical model and energetic\narguments that a global monopole is gravitationally attracted by a black hole\nwhile a cosmological constant induces a repulsive gravitational potential as in\nthe case of test particles.

The WL effect depends on the lensing potential (LP) caused by matter\nperturbations, the distribution of which at cosmological scales is given by the\nmatter power spectrum (MPS). Therefore, the WL effect on the CMB $B$ mode is\naffected by the MPS. Considering the effect of the ensemble average energy\ndensity of the PMF, which we call \"the background PMF,\" on the MPS, the\namplitude of MPS is suppressed in the wave number range of $k>0.01~h$\nMpc$^{-1}$.The MPS affects the LP and the WL effect in the CMB $B$ mode;\nhowever, the PMF can damp this effect.

We summarize how such shell-burning\ndepend on the accretion rate and the WD mass and how the WD blows strong wind.\nWe identify the following evolutionary routes for the accreting WD to trigger a\nthermonuclear explosion. With a decreasing rate with time, 5 phases are\nobserved: 1. The WD increases its mass by stable H burning and blows a strong\nwind, which strips a part of the companion star's envelope to control the\naccretion rate and forms circumstellar matter (CSM). The WD may explode within\nCSM as an \"SN Ia-CSM\". 2. The wind stops and an SN Ia is triggered under\nsteady-stable H shell-burning, which is observed as a super-soft X-ray source:\n\"SN Ia-SSXS\". 3. H shell-burning becomes unstable and many flashes recur. The\nWD undergoes recurrent nova (RN) whose mass ejection is smaller than the\naccreted matter, evolving to an \"SN Ia-RN\". 4. If the companion is a He star or\nWD, the accretion of He can trigger He and C double detonations at the\nsub-Chandrasekhar (sub-Chand) mass or the WD grows to the Chand mass while\nproducing and He-wind: \"SN Ia-He CSM\". 5.

The extraction of the neutrino mass\nordering is a data-driven field expected to evolve very rapidly in the next\ndecade.

However, their\ndetection is sensitive to radiative transfer effects that depend on local\nastrophysical conditions. Thus, modeling the bulk properties of this galaxy\npopulation remains challenging for theoretical models. Here we develop a\nphysically-motivated scheme to predict LAEs in cosmological simulations. The\nescape of Ly{\\alpha} photons is computed using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode which outputs a Ly{\\alpha} escape fraction. To speed-up the process of\nassigning escape fractions to individual galaxies, we employ fitting formulae\nthat approximate the full Monte Carlo results within an accuracy of 10% for a\nbroad range of column densities, gas metallicities and gas bulk velocities. We\napply our methodology to the semi-analytical model GALFORM on a large N-body\nsimulation.

In this paper, we derive an analytic formula of\nthe decay rate of the I-balls/oscillons within the classical field theory. In\nour approach, we calculate the Poynting vector of the perturbation around the\nI-ball/oscillon profile by solving a relativistic field equation, with which\nthe decay rate of the I-ball/oscillon is obtained. We also perform a classical\nlattice simulation and confirm the validity of our analytical formula of the\ndecay rate numerically. \n\n"}

Furthermore, we\nfind that the recent constraint of $\\Lambda_{1.4} \\le 580$ from the\ngravitational wave signal GW170817 detected from the binary neutron star merger\nby the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations rules out too stiff high-density symmetry\nenergy, leading to an upper limit of $R_{1.4} \\le 13.3$ km. All these\nterrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations based on strong,\nEM and gravitational measurements together put stringent constraints on the\nhigh-density symmetry energy and the EOS of SNM, pure neutron matter and\nneutron star matter. \n\n"}
