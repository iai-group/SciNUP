In this article, we study the performance of reactor and\nsuperbeam neutrino experiments in the presence of such non-standard\ninteractions (NSI). Due to interference between the standard and non-standard\namplitudes, sizeable effects are to be expected if the NSI parameters are close\nto their current upper limits. We derive approximate formulas for the relevant\noscillation probabilities including NSI, and show how the leading effects can\nbe understood intuitively even without any calculations. We will present a\nclassification of all possible NSI according to their impact on reactor and\nsuperbeam experiments, and it will turn out that these experiments are highly\ncomplementary in terms of their sensitivity to the non-standard parameters. The\nsecond part of the paper is devoted to detailed numerical simulations, which\nwill demonstrate how a standard oscillation fit of the mixing angle theta-13\nmay fail if experimental data is affected by NSI. We find that for some\nnon-standard terms, reactor and superbeam experiments would yield seemingly\nconflicting results, while in other cases, they may agree well with each other,\nbut the resulting value for theta-13 could be far from the true value. This\noffset may be so large that the true theta-13 is even ruled out erroneously.

The VHE emission could,\nin principle, be interpreted as Compton upscattering of external radiation\n(e.g., from the broad-line regions). However, such an interpretation would\nrequire either an unusually low magnetic field of B ~ 0.03 G or an\nunrealistically high Doppler factor of Gamma ~ 140.

Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature.

The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05.

However, in\ncalculating the afterglows, usually only the emission from the forward jet is\nconsidered. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the afterglow from\nthe receding jet. Our calculation is based on a generic dynamical description,\nand includes some delicate ingredients such as the effect of the equal arrival\ntime surface. It is found that the emission from the receding jet is generally\nrather weak. In radio bands, it usually peaks at a time of $t \\geq 1000$ d,\nwith the peak flux nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. Also, it usually manifests as a short plateau in the total\nafterglow light curve, but not as an obvious rebrightening as once expected. In\noptical bands, the contribution from the receding jet is even weaker, with the\npeak flux being $\\sim 8$ orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. We thus argue that the emission from the receding jet is very\ndifficult to detect. However, in some special cases, i.e., when the\ncircum-burst medium density is very high, or if the parameters of the receding\njet is quite different from those of the forward jet, the emission from the\nreceding jet can be significantly enhanced and may still emerge as a marked\nrebrightening.

First, because ScaLAPACK assumes a homogeneous communication\nnetwork, the implementations of ScaLAPACK algorithms lack locality in their\ncommunication pattern. Second, the number of messages sent in the ScaLAPACK\nalgorithms is significantly greater than other algorithms that trade flops for\ncommunication. In this paper, we present a new approach for computing a QR\nfactorization -- one of the main dense linear algebra kernels -- of tall and\nskinny matrices in a grid computing environment that overcomes these two\nbottlenecks. Our contribution is to articulate a recently proposed algorithm\n(Communication Avoiding QR) with a topology-aware middleware (QCG-OMPI) in\norder to confine intensive communications (ScaLAPACK calls) within the\ndifferent geographical sites. An experimental study conducted on the Grid'5000\nplatform shows that the resulting performance increases linearly with the\nnumber of geographical sites on large-scale problems (and is in particular\nconsistently higher than ScaLAPACK's). \n\n"}

The source luminosity varies\nby a factor 3-4, giving rise to corresponding spectral changes which are\nsignificant, but subtle, and not well tracked by a simple hardness ratio.\nInstead, we co-add the Swift data in intensity bins and do full spectral\nfitting with disc plus thermal Comptonisation models. All the data are\nwell-fitted by a low temperature, optically thick Comptonising corona, and the\nvariability can be roughly characterised by decreasing temperature and\nincreasing optical depth as the source becomes brighter, as expected if the\ncorona is becoming progressively mass loaded by material blown off the\nsuper-Eddington inner disc. This variability behaviour is seen in other ULX\nwhich have similar spectra, but is opposite to the trend seen in ULX with much\nsofter spectra. This supports the idea that there are two distinct physical\nregimes in ULXs, where the spectra go from being dominated by a disc-corona to\nbeing dominated by a wind. \n\n"}

This possibility is inevitably related with the\ndark matter interpretation of the observed PAMELA and FERMI excesses. The aim\nof this paper is providing a simple and universal method to constraint dark\nmatter models which produce electrons and positrons in their decay by using the\nFermi LAT gamma-ray observations in the energy range between 0.5 GeV and 300\nGeV. We provide a set of universal response functions that, once convolved with\na specific dark matter model produce the desired constraint. Our response\nfunctions contain all the astrophysical inputs such as the electron propagation\nin the galaxy, the dark matter profile, the gamma-ray fluxes of known origin,\nand the Fermi LAT data. We study the uncertainties in the determination of the\nresponse functions and apply them to place constraints on some specific dark\nmatter decay models that can well fit the positron and electron fluxes observed\nby PAMELA and Fermi LAT. To this end we also take into account prompt radiation\nfrom the dark matter decay. We find that with the available data decaying dark\nmatter cannot be excluded as source of the PAMELA positron excess. \n\n"}

We use the 31 clusters from the\nREXCESS sample, compiled from the southern ROSAT All-Sky cluster survey REFLEX\nwith a morphologically unbiased selection in X-ray luminosity and redshift, all\nof which have been reobserved with XMM-Newton. We investigate the uncertainties\nof the substructure parameters and examine the dependence of the results on\nprojection effects, finding that the uncertainties of the parameters can be\nquite substantial. Thus while the quantification of the dynamical state of\nindividual clusters with these parameters should be treated with extreme\ncaution, these substructure measures provide powerful statistical tools to\ncharacterise trends of properties in large cluster samples. The centre shift\nparameter, w, is found to be more sensitive in general. For the REXCESS sample\nneither the occurence of substructure nor the presence of cool cores depends on\ncluster mass. There is a significant anti-correlation between the existence of\nsubstantial substructure and cool cores.

Moreover, the frequency of cool regions is higher\nin the simulations than in the observations, implying that the description of\nthe physical processes shaping cluster formation in the simulations requires\nfurther improvement. \n\n"}

This amplification may be due to\nplasma instabilities driven by shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs). One\ncandidate is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004),\ncaused by the electric current of large Larmor radii CRs propagating parallel\nto the upstream magnetic field. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown\nthat the back-reaction of the amplified field on CRs would limit the\namplification factor of this instability to less than ~10 in galactic SNRs. In\nthis paper, we study the possibility of further amplification driven near\nshocks by \"magnetized\" CRs, whose Larmor radii are smaller than the length\nscale of the field that was previously amplified by the CRCD instability. We\nfind that additional amplification can occur due to a new instability, driven\nby the CR current perpendicular to the field, which we term the \"perpendicular\ncurrent-driven instability\" (PCDI). We derive the growth rate of this\ninstability, and, using PIC simulations, study its non-linear evolution and\nsaturation. We find that PCDI increases the amplification of the field\n(amplification factor up to ~45, not including the shock compression) and\ndiscuss its observational signatures.

From a set of 391 light curves\nk-corrected to the rest frame B and V bands, we find a smaller dispersion in\nthe rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. This is in\nqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations in\nradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the\ndecline rates. The differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest\nthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properly\nmodel the range of SN Ia light curve shapes. We select a subset of 105 light\ncurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves and\ndevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall times\nindependently. We find the average time from explosion to B-band peak\nbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days. Our average rise time is shorter than the\n19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different light\ncurve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm.

Here we\ninvestigate whether electrons can be accelerated to energies such that they\nradiate synchrotron photons with energy up to about 10 GeV in this particular\nscenario. We do this using two methods: (i) we check if these electrons can be\nconfined to the shock front; and (ii) we calculate radiative losses while they\nare being accelerated. We find that these electrons remain confined to the\nshock front, as long as the upstream magnetic field is >~ 10 micro-Gauss, and\ndon't suffer substantial radiative losses, the only condition required is that\nthe external reverse shock emission be not too bright: peak flux less than 1 Jy\nin order to produce photons of 100 MeV, and less than ~100 mJy for producing\n1-GeV photons.

METHODS: Very High Energy\n(VHE; E > 100 GeV) observations of H 2356-309 were performed with the High\nEnergy Stereoscopic System (HESS) from 2004 through 2007. Simultaneous\noptical/UV and X-ray observations were made with the XMM-Newton satellite on\nJune 12/13 and June 14/15, 2005. NRT radio observations were also\ncontemporaneously performed in 2005.

The\nintegral flux above 240 GeV is I(>240 GeV) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61\n{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observed\nfrom the Crab Nebula. A time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 GeV\nto 2 TeV and is characterized by a power law (photon index of Gamma = 3.06 +-\n0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). Significant small-amplitude variations in the VHE\nflux from H 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not on\nshorter time scales.

When combined\nwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are able\nto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburst\nmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of the\noutflows. In agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativistic\nenergy budget of at least one of these events (GRB 090926A) exceeds the\ncanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. Such energies pose a\nsevere challenge for models in which the GRB is powered by a magnetar or\nneutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectations\nfor magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) collapsar models. Our jet opening angles\n(theta) are similar to those found for pre-Fermi GRBs, but the large initial\nLorentz factors (Gamma_0) inferred from the detection of GeV photons imply\ntheta Gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in MHD models of\njet acceleration. Finally, we find that these Fermi-LAT events preferentially\noccur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that this\nmight result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicity\nprogenitor stars. Future studies of Fermi-LAT afterglows in the radio with the\norder-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the EVLA should\ndefinitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events. \n\n"}

These effects may have striking consequences; for example, for\nresonantly-enhanced Sommerfeld annihilation, dark matter freezes out but may\nthen chemically recouple, implying highly suppressed indirect signals, in\ncontrast to naive expectations.

The sample contains those bursts with\nmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.\nIntermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long\nGRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average\none order of magnitude fainter than long bursts.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet. This model matches the overall spectrum shown by the Auger\ndata and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function of\nparticle energy.

At\nenergies above about 10^{16} eV (in ice), the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM)\neffect significantly reduces the cross sections for the two dominant\nelectromagnetic interactions: bremsstrahlung and pair production.

All the strong K_alpha line\nemission show broader widths at the center than at the rim, while the centroid\nenergies are constant across the remnant (except for Ca). This is the pattern\nexpected for Doppler broadening due to expansion of the SNR ejecta in a\nspherical shell. To determine the expansion velocities of the ejecta, we\napplied a model for each emission line feature having two Gaussian components\nseparately representing red- and blue-shifted gas, and inferred the Doppler\nvelocity difference between these two components directly from the fitted\ncentroid energy difference. Taking into account the effect of projecting a\nthree-dimensional shell to the plane of the detector, we derived average\nspherical expansion velocities independently for the K_alpha emission of Si, S,\nAr, and Fe, and K_beta of Si.

We construct a purely gravitational theoretical model of perfectly\ncollimated jets of high energy particles in the ideal case where the central\nengine is a Kerr BH of mass $M$ and angular momentum by unit of mass $a$. We\nstudy in Weyl coordinates ($\\rho $, $z$) the unbound Kerr 2D-geodesics which\nare asymptotes to straight lines parallel to the $z$ axis of equations \\rho\n=constant= \\rho_{1}= [(a/M)^2+Q/(E^2-1)]^{1/2} of which existence was recently\ndemonstrated (Gariel et al.,A & A, 2010).

Previous\nwork has shown that rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars\n(`millisecond proto-magnetars') produce outflows with energies, timescales, and\nmagnetizations sigma_0 (maximum Lorentz factor) that are consistent with those\nrequired to produce long GRBs. Here we extend this work in order to construct a\nself-consistent model that directly connects the properties of the central\nengine to the observed prompt emission. Just after the launch of the supernova\nshock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The\noutflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As\nthe magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux\ndominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet\nto clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the\nprompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models:\nmagnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic\ndissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band'\nspectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading\ndecreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t\n~ 10-100 seconds.

Most\nplausible explanation of this phenomena is an assumption that the magnetic\nfield at the stellar surface differs essentially from the purely dipolar field.\nWe can determine magnetic field at the surface by the conservation of the\nmagnetic flux through the area bounded by open magnetic field lines. Then the\nvalue of the surface magnetic field can be estimated as of the order of\n$10^{14}$ G. On the other hand observations show that the temperature of the\nhot spot is about a few million Kelvins.

To account for the phase alignment, we\nexplore geometric models where both the radio and gamma-ray emission originate\neither in the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder (R_LC) or near the\npolar caps (PCs). We obtain reasonable fits for the first three of these MSPs\nin the context of \"altitude-limited\" outer gap (alOG) and two-pole caustic\n(alTPC) geometries. The outer magnetosphere phase-aligned models differ from\nthe standard outer gap (OG) / two-pole caustic (TPC) models in two respects:\nfirst, the radio emission originates in caustics at relatively high altitudes\ncompared to the usual low-altitude conal radio beams; second, we allow the\nmaximum altitude of the gamma-ray emission region as well as both the minimum\nand maximum altitudes of the radio emission region to vary within a limited\nrange. Alternatively, there also exist phase-aligned LC solutions for emission\noriginating near the stellar surface in a slot gap (SG) scenario (\"low-altitude\nslot gap\" (laSG) models). We find best-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) maximum likelihood approach. Our fits imply that the phase-aligned LCs\nare likely of caustic origin, produced in the outer magnetosphere, and that the\nradio emission may come from close to R_LC.

The problem is relevant for probes of magnetic field in\ncosmic voids through gamma-ray observations. In addition, dissipation of such\nbeams could affect considerably the thermal history of the intergalactic medium\nand structure formation. We use a Monte Carlo method to quantify the properties\nof the blazar induced electromagnetic shower, in particular the bulk Lorentz\nfactor and the angular spread of the pair beam generated by the shower, as a\nfunction of distance from the blazar itself. We then use linear and nonlinear\nkinetic theory to study the stability of the pair beam against the growth of\nelectrostatic plasma waves, employing the Monte Carlo results for our\nquantitative estimates. We find that the fastest growing mode, like any\nperturbation mode with even a very modest component perpendicular to the beam\ndirection, cannot be described in the reactive regime. Due to the effect of\nnon-linear Landau damping, which suppresses the growth of plasma oscillations,\nthe beam relaxation timescale is found significantly longer than the inverse\nCompton loss time. Finally, density inhomogeneities associated with cosmic\nstructure induce loss of resonance between the beam particles and plasma\noscillations, strongly inhibiting their growth.

Simultaneously,\nthe X-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about\n1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 .

If this interpretation\nis correct, we predict that the LUX experiment, with a significantly higher\nlight yield than XENON100, should observe dark matter induced events at an\nobservable rate of ~3-24 per month. \n\n"}

We include the nuclear energy input from the freshly synthesized,\nradioactively decaying nuclei in our simulations and study its effects on the\nremnant dynamics. Although the nuclear heating substantially alters the\nlongterm evolution, we find that running nuclear networks over purely\nhydrodynamic simulations (i.e. without heating) yields actually acceptable\nnucleosynthesis results. The main dynamic effect of the radioactive heating is\nto quickly smooth out inhomogeneities in the initial mass distribution,\nsubsequently the evolution proceeds self-similarly and after 100 years the\nremnant still carries the memory of the initial binary mass ratio. We also\nexplore the nucleosynthetic yields for two mass ejection channels.

Wolf-Rayet stars are the\nmost plausible LGRB progenitors, since the free-fall time of the envelope is\nconsistent with the duration, and the natural outcome of the progenitor is a\nType Ic SN. While a new population of ultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), GRB 111209A,\nGRB 101225A, and GRB 121027A, has a duration of ~ 10^4 s, two of them are\naccompanied by superluminous-supernova (SLSN) like bumps, which are <~ 10 times\nbrighter than typical hypernovae. Wolf-Rayet progenitors cannot explain ULGRBs\nbecause of too long duration and too bright SN-like bump. A blue supergiant\n(BSG) progenitor model, however, can explain the duration of ULGRBs. Moreover,\nSLSN-like bump can be attributed to the so-called cocoon-fireball photospheric\nemissions (CFPEs).

While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor\nsystems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently\nsuggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase.\nAims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems\nbeing SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible\ndurations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic\npopulation. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to\nexamine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa\nassumptions, and 2) an optimistic best-case scenario. The latter case\nestablishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate\nthat unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, the vast\nmajority of the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a\ncombination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even\nwith extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and\nretention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually\nbecome double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small. Consequently, the lengths of\ntime that these systems may be SSSs are short, even under optimal conditions,\nand the expected number of such systems in a galactic population is negligible.\nConclusions: The population of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitors that\nare SSSs is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the population of\nsingle-degenerate progenitors expected to be SSSs, and the supersoft X-ray\nbehaviour of double-degenerate systems typically ceases long before the SN\nexplosions. \n\n"}

Here\nwe present an analysis of the red Ly alpha damping wing of the afterglow\nspectrum taken by Subaru/FOCAS during 10.4-13.2 hr after the burst.

Such a\ncurvature in the short wavelength range cannot be explained either by\nextinction at the host with standard extinction curves, intrinsic curvature of\nafterglow spectra, or by the known systematic uncertainties in the observed\nspectrum. The red damping wing by intervening HI gas outside the host can\nreduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance. We find that a\ndamped Ly alpha system is not favored as the origin of this intervening HI\nabsorption, from the observed Ly beta and metal absorption features. Therefore\nabsorption by diffuse IGM remains as a plausible explanation. A fit by a simple\nuniform IGM model requires HI neutral fraction of f_HI ~ 0.1-0.5 depending on\nthe distance to the GRB host, implying high f_HI IGM associated with the\nobserved dark Gunn-Peterson (GP) troughs.

Using high-resolution 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations, we isolate the impact of AGN feedback on the $L_{\\rm\nx}-T_{\\rm x} $ relation, testing the two archetypal and common regimes,\nself-regulated mechanical feedback and a quasar thermal blast. We find that AGN\nfeedback has severe difficulty in breaking the relation in a consistent way.\nThe similarity breaking is directly linked to the gas evacuation within\n$R_{500}$, while the central cooling times are inversely proportional to the\ncore density. Breaking self-similarity implies thus breaking the cool core,\nmorphing all systems to non-cool-core objects, which is in clear contradiction\nwith the observed data populated by several cool-core systems. Self-regulated\nfeedback, which quenches cooling flows and preserves cool cores, prevents the\ndramatic evacuation and similarity breaking at any scale; the relation scatter\nis also limited.

We reobserved the galaxy in high spatial\nresolution using the VIMOS integral-field unit (IFU) at the VLT with a spaxel\nsize of 0.67 arcsec. Furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data from\nHIRES/Keck at two different slit positions covering the GRB site, the center of\nthe galaxy and an HII region next to the GRB region. We compare the properties\nof different HII regions in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global\nand local kinematic properties of this galaxy. The resolved data show that the\nGRB site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 Z_solar, but\nits specific SFR (SSFR) of 7.4 M_solar/yr/L/L* and age (determined by the\nHalpha EW) are similar to other HII regions in the host. The galaxy shows a\ngradient in metallicity and SSFR from the bulge to the outskirts as it is\ncommon for spiral galaxies. This gives further support to the theory that GRBs\nprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in S-type\ngalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.\nKinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for large\nperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. This study\nconfirms the collapsar origin of GRB060505 but reveals that the properties of\nthe HII region surrounding the GRB were not unique to that galaxy. Spatially\nresolved observations are key to know the implications and interpretations of\nunresolved GRB hosts observations at higher redshifts. \n\n"}

The optical data also show narrow\nabsorption and emission features with nearly synchronous and significant\nDoppler motions. A radial velocity study of these lines which we associate with\nthe secondary star, yields a semi-amplitude of K_2=382 km/s. A time-series\nanalysis of the spectral and photometric data revealed a possible orbital\nperiodicity of 2.85 h, significantly shorter than the reported 3.2 h periodic\nsignal by Zurita et al.

The ejected material contributes to a\nradioactively-powered electromagnetic transient, with properties that depend\nsensitively on the composition of the outflow. Here we investigate how the spin\nof the black hole remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscous\ntimescales. We carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic\nsimulations of merger remnant accretion disks including viscous angular\nmomentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation. The gravity of\nthe spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find\nthat a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of\nseveral, relative to the non-spinning case. The enhanced mass loss is due to\nenergy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational potential,\nraising the disk temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regions\nwhere neutrino cooling is ineffective. The mean electron fraction of the\noutflow increases moderately with BH spin due to a highly-irradiated (though\nnot neutrino-driven) wind component. While the bulk of the ejecta is still very\nneutron-rich, thus generating heavy r-process elements, the leading edge of the\nwind contains a small amount of Lanthanide-free material.

At the\nsame time there is a debate in the literature as to what degree the $r$-process\nelements are produced in supernovae or the mergers of binary neutron stars. In\nthis paper we propose a novel solution to both problems. We demonstrate that\nthe underproduction of elements above and below the $r$-process peaks\ncharacteristic in the main or weak $r$-process events (like magnetohydrodynamic\njets or neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae) can be supplemented\nvia fission fragment distributions from the recycling of material in a\nneutron-rich environment such as that encountered in neutron star mergers.

The clumps should give the main contribution into the\nsignal of dark matter annihilation, provided that they have survived until the\npresent time.

Whether initially\nweak magnetic fields can be amplified by this instability to dynamically\nrelevant strengths is still a matter of debate. One of the main uncertainties\nconcerns the process that terminates the growth of the instability. Parasitic\ninstabilities of both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing-mode type have been\nsuggested to play a crucial role in this process, disrupting MRI channel flows\nand quenching magnetic field amplification. We perform two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional sheering-disc simulations of a differentially rotating\nprotoneutron star layer in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics with unprecedented\nhigh numerical accuracy, finding that Kelvin-Helmholtz parasitic modes dominate\ntearing modes in the regime of large hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers, as encountered close to the surface of protoneutron stars.

An observer far from a star\nis most sensitive to the spherically-symmetric piece of this profile that\ndecays linearly with the inverse of the distance, the so-called scalar charge,\nwhich is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binaries.\nThe presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to very strongly constrain\nextended theories of gravity. These facts may lead people to believe that\ngravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been\nconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems\nyielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic\ngravity theories. To achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge for\nslowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. In generic case,\neither neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to\nconstrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary\nconstraints. However, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar\ncharge. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from black\nhole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries.

A strong gamma-ray flare from this\nsource was detected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray\nSpace Telescope satellite in 2013 January, reaching on January 20 a daily peak\nflux of (301$\\pm$36)$\\times$10$^{-8}$ ph/cm$^2$/s in the 0.1-100 GeV energy\nrange. This flux corresponds to an apparent isotropic luminosity of\n(1.5$\\pm$0.2)$\\times$10$^{50}$ erg/s, comparable to the highest values observed\nby a blazar so far. During the flare the increase of flux was accompanied by a\nsignificant change of the spectral properties.

The broad band\nX-ray spectra of PKS 2149-306 observed by Swift-XRT and NuSTAR are well\ndescribed by a broken power-law model, with a very hard spectrum ($\\Gamma$$_1$\n$\\sim$ 1) below the break energy, at E$_{\\rm\\,break}$ = 2.5-3.0 keV, and\n$\\Gamma$$_2$ $\\sim$ 1.4-1.5 above the break energy.

These TDEs release a huge amount of radiation energy ~ 10^51-52 erg\ninto the circum-nuclear medium.

Seven SNe Ia have been analysed to date looking for signs of H-rich\nmaterial in their late-time spectra and none were detected. We present results\nfrom new late-time spectra of 11 SNe Ia obtained at the Very Large Telescope\nusing XShooter and FORS2.

Radiation constraints, which are relevant for high-energy neutrino\nproduction are considered as well. Efficient shock acceleration of cosmic rays\nis possible for sufficiently low-power jets and/or jets buried in a dense,\nextended wind or outer envelope.

Such\nchoked jets may explain transrelativistic supernovae (SNe) and low-luminosity\n(LL) GRBs, giving a unified picture of GRBs and GRB-SNe. Focusing on this\nunified scenario for GRBs, we calculate the resulting neutrino spectra from\nchoked jets including the relevant microphysical processes such as multipion\nproduction in pp and pgamma interactions, as well as the energy losses of\nmesons and muons. We obtain diffuse neutrino spectra using the latest results\nfor the luminosity function of LL GRBs.

We show that such a\npulse observed off-axis is (i) broader, (ii) softer and (iii) displays a\ndifferent hardness-intensity correlation with respect to the same pulse seen\non-axis. For each of these effects, we provide an intuitive physical\nexplanation. We then show how a synthetic light curve made by a superposition\nof pulses changes with increasing viewing angle.

Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two\nprocesses and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied\ncircumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our\nresults in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we\ncome up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk\nstructures, which differ from the standard constant $\\dot M$ accretion disk\nsolution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a\nsignificant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.\nWe show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously\ntransmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can\nmerge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the\ninspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even\nif the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass disk (lower than its own\nmass). This is important for resolving the \"last parsec\" problem for SMBH\nbinaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe.\nWe argue that the enhancement of accretion by the binary found in some recent\nsimulations cannot persist for a long time and should not affect the long-term\norbital inspiral.

We study their high-energy signatures, focusing on\nthe role of pair-enriched bubbles produced by young magnetars, rapidly-rotating\nneutron stars, and magnetized white dwarfs. (i) First, we study the nebular\nproperties and the conditions allowing for escape of high-energy gamma-rays and\nradio waves, showing that their escape is possible for nebulae with ages of\n>10-100 yr. In the rapidly-rotating neutron star scenario, we find that radio\nemission from the quasi-steady nebula itself may be bright enough to be\ndetected especially at sub-mm frequencies, which is relevant as a possible\ncounterpart of pulsar-driven SNe and FRBs. (ii) Second, we consider the fate of\nbursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead\nto a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the\nshocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the\nnebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to\nshort-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes.\nPossible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission.\n(iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to\nafterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks. In the magnetar scenario,\nthis burst-in-bubble model leads to the expectation that nearby (<10-100 Mpc)\nhigh-energy gamma-ray flashes may be detected by HAWC and CTA, and the\nsubsequent afterglow emission may be seen by radio telescopes such as VLA.

We find significant dissipative losses (up to about 50% of the\npulsar spindown luminosity), similar to what is found in global PIC simulations\nin which particles are provided only on the stellar surface. We conclude that\nthere might indeed exist two types of pulsars, strongly dissipative ones with\nparticle injection only from the stellar surface, and ideal (weakly\ndissipative) ones with particle injection in the outer magnetosphere and in\nparticular at the Y-point. \n\n"}

Abstract: A supramassive, strongly-magnetized millisecond neutron star (NS) has been\nproposed to be the candidate central engine of at least some short gamma-ray\nbursts (SGRBs), based on the \"internal plateau\" commonly observed in the early\nX-ray afterglow. While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated. In\nthis paper, we study four recently-constructed \"unified\" NS EoSs, as well as\nthree developed strange quark star (QS) EoSs within the new confinement\ndensity-dependent mass model. All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent\nobservational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely\nmeasured. We construct sequences of rigidly rotating NS/QS configurations with\nincreasing spinning frequency $f$, from non-rotating ($f = 0$) to the Keplerian\nfrequency ($f = f_{\\rm K}$), and provide convenient analytical parametrizations\nof the results. Assuming that the cosmological NS-NS merger systems have the\nsame mass distribution as the Galactic NS-NS systems, we demonstrate that all\nexcept the BCPM NS EoS can reproduce the current $22\\%$ supramassive NS/QS\nfraction constraint as derived from the SGRB data.

In this work, we explore an alternative evolutionary route\ntoward UCXBs where the companions evolve from intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars\nwith an anomalously strong magnetic field ($100 - 10000$\\,G). Including the\nmagnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an\nirradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accreting component,\nwe show that intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) can evolve into UCXBs.\nUsing the \\emph{MESA} code, we have calculated evolutionary sequences for a\nlarge number of IMXBs. The simulated results indicate that, for a small\nwind-driving efficiency $f=10^{-5}$, the anomalous magnetic braking can drive\nIMXBs to an ultra-short period of 11 min. Comparing our simulated results with\nthe observed parameters of fifteen identified UCXBs, the anomalous magnetic\nbraking evolutionary channel can account for the formation of seven and eight\nsources with $f=10^{-3}$, and $10^{-5}$, respectively. In particular, a\nrelatively large value of $f$ can fit three of the long-period, persistent\nsources with high mass-transfer rate. Though the proportion of Ap/Bp stars in\nintermediate-mass stars is only 5\\%, the lifetime of the UCXB phase is\n$\\gtrsim$ 2 Gyr, producing a relatively high number of observable systems,\nmaking this an alternative evolutionary channel for the formation of UCXBs. \n\n"}

Our main\nfocus rests on exploring the effects of the interaction between ejecta and\ncircumstellar material on the ejecta evolution and the broad-band light curve.\nIn our calculations, we find that a strong reverse shock efficiently\ndecelerates and compresses the ejecta material. This leads to a significant\nbroadening of the optical light curve, a longer rise to maximum and a slower\ndecline in the tail phase. During the interaction, substantial radiative energy\nis generated, which mostly emerges in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime.\nOnly if reprocessing due to radiation-matter interactions is very efficient, a\nsignificant boost in the optical light curve is observed.

Some authors even\nclaim that a single source is responsible for the observed anomalies. But how\nprobable these explanations are? To answer that question, our current\ndescription of cosmic ray Galactic propagation needs to be replaced by the\nMyriad model. In the former approach, sources of protons and helium nuclei are\ntreated as a jelly continuously spread over space and time. A more accurate\ndescription is provided by the Myriad model where sources are considered as\npoint-like events. This leads to a probabilistic derivation of the fluxes of\nprimary species, and opens the possibility that larger-than-average values may\nbe observed at the Earth.

It confirms that pure secondary predictions fall\nbelow the data above 10 GeV, suggesting the presence of a primary component,\ne.g. annihilations of WIMPs dark matter. Most analyses have focused on the\nhigh-energy part of the spectrum, disregarding the GeV energy region where\ncosmic ray transport is harder to model and solar modulation comes into play.\nGiven the high quality of AMS measurements, it is timely to re-examine the\npositron anomaly over the entire energy range, taking into account transport\nprocesses so far neglected, e.g. convection or diffusive re-acceleration. We\ndevise a new semi-analytical method to take into account transport processes so\nfar neglected, but important below a few GeV. It is based on the pinching of\ninverse Compton and synchrotron energy losses inside the Galactic disc. It\nallows to carry out extensive scans over the cosmic ray propagation parameters,\nwhich we strongly constrain by requiring that the secondary component does not\novershoot the AMS measurements. Only models with large diffusion coefficients\nsurvive this test. The positron flux is a powerful and independent probe of\ncosmic ray propagation, complementary to the boron-to-carbon ratio. We then\nscan over WIMP mass to fit the annihilation cross section and branching ratios,\nexploring both direct annihilations into standard model particles or through\nlight mediators. In the former case, the best fit yields a $p$-value of 0.4%\nfor a mass of 264 GeV, a value that does not allow to reproduce the highest\nenergy data points. Worse quality fits are found in the latter case. The\ninterpretation of the positron excess in terms of single DM species\nannihilations is strongly disfavored.

Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies.

Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart.

Abstract: Long-duration, spectrally-soft Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with\nType Ic Core Collapse (CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of\nmassive stars. In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine\nmust bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most\nof these jets do not break out, and are instead \"choked\" inside the star, as\nthe central-engine activity time, $t_{\\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling\nthe long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for\ntheir central-engine activity times, $\\propto t_{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha}$ for $t_{\\rm\ne}>t_{\\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\\alpha\\sim4$) and a typical GRB\njet breakout time of $t_{\\rm b}\\sim 60\\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The\nlatter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding\nthe progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity\nGRBs.

Among them, the effects of foreground stars particularly attract\nattention because the contamination is unavoidable even for the future\nkinematical survey. In this article, we assess the effects of the foreground\ncontamination on the astrophysical $J$-factor estimation by generating mock\nsamples of stars in the four ultra-faint dSphs and using a model of future\nspectrographs. We investigate various data cuts to optimize the quality of the\ndata and apply a likelihood analysis which takes member and foreground stellar\ndistributions into account. We show that the foreground star contaminations in\nthe signal region (the region of interest) and their statistical uncertainty\ncan be estimated by interpolating the foreground star distribution in the\ncontrol region where the foreground stars dominate the member stars. Such\nregions can be secured at future spectroscopic observations utilizing a\nmultiple object spectrograph with a large field of view; e.g. the Prime Focus\nSpectrograph mounted on Subaru Telescope. The above estimation has several\nadvantages: The data-driven estimation of the contamination makes the analysis\nof the astrophysical factor stable against the complicated foreground\ndistribution.

Stable clocks\nare synonymous with precise measurements, which is why pulsars play a role of\nparamount importance in testing fundamental physics. As a pulsar rotates, the\nradio beam emitted along its magnetic axis appears to us as pulses because of\nthe lighthouse effect. Thanks to the extreme regularity of the emitted pulses,\nminuscule disturbances leave particular fingerprints in the times-of-arrival\n(TOAs) measured on Earth with the technique of pulsar timing. Tiny deviations\nfrom the expected TOAs, predicted according to a theoretical timing model based\non known physics, can therefore reveal a plethora of interesting new physical\neffects. Pulsar timing can be used to measure the dynamics of pulsars in\ncompact binaries, thus probing the post-Newtonian expansion of general\nrelativity beyond the weak field regime, while offering unique possibilities of\nconstraining alternative theories of gravity. Additionally, the correlation of\nTOAs from an ensemble of millisecond pulsars can be exploited to detect\nlow-frequency gravitational waves of astrophysical and cosmological origins.

The gamma-ray spectrum shows a characteristic peak\nstructure around the LKP mass. This paper investigates the observability of\nthis peak structure by near-future detectors taking account of their energy\nresolution, and calculates the expected energy spectrum of the gamma-ray\nsignal.

The resulting upper limit\non the boost factor is in the range from 1 to 30. The constraints can be\nregarded as comparable with the results of previous work for gamma-ray and\nelectron-positron observation. However, the observational data for the TeV or\nhigher energy region are still limited, and the possible LKP signal is not\nconclusive.

Barycentering time delays Abstract: The frequencies and phases of emission from extra-solar sources measured by\nEarth-bound observers are modulated by the motions of the observer with respect\nto the source, and through relativistic effects. These modulations depend\ncritically on the source's sky-location. Precise knowledge of the modulations\nare required to coherently track the source's phase over long observations, for\nexample, in pulsar timing, or searches for continuous gravitational waves. The\nmodulations can be modelled as sky-location and time-dependent time delays that\nconvert arrival times at the observer to the inertial frame of the source,\nwhich can often be the Solar system barycentre. We study the use of reduced\norder modelling for speeding up the calculation of this time delay for any\nsky-location. We find that the time delay model can be decomposed into just\nfour basis vectors, and with these the delay for any sky-location can be\nreconstructed to sub-nanosecond accuracy.

If a warp in a disc is too large, the\ndisc can `break' apart into two or more distinct planes, with only tenuous\nconnections between them. Further if an initially planar disc is subject to a\nstrong differential precession, then it can be torn apart into discrete annuli\nthat precess effectively independently. In previous investigations,\ntorque-balance formulae have been used to predict where and when the disc\nbreaks into distinct parts. In this work, focusing on discs with Keplerian\nrotation and where the shearing motions driving the radial communication of the\nwarp are damped locally by turbulence (the `diffusive' regime), we investigate\nthe stability of warped discs to determine the precise criterion for an\nisolated warped disc to break.

Observationally,\nsome SNe Ia show such signal, while the others do not. Here, we propose a\nuniversal model to explain these observations based on the spin-up/spin-down\nmodel, in which a white dwarf (WD) will experience a spin-down phase before\nsupernova explosion, and the spin-down timescale is determined by its initial\nmass, i.e. the more massive the initial WD, the shorter the spin-down timescale\nand then the more likely the SN Ia to show the SD signature.

It is usually believed that ablazar\nis produced by a relativistic jet launched from an accreting supermassive black\nhole (SMBH).Here we show that the high-energy neutrino event can be interpreted\nby the inelastic hadronuclearinteractions between the accelerated cosmic-ray\nprotons in the relativistic jet and the dense gasclouds in the vicinity of the\nSMBH. Such a scenario only requires a moderate proton power in thejet, which\ncould be much smaller than that required in the conventional hadronic model\nwhichinstead calls upon the photomeson process. Meanwhile, the flux of the\nmultiwavelength flare fromthe optical to gamma-ray band can be well explained\nby invoking a second radiation zone in thejet at a larger distance to the SMBH.\nIn our model, the neutrino emission lasts a shorter time thanthe\nmultiwavelength flare so the neutrino event is not necessarily correlated with\nthe flare but it is probably accompanied by a spectrum hardening above a few\nGeV. \n\n"}

We perform semi-analytical spectral fitting of the multi-wavelength\nemission to obtain estimates of the jet physical parameters, and find that the\nmulti-wavelength emission can be explained by either a proton synchrotron\nscenario or an electron inverse Compton scattering scenario. In the proton\nsynchrotron scenario, a strong magnetic field of $10-100$~G is required,\nimplying that the particle acceleration is likely driven by magnetic energy\ndissipation such as magnetic reconnection events. The inverse Compton scenario\nimplies a magnetic field of $0.1-1$~G. Thus the particle acceleration is likely\ndriven by the kinetic energy dissipation such as shocks. We also discuss the\nneutrino production in the context of single-zone and multi-zone models based\non the above two scenarios. We demonstrate that the variability and optical\npolarization signatures can be used to distinguish the two scenarios due to\ntheir drastically different magnetic field. Specifically, the proton\nsynchrotron scenario may show orphan fast variability in the low-energy\nspectral component on top of the active state, with an optical polarization\ndegree $\\lesssim 10\\%$ throughout the active state.

It is caused by an asymmetry between the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions, which can be maintained at high energies when the\nchirality flipping rate can be neglected, for example in the early Universe.\nThe inclusion of the CME in the Maxwell equations leads to a modified set of\nMHD equations. We discuss how the CME is implemented in the PENCIL CODE. The\nCME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since it results in a\ndynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation.\nThis term is formally similar to the $\\alpha$ effect in classical mean-field\nMHD. However, the chiral dynamo can operate without turbulence and is\nassociated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case of the early\nUniverse, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius. A chiral $\\alpha_\\mu$\neffect has also been identified in mean-field theory. It occurs in the presence\nof turbulence but is not related to kinetic helicity. Depending on the plasma\nparameters, chiral dynamo instabilities can amplify magnetic fields over many\norders of magnitude. These instabilities can affect the propagation of MHD\nwaves, which is demonstrated by our DNS. We also study the coupling between the\nevolution of the chiral chemical potential and the ordinary chemical potential,\nwhich is proportional to the sum of the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions. An important consequence of this coupling is the\nemergence of chiral magnetic waves (CMWs). We confirm numerically that linear\nCMWs and MHD waves are not interacting. Our simulations suggest that the\nchemical potential has only a minor effect on the non-linear evolution of the\nchiral dynamo. \n\n"}

Proxies exist to evaluate the\nefficiency of mass and angular momentum accretion but they depend so\ndramatically on the wind speed that given the current uncertainties, they only\nset loose constrains. Furthermore, they often bypass the impact of orbital and\nshock effects on the flow structure. We study the wind dynamics and the angular\nmomentum gained as the flow is accreted. We identify the conditions for the\nformation of a disc-like structure around the accretor and the observational\nconsequences for SgXB. We use recent results on the wind launching mechanism to\ncompute 3D streamlines, accounting for the gravitational and X-ray ionizing\ninfluence of the compact companion on the wind. Once the flow enters the Roche\nlobe of the accretor, we solve the hydrodynamics equations with cooling. A\nshocked region forms around the accretor as the flow is beamed. For wind speeds\nof the order of the orbital speed, the shock is highly asymmetric compared to\nthe axisymmetric bow shock obtained for a purely planar homogeneous flow. With\nnet radiative cooling, the flow always circularizes for wind speeds low enough.\nAlthough the donor star does not fill its Roche lobe, the wind can be\nsignificantly beamed and bent by the orbital effects. The net angular momentum\nof the accreted flow is then sufficient to form a persistent disc-like\nstructure. This mechanism could explain the proposed limited outer extension of\nthe accretion disc in Cygnus X-1 and suggests the presence of a disc at the\nouter rim of the neutron star magnetosphere in Vela X-1, with dramatic\nconsequences on the spinning up of the accretor. \n\n"}

As\na corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalisation, we consider the\nSuper-Kamiokande (SK) limit on the electron antineutrino flux from past\ncore-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z<~1. We find consistency\nwith the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from SN events are relatively\nmodest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become\napparent.

The effect\nis in many respects similar to the electron paramagnetic resonance. The\nconditions for existence of this new resonance effect are discussed. They\ninclude specific constraints on the neutrino oscillation lengths in the Earth\nmantle and in the Earth core, thus the resonance is a ``neutrino oscillation\nlength resonance''. The effect exhibits strong dependence on the neutrino\nenergy. Analytic expression for the probability accounting for the solar\nneutrino transitions in the Earth, which provides a high precision description\nof the transitions, including the new resonance effect, is derived. The\nimplications of our results for the searches of the day-night asymmetry in the\nsolar neutrino experiments are briefly discussed.
