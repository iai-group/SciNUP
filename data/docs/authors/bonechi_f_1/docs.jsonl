This merges Donaldson's picture\nof special Lagrangian submanifolds and the Polchinski-Grothendieck Ansatz for\nD-branes on a Calabi-Yau space. Basic phenomena of D-branes such as\nHiggsing/un-Higgsing and large- vs. small-brane wrapping can be realized via\ndeformations of such morphisms.

Earlier it was shown that the quasi-energy spectra of\nthese two dynamical models (i) can exactly overlap with each other if an\neffective Planck constant takes irrational multiples of 2*pi and (ii) will be\ndifferent if the same parameter takes rational multiples of 2*pi. This work\nmakes some detailed comparisons between these two models, with an effective\nPlanck constant given by 2*pi M/N, where M and N are coprime and odd integers.\nIt is found that the ORDKR spectrum (with two periodic kicking sequences having\nthe same kick strength) has one flat band and $N-1$ non-flat bands whose\nlargest width decays in power law as K to the power of N+2, where K is a\nkicking strength parameter. The existence of a flat band is strictly proven and\nthe power law scaling, numerically checked for a number of cases, is also\nanalytically proven for a three-band case. By contrast, the KHM does not have\nany flat band and its band width scales linearly with K. This is shown to\nresult in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior, such as transient (but\nextremely long) dynamical localization in ORDKR, which is absent in KHM.\nFinally, we show that despite these differences, there exist simple extensions\nof KHM and ORDKR (upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter) such\nthat the resulting extended KHM and ORDKR are actually topologically\nequivalent, i.e., they yield exactly the same Floquet-band Chern numbers and\ndisplay topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths. A theoretical\nderivation of this topological equivalence is provided. \n\n"}

Inspired by chemical reaction networks,\nI demonstrate the utility of expressing the governing equations of arbitrary\nfirst-order dynamical systems (interaction networks) in terms of sums of real\nfunctions (generalized reactions) multiplied by real scalars (generalized\nstoichiometries). Specifically, I examine the mathematical notion of influence\ntopology, which is based on the reaction stoichiometries and the first\nderivatives of the reactions with respect to each species at the steady state\nsolution(s). It is naturally represented as a signed directed bipartite graph\nwith arrows or blunt arrows connecting a species node to a reaction node\n(positive/negative derivative) or a reaction node to a species node\n(positive/negative stoichiometry). The set of all such graphs is denumerable. A\nsignificant reduction in dimensionality is possible through stoichiometric\nscaling, cycle compaction, and temporal scaling. All cycles in a network can be\nread directly from the graph of its influence topology, enabling efficient and\nintuitive computation of the principal minors (sums of products of\nnon-overlapping bipartite cycles) and the Hurwitz determinants (sums of\nproducts of either the principal minors or the bipartite cycles) for testing\nsteady state stability. The stability of a given network is shown to have a\nhierarchical dependence first on its influence topology and then, more\nspecifically, on algebraic conditions (exact functional form of the reactions).\nThe utility of this hierarchical approach to bifurcation analysis is\ndemonstrated on classical networks from control theory, biology, chemistry,\nphysics, and electronics. \n\n"}

The main result states that the\nlift of a Hopf polyad is a strong (co)monoidal action-type polyad (or strong\nmonoidal pseudofunctor). The lift of a polyad is a new polyad having simpler\nstructure but the same category of modules. We show that, under certain\nassumptions, a Hopf polyad can be `wrapped up' into a Hopf monad.

Starting from physical\nconsiderations, we derive an axiomatic definition of Hopf-algebra gauge theory,\nincluding locality conditions under which the theory for a general ribbon graph\ncan be assembled from local data in the neighbourhood of each vertex. For a\nvertex neighbourhood with n incoming edge ends, the algebra of non-commutative\n\"functions\" of connections is dual to a two-sided twist deformation of the\nn-fold tensor power of the gauge Hopf algebra.

Our approach does not\nrequire the Lagrangian to be fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, but can\nuse such an involution, if present, to obtain stronger results. Also,\nnon-trivial invariants are defined for broader classes of interior constraints\nand Lagrangian submanifolds than previously possible even in the presence of an\nanti-symplectic involution. The invariants of the present work specialize to\ninvariants of Welschinger, Fukaya, and Georgieva in many instances.\n  The main obstacle to defining open Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary\nconstraints in arbitrary dimension is the bubbling of $J$-holomorphic disks.\nUnlike in low dimensions or for interior constraints, disk bubbles do not\ncancel in pairs by anti-symplectic involution symmetry. Rather, we use the\ntechnique of bounding chains introduced in Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's work on\nLagrangian Floer theory to cancel disk bubbling.

Given the bulk Hamiltonian defined by a gauge group $G$\nand a three-cocycle in the third cohomology group of $G$ over $U(1)$, a\nboundary Hamiltonian can be defined by a subgroup $K$ of $G$ and a two-cochain\nin the second cochain group of $K$ over $U(1)$. The consistency between the\nbulk and boundary Hamiltonians is dictated by what we call the Frobenius\ncondition that constrains the two-cochain given the three-cocyle. We offer a\nclosed-form formula computing the ground state degeneracy of the model on a\ncylinder in terms of the input data only, which can be naturally generalized to\nsurfaces with more boundaries. We also explicitly write down the ground-state\nwavefunction of the model on a disk also in terms of the input data only. \n\n"}

We use the\ndistribution approach and derive a new algebra for quadratic master fields in\nthe low density limit by using the energy representation. We formulate the\nstochastic golden rule in the low density limit case for a system coupling with\nBose field via quadratic interaction. In particular the vacuum expectation\nvalue of the evolution operator is computed and its exponential decay is shown. \n\n"}

This may be inferred from exact results\nestablished within symplectic cutting. \n\n"}
