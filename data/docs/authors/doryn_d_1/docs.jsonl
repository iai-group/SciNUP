In\nthe case of the nilpotent orbit $\\{ M^2=0 \\}$, the orbital varieties can be\nindexed by noncrossing chord diagrams in the disc. In this paper we study the\nnormal cone to the orbital scheme inside this nilpotent orbit $\\{ M^2 = 0 \\}$.\nThis gives a better-motivated construction of the Brauer loop scheme we\nintroduced in [KZJ07], whose components are indexed by all chord diagrams (now\npossibly with crossings) in the disc. The multidegrees of its components, the\nBrauer loop varieties, were shown to reproduce the ground state of the Brauer\nloop model in statistical mechanics [DFZJ06]. Here, we reformulate and slightly\ngeneralize these multidegrees in order to express them as solutions of the\nrational quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation associated to the Brauer\nalgebra.

The link is established via weighted projective lines and (stable)\ncategories of vector bundles on those. The setup yields a new approach to\nattack the subspace problem. In particular, we deduce the main results of\nRingel and Schmidmeier for nilpotency degree p from properties of the category\nof vector bundles on the weighted projective line of weight type (2,3,p),\nobtained by Serre construction from the triangle singularity x^2+y^3+z^p.

This conjecture has\nrecently been proved by Guralnick-Malle and Fairbairn-Magaard-Parker.\n  In this survey we demonstrate another approach towards the proof of this\nconjecture, based on probabilistic group theoretical methods, by describing the\nfollowing three works. The first is the work of Garion, Larsen and Lubotzky,\nshowing that the above conjecture holds for almost all finite simple groups of\nLie type. The second is the work of Garion and Penegini on Beauville structures\nof alternating groups, based on results of Liebeck and Shalev, and the third is\nthe case of the group PSL(2,p^e), in which we give bounds on the probability of\ngenerating a Beauville structure. We also discuss other related problems\nregarding finite simple quotients of hyperbolic triangle groups and present\nsome open questions and conjectures. \n\n"}

We start with the conjecture of\nHausel-Thaddeus which claims that certain Hodge numbers of moduli spaces of\nflat SL(n,C) and PGL(n,C)-connections on a smooth projective algebraic curve\nagree. We then change our point of view in the non-Abelian Hodge theory of the\ncurve, and concentrate on the SL(n,C) and PGL(n,C) character varieties of the\ncurve. Here we discuss a recent conjecture of Hausel-Rodriguez-Villegas which\nclaims, analogously to the above conjecture, that certain Hodge numbers of\nthese character varieties also agree. We explain that for Hodge numbers of\ncharacter varieties one can use arithmetic methods, and thus we end up\nexplicitly calculating, in terms of Verlinde-type formulas, the number of\nrepresentations of the fundamental group into the finite groups SL(n,F_q) and\nPGL(n,F_q), by using the character tables of these finite groups of Lie type.\nFinally we explain a conjecture which enhances the previous result, and gives a\nsimple formula for the mixed Hodge polynomials, and in particular for the\nPoincare polynomials of these character varieties, and detail the relationship\nto results of Hitchin, Gothen, Garsia-Haiman and Earl-Kirwan.
