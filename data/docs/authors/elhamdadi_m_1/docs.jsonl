The purpose of this\narticle is to shed more light on these interactions. We prove that if X and X'\nare cobordant closed smooth 4-manifolds with the same euler characteristics,\nand if one of them is simply-connected, then there is a cobordism between them\nwhich is composed of round 2-handles only, and therefore one can pass from one\nto the other via a sequence of generalized logarithmic transforms along tori.\nAs a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a theorem of Iwase's, which is a\n4-dimensional analogue of the Lickorish-Wallace theorem for 3-manifolds: Every\nclosed simply-connected 4-manifold can be produced by a surgery along a\ndisjoint union of tori contained in a connected sum of copies of CP^2, -CP^2\nand S^1 x S^3. These answer some of the open problems posted by Ron Stern,\nwhile suggesting more constraints on the cobordisms in consideration.

In particular, we show\nthat simple cobordisms exist between knot surgered manifolds. We then show that\ngeneralized logarithmic transforms can be seen as standard logarithmic\ntransforms along fiber components of broken Lefschetz fibrations, and show how\nchanging the smooth structures on a fixed homeomorphism class of a closed\nsmooth 4-manifold can be realized as relevant modifications of a broken\nLefschetz fibration on it. \n\n"}

Our goal is to facilitate\nprogress on Rasmussen's conjecture that a spectral sequence relates the two\nknot homologies. We replace the language of twisted coefficients with the more\nquantum topological language of framings on trivalent graphs. We define a\nhomology theory for framed trivalent graphs with boundary that -- for a\nparticular non-blackboard framing -- specializes to the homology of singular\nknots underlying the knot Floer cube of resolutions. For blackboard framed\ngraphs, our theory conjecturally recovers the graph homology underlying the\nHOMFLY-PT chain complex.

For generic values of the\ndefining parameters of the BMW algebra, this cover is isomorphic to the BMW\nalgebra itself, and this fact provides a shorter defining relation for it, in\nthe generic case. For a certain 1-dimensional family of special values however,\nit is a non-trivial central extension of the BMW-algebra which induces a\ncentral extension of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. Inside this 1-dimensional\nfamily, exactly two values provide possibly additional Q-valued Markov traces.\nWe describe both of these potential traces on the (extended) Temperley-Lieb\nsubalgebra.

The present article contributes to\nthe non-semisimple case, which is much more complicated.

Many of the algebraic results are proved by topological methods,\nvia consideration of the space of orderings.

All knot groups, and more generally groups of 3-manifolds with\npositive first Betti number are left-orderable, in fact locally indicable and\nsometimes even bi-orderable. However when the first homology is finite the\nsituation is more subtle, and we find connections with foliations, branched\ncoverings, surgery, and conjecturally Heegaard-Floer homology.\n  Braid groups are considered in some detail, including Dehornoy's ordering of\nthe braid groups and its later generalizations due to Thurston.

A consequence is that any quasi-action of a higher\nrank lattice on a tree is elliptic, i.e. it has Manning's property (QFA).\nMoreover, we obtain a new proof of the theorem of Farb-Kaimanovich-Masur that\nany morphism from a higher rank lattice to a mapping class group has finite\nimage, without relying on the Margulis normal subgroup theorem nor on bounded\ncohomology.

On one hand, it is known that oriented 3d TFTs having a topological\nboundary condition admit a state-sum construction known as the Turaev-Viro\nconstruction. This is related to the string-net construction of fermionic\nphases of matter. We show how Turaev-Viro construction can be generalized to\nunoriented 3d TFTs. On the other hand, it is known that the \"fermionic\"\nversions of oriented TFTs, known as Spin-TFTs, can be constructed in terms of\n\"shadow\" TFTs which are ordinary oriented TFTs with an anomalous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n1-form symmetry. We generalize this correspondence to Pin$^+$-TFTs by showing\nthat they can be constructed in terms of ordinary unoriented TFTs with\nanomalous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry having a mixed anomaly with\ntime-reversal symmetry. The corresponding Pin$^+$-TFT does not have any anomaly\nfor time-reversal symmetry however and hence it can be unambiguously defined on\na non-orientable manifold.

An important problem in knot theory is to study the\nminimal ratio of length to width of a flat knotted ribbon. This minimal ratio\nis called the ribbonlength of the knot.
