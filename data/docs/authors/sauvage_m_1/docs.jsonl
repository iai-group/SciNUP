We develop a formalism that provides the excitation rates\nof non-radial global modes excited by turbulent convection. As a first\napplication, we estimate the impact of non-radial effects on excitation rates\nand amplitudes of high-angular-degree modes which are observed on the Sun. A\nmodel of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed to\ncompute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solar\nradial modes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2006b). We generalize this\napproach to the case of non-radial global modes. This enables us to estimate\nthe energy supplied to high-($\\ell$) acoustic modes. Qualitative arguments as\nwell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results. We find that\nnon-radial effects for $p$ modes are non-negligible:\n  - for high-$n$ modes (i.e. typically $n > 3$) and for high values of $\\ell$;\nthe power supplied to the oscillations depends on the mode inertia.\n  - for low-$n$ modes, independent of the value of $\\ell$, the excitation is\ndominated by the non-diagonal components of the Reynolds stress term.

Hence we require a mechanism for the spontaneous breaking of conformal\ninvariance. In this paper we study the possibility that conformal invariance is\nspontaneously broken due to interactions with conformally coupled matter\nfields. The vacuum of the theory admits conformally non-invariant solutions\ncorresponding to maximally symmetric space-times and variants thereof. These\nare either de Sitter space-time or anti-de Sitter space-time in the full four\nspace-time dimensions or in a lower dimensional sub-space.

The final spatial distribution of the old\nstars projected onto the sky is spherical even after the strong LMC-SMC-Galaxy\ninteraction, whereas that of the new ones is significantly flattened and\nappears to form a bar structure. Old stars have the line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion (sigma) of ~ 30 km/s and slow rotation with the maximum rotational\nvelocity (V) of less than slow rotation with the maximum rotational velocity\n(V) of less than 20 km/s and show asymmetry in the radial profiles.

Although this is commonly attributed to\nviolent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with\nsuch events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by\nspheroids (Genzel et al. 2006, 2008). Cosmological simulations and clustering\ntheory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we\nreport that they are stream-fed galaxies, formed from steady, narrow, cold gas\nstreams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes\n(Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Keres et al. 2005). A comparison with the observed\nabundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must\nrapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading\nto mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows.\nWith a merger duy cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at\na given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that\nform stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike\ndestructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk\nconfiguration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming\nclumps that merge into a central spheroid (Noguchi 1999; Genzel et al. 2008,\nElmegreen, Bournaud & Elmegreen 2008, Dekel, Sari & Ceverino 2009).

Abstract: Three planets with minimum masses less than 10 Earth masses orbit the star HD\n40307, suggesting these planets may be rocky. However, with only radial\nvelocity data, it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky or\ngaseous. Here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order to\nassess the physical properties of the planets. Observations allow for circular\norbits, but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be at\nleast 0.0001. Also, planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effects\nare significant. If planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrial\nplanets in the Solar System and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0.001, then,\ngoing back in time, the system would have been unstable within the lifetime of\nthe star (which we estimate to be 6.1 +/- 1.6 Gyr). Moreover, if the\neccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky, then its tidal\nheating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic Io, on a\nper unit surface area basis. If planet b is not terrestrial, e.g. Neptune-like,\nthese physical constraints would not apply. This analysis suggests the planets\nare not terrestrial-like, and are more like our giant planets.

Massive stars in\nnewly formed or primordial globular clusters could have played an important\nrole during the epoch of cosmological reionisation (z>~6) as sources of\nenergetic, neutral hydrogen ionising UV photons. We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray\nbackground at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate\nthe total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast\nthis with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main\nsequence lives. For reasonable estimates, we find that the bolometric\nluminosity of the cluster peaks at ~10^42 erg/s during the first few million\nyears, but declines to ~10^41 erg/s after ~5 million years as the most massive\nstars evolve off the main sequence. From this time onwards, the total\nbolometric luminosity is dominated by HMXBs and falls gradually to ~10^40 erg/s\nafter ~50 million years. Assuming a power-law spectral energy distribution for\nthe HMXBs, we calculate the effective number of neutral hydrogen ionisations\nper HMXB and show that HMXBs can be as important as sources of ionising\nradiation as massive stars. Finally we discuss the implications of our results\nfor modelling galaxy formation at high redshift and the prospects of using\nglobular clusters as probes of reionisation. \n\n"}

Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms.\nThe Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16 +/- 3 degrees, which favors four\nrather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances,\nproper motions, and radial velocities yields complete 3-dimensional kinematic\ninformation.

By fitting the\nmeasurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic\ncenter R_o = 8.4 +/- 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Theta_o = 254 +/- 16\nkm/s. The ratio Theta_o/R_o can be determined to higher accuracy than either\nparameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 +/- 0.9 km/s/kpc, in good\nagreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of\nSgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or\nslightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally\ntoo large, sometimes by factors greater than two; they can be brought into\nbetter agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Theta_o/R_o\nfrom the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km/s/kpc to a value near 30 km/s/kpc.

Simple arguments show that the location of the\nlength-scale r_c, marking the transition from positive to negative\ncorrelations, is the same for any class of objects as for the full matter\ndistribution, i.e. it is invariant under biasing.

The resultant escape fractions\nare 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results\nare well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at\n1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape\nfractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and LBGs, we find that high-z\nLAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z=3-5. However, ionizing radiation from\nLAEs as well as LBGs falls short to ionize the IGM at z>6. That implies that\nadditional ionization sources may required at z>6. \n\n"}

Although the dust in disks is\nrelatively easily detected as a far-IR photometric ``excess'' over the expected\nphotospheric emission, much less is known about the gas phase. It seems clear\nthat an abrupt transition from massive optically thick disks (gas-rich\nstructures where only ~1% of the total mass is in the form of dust) to tenuous\ndebris disks almost devoid of gas occurs at ~10^7 years, by which time the\nmajority of at least the giant planets must have formed. Indeed, these planets\nare largely gaseous and thus they must assemble before the gas disk dissipates.\nSpectroscopic studies of the disk gas content at different evolutive stages are\nthus critical. Far-IR water vapor lines and atomic fine structure lines from\nabundant gas reservoirs (e.g., [OI]63um, [SI]56um, [SiII]34um) are robust\ntracers of the gas in disks. Spectrometers on board Herschel will detect some\nof these lines toward the closest, youngest and more massive protoplanetary\ndisks.

Both are unique goals for\nSPICA/SAFARI. Besides, SAFARI will be able to detect the far-IR modes of water\nice at ~44 and ~62um, and thus allow water ice to be observed in many\nprotoplanetary systems and fully explore its impact on planetary formation and\nevolution. \n\n"}

We\nsystematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical\nprocesses are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically,\nwe find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high\nredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as\nit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas\nexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher\nredshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and\nto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height\nof the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the\npresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole\nfeedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both\nboost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated\nfashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback\nfrom massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and\naccretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF\nlaw. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency\nis changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same\nrate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting\nblack holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate\nbelow redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the\nform of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help. \n\n"}

Alternatively,\nif we impose a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation in order to explain the\nunexpectedly high densities of the ultrafaint dwarfs, then we expect only a\nhandful of stealth galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way. A complete census of\nthese objects will require deeper sky surveys, 30m-class follow-up telescopes,\nand more refined methods to identify extended, self-bound groupings of stars in\nthe halo. \n\n"}

Our sample of\ngroups and clusters includes AGN feedback and is of high enough resolution to\naccurately resolve galaxy populations down to the smallest galaxies that are\nexpected to significantly contribute to the stellar mass budget. We describe\nand test four different methods to identify the ICL in simulations, thereby\nallowing us to assess the reliability of the measurements. For all of the\nmethods, we consistently find a very significant ICL stellar fraction (~45%)\nwhich exceeds the values typically inferred from observations. However, we show\nthat this result is robust with respect to numerical resolution and integration\naccuracy, remarkably insensitive to changes in the star formation model, and\nalmost independent of halo mass. It is also almost invariant when black hole\ngrowth is included, even though AGN feedback successfully prevents excessive\novercooling in clusters and leads to a drastically improved agreement of the\nsimulated cluster galaxy population with observations. In particular, the\nluminosities of central galaxies and the ages of their stellar populations are\nmuch more realistic when including AGN. In the light of these findings, it\nappears challenging to construct a simulation model that simultaneously matches\nthe cluster galaxy population and at the same time produces a low ICL\ncomponent. We find that intracluster stars are preferentially stripped in a\ncluster's densest region from massive galaxies that fall into the cluster at\nz>1.

Using models for the evolution of\nthe luminosity function at z<1.2 which are constrained by observations at 24\nmicron and 70 micron, and which are consistent with the results from the\nstacking analysis, we find that galaxies at z<1.2, account for ~95-55% of the\nextragalactic far-infrared background in the ~70-500 micron range respectively.\nThis places strong upper limits on the fraction of dust obscured star-formation\nat z>1, which are remarkably, below the values derived from the extinction\ncorrected ultraviolet luminosities of galaxies.

In that\nexpansion, for each multipole $l$ there is a discrete tower of momenta\n$k_{i,l}$ (not a continuum) which can affect physical observables, with the\nsmallest momenta being $k_{1,l} ~ l$. The Fourier-Bessel modes take into\naccount precisely the information from the sources of anisotropies that\npropagates from the initial value surface to the point of observation - no\nmore, no less. We also show that the physical observables (the temperature and\npolarization maps), and hence the angular power spectra, are unaffected by that\nchoice of basis. This implies that the Fourier-Bessel expansion is the optimal\nscheme with which one can compute CMB anisotropies. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Despite its importance, however, dust remains poorly\nunderstood in terms of its origin, composition, and abundance throughout the\nuniverse. Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide a laboratory for studying the\nevolution of dust grains, as they are one of the only environments in the\nuniverse where it is possible to observe grains being both created and\ndestroyed. SNRs exhibit collisionally heated dust, allowing dust to serve as a\ndiagnostic both for grain physics and for the plasma conditions in the SNR. I\npresent theoretical models of collisionally heated dust which calculate grain\nemission as well as destruction rates. In these models, I incorporate physics\nsuch as nonthermal sputtering caused by grain motions through the gas, a more\nrealistic approach to sputtering for small grains, and arbitrary grain\ncompositions porous and composite grains. I apply these models to infrared and\nX-ray observations of Kepler's supernova and the Cygnus Loop in the galaxy, and\nSNRs 0509-67.5, 0519-69.0, and 0540-69.3 in the LMC.

Such a multi-wavelength approach is crucial for a\ncomplete understanding of gas and dust interaction and evolution. Modeling of\nboth X-ray and IR spectra allows disentangling of parameters such as pre and\npostshock gas density, as well as swept-up masses of gas and dust, and can\nprovide constraints on the shock compression ratio.

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc.

The\nhigh-resolution imaging and X-ray spectral information from our Chandra\nobservations allow us to measure separately X-ray contributions from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) and normal galaxy processes (e.g., X-ray binaries and\nhot gas). We utilized total infrared plus UV luminosities to estimate\nstar-formation rates (SFRs) and K-band luminosities and optical colors to\nestimate stellar masses (M*) for the sample. Under the assumption that the\ngalaxy-wide 2-10 keV luminosity (LX) traces the combined emission from high\nmass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), and that the\npower output from these components are linearly correlated with SFR and M*,\nrespectively, we constrain the relation LX = alpha M* + beta SFR. To achieve\nthis, we construct a Chandra-based data set composed of our new LIRG sample\ncombined with additional samples of less actively star-forming normal galaxies\nand more powerful LIRGs and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) from the\nliterature. Using these data, we measure best-fit values of alpha = (9.05 +/-\n0.37) X 10^28 ergs s^-1 Msol^-1 and beta = (1.62 +/- 0.22) X 10^39 ergs s^-1\n(Msol yr^-1)^-1.

The newly obtained data confirmed the\nbasic findings reported in Kato et al.

There was a systematic\ndifference in period derivatives for systems with superhump periods longer than\n0.075 d between this study and Kato et al. (2009). We suggest that this\ndifference is possibly caused by the relative lack of frequently outbursting SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae in this period regime in the present study. We recorded a\nstrong beat phenomenon during the 2009 superoutburst of IY UMa. The close\ncorrelation between the beat period and superhump period suggests that the\nchanging angular velocity of the apsidal motion of the elliptical disk is\nresponsible for the variation of superhump periods. We also described three new\nWZ Sge-type objects with established early superhumps and one with likely early\nsuperhumps.

Charged black holes Abstract: This paper extends to the case of charged rotating black holes the\nconformally stationary, axisymmetric, conformally separable solutions presented\nfor uncharged rotating black holes in a companion paper. In the present paper,\nthe collisionless fluid accreted by the black hole may be charged. The charge\nof the black hole is determined self-consistently by the charge accretion rate.\nAs in the uncharged case, hyper-relativistc counter-streaming between ingoing\nand outgoing streams drives inflation at (just above) the inner horizon,\nfollowed by collapse. If both ingoing and outgoing streams are charged, then\nconformal separability holds during early inflation, but fails as inflation\ndevelops. If conformal separability is imposed throughout inflation and\ncollapse, then only one of the ingoing and outgoing streams can be charged: the\nother must be neutral. Conformal separability prescribes a hierarchy of\nboundary conditions on the ingoing and outgoing streams incident on the inner\nhorizon. The dominant radial boundary conditions require that the incident\ningoing and outgoing number densities be uniform with latitude, but the charge\nper particle must vary with latitude such that the incident charge densities\nvary in proportion to the radial electric field. The sub-dominant angular\nboundary conditions require specific forms of the incident number- and\ncharge-weighted angular motions. If the streams fall freely from outside the\nhorizon, then the prescribed angular conditions can be achieved by the charged\nstream, but not by the neutral stream. Thus, as in the case of an uncharged\nblack hole, the neutral stream must be considered to be delivered ad hoc to\njust above the inner horizon. \n\n"}

Observations and theory support models in\nwhich these cusps are formed by dissipative gas inflows and nuclear starbursts\nin gas-rich mergers. At these comparatively large radii, stellar relaxation is\nunlikely to account for or strongly modify the cuspy stellar profiles. We argue\nthat the power-law surface density profiles observed are a natural consequence\nof the gravitational instabilities that dominate angular momentum transport in\nthe gravitational potential of a central massive black hole. The dominant mode\nat these radii is an m=1 lopsided/eccentric disk instability, in which stars\ntorquing the gas can drive rapid inflow and accretion. Such a mode first\ngenerically appears at large radii and propagates inwards by exciting\neccentricities at smaller and smaller radii, where M*(<R)<<M_BH. When the\nstellar surface density profile is comparatively shallow with n<1/2, the modes\ncannot efficiently propagate to R=0 and so gas piles up and star formation\nsteepens the profile. But if the profile is steeper than n=1, the inwards\npropagation of eccentricity is strongly damped, suppressing inflow and bringing\nn down again. Together these results produce an equilibrium slope of 1/2 < n <\n1 in the potential of the central black hole. These physical arguments are\nsupported by nonlinear numerical simulations of gas inflow in galactic nuclei.\nTogether, these results naturally explain the observed stellar density profiles\nof 'cusp' elliptical galaxies. \n\n"}

The precise photometric redshifts and stellar masses that the NMBS\nproduces allows us to define a series of mass limited samples of galaxies more\nmassive than 0.7, 1 and 3x10^10 Msun in redshift intervals centered on z = 1.1,\n1.5 and 1.9 respectively.

We further interpret our clustering measurements in the LCDM\ncosmological context using the halo model of galaxy clustering. We show that\nthe typical halo mass of central and satellite galaxies increases with stellar\nmass, whereas the satellite fraction decreases with stellar mass, qualitatively\nthe same as is seen at z < 1. We see little evidence of any redshift dependence\nin the stellar mass-to-halo mass relationship over our narrow redshift range.\nHowever, when we compare with similar measurements at z~0, we see clear\nevidence for a change in this relation. If we assume a universal baryon\nfraction, the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass reveals the fraction of\nbaryons that have been converted to stars.

The\nsample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\\mu}m which have reliable\ncounterparts from SDSS at z < 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. Dust masses are\ncalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectral\nenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperature\ncomponents.

At z = 0.4 - 0.5, massive\ngalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local Universe.

We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation\nto investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion\nand to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop\nin the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global\ncold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas\nconsumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode\n(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never\nexceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks\nat z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant\nthereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global\naccretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo\naccretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN\nfeedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered\nhaloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.\nConsequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode\nwould become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in\nthe cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep. \n\n"}

The dominant source of noise in the power spectrum of the tracers is\ncaused by sampling variance on large scales (where the non-Gaussian signal is\nstrongest) and shot noise arising from their discrete nature.

Unlike most traditional\napproaches to the dark-matter problem which hypothesize the existence of one or\nmore stable dark-matter particles, our dynamical dark-matter framework is\ncharacterized by the fact that the requirement of stability is replaced by a\ndelicate balancing between cosmological abundances and lifetimes across a vast\nensemble of individual dark-matter components. This setup therefore\ncollectively produces a time-varying cosmological dark-matter abundance, and\nthe different dark-matter components can interact and decay throughout the\ncurrent epoch. While the goal of our previous paper was to introduce the broad\ntheoretical aspects of this framework, the purpose of the current paper is to\nprovide an explicit model of dynamical dark matter and demonstrate that this\nmodel satisfies all collider, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints. The\nresults of this paper therefore constitute an \"existence proof\" of the\nphenomenological viability of our overall dynamical dark-matter framework, and\ndemonstrate that dynamical dark matter is indeed a viable alternative to the\ntraditional paradigm of dark-matter physics.

In an optical survey of\nbright nearby galaxies, NGC 185 was classified as a Seyfert galaxy based on its\nemission line ratios. However, although the emission lines in this object\nformally place it in the category of Seyferts, it is probable that this galaxy\ndoes not contain a genuine active nucleus. NGC 185 was not detected in radio\nsurveys either in 6 or 20 cm, or X-ray observations, which means that the\nSeyfert-like line ratios may be produced by stellar processes.

We\ndiscussed the possibility of the line emissions being produced by planetary\nnebulae (PNe), using deep spectroscopy observations obtained with GMOS-N, at\nGemini. Although the fluxes of the PNe are high enough to explain the\nintegrated spectrum, the line ratios are very far from the values for the\nSeyfert classification.

While the\nbest-fitting hosts of the dwarf spheroidals all have 12 < Vmax < 25 km/s, LCDM\nsimulations predict at least ten subhalos with Vmax > 25 km/s.

As these clouds\nare optically thick at short wavelength but optically thin at long wavelength,\nit is tricky to conclude anything about dust properties without a proper\ntreatment of the radiative transfer (RT). Our aim is to disentangle the effects\nof RT and of dust properties on the variations in the dust emission to provide\nobservers with keys to analyse the emission arising from dense clouds. We model\ncylindrical clouds, illuminated by the ISRF, and carry out full RT\ncalculations. Dust temperatures are solved using DustEM for amorphous carbons\nand silicates, grains coated with carbon mantles, and mixed aggregates of\ncarbon and silicate. We allow variations of the grain optical properties with\nwavelength and temperature. We determine observed colour temperatures, T, and\nemissivity spectral indices, beta, by fitting the dust emission with modified\nblackbodies, to compare our models with observations. RT effects can neither\nexplain the low T nor the increased submm emissivity measured at the centre of\ndense clouds, nor the observed beta-T anti-correlation. Adding noise to the\nmodelled data, we show that it is not likely to be the unique explanation for\nthe beta-T anti-correlation observed in starless clouds. It may be explained by\nintrinsic variations in the grain optical properties with temperature. As for\nthe increased submm emissivity and the low T, they have to originate in\nvariations in the grain optical properties, probably caused by their growth to\nform porous aggregates. We find it difficult to track back the nature of grains\nfrom the spectral variations in their emission. Finally, the column density is\nunderestimated when determined with blackbody fitting because of the\ndiscrepancy between T and the true dust temperature at the cloud centre. \n\n"}

In our largest simulations, the Maxwell stress shows a significant\nlarge scale non-local component, while the density develops long-lived\naxisymmetric perturbations (zonal flows) at the 20% level.

The observed\nblack hole-to-bulge mass ratios of NGC4342 and NGC4291 are ~6.9% and ~1.9%,\nrespectively, which significantly exceed the typical observed ratio of ~0.2%.\nAs a consequence of the exceedingly large black hole-to-bulge mass ratios,\nNGC4342 and NGC4291 are ~5.1 sigma and ~3.4 sigma outliers from the M_BH -\nM_bulge scaling relation, respectively.

Based on Chandra X-ray\nobservations of the hot gas content of NGC4342 and NGC4291, we compute\ngravitating mass profiles, and conclude that both galaxies reside in massive\ndark matter halos, which extend well beyond the stellar light.

Due to the absence of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, however,\ndetailed investigations, specifically a determination of the gas-phase\nmetallicity of gamma-ray burst hosts, was largely limited to redshifts z < 1 to\ndate.

Specifically, we use\ndifferent strong-line diagnostics based on [N II] to robustly measure the\ngas-phase metallicity for the first time for a GRB host at this redshift. The\nhost of the energetic (E_iso ~ 2 x 10^53 erg) GRB 080605 is a morphologically\ncomplex, vigorously star-forming galaxy with an H\\alpha-derived SFR of 31\nM_sun/yr.

The reason is that stellar winds have\nbeen found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical\nmass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss\nrates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to\nnon-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates\nare of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even\nfurther, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes\nnecessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans\nbetween O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model\nindependent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition\npoint in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far\nless model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is\nsubsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the\nOf/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two\nalternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided\nby current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the\n~50Msun mass range.

We compare all six theories with MHD\nsimulations, covering cloud masses of 300 to 4x10^6 solar masses and Mach\nnumbers M = 3 to 50 and M_A = 1 to infinity, with solenoidal (b=1/3), mixed\n(b=0.4) and compressive turbulent (b=1) forcings. We find that the SFR\nincreases by a factor of four between M=5 and 50 for compressive forcing and\nalpha_vir~1. Comparing forcing parameters, we see that the SFR is more than 10x\nhigher with compressive than solenoidal forcing for Mach 10 simulations. The\nSFR and fragmentation are both reduced by a factor of two in strongly\nmagnetized, trans-Alfvenic turbulence compared to hydrodynamic turbulence.

However, the\norigin of these LABs is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate a\nmerger model for the formation of LABs by studying Lya emission from\ninteracting galaxies at high redshifts by means of a combination of\nhydrodynamics simulations with three dimensional radiative transfer\ncalculations. Our galaxy simulations focus on a set of binary major mergers of\ngalaxies with a mass range of 3-7 *10^12 Msun in the redshift range of z ~ 3\n-7, and we use the newly improved ART^2 code to perform the radiative transfer\ncalculations which couple multi-wavelength continuum, ionization of hydrogen,\nand Lya line emission. We find that intense star formation and enhanced cooling\ninduced by gravitational interaction produce strong Lya emission from these\nmerging galaxies. The Lya emission appears to be extended due to the extended\ndistribution of sources and gas. During the close encounter of galaxy\nprogenitors when the star formation rate peaks at ~ 10^3 Msun/yr, our model\nproduces Lya blobs with luminosity of L ~ 10^42-10^44 erg/s, and size of D ~\n10-20 kpc at z>6 and D ~ 20-50 kpc at z ~ 3, in broad agreement with\nobservations in the same redshift range.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence\ndriven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in\nterms of Q and the cooling time.

Multi-planet\nevolved systems are particularly complex because of the mutual interactions\nbetween the planets. Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize\nmaps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and\nchaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape.

The 1st of these encompasses the main sequence\n(MS) of SFGs, the 2nd one a rarer population of starbursts (SB). We show that\nthe sSFR-distribution of SBs can be regarded as the result of a physical\nprocess (plausibly merging) taking the mathematical form of a log-normal\nboosting kernel and enhancing star formation activity. We explore the utility\nof splitting the star-forming population into MS and SB galaxies - an approach\nwe term \"2-Star Formation Mode\" (2-SFM) framework - for understanding their\nmolecular gas properties. Variations of star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas\nfractions among SFGs take a simple, redshift-independent form, once these\nquantities are normalized to the value of an average MS galaxy. The change in\nSFE for galaxies undergoing a starburst event scales supra-linearly with the\nSFR-increase, as expected for mergers. This implies a continuous distribution\nof galaxies in the Schmidt-Kennicutt plane that separates more clearly into\nloci for SBs and normal galaxies than observed in SFR vs. M* space. SBs with\nthe largest deviations (>10-fold) from the MS, like many local ULIRGs, are not\naverage SBs, but even rarer events with progenitors having larger gas fractions\nthan typical MS galaxies.

Compared to previous work, we improve the\ncalculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition\nto radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central\nAGN, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scattered\nand reprocessed photons. We find that the accretion flow properties change\nsignificantly due to this \"re-radiation\" effect. The inflow rate at the inner\nboundary is reduced, while the outflow rate at the outer boundary is enhanced\nby about one order of magnitude. This effect is more significant when the\ndensity at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as\nvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the\naccretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the\nradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far\nbelow the value of $\\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological\nsimulations. The effect of the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary\n($T_0$) is investigated. When $T_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity of the\naccretion flow oscillates.

Among various correlations of the\ntotal number of GCs with other global galaxy properties, we find that N_GC\ncorrelates well though nonlinearly with the dynamical mass of the galaxy bulge\nM_dyn = 4 \\sigma_e^2 R_e /G, where \\sigma_e is the central velocity dispersion\nand R_e the effective radius of the galaxy light profile. We also present\nupdated versions of the GC specific frequency S_N and specific mass S_M versus\nhost galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass. These graphs exhibit the previously\nknown U-shape: highest S_N or S_M values occur for either dwarfs or\nsupergiants, but in the midrange of galaxy size (10^9 - 10^10 L_Sun) the GC\nnumbers fall along a well defined baseline value of S_N ~ 1 or S_M ~ 0.1,\nsimilar among all galaxy types. Along with other recent discussions, we suggest\nthat this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematically\ninhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, but\nwhich had its minimum effect for intermediate masses. Our results strongly\nreinforce recent proposals that GC formation efficiency appears to be most\nnearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass M_halo.

When heavy\nfields are excited after the sudden turn and oscillate around the bottom of the\npotential, the following two effects are generically induced: deformation of\nthe inflationary background spacetime and conversion interactions between\nadiabatic and isocurvature perturbations, both of which can affect the\nprimordial density perturbations. In this paper, we calculate primordial\nspectra in inflationary models with sudden turning potentials taking into\naccount both of the two effects appropriately. We find that there are some\nnon-trivial correlations between the two effects in the power spectrum and, as\na consequence, the primordial scalar power spectrum has a peak around the scale\nexiting the horizon at the turn. Though both effects can induce parametric\nresonance amplifications, they are shown to be canceled out for the case with\nthe canonical kinetic terms.

Determining the nature of their progenitors is a crucial step\ntowards understanding the properties of SNe. Until recently, no progenitor has\nbeen directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from\nmassive stars that lose their hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from\nbinary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the\nprimary. Here we analyze recently reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which\ncould possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on\npre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models\nof single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor\ncandidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario. We\nfind that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the\nobserved photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. Our models indicate a very uncertain\nejecta mass of ~8 Msun, which is higher than the average of the SN Ib ejecta\nmass that is derived from the lightcurve (2-4 Msun). This possibly high ejecta\nmass could produce detectable effects in the iPTF13bvn lightcurve and spectrum.\nIf the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest\nthat stars with relatively high initial masses (>30 Msun) can produce visible\nSN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole. \n\n"}

A typical example is a galactic disc embedded in a dark matter halo.\nHere we do a linear perturbation analysis for a disc in an external field, and\nobtain a generalized dispersion relation and a modified stability criterion. An\nexternal field has two effects on the disc dynamics: first, it contributes to\nthe unperturbed rotational field, and second, it adds a tidal field term in the\nstability parameter. A typical disruptive tidal field results in a higher\nmodified Q value and hence leads to a more stable disc. We apply these results\nto the Milky Way, and to a low surface brightness galaxy UGC 7321.

We therefore build and compare a semi-empirical\nmodel for AGN fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger\n'triggering.' In particular, we show that the 'stochastic accretion' model - in\nwhich fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising whenever\ndense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the present\nobservations at low/intermediate luminosities. However it falls short of the\nhigh-luminosity population. We combine this with models for major\nmerger-induced AGN fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, and\npredict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host\ngalaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. We compile and compare\nobservational constraints from z~0-2. The models and observations generically\nshow a transition from disk to bulge dominance in hosts near the Seyfert-quasar\ntransition, at all redshifts.

The calculations focus on the single-scattering (direct\nradiation pressure) and optically thick regime, and adopt a moment-based\nRT-method implemented in the moving-mesh code AREPO. The source luminosity, gas\ndensity profile and initial temperature are varied. At typical temperatures and\ndensities of molecular clouds, radiation pressure drives velocities of order\n~20 km/s over 1-5 Myr; enough to unbind the smaller clouds. However, these\nestimates ignore the effects of photoionization that naturally occur\nconcurrently. When radiation pressure and photoionization act together, the\nlatter is substantially more efficient, inducing velocities comparable to the\nsound speed of the hot ionized medium (10-15 km/s) on timescales far shorter\nthan required for accumulating similar momentum with radiation pressure. This\nmismatch allows photoionization to dominate the feedback as the heating and\nexpansion of gas lowers the central densities, further diminishing the impact\nof radiation pressure. Our results indicate that a proper treatment of the\nimpact of young stars on the interstellar medium needs to primarily account for\ntheir ionization power whereas direct radiation pressure appears to be a\nsecondary effect.

We have determined a relationship for the optically thin HI\ngas between atomic hydrogen column density and tau353, NHI (cm-2) = (1.5 x\n10^26) x tau353, under the assumption that the dust properties are uniform and\nwe have applied this to estimate NHI from tau353 for the whole cloud.

In our new study we find correlations with much smaller scatter.\nDependences of the Tdep on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass\nsurface density and concentration index are now weak or absent. Differences\nwith previous work arise because dust extinction correlates strongly with\ngalaxy structural parameters. We further demonstrate that the 'primary' global\nparameter correlation is between Tdep and sSFR; all other remaining\ncorrelations can be shown to be induced by this primary dependence. This\nimplies that galaxies with high current-to-past-averaged star formation\nactivity, will drain their molecular gas reservoir sooner.

We further\nconducted VERA astrometry for the M87 core during the flaring period, and\ndetected core shifts between 22 and 43GHz. We also discovered a clear\nfrequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5GHz; the\nradio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a larger\namplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at\n22 and 43GHz. This indicates that a new radio-emitting component was created\nnear the black hole in the period of the VHE event, and then propagated outward\nwith progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. By combining these results,\nwe estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived a\nsub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. This value is significantly slower than\nthe super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during the\nprominent VHE flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger VHE activity\ncan be associated with the production of the higher Lorentz factor jet. \n\n"}

In recent works a statistical procedure based upon the\ncalculation of the skewness and kurtosis of the patches of CMB sky-sphere has\nbeen proposed and used to find out significant large-angle deviation from\nGaussianity in the foreground-reduced WMAP maps. Here we address the question\nas to how the analysis of Gaussianity of WMAP maps is modified if the\nforeground-cleaned Planck maps are used, therefore extending and complementing\nthe previous analyses in several regards. We carry out a new analysis of\nGaussianity with the available nearly full-sky foreground-cleaned Planck maps.\nAs the foregrounds are cleaned through different component separation\nprocedures, each of the resulting Planck maps is then tested for Gaussianity.\nWe determine quantitatively the effects for Gaussianity of masking the\nforeground-cleaned Planck maps with the INPMASK, VALMASK, and U73 Planck masks.\nWe show that although the foreground-cleaned Planck maps present significant\ndeviation from Gaussianity of different degrees when the less severe INPMASK\nand VALMASK are used, they become consistent with Gaussianity as detected by\nour indicator $S$ when masked with the union U73 mask. A slightly smaller\nconsistency with Gaussianity is found when the $K$ indicator is employed, which\nseems to be associated with large-angle anomalies reported by the Planck team.\nFinally, we examine the robustness of the Gaussianity analyses with respect to\nthe noise pixel's as given by the Planck team, and show that no appreciable\nchanges arise when is incorporated into the maps. The results of our analyses\nprovide important information about the suitability of the foreground-cleaned\nPlanck maps as Gaussian reconstructions of the CMB sky. \n\n"}

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)!

Three simple models of dust emission were fit to the\nobservations: a single temperature blackbody modified by a power- law\nemissivity (SMBB), a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken\npower-law emissivity (BEMBB), and two blackbodies with different temperatures,\nboth modified by the same power-law emissivity (TTMBB). Using these models we\ninvestigate the origin of the submm excess; defined as the submillimeter\n(submm) emission above that expected from SMBB models fit to observations < 200\nmicron. We find that the BEMBB model produces the lowest fit residuals with\npixel-averaged 500 micron submm excesses of 27% and 43% for the LMC and SMC,\nrespectively.

Abstract: Stellar feedback, star formation and gravitational interactions are major\ncontrolling forces in the evolution of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). To\nexplore their relative roles, we examine the properties and evolution of GMCs\nforming in an isolated galactic disk simulation that includes both localised\nthermal feedback and photoelectric heating. The results are compared with the\nthree previous simulations in this series which consists of a model with no\nstar formation, star formation but no form of feedback and star formation with\nphotoelectric heating in a set with steadily increasing physical effects. We\nfind that the addition of localised thermal feedback greatly suppresses star\nformation but does not destroy the surrounding GMC, giving cloud properties\nclosely resembling the run in which no stellar physics is included. The\noutflows from the feedback reduce the mass of the cloud but do not destroy it,\nallowing the cloud to survive its stellar children. This suggests that weak\nthermal feedback such as the lower bound expected for supernova may play a\nrelatively minor role in the galactic structure of quiescent Milky Way-type\ngalaxies, compared to gravitational interactions and disk shear. \n\n"}

Such\nsolitons should be ubiquitous in models of axion dark matter, with the soliton\ncharacteristic mass and size depending on some inverse power of the axion mass.\nStable configurations of non-relativistic axions are studied numerically using\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson system. This method, and the resulting soliton\ndensity profiles, are reviewed. Using a scaling symmetry and the uncertainty\nprinciple, the core size of the soliton can be related to the central density\nand axion mass, $m_a$, in a universal way. Solitons have a constant central\ndensity due to pressure-support, unlike the cuspy profile of cold dark matter\n(CDM). One consequence of this fact is that solitons composed of ultra-light\naxions (ULAs) may resolve the `cusp-core' problem of CDM. In DM halos,\nthermodynamics will lead to a CDM-like Navarro-Frenk-White profile at large\nradii, with a central soliton core at small radii. Using Monte-Carlo techniques\nto explore the possible density profiles of this form, a fit to\nstellar-kinematical data of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is performed.

Interest in this has been rekindled by recent studies in non-linear\nrelativistic perturbation theory that find biases in both the area of a surface\nof constant redshift and in the mean distance to this surface, with a\nfractional bias in both cases on the order of the mean squared convergence\n$\\langle \\kappa^2 \\rangle$. Any such area bias could alter CMB cosmology, and\nthe corresponding bias in mean flux density could affect supernova cosmology.\nHere we show that, in an ensemble averaged sense, the perturbation to the area\nof a surface of constant redshift is in reality much smaller, being on the\norder of the cumulative bending angle squared, or roughly a part-in-a-million\neffect. This validates the arguments of Weinberg (1976) that the mean\nmagnification $\\mu$ of sources is unity and of Kibble \\& Lieu (2005) that the\nmean direction-averaged inverse magnification is unity. It also validates the\nconventional treatment of lensing in analysis of CMB anisotropies.

The discs are assumed to be axisymmetric and in coplanar\norbits around a massive object at the common center of the discs. The mass in\nboth discs is assumed to be much smaller than the mass of the central object.\nFor each disc, the disc particles are assumed to be in near circular orbits.\nThe two discs are coupled to each other gravitationally.

Several threads point to excessive halo concentration,\nincluding central densities that rise too steeply with decreasing radius. Yet,\nrandom fluctuations in the gaseous component can 'heat' the centres of haloes,\ndecreasing their densities. We present a theoretical model deriving this effect\nfrom first principles: stochastic variations in the gas density are converted\ninto potential fluctuations that act on the dark matter; the associated force\ncorrelation function is calculated and the corresponding stochastic equation\nsolved. Assuming a power law spectrum of fluctuations with maximal and minimal\ncutoff scales, we derive the velocity dispersion imparted to the halo particles\nand the relevant relaxation time. We further perform numerical simulations,\nwith fluctuations realised as a Gaussian random field, which confirm the\nformation of a core within a timescale comparable to that derived analytically.\nNon-radial collective modes enhance the energy transport process that erases\nthe cusp, though the parametrisations of the analytical model persist.\n  In our model, the dominant contribution to the dynamical coupling driving the\ncusp-core transformation comes from the largest scale fluctuations. Yet, the\nefficiency of the transformation is independent of the value of the largest\nscale and depends weakly (linearly) on the power law exponent; it effectively\ndepends on two parameters: the gas mass fraction and the normalisation of the\npower spectrum.

The aim of the present paper is to show that strong blueshifts can be\ngenerated in quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) models.

In order to study this\nevolution it is important to sample the galaxies at various times in a\nconsistent way through time. In regular luminosity selected samples, our\nanalyses are biased towards the brightest galaxies at all times (as these are\neasier to observe and identify). A complementary method relies on the\nabsorption imprint from neutral gas in galaxies, the so-called damped Ly-alpha\nabsorbers (DLAs) seen towards distant bright objects. This thesis seeks to\nunderstand how the absorption selected galaxies relate to the emission selected\ngalaxies by identifying the faint glow from the absorbing galaxies at redshift\nz~2.\n  In the last Chapter, a study of the more evolved, massive galaxies is\npresented. These galaxies are observed to be a factor of 2 to 6 times smaller\nthan local galaxies of similar masses. A new spectroscopically selected sample\nis presented and the increased precision of the redshifts allows a more\ndetailed measurement of the scatter in the mass-size relation. The size\nevolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is modelled by a `dilution' scenario,\nin which progressively larger galaxies at later times are added to the\npopulation of denser galaxies, causing an increase of the mean size of the\npopulation. This model describes the evolution of both sizes and number\ndensities very well, however, the scatter in the model increases with time,\ncontrary to the data.

We study the limitations of such modelling by applying a general\ndynamical model with minimal assumptions to a large sample of galactic haloes\nfrom cosmological $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations. Using dark matter\nparticles as dynamical tracers, we find that the systematic uncertainties in\nthe measured mass and concentration parameters typically have an amplitude of\n25% to 40%.

The systematic\nuncertainties are not reduced by increasing the tracer sample size and vary\nstochastically from halo to halo. These systematic uncertainties are mostly\ndriven by underestimated statistical noise caused by correlated phase-space\nstructures that violate the steady state assumption. The number of independent\nphase-space structures inferred from the uncertainty level sets a limiting\nsample size beyond which a further increase no longer significantly improves\nthe accuracy of dynamical inferences. The systematic uncertainty level is\ndetermined by the halo merger history, the shape and environment of the halo.\nOur conclusions apply generally to any spherical steady-state model. \n\n"}

Recent studies suggest that elemental ratios could provide important\nconstraints on formation and migration mechanisms of giant exoplanets. A\nfundamental assumption in such studies is that the chemical composition of the\nplanetary envelope represents the sum-total of compositions of the accreted gas\nand solids during the formation history of the planet. We investigate the\nefficiency with which accreted planetesimals ablate in a giant planetary\nenvelope thereby contributing to its composition rather than sinking to the\ncore. From considerations of aerodynamic drag causing `frictional ablation' and\nthe envelope temperature structure causing `thermal ablation', we compute mass\nablations for impacting planetesimals of radii 30 m to 1 km for different\ncompositions (ice to iron) and a wide range of velocities and impact angles,\nassuming spherical symmetry. Icy impactors are fully ablated in the outer\nenvelope for a wide range of parameters. Even for Fe impactors substantial\nablation occurs in the envelope for a wide range of sizes and velocities. For\nexample, iron impactors of sizes below ~0.5 km and velocities above ~30 km/s\nare found to ablate by ~60-80% within the outer envelope at pressures below\n10^3 bar due to frictional ablation alone. For deeper pressures (~10^7 bar),\nsubstantial ablation happens over a wider range of parameters. Therefore, our\nexploratory study suggests that atmospheric abundances of volatile elements in\ngiant planets reflect their accretion history during formation. \n\n"}

We use (1) the caustic technique that identifies the\ncluster substructures and their galaxy members with optical spectroscopic data,\nand (2) the X-ray redshift fitting procedure that estimates the redshift\ndistribution of the intracluster medium (ICM).

Our approach differs significantly from previous studies in that we\ndirectly fit 3D models (two spatial dimensions plus one spectral dimension)\nusing the software $^\\text{3D}$BAROLO, fully exploiting the information in the\nHI datacubes. For each galaxy we derive the geometric parameters of the HI disc\n(inclination and position angle), the radial distribution of the surface\ndensity, the velocity-dispersion ($\\sigma_v$) profile and the rotation curve.\nThe circular velocity (V$_{\\text{c}}$), which traces directly the galactic\npotential, is then obtained by correcting the rotation curve for the asymmetric\ndrift. As an initial application, we show that these dIrrs lie on a baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation in excellent agreement with that seen on larger scales.\nThe final products of this work are high-quality, ready-to-use kinematic data\n($\\textrm{V}_\\textrm{c}$ and $\\sigma_v$) that we make publicly available.

These systems are susceptible to be tidally\nevolving, in particular the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in\nthe host star may modify its rotational evolution and also shape the orbital\narchitecture of the surrounding planetary system. Recent theoretical studies\nhave shown that the amplitude of the stellar dissipation can vary over several\norders of magnitude as the star evolves, and that it also depends on the\nstellar mass and rotation. We present here one of the first studies of the\ndynamics of close-in planets orbiting low-mass stars (from $0.6~M_\\odot$ to\n$1.2~M_\\odot$) where we compute the simultaneous evolution of the star's\nstructure, rotation and tidal dissipation in its external convective envelope.\nWe demonstrate that tidal friction due to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e.\ntidal inertial waves (their restoring force is the Coriolis acceleration)\nexcited in the convection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude\nthan the one of the equilibrium tide currently used in celestial mechanics.\nThis is particularly true during the Pre Main Sequence (PMS) phase and to a\nlesser extent during the Sub Giant (SG) phase.

{"id": "1611.08248", "contents": "Title: Limitations on the recovery of the true AGN variability parameters using\n  Damped Random Walk modeling Abstract: Context: The damped random walk (DRW) stochastic process is nowadays\nfrequently used to model aperiodic light curves of AGNs. A number of\ncorrelations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation\ntimescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole\nmass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is\nplausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based\nsurvey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to\nthe input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light\ncurves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,\ncadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most\nsignificant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return\nunconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do\nnot probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The\nexperiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW\ntimescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum\n10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for\nsufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias\ndepends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly\naffected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because\nthe DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing\ndata, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN\nparameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the\nanti-correlation of the DRW timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the\nsurvey length being too short.

In this paper we use SDSS\nspectrophotometry to explore the systematics of the correlation using the\n[OIII]5007 lines instead of Halpha or Hbeta to measure luminosities and line\nwidths. We also examine possible systematic effects involved in measuring the\nprofile-widths and the luminosities through different apertures.

We find the mixed\nL(Hbeta) sigma[OIII] relation to be at least as powerful as the canonical\nL-sigma relation as a distance estimator, and we show that the evolutionary\ncorrections do not change the slope and the scatter of the correlation, and\ntherefore, do not bias the L-sigma distance indicator at high redshifts.\nLocally, however, the luminosities of the Giant HII Regions that provide the\nzero-point calibrators are sensitive to evolutionary corrections and may bias\nthe Hubble constant if their mean ages, as measured by the equivalent widths of\nHbeta, are significantly different from the mean age of the HII Galaxies.

Already existing IVOA data models are\nreused as much as possible. The model is also made as generic as possible to be\nopen to new extensions but at the same time closed for modifications. This\nenables maintaining interoperability throughout different versions of the data\nmodel. We define the necessary building blocks for metadata discovery,\nserialization of time series data and understanding it by clients. We present\nseveral categories of time series science cases with examples of\nimplementation. We also take into account the most pressing topics for time\nseries providers like tracking original images for every individual point of a\nlight curve or time-derived axes like frequency for gravitational wave\nanalysis. The main motivation for the creation of a new model is to provide a\nunified time series data publishing standard - not only for light curves but\nalso more generic time series data, e.g., radial velocity curves, power\nspectra, hardness ratio, provenance linkage, etc. The flexibility is the most\ncrucial part of our model - we are not dependent on any physical domain or\nframe models. While images or spectra are already stable and standardized\nproducts, the time series related domains are still not completely evolved and\nnew ones will likely emerge in near future. That is why we need to keep models\nlike Time Series Cube DM independent of any underlying physical models. In our\nopinion, this is the only correct and sustainable way for future development of\nIVOA standards. \n\n"}

Four periods of eclipses - 94.2, 8.65, 1.52 and 1.43\nd - have been observed by the Kepler satellite, and three point sources (A, B,\nand C) are seen in high angular resolution images.\n  From spectroscopic observations made with the HIDES spectrograph attached to\nthe 1.88-m telescope of the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), for the\nfirst time we calculated radial velocities (RVs) of the component B - a pair of\nG-type stars - and combined them with Kepler photometry in order to obtain\nabsolute physical parameters of this pair. We also managed to directly measure\nRVs of the pulsator, also for the first time.

We also performed relative astrometry and photometry of\nthree sources seen on the images taken with the NIRC2 camera of the Keck II\ntelescope.

Models and simulations Abstract: Recent studies have shown that line profile distortions are commonly observed\nin gravitationally lensed quasar spectra. We investigate the effect of\ngravitational microlensing on quasar broad emission line profiles and their\nunderlying continuum, combining the emission from simple representative BLR\nmodels with generic microlensing magnification maps. Specifically, we\nconsidered Keplerian disk, polar, and equatorial wind BLR models of various\nsizes. The effect of microlensing has been quantified with four observables:\n$\\mu^{BLR}$, the total magnification of the broad emission line; $\\mu^{cont}$,\nthe magnification of the underlying continuum; as well as red/blue, RBI and\nwings/core, WCI, indices that characterize the line profile distortions. The\nsimulations showed that distortions of line profiles, such as those recently\nobserved in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the\ndifferential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR.\nWhile the magnification of the emission line $\\mu^{BLR}$ sets an upper limit on\nthe BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum $\\mu^{cont}$\nsets an upper limit on the size of the continuum source, the line profile\ndistortions mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics.

It\nappears that a strong microlensing effect puts important constraints on the\nsize of the BLR and on its distance to the high-magnification caustic. In that\ncase, BLR models with different geometries and kinematics are more prone to\nproduce distinctive line profile distortions for a limited number of caustic\nconfigurations, which facilitates their discrimination. \n\n"}

However, to further investigate the nature\nof the dark energy, a H0 estimate down to 1% level is greatly needed. This\nrequires dozens of strongly lensed quasars that are yet to be delivered by\nongoing and forthcoming all-sky surveys.\n  Aims: In this work we aim to determine the spectroscopic redshift of\nPSOJ0147, the first strongly lensed quasar candidate found in the Pan-STARRS\nsurvey. The main goal of our work is to derive an accurate redshift estimate of\nthe background quasar for cosmography.\n  Methods: To obtain timely spectroscopically follow-up, we took advantage of\nthe fast-track service programme that is carried out by the Nordic Optical\nTelescope. Using a grism covering 3200 - 9600 A, we identified prominent\nemission line features, such as Ly-alpha, N V, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, and [C\nIII] in the spectra of the background quasar of the PSOJ0147 lens system. This\nenables us to determine accurately the redshift of the background quasar.\n  Results: The spectrum of the background quasar exhibits prominent absorption\nfeatures bluewards of the strong emission lines, such as Ly-alpha, N V, and C\nIV. These blue absorption lines indicate that the background source is a broad\nabsorption line (BAL) quasar. Unfortunately, the BAL features hamper an\naccurate determination of redshift using the above-mentioned strong emission\nlines. Nevertheless, we are able to determine a redshift of 2.341+/-0.001 from\nthree of the four lensed quasar images with the clean forbidden line [C III].\nIn addition, we also derive a maximum outflow velocity of ~ 9800 km/s with the\nbroad absorption features bluewards of the C IV emission line. This value of\nmaximum outflow velocity is in good agreement with other BAL quasars. \n\n"}

In a highly eccentric binary, the tidal potential of one body can\nexcite oscillatory modes in the other during a pericenter passage, resulting in\nenergy exchange between the modes and the binary orbit. These modes exhibit one\nof three behaviors over multiple passages: low-amplitude oscillations, large\namplitude oscillations corresponding to a resonance between the orbital\nfrequency and the mode frequency, and chaotic growth.

Here we emphasize that two families of\ncompact stars, viz., neutron stars and strange stars, can coexist in nature,\nand that neutron stars can get converted to strange stars through the\nnucleation process of quark matter in the stellar center. From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars. Such a stellar conversion can also rescue\nsome massive, spin-supported millisecond pulsars from collapsing into black\nholes.

Yet determining this time is important for precision tests of the\ngeneral theory of relativity that compare an observed signal with quasinormal\nmode descriptions of the ringdown, such as tests of the no-hair theorem.

Using numerical relativity\nsimulations, we characterize the Kerrness of the strong-field region close to\nthe black hole using a set of local, gauge-invariant geometric and algebraic\nconditions that measure local isometry to Kerr.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the demographics of dark matter (DM) substructure is of\nparamount importance for many fields of astrophysics, including gravitational\nlensing, galaxy evolution, halo occupation modeling, and constraining the\nnature of dark matter. Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM\nsubstructure is typically modeled using N-body simulations, which reveal that\nlarge fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper we\nuse both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to\ninvestigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating\nand stripping, or numerical (i.e., artificial). We show that, contrary to naive\nexpectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock $\\Delta E$ that exceeds\nthe subhalo's binding energy, $|E_{\\rm b}|$, do not undergo disruption, even\nwhen $\\Delta E/|E_{\\rm b}|$ is as large as 100. Along the same line, and\ncontrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter\nfrom the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete\ndisruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In\naddition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters\nwith other subhaloes (`harassment'), is negligible compared to the tidal\neffects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of\nbaryonic processes, the complete, physical disruption of CDM substructure is\nextremely rare, and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore\nmust be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with\nnumerical overmerging, and conclude that inadequate force-softening is the most\nlikely culprit. \n\n"}

Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find\nthat: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean\nchemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many\nwaterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to\nprevious claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical\ncycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C\nexchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by\nseafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass\nand ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our\nmodel, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early\nwater-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of\nmagnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory\noverlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for\nwhich the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as\nwide as it can be.

In this work, we\nuse full-sky ray-tracing technique to produce mock images of galaxies from the\nELUCID $N$-body simulation run with the WMAP9 cosmology.

Using the mocked galaxy images,\na combination of galaxy intrinsic shape and the gravitational shear, we compare\nthe predicted tomographic shear correlations to the results of KiDS and DLS.

We rule\nout a model in which the satellite galaxies are radially aligned with the\ncenter galaxy, otherwise the shear-correlations on small scales are too high.\nMost important, we find that although the intrinsic alignment of spiral\ngalaxies is very weak, they induce a positive correlation between the\ngravitational shear signal and the intrinsic galaxy orientation (GI).

Locally, the number of filaments sticking out from\na node is not equal to its number of connections. At small distance, the peak\nhas an ellipsoidal shape so that only two filaments emerge. Further away,\nfilaments are subdivided at bifurcation points. At the resolution of the maps,\nthe local number of filaments is 3 on average in 2D and 4 in 3D, depending on\nthe height of the peak. Predictions from first principles based on peak theory\nare shown to reproduce well the connectivity and multiplicity of Gaussian\nrandom fields and cosmological simulations.

The WL effect depends on the lensing potential (LP) caused by matter\nperturbations, the distribution of which at cosmological scales is given by the\nmatter power spectrum (MPS). Therefore, the WL effect on the CMB $B$ mode is\naffected by the MPS.

Previous studies of the CMB $B$ mode\nwith the PMF have only considered the vector and tensor modes.

We further show that in our\nsimulations, the contribution of each type of source to reionization is not\nuniform across different gas phases.

Other\nspherical stellar systems, such as globular clusters, exhibit a restricted form\nof this effect where enhanced relaxation rate only occurs in the directions of\nthe angular momentum vectors, but not in their magnitudes; this is called\nvector resonant relaxation (VRR). To explore this effect, we performed a large\nset of direct N-body simulations, with up to 512k particles and ~500 dynamical\ntimes. Contrasting our simulations with Spitzer-style Monte Carlo simulations,\nthat by design only exhibit 2-body relaxation, we show that the temporal\nbehavior of the angular momentum vectors in $N$-body simulations cannot be\nexplained by 2-body relaxation alone. VRR operates efficiently in globular\nclusters with $N>10^4$. The fact that VRR operates in globular clusters may\nopen way to use powerful tools in statistical physics for their description. In\nparticular, since the distribution of orbital planes relaxes much more rapidly\nthan the distribution of the magnitude of angular momentum and the radial\naction, the relaxation process reaches an internal statistical equilibrium in\nthe corresponding part of phase space while the whole cluster is generally out\nof equilibrium, in a state of quenched disorder.

The dust extinction curve is measured along the GRB afterglow line of\nsight and the analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the host\ngalaxy gives access to the global dust attenuation of the stellar light. We\nselected a sample of 30 GRBs for which the extinction curve along the GRB\nafterglow line-of-sight (l.o.s) is measured in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)\nup to optical and we analysed the properties of the extinction curve as a\nfunction of the host galaxy properties. From these 30 GRBs, we selected seven\nGRBHs with a good rest-frame UV to near infra-red spectral coverage for the\nhost. The attenuation curve was derived by fitting the SEDs of the GRBH sample\nwith the CIGALE SED fitting code. Different star formation histories were\nstudied to recover the star formation rates (SFR) derived using H$_{\\alpha}$\nluminosities. The most extinguished GRBs are preferentially found in the more\nmassive hosts and the UV bump is preferentially found in the most extinguished\nGRB l.o.s. Five out of seven hosts are best fitted with a recent burst of star\nformation, leading to lower stellar mass estimates than previously found. The\naverage attenuation in the host galaxies is about 70% of the amount of\nextinction along the GRB l.o.s.

Partially motivated by a\nrecent suggestion that large non-isobaric clouds can `shatter' into tiny\ncloudlets, we revisit the linear theory to survey all possible regimes of\nthermal instability. We uncover seven regimes in total, one of which allows\nthree unstable condensation modes. Using the code Athena++, we determine the\nnumerical requirements to properly evolve small amplitude perturbations of the\nentropy mode into the nonlinear regime. Our 1D numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that for a typical AGN cooling function, the nonlinear evolution of\na single eigenmode in an isobarically unstable plasma involves increasingly\nlarger amplitude oscillations in cloud size, temperature and density as the\nwavelength increases.

It has been long suggested that such a wind\nfeedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently\nthat AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level\nconsistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the\neffect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection\nscheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are\nexplored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one\nin which it has an isothermal sphere profile.

The\ndeviations introduced by late non-linearities are commonly thought as noise in\nthe model. In this work, we analyze a cosmological simulation looking for\nsystematics on these deviations, finding that the classification of DM haloes\naccording to their angular momentum growth results in samples with different\ninternal alignment, spin parameter distribution and assembly history. Based on\nthis classification, we obtain that low mass haloes are embedded in denser\nenvironments if they have acquired angular momentum below the TTT expectations\n(L haloes), whereas at high masses enhanced clustering is typically associated\nwith higher angular momentum growths (W haloes). Additionally, we find that the\nlow mass signal has a weak dependence on the direction, whereas the high mass\nsignal is entirely due to the structure perpendicular to the angular momentum.\nFinally, we study the anisotropy of the matter distribution around haloes as a\nfunction of their mass. We find that the angular momentum direction of W (L)\nhaloes remains statistically perpendicular (parallel) to the surrounding\nstructure across the mass range\n$11<\\mathrm{log}(M/h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot})<14$, whereas haloes following TTT\nshow a \"spin flip\" mass consistent with previously reported values ($\\sim 5\n\\times 10^{12}$ $h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$).

Alternatively, age distributions can\nbe derived applying the robust technique of colour-magnitude diagram fitting\n(Gallart et al. 2005), till now mainly employed to study nearby galaxies. The\nnew distances to individual Milky Way stars from the Gaia mission (Brown et al.\n2018) have allowed us to use this technique to derive ages from a thick disk\ncolour-magnitude diagram, and from the enigmatic, two-sequenced\ncolour-magnitude diagram of the kinematically hot local halo (Babusiaux et al.\n2018), which blue-sequence has been linked to a major accretion event (Haywood\net al. 2018, Helmi et al. 2018). Because accurate ages were lacking, the time\nof the merger and its role on our Galaxy's early evolution remained unclear. We\nshow that the stars in both halo sequences share identical age distributions,\nand are older than the bulk of thick disc stars.

The black hole\nexerts a torque on the disk, which transfers energy and angular momentum\nbetween the black hole and the disk. If the black hole rotates faster than the\ndisk, energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and\ntransfered to the disk. The energy deposited into the disk is eventually\nradiated away by the disk, which will increase the efficiency of the disk. If\nthe black hole rotates slower than the disk, energy and angular momentum are\ntransfered from the disk to the black hole, which will lower the efficiency of\nthe disk. With suitable boundary conditions, quasi-steady state solutions are\nobtained for a thin Keplerian disk magnetically coupled to a Kerr black hole.\nBy ``quasi-steady state'' we mean that any macroscopic quantity at a given\nradius in the disk slowly changes with time: the integrated change within one\nrotation period of the disk is much smaller than the quantity itself. We find\nthat, the torque produced by the magnetic coupling propagates only outward in\nthe disk, the total radiation flux of the disk is a superposition of the\nradiation flux produced by the magnetic coupling and that produced by\naccretion. Most interestingly, a disk magnetically coupled to a rapidly\nrotating black hole can radiate without accretion. Such a disk has an infinite\nefficiency. For a specific example that the magnetic field touches the disk at\nthe inner boundary, the radial radiation profile is very different from that of\na standard accretion disk: the emissivity index is significantly bigger, most\nradiation comes from a region which is closer to the center of the disk. \n\n"}

As pulse lag and luminosity have been found to be correlated this also\nrepresents a correlation between peak luminosity and jet-break time.

We use\nthree-dimensional Monte Carlo cosmological realizations of a simple linear\npeaks model to track the time evolution of such metal-enriched outflows and\ntheir feedback on galaxy formation. We find that at most 30% of the IGM by\nvolume is enriched to values above 10^-3 solar in models that only include\nobjects that cool by atomic transitions. The majority of enrichment occurs\nrelatively early (5 < z < 12) and resulting in a mass-averaged cosmological\nmetallicity between 10^-3 and 10^-1.5 solar.

Multi-frequency VLBA maps\nshow that the sixth and faintest component has a different radio spectrum than\nthe others, confirming that it represents a second component of the background\nsource rather than a sixth image. The lens models predict that there should be\nadditional faint images of this second source component, and we find evidence\nfor one of the predicted images.

Standard models of quad lenses,\nwhich approximate the environment as a tidal shear, recover the ellipticity\nreasonably well (|de/e|<~0.24) but overestimate the Hubble constant\n(dh/h~0.15), and have significant (~30%) errors in the millilensing analyses\nused to constrain the amount of substructure in dark matter halos.

The spinning fragment has a deformed shape and looks like an oblate\nellipsoid. Due to the virtual non-compressibility of nuclear matter, and the\npolarization of the spin in the plane transverse to the input momentum of the\nprojectile nucleus such an ellipsoid has a reduced mean interaction\ncross-section compared with a non-spinning fragment which has a spherical\nshape. Purely geometrical arguments dictate that such an ellipsoidal nucleus\nshould have additional fluctuations of cross-section even at a fixed impact\nparameter dependent on the orientation angle between the axis of the ellipsoid\nand the vector connecting the centers of projectile and target nucleus. The\nnumber of 'wounded nucleons' in the projectile nucleus participating in the\ninteraction correlates strongly with the interaction cross-section. All these\neffects lead to a non-exponential attenuation of fragments and increased\nprobability for a fragment to penetrate down to a larger depth in the absorber,\nthan normal.\n  If the sling effect appears in the interaction of a primary cosmic ray\nnucleus with nuclei in the atmosphere the induced atmospheric cascade will have\na slower attenuation, and thereby can help to reduce some important\ninconsistencies in the interpretation of the existing experimental data on\nextensive air showers, observed in the lower half of the atmosphere.

We derive UV luminosity functions and j_280 luminosity\ndensities for spheroid-dominated galaxies, spiral galaxies, Magellanic\nirregulars, and clearly-interacting galaxies with morphologies suggestive of\nongoing major mergers. We check the reliability of GEMS morphologies against\nthe deeper GOODS images and quantify an incompleteness of the GEMS merger\nidentification at the faint end.

The two frequencies are well correlated but, contrary to recent\nsuggestions, the frequency-frequency correlation is significantly different\nfrom a nu_2 = (3/2) nu_1 relation. To check whether, although not following the\nthe 3/2 relation, the QPO frequencies cluster around a region where nu_2/nu_1 ~\n3/2, we re-analyzed the Sco X-1 data that were used to report that ratio and\nshow that, because the distribution of ratios of linearly correlated\nmeasurements is intrinsically biased, although the significance of the\nclustering around nu_2/nu_1 ~ 3/2 previously reported in the case of Sco X-1 is\nformally correct, it does not provide any useful information about a possible\nunderlying resonance mechanism in this source.

The main feature of this\ndistribution can be presented as follows. Both shallow and deep active regions\ndemonstrate a clear dominance of one sign of current helicity in a given\nhemisphere during the whole cycle. Broadly speaking, current helicity has\nopposite polarities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, although there\nare some active regions that violate this polarity rule. The relative number of\nactive regions violating the polarity rule is significantly higher for deeper\nactive regions. A separation of active regions into `shallow', `middle' and\n`deep' is made by comparing their rotation rate and the helioseismic rotation\nlaw.

We use detailed cosmologically motivated numerical\nmodels to investigate the systematics and the accuracy of recovering parameters\nof the galaxies. Some of our models match the observed structure of the two\ngalaxies remarkably well. Our analysis shows that the rotation curves of these\ntwo galaxies are instead quite compatible with their DM halos having steep\ncuspy density profiles. The rotation curves in our models are measured using\nstandard observational techniques. The models reproduce the rotation curves of\nboth galaxies, the disk surface brightness profiles as well as the profile of\nisophotal ellipticity and position angle. The models are centrally dominated by\nbaryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. The simulated\ndisk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio in\nagreement with the observed colors. We show that non-circular motions combined\nwith gas pressure support and projection effects results in a large\nunderestimation of the circular velocity in the central $\\sim 1$ kpc region,\ncreating the illusion of a constant density core.

Electron capture leads to\nthe collapse to nuclear densities of these cores within a few tens of\nmilliseconds. The shock generated at bounce moves slowly, but steadily,\noutwards.

We provide new estimates of the Cosmic\nInfrared Background (CIB), and compare it with the Cosmic Optical Background\n(COB). Methods. Using Spitzer data at 24, 70 and 160um in three deep fields, we\nstacked more than 19000 MIPS 24um sources with S24>60uJy at 70 and 160um, and\nmeasured the resulting FIR flux densities. Results.

They have steep radio spectra but no apparent cutoff, as old remnants\nof radio galaxies usually have. Therefore particle acceleration has to take\nplace within them. We propose that shock structures of the cosmological\nlarge-scale matter flows are responsible for the acceleration of relativistic\nelectrons: cluster accretion shocks and bow shocks of merger events. We develop\na theory of radio plasma having traversed these shocks and compare it to\nobservational data of nine radio relics (0038-096, 0917+75, 1140+203, 1253+275,\n1712+64, 1706+78, 2006-56, 2010-57, 1401-33) and their host clusters (A85,\nA786, A1367, Coma, A2255, A2256, A3667, S753).

For galactic bulges of types S0 to Sb, the tightness of the B-I vs\nI-H relation suggests that the age spread among bulges of early type galaxies\nis small, of at most 2 Gyr. Colours at 1 R_eff, where we expect extinction to\nbe negligible are similar to than those of elliptical galaxies in the Coma\ncluster, suggesting that these bulges formed at the same time as the bright\ngalaxies in Coma. Furthermore the galaxy ages are found to be independent of\ntheir environment. Since it is likely that Coma was formed at redshift z > 3,\nour bulges, which are in groups and in the field, also must have been formed at\nthis epoch.

The toroidal field B_t tends to\ndistort the NS into a prolate shape, and this magnetic distortion can easily\ndominate over the oblateness ``frozen into'' the NS crust. An elastic NS with\nfrozen-in B-field of this magnitude is clearly secularly unstable: the wobble\nangle between the NS's angular momentum J^i and the star's magnetic axis n_B^i\ngrow on a dissipation timescale until J^i and n_B^i are orthogonal. This final\norientation is clearly the optimal one for gravitational-wave (gw) emission.\nThe basic cause of the instability is quite general, so we conjecture that the\nsame final state is reached for a realistic NS. Assuming this, we show that for\nLMXB's with B_t of order 10^{13}G, the spindown from gw's is sufficient to\nbalance the accretion torque--supporting a suggestion by Bildsten. The spindown\nrates of most millisecond pulsars can also be attributed to gw emission sourced\nby toroidal B-fields, and both these sources could be observed by LIGO II.\nWhile the first-year spindown of a newborn NS is most likely dominated by em\nprocesses, reasonable values of B_t and the (external) dipolar field B_d can\nlead to detectable levels of gw emission, for a newborn NS in our own galaxy. \n\n"}
