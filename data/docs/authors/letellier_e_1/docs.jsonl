Furthermore, it has been observed recently\nthat the elliptic genus of K3 has a natural interpretation in terms of the\ndimensions of representations of the largest Mathieu group M24. In this paper\nwe first give further evidence for this possibility by studying the elliptic\ngenus of K3 surfaces twisted by some simple symplectic automorphisms.

Our\nstarting points is the class of algebras, which we call 'conformal Lie\nalgebras' (CLA), which have very similar properties to the conformal algebras\nof Minkowski space-time, though our aim is to go beyond this class in a natural\nway. For this we introduce the new notion of {\\it parabolic relation} between\ntwo non-compact semisimple Lie algebras g and g' that have the same\ncomplexification and possess maximal parabolic subalgebras with the same\ncomplexification. Thus, we consider the exceptional algebra E_{7(7)} which is\nparabolically related to the CLA E_{7(-25)}, the parabolic subalgebras\nincluding E_{6(6)} and E_{6(-6)} . Other interesting examples are the\northogonal algebras so(p,q) all of which are parabolically related to the\nconformal algebra so(n,2) with p+q=n+2, the parabolic subalgebras including the\nLorentz subalgebra so(n-1,1) and its analogs so(p-1,q-1).

Second -\nsecant varieties of homogeneous projective varieties, and the related notions\nof rank and border rank. Third - quantum entanglement. Our main result concerns\nthe relation between the problem of the state reconstruction from its reduced\none-particle density matrices and the minimal number of separable summands in\nits decomposition. More precisely, we show that sphericity implies that states\nof a given rank cannot be approximated by states of a lower rank. We call\nstates for which such approximation is possible exceptional states. For three,\nimportant from quantum entanglement perspective cases of distinguishable,\nfermionic and bosonic particles, we also show that non-sphericity implies the\nexistence of exceptional states. Remarkably, the exceptional states belong to\nnon-bipartite entanglement classes. In particular, we show that the $W$-type\nstates and their appropriate modifications are exceptional states stemming from\nthe second secant variety for three cases above. We point out that the\nexistence of the exceptional states is a physical obstruction for deciding the\nlocal unitary equivalence of states by means of the one-particle reduced\ndensity matrices.

Localizing an\narbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight\nstructure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight\nstructure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the\nnon-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the\nnatural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor\nconnecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the\nelements of $S$ invertible. In particular, taking $C=K^b(A)$ for an additive\n$A$ we obtain a very efficient tool for computing the additive localization of\n$A$ by $S$; using it, we generalize the calculations of Gerasimov and\nMalcolmson.\n  We apply our results to certain categories of birational motives over a base\nscheme $U$ (generalizing those defined by Kahn and Sujatha).

Often these basis elements are computed by a standard recursive\nalgorithm which, for Coxeter group elements of long length, generally involves\ncomputing most basis elements corresponding to Coxeter group elements of\nsmaller length. Thus, many calculations simply compute all basis elements\nassociated to a given length or less, even if the interest is in a specific\nKazhdan-Lusztig basis element. Similar remarks apply to \"parabolic\" versions of\nthese basis elements defined later by Deodhar (1987,1990), though the lengths\ninvolved are the (smaller) lengths of distinguished coset representatives. We\ngive an algorithm which targets any given Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element or\nparabolic analog and does not precompute any other Kazhdan-Lusztig basis\nelements. In particular it does not have to store them.

Here Xcan is the complement of an anticanonical\ndivisor in a Langlands dual quadric. The superpotential W is a regular function\non Xcan and is written in terms of coordinates which are naturally identified\nwith a cohomology basis of the original quadric. This superpotential is shown\nto extend the earlier Landau-Ginzburg model of Givental, and to be isomorphic\nto the Lie-theoretic mirror introduced by Rietsch. We also introduce a Laurent\npolynomial superpotential which is the restriction of W to a particular torus\nin Xcan. Together with results of Pech-Rietsch for odd quadrics, we obtain a\ncombinatorial model for the Laurent polynomial superpotential in terms of a\nquiver, in the vein of those introduced in the 1990's by Givental for type A\nfull flag varieties. These Laurent polynomial superpotentials form a single\nseries, despite the fact that our mirrors of even quadrics are defined on dual\nquadrics, while the mirror to an odd quadric is naturally defined on a\nprojective space.

For\nclassical Lie algebras, Kraft and Procesi showed that these two types of\nsingularities suffice to describe all generic singularities of nilpotent orbit\nclosures: specifically, any such singularity is either a simple surface\nsingularity, a minimal singularity, or a union of two simple surface\nsingularities of type $A_{2k-1}$.

We check\nthat for several well-known reductive groups these analogies are actually\nprecise.\n  Furthermore we reveal a new structure in the space of enhanced L-parameters\nfor H, that of a disjoint union of twisted extended quotients. This is an\nanalogue of the ABPS conjecture (about irreducible H-representations) on the\nGalois side of the local Langlands correspondence. Only, on the Galois side it\nis no longer conjectural. These results will be useful to reduce the problem of\nfinding a local Langlands correspondence for H-representations to the\ncorresponding problem for supercuspidal representations of Levi subgroups of H.\n  The main machinery behind this comes from perverse sheaves on algebraic\ngroups.

The conjecture proposes\nan automorphic category associated to a compact Riemann surface X and complex\nreductive group G is equivalent to a spectral category associated to the\nunderlying topological surface S and Langlands dual group G^. The automorphic\ncategory consists of suitable C-sheaves on the moduli stack Bun_G(X) of\nG-bundles on X, while the spectral category consists of suitable O-modules on\nthe character stack Loc_G^(S) of G^-local systems on S. The conjecture is\ncompatible with and constrained by the natural symmetries of both sides coming\nfrom modifications of bundles and local systems.

We study these characters for combinatorial Hopf\nalgebras. Following Loday and Ronco, a combinatorial Hopf algebra is a graded\nand connected Hopf algebra which is a polynomial algebra with an explicit\nchoice of basis (usually identified with combinatorial objects such as trees,\ngraphs, etc.). If the growth bounds and the Hopf algebra are compatible we\nprove that the controlled characters form infinite-dimensional Lie groups.\nFurther, we identify the Lie algebra and establish regularity results (in the\nsense of Milnor) for these Lie groups.
