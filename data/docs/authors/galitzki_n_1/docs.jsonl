Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Measurements using bispectrum of cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies are limited by the cosmic variance, i.e. available number of\nmodes. Recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-gaussianity of\nlocal type using the scale dependence of large scale bias from highly biased\ntracers of large scale structure. However, this power spectrum method is also\nlimited by cosmic variance, finite number of structures on the largest scales,\nand by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic\nthe same effect. Here we propose an alternative method that solves both of\nthese problems. It is based on the idea that on large scales halos are biased,\nbut not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased\ntracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer one eliminates the\ncosmic variance error, which can lead to a high signal to noise even from the\nstructures comparable to the size of the survey.

We compare our clusters to an analogous sample from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) and match the EDisCS clusters to their most likely\ndescendants.

We find tentative\nevidence that red sequence galaxies brighter than a threshold magnitude are\nalready in place, and that this threshold evolves to fainter magnitudes toward\nlower redshifts. We compare the EDisCS LFs with the LF of co-eval red sequence\ngalaxies in the field and find that the bright end of the LFs agree.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists.

The regions have overdensities that\ndeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the\nrms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20Mpc/h at z=1.5.

They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising\nbackground, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR\ndensity at z <~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an\norder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces\nobservational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the\nGOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear\nin the underdense regions until z~3.

Analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acoustic\noscillations.

The\ndistribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the power\nasymmetry on scales k ~ 1.5h/Mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of the\nasymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of the\nasymmetry in the CMB. We show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetry\nwith this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the\ninflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. Instead, we consider\ncurvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,\nthus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon\nfluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these\nperturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on\nlarge angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate\nthe observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the\ncurvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.\nThe model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from\nfluctuations in the inflaton field.

These tessellated reflectors comprise hundreds\nof mirror facets mounted on a space frame to achieve this large area at a\nreasonable cost. To achieve a reflecting surface of sufficient quality one must\nprecisely orient each facet using a procedure known as alignment. We describe\nhere an alignment system which uses a digital (CCD) camera placed at the focus\nof the optical system, facing the reflector. The camera acquires a series of\nimages of the reflector while the telescope scans a grid of points centred on\nthe direction of a bright star. Correctly aligned facets are brightest when the\ntelescope is pointed directly at the star, while mis-aligned facets are\nbrightest when the angle between the star and the telescope pointing direction\nis twice the misalignment angle of the facet.

Recent work has shown\nthat detailed observations can be used to separate the stellar mass profile of\nthese 'burst relic' components in local systems. Together with the assumption\nthat some Kennicutt-Schmidt law holds, and that the burst was indeed a\ndissipational gas-rich event, we show that the observed profiles can be\ninverted to obtain the time and space-dependent SF history of each burst.\nPerforming this with a large sample of well-studied spheroids, we show that the\nimplied bursts scale in magnitude, mass, peak SFR, and spatial extent with\ngalaxy mass in simple manner, and provide fits to these correlations. Burst\nmasses are ~10% the total spheroid mass; timescales a mass-independent ~10^8\nyr; peak SFR ~M_burst/t_burst; and they decay in power-law fashion ~t^-2.4.\nSizes are ~0.1 R_e(spheroid), but grow with time. Combined with measurements of\nthe nuclear stellar population ages of these systems (i.e. burst times), it is\npossible to re-construct the burst contribution to the distribution of SFRs and\nIR luminosity functions at all redshifts. The burst LF agrees well with\nobserved IR LFs at the brightest luminosities, at z=0-2. At low-L, bursts are\nalways unimportant; the transition to their importance increases from ULIRG\nluminosities at z~0 to HyLIRG luminosities at z~2.

The\nother is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted.

Abstract: We study the effects of externally imposed turbulence on the thermal\nproperties of galaxy cluster cores, using three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations including magnetic fields, anisotropic thermal conduction, and\nradiative cooling. The imposed \"stirring\" crudely approximates the effects of\ngalactic wakes, waves generated by galaxies moving through the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), and/or turbulence produced by a central active galactic nucleus.\nThe simulated clusters exhibit a strong bimodality. Modest levels of\nturbulence, ~100 km/s (~10% of the sound speed), suppress the heat-flux-driven\nbuoyancy instability (HBI), resulting in an isotropically tangled magnetic\nfield and a quasi-stable, high entropy, thermal equilibrium with no cooling\ncatastrophe. Thermal conduction dominates the heating of the cluster core, but\nturbulent mixing is critical because it suppresses the HBI and (to a lesser\nextent) the thermal instability. Lower levels of turbulent mixing\n(approximately less than 100 km/s) are insufficient to suppress the HBI,\nrapidly leading to a thermal runaway and a cool-core cluster.

The homogeneous and isotropic background in this class of\ntheories is unmodified and is described by the usual Friedmann equations. The\ntheory of cosmological perturbations is modified and the relevant deformation\nparameter has the dimension of length. Gravitational perturbations of the\nscalar type can be described by a certain relativistic potential related to the\nmatter perturbations just as in general relativity. A system of differential\nequations describing the evolution of this potential and of the stress-energy\ndensity perturbations is obtained. We find that the evolution of scalar\nperturbations proceeds with a modified effective time-dependent speed of sound,\nwhich, contrary to the case of general relativity, does not vanish even at the\nmatter-dominated stage. In a broad range of values of the length parameter\ncontrolling the deformation, a specific transition from the regime of modified\ngravity to the regime of general relativity in the evolution of scalar\nperturbations takes place during the radiation domination. In this case, the\nresulting power spectrum of perturbations in radiation and dark matter is\nsuppressed on the comoving spatial scales that enter the Hubble radius before\nthis transition. We estimate the bounds on the deformation parameter for which\nthis suppression does not lead to observable consequences.

As a standard method, the two-point\ncorrelation functions $xi_\\pm(theta)$ of the cosmic shear field are used as\nstatistical measures for the shear field. In order to separate the observed\nshear into E- and B-modes, the latter being most likely produced by remaining\nsystematics in the data set and/or intrinsic alignment effects, several\nstatistics have been defined before. Here we aim at a complete E-/B-mode\ndecomposition of the cosmic shear information contained in the $xi_\\pm$ on a\nfinite angular interval. We construct two sets of such E-/B-mode measures,\nnamely Complete Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-mode Integrals (COSEBIs), characterized\nby weight functions between the $xi_\\pm$ and the COSEBIs which are polynomials\nin $theta$ or polynomials in $ln(theta)$, respectively. Considering the\nlikelihood in cosmological parameter space, constructed from the COSEBIs, we\nstudy their information contents. We show that the information grows with the\nnumber of COSEBI modes taken into account, and that an asymptotic limit is\nreached which defines the maximum available information in the E-mode component\nof the $xi_\\pm$. We show that this limit is reached the earlier (i.e., for a\nsmaller number of modes considered) the narrower the angular range is over\nwhich $xi_\\pm$ are measured, and it is reached much earlier for logarithmic\nweight functions.

If so, it hosts the closest known neutron\nstar, and its existence implies a great abundance of similar systems and a rate\nof white-dwarf neutron-star mergers similar to that of the type Ia supernova\nrate. Here, we present high signal-to-noise spectra of SDSS 1257+5428, which\nconfirm an independent finding that the system is in fact composed of two white\ndwarfs, one relatively cool and with low mass, and the other hotter and more\nmassive. With this, the demographics and merger rate are no longer puzzling\n(various factors combine to lower the latter by more than two orders of\nmagnitude). We show that the spectra are fit well with a combination of two\nhydrogen model atmospheres, as long as the lines of the higher-gravity\ncomponent are broadened significantly relative to what is expected from just\npressure broadening. Interpreting this additional broadening as due to\nrotation, the inferred spin period is short, about 1 minute. Similarly rapid\nrotation is only seen in accreting white dwarfs that are magnetic; empirically,\nit appears that in non-magnetized white dwarfs, accreted angular momentum is\nlost by nova explosions before it can be transferred to the white dwarf. This\nsuggests that the massive white dwarf in SDSS 1257+5428 is magnetic as well,\nwith B~10^5 G. Alternatively, the broadening seen in the spectral lines could\nbe due to a stronger magnetic field, of ~10^6 G. The two models could be\ndistinguished by further observations. \n\n"}

The fractional polarization of sources is almost\nindependent of frequency with a median of ~2 per cent and an average, for\ndetected sources, of ~3.5 per cent. These values are also independent of the\ntotal intensity over the narrow range of intensity we sample. Using a\ncontemporaneous sample of 105 sources detected at all 3 VLA frequencies, we\nhave investigated the spectral behaviour as a function of frequency by means of\na 2-colour diagram. Most sources have power-law spectra in total intensity, as\nexpected. On the other hand they appear to be almost randomly distributed in\nthe polarized intensity 2-colour diagram. This is compatible with the polarized\nspectra being much less smooth than those in intensity and we speculate on the\nphysical origins of this.

We examine their positions in\nthe luminousity-metallicity (L-Z) and mass-metallicity (M-Z) planes, with\nrespect to the L-Z and M-Z relations of other gas-rich, star-forming dwarf\ngalaxies, viz., blue compact galaxies (BCGs) and dwarf irregular (dI) galaxies.\nWe find that while the metallicities of some low-luminousity XMD galaxies are\nconsistent with those expected from the L-Z relation, other XMD galaxies are\ndeviant. We determine the 95 per cent confidence interval around the L-Z\nrelation for BCGs, and find that its lower boundary is given by 12 + log(O/H) =\n-0.177 M_{B} + 4.87. We suggest that a galaxy should be regarded as XMD, in a\nstatistically significant manner, only if it lies below this boundary in the\nL-Z plane. Of our sample of XMD galaxies, we find that more than half are XMD\nby this criterion. We also determine the gas mass fractions and chemical yields\nof galaxies in all three samples. We find that the effective chemical yield\nincreases with increasing baryonic mass, consistent with what is expected if\noutflows of metal-enriched gas are important in determining the effective\nyield. XMD galaxies have lower effective yield than BCG/dI galaxies of similar\nbaryonic mass. Motivated by the fact that interactions are common in XMD\ngalaxies, we suggest that improved (tidally-driven) mixing of the interstellar\nmedia (ISM) in XMD galaxies leads to a lowering of both, the measured\nmetallicity and the calculated effective yield. We suggest that XMD galaxies\nare deviant from the L-Z relation because of a combination of being gas-rich\n(i.e., having processed less gas into stars) and having more uniform mixing of\nmetals in their ISM. \n\n"}

The radiative transfer\nformulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday\nrotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps\nwere generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and\nradiative properties of the evolving jets. Intensity light curves were computed\nvia integrating spatially over the emission maps. We apply the models to jets\nin active galactic nuclei (AGN).

The energy dependence of the\nscintillation yield of liquid xenon for nuclear recoils also bears heavily on\ndetector sensitivity, yet numerous measurements have not succeeded in obtaining\nconcordant results. In this article we show that the ratio of detected\nionization to scintillation can be leveraged to constrain the scintillation\nyield.

The molecular composition of the\ntwo outflows presents systematic changes with velocity that we analyze by\ndividing the outflow in three chemical regimes, two of them associated with the\nwing component and the other the EHV gas. The analysis of the two wing regimes\nshows that species like H2CO and CH3OH favor the low-velocity gas, while SiO\nand HCN are more abundant in the fastest gas. We also find that the EHV regime\nis relatively rich in O-bearing species, as is not only detected in CO and SiO\n(already reported elsewhere), but also in SO, CH3OH, and H2CO (newly reported\nhere), with a tentative detection in HCO+. At the same time, the EHV regime is\nrelatively poor in C-bearing molecules like CS and HCN. We suggest that this\ndifference in composition arises from a lower C/O ratio in the EHV gas. The\ndifferent chemical compositions of the wing and EHV regimes suggest that these\ntwo outflow components have different physical origins. The wing component is\nbetter explained by shocked ambient gas, although none of the existing shock\nmodels explains all observed features. The peculiar composition of the EHV gas\nmay reflect its origin as a dense wind from the protostar or its surrounding\ndisk. \n\n"}

Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and\ndisplaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light\ncurves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the\ntime lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical\nformalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the\nproblems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated\nerrors, and seasonal gaps. We redetermine the lags for 87 emission lines in 31\nquasars and reassess the BLR size--luminosity relationship using 60 H-beta\nlags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation\nmethods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad\nrange of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines\nand continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and\nprovides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these\ncorrelations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line\nvelocity--delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent\nlags or line responses. We use this to detect the scaling of the BLR size with\ncontinuum luminosity in NGC 5548. \n\n"}

This paper reports\ninitial results from the 43GHz receiver which has an array sensitivity to CMB\nfluctuations of 69uK sqrt(s). The data were extensively studied with a large\nsuite of null tests before the power spectra, determined with two independent\npipelines, were examined. Analysis choices, including data selection, were\nmodified until the null tests passed. Cross correlating maps with different\ntelescope pointings is used to eliminate a bias. This paper reports the EE, BB\nand EB power spectra in the multipole range ell=25-475. With the exception of\nthe lowest multipole bin for one of the fields, where a polarized foreground,\nconsistent with Galactic synchrotron radiation, is detected with 3sigma\nsignificance, the E-mode spectrum is consistent with the LCDM model, confirming\nthe only previous detection of the first acoustic peak. The B-mode spectrum is\nconsistent with zero, leading to a measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio of\nr=0.35+1.06-0.87. The combination of a new time-stream double-demodulation\ntechnique, Mizuguchi-Dragone optics, natural sky rotation, and frequent\nboresight rotation leads to the lowest level of systematic contamination in the\nB-mode power so far reported, below the level of r=0.1 \n\n"}

These data also strongly constrain models\nfeaturing the spectral breaks predicted by classical physical models for the\nsynchrotron emission produced in jets of blazars (Blandford & Konigl 1979;\nKonigl 1981). A model dealing with blazars as a single population is, at best,\nonly marginally consistent with data coming from current surveys at high radio\nfrequencies.

Our results are consistent\nwith the fraction of Compton-thick sources being ~10%. The spectra of Seyfert\n2's with and without polarized broad lines do not show significant differences,\nthe only difference between the two samples being the higher hard X-ray and\nbolometric luminosity of Seyfert 2's with polarized broad lines. The average\nhard X-ray spectrum of Narrow line Seyfert 1's is steeper than those of Seyfert\n1's and Seyfert 1.5's, probably due to a lower energy of the cutoff. \n\n"}

The simulations consider a number of processes, such as radiative\ncooling, star formation, supernovae and feedback from active galactic nuclei\n(AGN). Van Daalen et al. (2011) used the same simulations to show that baryon\nphysics, in particular the strong feedback that is required to solve the\novercooling problem, modifies the matter power spectrum on scales relevant for\ncosmological weak lensing studies. As a result, the use of power spectra from\ndark matter simulations can lead to significant biases in the inferred\ncosmological parameters. We show that the typical biases are much larger than\nthe precision with which future missions aim to constrain the dark energy\nequation of state, w_0. For instance, the simulation with AGN feedback, which\nreproduces X-ray and optical properties of groups of galaxies, gives rise to a\n~40% bias in w_0. We demonstrate that the modification of the power spectrum is\ndominated by groups and clusters of galaxies, the effect of which can be\nmodelled.

We evaluate the consequences of the lossy compression\nalgorithm of Bernstein et al. (2010) for the high-precision measurement of\nweak-lensing galaxy ellipticities. This square-root algorithm compresses each\npixel independently, and the information discarded is by construction less than\nthe Poisson error from photon shot noise. For simulated space-based images\n(without cosmic rays) digitized to the typical 16 bits per pixel, application\nof the lossy compression followed by image-wise lossless compression yields\nimages with only 2.4 bits per pixel, a factor of 6.7 compression.

We first combine the SDSS, 2QZ\nand 2SLAQ surveys to form a survey of ~60000 QSOs.

Here we focus on the secondary anisotropies resulting from\nthe thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect; the amplitude of which depends\ncritically on the average thermal pressure profile of galaxy groups and\nclusters. To this end, we use a suite of SPH simulations that include radiative\ncooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and energetic feedback from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). We examine in detail how the pressure profile depends on\ncluster radius, mass, and redshift and provide an empirical fitting function.\nWe employ three different approaches for calculating the tSZ power spectrum: an\nanalytical approach that uses our pressure profile fit, a semi-analytical\nmethod of pasting our pressure fit onto simulated clusters, and a direct\nnumerical integration of our simulated volumes. We demonstrate that the\ndetailed structure of the intracluster medium and cosmic web affect the tSZ\npower spectrum.

We assess\nthe possibility to use lensed SNe to put constraints on the mass models of\ngalaxy clusters and the Hubble parameter at high redshift. Due to the standard\ncandle nature of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observational information on the\nlensing magnification from an intervening galaxy cluster can be used to\nconstrain the model for the cluster mass distribution. A statistical analysis\nusing parametric cluster models was performed to investigate the possible\nimprovements from lensed SNe Ia for the accurately modeled galaxy cluster A1689\nand the less well constrained cluster A2204. Time delay measurements obtained\nfrom SNe lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure\nthe Hubble parameter. For a survey of A1689 we estimate the expected rate of\ndetectable SNe Ia and of multiply imaged SNe. The velocity dispersion and core\nradius of the main cluster potential show strong correlations with the\npredicted magnifications and can therefore be constrained by observations of\nSNe Ia in background galaxies. This technique proves especially powerful for\ngalaxy clusters with only few known multiple image systems. The main\nuncertainty for measurements of the Hubble parameter from the time delay of\nstrongly lensed SNe is due to cluster model uncertainties. For the extremely\nwell modeled cluster A1689, a single time delay measurement could be used to\ndetermine the Hubble parameter with a precision of ~ 10%. We conclude that\nobservations of SNe Ia behind galaxy clusters can be used to improve the mass\nmodeling of the large scale component of galaxy clusters and thus the\ndistribution of dark matter.

Low-significance candidate high-z clusters are followed up with the\nseven-channel imager GROND (Gamma-Ray Burst Optical and Near-Infrared Detector)\nthat is mounted at a 2m-class telescope. ... The test case is XMMU\nJ0338.7+0030, suggested to be at z~1.45+/-0.15 from the analysis of the z-H vs\nH colour-magnitude diagram obtained from the follow-up imaging. Later VLT-FORS2\nspectroscopy enabled us to identify four members, which set this cluster at\nz=1.097+/-0.002. To reach a better knowledge of its galaxy population, we\nobserved XMMU J0338.7+0030 with GROND for about 6 hr. The publicly available\nphoto-z code le Phare was used.

The\nphoto-z's of the three imaged spectroscopic members yield z=1.12+/-0.09. The\nspatial distribution and the properties of the GROND sources with a photo-z in\nthe range 1.01 - 1.23 confirm the correspondence of the X-ray source with a\ngalaxy over-density at a significance of at least 4.3 sigma.

The disk is proposed to\nhave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its\nenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal\ndebris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed\ncloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the\nexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters\nmay be as high as $\\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by\nthe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular\nmomentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation\nradius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may\nplace gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporation\nwind that forms the cloud at every orbit. This model predicts that, after the\ncloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smaller\nunresolved cloud will gradually grow around the star on the same present orbit.\nAn increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also be detectable when the\nperibothron is reached.

The measurements of proper motion and\nparallax allow for a precise subtraction of the kinematic contribution to the\nobserved orbital decay; this results in a significant measurement of the\nintrinsic orbital decay: (-25.9 +/- 3.2) \\times 10^{-15} s/s. This is\nconsistent with the orbital decay from the emission of gravitational waves\npredicted by general relativity, (-27.7 +1.5/-1.9) \\times 10^{-15} s/s (...).\nThis agreement introduces a tight upper limit on dipolar gravitational wave\nemission, a prediction of most alternative theories of gravity for asymmetric\nbinary systems such as this. We use this limit to derive the most stringent\nconstraints ever on a wide class of gravity theories, where gravity involves a\nscalar field contribution.

In the case of high-dimensional data sets, though, interactive\nexploratory data visualization can give far more insight than an approach where\ndata processing and statistical analysis are followed, rather than accompanied,\nby visualization. This paper attempts to charts a course toward \"linked view\"\nsystems, where multiple views of high-dimensional data sets update live as a\nresearcher selects, highlights, or otherwise manipulates, one of several open\nviews. For example, imagine a researcher looking at a 3D volume visualization\nof simulated or observed data, and simultaneously viewing statistical displays\nof the data set's properties (such as an x-y plot of temperature vs. velocity,\nor a histogram of vorticities). Then, imagine that when the researcher selects\nan interesting group of points in any one of these displays, that the same\npoints become a highlighted subset in all other open displays.

As the tSZ signal is strongly non-Gaussian, higher\nmoments of tSZ maps contain useful information. We first calculate the\ndependence of the tSZ moments on cosmological parameters, finding that higher\nmoments scale more steeply with sigma_8 and are sourced by more massive galaxy\nclusters. Taking advantage of the different dependence of the variance and\nskewness on cosmological and astrophysical parameters, we construct a\nstatistic, |<T^3>|/<T^2>^1.4, which cancels much of the dependence on cosmology\n(i.e., sigma_8) yet remains sensitive to the astrophysics of intracluster gas\n(in particular, to the gas fraction in low-mass clusters). Constraining the ICM\nastrophysics using this statistic could break the well-known degeneracy between\ncosmology and gas physics in tSZ measurements, allowing for tight constraints\non cosmological parameters. Although detailed simulations will be needed to\nfully characterize the accuracy of this technique, we provide a first\napplication to data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole\nTelescope.

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation. Higher resolution imaging of stars with excesses is the best way to\nrule out galaxy confusion and identify more reliable disk candidates among\nKepler stars.

In this paper we discuss two approaches to reduce these costs: (i)\nbased on computational strategies, and (ii) based on the properties and on the\ntopology of the chemical network. The first methods are more robust, while the\nsecond are meant to be giving important information on the structure of large,\ncomplex networks. To this aim we first discuss the numerical solvers for\nintegrating the system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) associated with\nthe chemical network.

The\ntidal stirring model posits that late-type, rotationally-supported dwarfs\nresembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies can transform into dSphs\nvia interactions with Milky Way-sized hosts. Using collisionless N-body\nsimulations, we investigate for the first time how tidal stirring depends on\nthe dark matter (DM) density distribution in the central stellar region of the\nprogenitor disky dwarf. Specifically, we explore various asymptotic inner\nslopes gamma of the dwarf DM density profiles (rho \\propto r^{-gamma} as r ->\n0). For a given orbit inside the primary, rotationally-supported dwarfs\nembedded in DM halos with core-like density distributions (gamma = 0.2) and\nmild density cusps (gamma = 0.6) demonstrate a substantially enhanced\nlikelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs compared to their\ncounterparts with steeper DM density profiles (gamma = 1). Such shallow DM\ndistributions are akin to those of observed dIrrs, highlighting tidal stirring\nas a plausible model for the LG morphology-density relation. When gamma <1, a\nsingle pericentric passage can induce dSph formation and disky dwarfs on\nlow-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are able to transform into dSphs;\nthese new results allow the tidal stirring model to explain the existence of\nvirtually all known dSphs across a wide range of distances from their hosts. A\nsubset of rotationally-supported dwarfs with gamma <1 are eventually disrupted\nby the primary; those that survive as dSphs are generally on orbits that are\nbiased towards lower eccentricities and/or larger pericenters relative to those\nof typical CDM satellites. The latter could explain the rather peculiar orbits\nof several classic LG dSphs such as Fornax, Leo I, Tucana, and Cetus. \n\n"}

The combination of the latter two factors is often expressed in terms\nof $n_{\\rm eff}$ -- the \"effective number density of galaxies used for weak\nlensing measurements\".

We investigate how the\nfollowing factors affect the resulting $n_{\\rm eff}$ of the survey with\ndetailed simulations: (1) survey time, (2) shear measurement algorithm, (3)\nalgorithm for combining multiple exposures, (4) inclusion of data from multiple\nfilter bands, (5) redshift distribution of the galaxies, and (6) masking and\nblending. For the first time, we quantify in a general weak lensing analysis\npipeline the sensitivity of $n_{\\rm eff}$ to the above factors.\n  We find that with current weak lensing algorithms, expected distributions of\nobserving parameters, and all lensing data ($r$- and $i$-band, covering 18,000\ndegree$^{2}$ of sky) for LSST, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx37$ arcmin$^{-2}$ before\nconsidering blending and masking, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx31$ arcmin$^{-2}$ when\nrejecting seriously blended galaxies and $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx26$ arcmin$^{-2}$\nwhen considering an additional 15% loss of galaxies due to masking.

These discoveries motivate the hypothesis that the IMF may\nvary (possibly very slightly) across galaxies and across components of\nindividual galaxies (e.g. bulges vs discs). In this paper we use a sample of 19\nlate-type strong gravitational lenses from the SWELLS survey to investigate the\nIMFs of the bulges and discs in late-type galaxies. We perform a joint analysis\nof the galaxies' total masses (constrained by strong gravitational lensing) and\nstellar masses (constrained by optical and near-infrared colours in the context\nof a stellar population synthesis [SPS] model, up to an IMF normalisation\nparameter).

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise.

For uniform plasma in\nthermal balance (turbulent heating balancing radiative cooling), cold gas\ncondenses only if the cooling time is shorter than the mixing time.

Here we present a general framework (PCA\nmarginalization) to consistently incorporate systematic effects into a\nlikelihood analysis. This technique naturally accounts for degeneracies between\nnuisance parameters and can substantially reduce the dimension of the parameter\nspace that needs to be sampled. As a practical application, we apply PCA\nmarginalization to account for baryonic physics as an uncertainty in cosmic\nshear tomography. Specifically, we use CosmoLike to run simulated likelihood\nanalyses on three independent sets of numerical simulations, each covering a\nwide range of baryonic scenarios differing in cooling, star formation, and\nfeedback mechanisms. We simulate a Stage III (Dark Energy Survey) and Stage IV\n(Large Synoptic Survey Telescope/Euclid) survey and find a substantial bias in\ncosmological constraints if baryonic physics is not accounted for. We then show\nthat PCA marginalization (employing at most 3 to 4 nuisance parameters) removes\nthis bias. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain robust, precise\nconstraints on the dark energy equation of state even in the presence of large\nlevels of systematic uncertainty in astrophysical processes. We conclude that\nthe PCA marginalization technique is a powerful, general tool for addressing\nmany of the challenges facing the precision cosmology program. \n\n"}

Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully\nquantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star\ncluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power.

We found that the two optimal-filter\nluminosities extract virial information (size and virial velocity of the broad\nline region, BLR) from the spectra, justifying their usage in this empirical BH\nmass estimator. The major advantages of this new recipe over traditional SE BH\nmass estimators utilizing continuum luminosity and broad line width are: 1) it\nhas a smaller intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex calibrated against RM masses; 2) it\nis extremely simple to use in practice, without any need to decompose the\nspectrum; 3) it produces unambiguous and highly repeatable results even with\nlow signal-to-noise spectra. The combination of the two luminosities can also\ncancel out, to some extent, systematic luminosity errors potentially introduced\nby uncertainties in distance or flux calibration. In addition, we recalibrated\nthe traditional SE mass estimators using broad Hbeta full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) and monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100A (L_5100). We found that\nusing the best-fit slopes on FWHM and L_5100 (derived from fitting the BLR\nradius-luminosity relation and the correlation between rms line dispersion and\nSE FWHM, respectively) rather than simple assumptions (e.g., 0.5 for L_5100 and\n2 for FWHM) leads to more precise SE mass estimates, improving the intrinsic\nscatter from 0.41 dex to 0.36 dex with respect to the RM masses. We compared\ndifferent estimators and discussed their applications to the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) quasar sample.

Determination of the fundamental interactions that\ngovern matter under such extreme conditions is one of the major unsolved\nproblems of modern physics, and -- since it is impossible to replicate these\nconditions on Earth -- a major scientific motivation for SKA.

We find that a magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a\nsupernova-driven interstellar medium, which features a flow of hot gas from the\ndisk to the halo, reproduces the temperature but significantly underpredicts\nthe 0.5-2.0 keV surface brightness of the halo (by two orders of magnitude, if\nwe compare the median predicted and observed values). This is true for versions\nof the model with and without an interstellar magnetic field. We consider\ndifferent reasons for the discrepancy between the model predictions and the\nobservations. We find taking into account overionization in cooled halo plasma,\nwhich could in principle boost the predicted X-ray emission, is unlikely in\npractice to bring the predictions in line with the observations.

Global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,\nrelative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the sky\nmodel, and best-fit values are tabulated.

These models provide excellent\nfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK\nover 93% of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional\nerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky.

Traditionally, the emission lines employed\nare in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is\nlimited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in\nhelium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical\nparameters, such as temperature and density. Recently, Izotov, Thuan, & Guseva\n(2014) have pioneered adding the He 10830 infrared emission line in helium\nabundance determinations. The strong electron density dependence of He 10830\nmakes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking the\ndegeneracy with temperature. We revisit our analysis of the dataset published\nby Izotov, Thuan, & Stasinska (2007) and incorporate the newly available\nobservations of He 10830 by scaling them using the observed-to-theoretical\nPaschen-gamma ratio. The solutions are better constrained, in particular for\nelectron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving the\nmodel fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening for\nquality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95% confidence level cut.\nFurthermore, the addition of He 10830 decreases the uncertainty on the helium\nabundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from\n10-80%.

Instead, the abundance is set by\nannihilation to light hidden sector states that carry no charges under the SM\ngauge interactions. In such a scenario the constraints from direct and indirect\ndetection, and from collider searches for dark matter, can easily be satisfied.\nThe masses of such light hidden states can be protected by symmetry if they are\nNambu-Goldstone bosons, fermions, or gauge bosons. These states can then\ncontribute to the cosmic energy density as dark radiation, leading to\nobservable signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Furthermore,\ndepending on whether or not the light hidden sector states self-interact, the\nfraction of the total energy density that free-streams is either decreased or\nincreased, leading to characteristic effects on both the scalar and tensor\ncomponents of the CMB anisotropy that allows these two cases to be\ndistinguished.

There are two main technical\nchallenges. First, to get significant acceleration, the sail must be both\nextremely light weight and capable of operating at high intensities of the\nincident beam and the resulting high temperatures. Second, the transmitter must\nemit high power beams through huge apertures, many kilometers in diameter, in\norder to focus radiation on the sail across the long distances needed to\nachieve high final speeds. Existing proposals for the sail use carbon or\naluminum films, but aluminum is limited by a low melting point, and both have\nlow mechanical strength requiring either a distributed payload or complex\nrigging. We propose here a graphene sail, which offers high absorption per unit\nweight, high temperature operation, and the mechanical strength to support\nsimple rigging to a lumped mass payload. For the transmitter, existing\nproposals use a compact high power source, and focus the energy with a large\n(hundreds to thousands of km) space-based lens. Existing optical drive\nproposals also require launch from the outer solar system, have severe pointing\nrestrictions, and require difficult maneuvering of the beam source. Instead we\npropose an active Fresnel lens, allowing smaller apertures of less mass, easier\npointing with fewer restrictions, and probe launch from the inner solar system.\nThe technologies for both the sail and the transmitter are already under\ndevelopment for other reasons. Worked examples, physically smaller and less\nmassive than those suggested so far, range from a 1kg payload launched to 10\\%\nof the speed of light by a transmitter only 25 times the mass of ISS, to a\nlarger system that can launch a 1000 kg payload to 50\\% of the speed of light. \n\n"}

It\nconsists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the\nentire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are\nassigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of\ntwo sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the\nsky.

The main improvements are the use of\nmore and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more\ndetailed foreground and instrumental models, allowing further checks and\nenhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a\nlarger sky fraction. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further\nreduce uncertainties. For temperature, we perform an analysis of end-to-end\ninstrumental simulations fed into the data processing pipeline; this does not\nreveal biases from residual instrumental systematics. The $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model continues to offer a very good fit to Planck data. The slope\nof primordial scalar fluctuations, $n_s$, is confirmed smaller than unity at\nmore than 5{\\sigma} from Planck alone.

The origin of these tidal features is discussed,\neither coming from a satellite infall or caused by residuals of an ancient,\ngas-rich major merger. By modelling the formation of the peculiar features\nobserved in the NGC 4013 halo, we investigate their origin. By using GADGET -2\nwith implemented gas cooling, star formation, and feedback, we have modelled\nthe overall NGC 4013 galaxy and its associated halo features. A gas-rich major\nmerger occurring 2.7-4.6 Gyr ago succeeds in reproducing the NGC 4013 galaxy\nproperties, including all the faint stellar features, strong gas warp,\nboxy-shaped halo and vertical 3.6 mum luminosity distribution. High gas\nfractions in the progenitors are sufficient to reproduce the observed thin and\nthick discs, with a small bulge fraction, as observed.

Hence, a very large number of galaxies is required in\norder to average over their individual properties and to isolate the weak\nlensing cosmic shear signal. If this `shape noise' can be reduced, significant\nadvances in the power of a weak lensing surveys can be expected. This paper\ndescribes a general method for extracting the probability distributions of\nparameters from catalogues of data using Voronoi cells, which has several\napplications, and has synergies with Bayesian hierarchical modelling\napproaches. This allows us to construct a probability distribution for the\nvariance of the intrinsic ellipticity as a function of galaxy property using\nonly photometric data, allowing a reduction of shape noise. As a proof of\nconcept the method is applied to the CFHTLenS survey data. We use this approach\nto investigate trends of galaxy properties in the data and apply this to the\ncase of weak lensing power spectra. \n\n"}

Similarly, a direct\ncross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an\nanomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or\nWMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential\nexplanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS\ngalaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred. Simulations are used\nin the CFHTLenS pipeline to calibrate such biases, but no data-driven\nconstraints have been presented to date. In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al.

An extrapolation of the relationship\nbetween black hole (BH) and bulge mass would predict that the sample of z>6\ngalaxies host relatively massive BHs (>1e6 Msun), if one assumes that total\nstellar mass is a good proxy for bulge mass. At least a few of these BHs should\nbe luminous enough to be detectable in the 4Ms CDFS.

Progressing further in dark matter physics requires being able\nto understand structure formation in the non-linear regime, both for CDM and\nits alternatives. This short note describes a calculation, and accompanying\ncode, WarmAndFuzzy, incorporating the popular models of warm and fuzzy dark\nmatter (WDM and FDM) into the standard halo model to compute the non-linear\nmatter power spectrum. The FDM halo model power spectrum has not been computed\nbefore. The FDM implementation models ultralight axions and other scalar fields\nwith $m_a\\approx 10^{-22}\\text{ eV}$.

The halo model shows that differences\nbetween WDM, FDM, and CDM survive at low redshifts in the quasi-linear and\nfully non-linear regimes.

The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The\nlatter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface\ndensity profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first\nplace by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution\nis governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc.

Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including\nthe Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled\nwith the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their\nobservation. Extragalactic systems contain multiple stellar populations with\ncomplex star formation histories. However, their study is mainly based upon the\nprinciples of simple stellar populations (SSP). Hence, it is critical to\nexamine the validity of SSP models. AIMS. This work aims to empirically test\nthe validity of SSP models. This is done by comparing SSP models against\nobservations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the\ndetermination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.\nIntegral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC\n3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and\nunresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed\nusing the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of\nstrong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties\nfrom the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is\nanalysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity\ndetermination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population,\nthe derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those\nderived from resolved stars. RESULTS. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC\n3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range\nof those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including\nother estimates found in the literature.

Space-based detectors will observe\nlong-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to their\nlocation on the sky, using Doppler shifts of the signal to locate the sky\nposition. While these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector or\nnetwork, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards one\nexpects from electromagnetic astronomy. Another technique that can be used for\nsky localization is null-stream pointing. In the case where multiple\nindependent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitational\nwaves will appear in each of the data streams. Taking the signals from multiple\ndetectors in linear combination with each other, one finds there is a two\nparameter family of coefficients that effectively null the gravitational wave\nsignal; those two parameters are the angles that define the sky location of the\nsource. This technique has been demonstrated for a network of ground-based\ninterferometric observatories, and for 6-link space interferometers.

It is determined by the integral over the halo mass function\nmultiplied by the total pressure content of clusters, and further convolved by\nthe cluster gas pressure profile. It has been shown that various feedback\neffects can change significantly the pressure profile, possibly even pushing\nthe gas out to the virial radius and beyond, strongly affecting the tSZ power\nspectrum at high $l$. Energetics arguments and SZ-halo mass scaling relations\nsuggest feedback is unlikely to significantly change the total pressure\ncontent, making low $l$ tSZ power spectrum more robust against feedback\neffects. Furthermore, the separation between the cosmic infrared background\n(CIB) and tSZ is more reliable at low $l$. Low $l$ modes are however probing\nvery small volumes, giving rise to very large non-gaussian sampling variance\nerrors. By computing the trispectrum contribution we identify $90<l<350$ as the\nminimum variance scale where the combined error is minimized.

Recent studies also show that this obscuring material can even extend\nat galactic scales due to debris and/or mergers. In standard unified models the\ndifferent AGN types are expected to show similar galaxy environments. We aim to\ninvestigate properties and environment of obscured and unobscured AGNs selected\nfrom the MUSYC survey, in order to test the unified model and evolutionary\nscenarios. The sample of AGNs was selected from images obtained with the IRAC\nCamera, based on their MIR colors. We selected two samples of AGNs with\nredshifts in the range $1\\le z \\le 2$ and $M_v\\leq -$21: obscured and\nunobscured AGNs by means of a simple optical-MIR color cut criterion. We find\nthat obscured AGNs are intrinsically optically faint in the R band, suggesting\nthat luminous IR-selected AGNs have a significant dust extinction. From a\ncross-correlation with several X-ray surveys, we find that the majority of the\nAGNs have X-ray luminosities similar to those found in Seyfert-like galaxies.\nNeighbouring galaxies located close to ($\\sim$200 kpc) obscured AGNs tend to\nhave redder colors, compared to the local environment of unobscured AGNs.\nResults obtained from a KS test show that the two color distributions are\ndifferent at $\\sim$95% confidence level. We find that obscured AGNs are located\nin denser local galaxy environments compared to the unobscured AGN sample. Our\nresults suggest that AGN obscuration can occur at galactic scales, possibly due\nto galaxy interactions or mergers, and that the simple unified model based\nsolely on the local torus orientation may not be sufficient to explain all the\nobservations. \n\n"}

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run. \n\n"}

We select\ncompact massive (M > 5x10^10 M_sun) galaxies within the redshift range of\n0.2<z<0.6. The large volume sampled allows to decrease the effect of cosmic\nvariance that has hampered the calculation of the number density for this\nenigmatic population in many previous studies. We undertake an exhaustive\nanalysis in an effort to untangle the various findings inherent to the diverse\ndefinition of compactness present in the literature. We find that the absolute\nnumber of compact galaxies is very dependent on the adopted definition and can\nchange up to a factor of >10. We systematically measure a factor of ~5 more\ncompacts at the same redshift than what was previously reported on smaller\nfields with HST imaging, which are more affected by cosmic variance.

Although previous numerical simulations have indicated\nthat most of the missing baryons reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nWarm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), it is generally very difficult to detect\nsignatures from such a diffuse gas. In this work, we focus on the hyperfine\ntransition of neutral hydrogen (HI) called 21-cm line as a tool to trace the\nWHIM. For the purpose, we first construct the map of the 21-cm signals by using\nthe data provided by the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation\nproject, Illustris, in which detailed processes affecting the dynamical and\nthermal evolution of the WHIM are implemented. From the comparison with the\nconstructed 21-cm signal map with the expected noise level of the Square\nKilometre Array phase 1 mid-frequency instrument (SKA1-mid), we find that the\n21-cm signals from the filamentary structures at redshifts z=0.5-3 are\ndetectable with the SKA1-mid if we assume the angular resolution of\n\\Delta\\theta > 10 arcmin and the observing time of t_obs > 100 hours.

Using data\nfrom SDSS, we explore the evidence for such a feature in the density profiles\nof galaxy clusters and investigate the connection between this feature and a\npossible phase space boundary.

We find evidence of an abrupt change in the galaxy colors that\ncoincides with the location of the steepening of the density profile. Since\ngalaxies are likely to be quenched of star formation and turn red inside of\nclusters, this change in the galaxy color distribution can be interpreted as\nthe transition from an infalling regime to a collapsed regime.

The redshift evolution of $v_\\rm{max}$\n($v_\\rm{out}$) and $\\eta$ is consistent with the galaxy-size evolution and the\nlocal velocity-SFR surface density relation, and explained by high-gas\nfractions in high-redshift massive galaxies, which is supported by recent radio\nobservations.

Although the LG mostly reionizes in\nan inside-out fashion, the final 40 per cent of its ionization shows some\noutside influence. For the LG satellites, we find no evidence that their\nredshift of reionization is related to the present-day mass of the satellite or\nthe distance from the central galaxy.

One problem that plagues the use of this tool in the era of\nlarge-scale sky surveys is that the bright galaxies that are selected for\nspectroscopic observation do not have properties that match those of (far more\nnumerous) dimmer galaxies; thus, ill-designed empirical methods that produce\naccurate and precise redshift estimates for the former generally will not\nproduce good estimates for the latter. In this paper, we provide a principled\nframework for generating conditional density estimates (i.e. photometric\nredshift PDFs) that takes into account selection bias and the covariate shift\nthat this bias induces. We base our approach on the assumption that the\nprobability that astronomers label a galaxy (i.e. determine its spectroscopic\nredshift) depends only on its measured (photometric and perhaps other)\nproperties x and not on its true redshift. With this assumption, we can\nexplicitly write down risk functions that allow us to both tune and compare\nmethods for estimating importance weights (i.e. the ratio of densities of\nunlabeled and labeled galaxies for different values of x) and conditional\ndensities.

Interestingly, we identify a tight relation of SFR/dotMh-Mh showing\nno significant evolution beyond 0.15 dex in this wide-mass range over z~4-7.\nThis weak evolution suggests that the SFR/dotMh-Mh relation is a fundamental\nrelation in high-redshift galaxy formation whose star formation activities are\nregulated by the dark matter mass assembly. Assuming this fundamental relation,\nwe calculate the cosmic SFR densities (SFRDs) over z=0-10 (a.k.a. Madau-Lilly\nplot). The cosmic SFRD evolution based on the fundamental relation agrees with\nthe one obtained by observations, suggesting that the cosmic SFRD increase from\nz~10 to 4-2 (decrease from z~4-2 to 0) is mainly driven by the increase of the\nhalo abundance (the decrease of the accretion rate). \n\n"}

As\nfield galaxies have an H I covering fraction of ~100% at similar radii, the\ndearth of CGM H I in our data indicates that the cluster environment has\neffectively stripped or overionized the gaseous halos of these cluster\ngalaxies. Second, we assess the contribution of warm-hot (10^5 - 10^6 K) gas to\nthe ICM as traced by O VI and broad Ly-alpha (BLA) absorption.

In this work, we investigate a bias to CMB lensing reconstruction\nfrom temperature anisotropies due to the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ)\neffect, that is, the Doppler shift of CMB photons induced by Compton-scattering\noff moving electrons. The kSZ signal yields biases due to both its own\nintrinsic non-Gaussianity and its non-zero cross-correlation with the CMB\nlensing field (and other fields that trace the large-scale structure). This\nkSZ-induced bias affects both the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum and its\ncross-correlation with low-redshift tracers. Furthermore, it cannot be removed\nby multifrequency foreground separation techniques because the kSZ effect\npreserves the blackbody spectrum of the CMB. While statistically negligible for\ncurrent datasets, we show that it will be important for upcoming surveys, and\nfailure to account for it can lead to large biases in constraints on neutrino\nmasses or the properties of dark energy. For a Stage 4 CMB experiment, the bias\ncan be as large as $\\approx$ 15% or 12% in cross-correlation with LSST galaxy\nlensing convergence or galaxy overdensity maps, respectively, when the maximum\ntemperature multipole used in the reconstruction is $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 4000$,\nand about half of that when $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 3000$.

For example, the summed mass of neutrinos will be\ndetermined to an accuracy of 17 meV combining CORE lensing and CMB two-point\ninformation with contemporaneous BAO measurements, three times smaller than the\nminimum total mass allowed by neutrino oscillations. In the search for B-mode\npolarization from primordial gravitational waves with CORE, lens-induced\nB-modes will dominate over instrument noise, limiting constraints on the\ngravitational wave power spectrum amplitude.

However, a perennial problem has been the\nmapping of optical 'richness' measurements on to total cluster mass.

Although\nmainly aimed at the study of larger-scale structures, the Planck lensing\nreconstruction can yield nearly unbiased results for stacked clusters on\narcminute scales.

Upon interacting with\nEarth's atmosphere, these events produce extensive particle showers which can\nbe detected by cameras on mobile phones.

The flexibility is due to a modular architecture, which allows\nchanges and customizations to the pipeline, and relegates the\ninstrument-specific parts to a single module. At the core of the data reduction\nis the transformation from observed pixel coordinates (x, y) to rectified\ncoordinates (lambda, gamma). This transformation consists in the polynomial\nfunctions lambda(x,y) and gamma(x,y) that are derived from arc or sky emission\nlines and slit edge tracing, respectively. The use of 2D transformations allows\none to wavelength calibrate and rectify the data using just one interpolation\nstep.

Given the low incidence of DLAs, we find that a\npopulation of FRBs at z=2 will incur DM(z=2)=0.01 pc/cm^3 on average, with a\n99% c.l. upper bound of 0.22 pc/cm^3. Assuming that turbulence of the ISM in\nexternal galaxies is qualitatively similar to our Galaxy, we estimate that the\nangular broadening of an FRB by intersecting galaxies is negligible\n($\\theta<0.1$mas). The temporal broadening is also predicted to be small, $\\tau\n\\approx 0.3$ms for a z=1 galaxy intersecting a z=2 FRB for an observing\nfrequency of $\\nu=1$GHz. Even with $\\nu=600$MHz, the fraction of sightlines\nbroadened beyond 25ms is only approximately 0.1%. We conclude that gas within\nthe ISM of intervening galaxies has a minor effect on the detection of FRBs and\ntheir resultant DM distributions.

Yet determining this time is important for precision tests of the\ngeneral theory of relativity that compare an observed signal with quasinormal\nmode descriptions of the ringdown, such as tests of the no-hair theorem. We\npresent an algorithmic method to analyze the choice of ringdown start time in\nthe observed waveform. This method is based on determining how close the strong\nfield is to a Kerr black hole (Kerrness). Using numerical relativity\nsimulations, we characterize the Kerrness of the strong-field region close to\nthe black hole using a set of local, gauge-invariant geometric and algebraic\nconditions that measure local isometry to Kerr. We produce a map that\nassociates each time in the gravitational waveform with a value of each of\nthese Kerrness measures; this map is produced by following outgoing null\ncharacteristics from the strong and near-field regions to the wave zone.

It has been known that the\nescape fractions estimated by observations and numerical simulations show a\nlarge diversity. However, the origins of the diversity are still uncertain. In\nthis work, to understand what quantities of galaxies are responsible for\ncontrolling the escape fraction, we numerically evaluate the escape fraction by\nperforming ray-tracing calculation with simplified disc galaxy models.

The dark\nmatter particle candidates are axion-like, with masses of order eV and strong\nself-interactions. They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the\ncentral regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn\ncouple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable\nchoice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.\nIn this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological\nconsequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo\nprofile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we\nshow how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can\nbe reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive\nhigh surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law. We\nfinally point out other expected differences with Milgrom's law, in particular\nin dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies, tidal dwarf galaxies, and globular\nclusters, whose Milgromian or Newtonian behavior depends on the position with\nrespect to the superfluid core of the host galaxy. We also expect ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies within galaxy clusters to have velocities slightly above the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation. Finally, we note that, in this framework, photons and\ngravitons follow the same geodesics, and that galaxy-galaxy lensing, probing\nlarger distances within galaxy halos than rotation curves, should follow\npredictions closer to the standard cosmological model than those of Milgrom's\nlaw. \n\n"}

Polarized dust foregrounds Abstract: The study of polarized dust emission has become entwined with the analysis of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization.

We\npresent Planck EE, BB, and TE power spectra of dust polarization at 353 GHz for\nsix nested sky regions covering from 24 to 71 % of the sky. We present\npower-law fits to the angular power spectra, yielding evidence for\nstatistically significant variations of the exponents over sky regions and a\ndifference between the values for the EE and BB spectra. The TE correlation and\nE/B power asymmetry extend to low multipoles that were not included in earlier\nPlanck polarization papers. We also report evidence for a positive TB dust\nsignal. Combining data from Planck and WMAP, we determine the amplitudes and\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of polarized foregrounds, including the\ncorrelation between dust and synchrotron polarized emission, for the six sky\nregions as a function of multipole. This quantifies the challenge of the\ncomponent separation procedure required for detecting the reionization and\nrecombination peaks of primordial CMB B modes. The SED of polarized dust\nemission is fit well by a single-temperature modified blackbody emission law\nfrom 353 GHz to below 70 GHz.

Uncertainties include the instrument\ndetector band, which could systematically change across the focal plane, as\nwell as the calibration of the instrument used to measure the bands. A\npotentially major effect is time-dependent gain and band uncertainties caused\nby atmospheric fluctuations. More specifically, changes in atmospheric\nconditions lead to frequency-dependent changes in the atmospheric transmission\nwhich, in turn, leads to variations in the effective gain and central frequency\nof the instrument's bandpass. Using atmospheric modeling software and ACTPol\nbandpasses, we simulate the expected variations in band gain and central\nfrequency for 20, 40, 90, 150, and 240 GHz bands as a function of precipitable\nwater vapor, observing angle, and ground temperature. Combining these effects\nenables us to set maximum and minimum limits on the expected uncertainties in\nband gain and central frequency over the course of a full observing season.

Abstract: A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle.\nIntroduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally\nhigh-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities.\nArgon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the\npurge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses\nthrough materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact\nwith the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation. \n\n"}

In this regime, foreground contamination to the temperature map\nproduces significant lensing biases, which cannot be fully controlled by\nmulti-frequency component separation, masking or bias hardening. In this\nletter, we split the standard CMB lensing quadratic estimator into a new set of\noptimal \"multipole\" estimators. On large scales, these multipole estimators\nreduce to the known magnification and shear estimators, and a new shear B-mode\nestimator. We leverage the different symmetries of the lensed CMB and\nextragalactic foregrounds to argue that the shear-only estimator should be\napproximately immune to extragalactic foregrounds. We build a new method to\ncompute separately and without noise the primary, secondary and trispectrum\nbiases to CMB lensing from foreground simulations. Using this method, we\ndemonstrate that the shear estimator is indeed insensitive to extragalactic\nforegrounds, even when applied to a single-frequency temperature map\ncontaminated with CIB, tSZ, kSZ and radio point sources.

The errors add\nrandomly, before exponential divergence sets in, with exponentiation rate\nvirtually independent of $N$, but scale saturating as $\\sim 1/\\sqrt{N}$, in\nline with theoretical estimates presented. In a third phase, the growth rate is\ninitially driven by multiplicative enhancement of errors, as in the exponential\nstage. It is then qualitatively different for the phase space variables and\nmean field conserved quantities (energy and momentum); for the former, the\nerrors grow systematically through phase mixing, for the latter they grow\ndiffusively.

This is also true for\nangular momentum in the fixed stepsize runs, although the associated error\nthreshold is higher and the relaxation time smaller.

Among the 41 known quadruply-imaged quasars of the list, 26 have at\nleast one image in the Gaia Data Release 2, 12 of which are fully detected, 6\nhave three counterparts, 7 have two and 1 has only one. As expected, the\nmodeling of HE0435-1223 shows that the model parameters are significantly\nbetter constrained when using Gaia astrometry compared to HST astrometry, in\nparticular the relative positions of the background quasar source and the\ncentroid of the deflector. The Gaia sub-milliarcsecond astrometry also\nsignificantly reduces the parameter correlations. Besides providing an\nup-to-date list of multiply imaged quasars and their detection in the Gaia DR2,\nthis paper shows that more complex modeling scenarios will certainly benefit\nfrom Gaia sub-milliarcsecond astrometry. \n\n"}

These microresonators take the form of microwave\nSQUIDs that couple to Transition-Edge Sensors (TES) or Microwave Kinetic\nInductance Detectors (MKIDs). In principle, such arrays can be read out with\nvastly scalable software-defined radio using suitable FPGAs, ADCs and DACs. In\nthis work, we share plans and show initial results for SLAC Microresonator\nRadio Frequency (SMuRF) electronics, a next-generation control and readout\nsystem for superconducting microresonators. SMuRF electronics are unique in\ntheir implementation of specialized algorithms for closed-loop tone tracking,\nwhich consists of fast feedback and feedforward to each resonator's excitation\nparameters based on transmission measurements. Closed-loop tone tracking\nenables improved system linearity, a significant increase in sensor count per\nreadout line, and the possibility of overcoupled resonator designs for enhanced\ndynamic range.

The\nradial oxygen gradient calculated for the general PN population, which probes\nthe region between the Galactic center and out to $\\sim$28 kpc, is shallow,\nwith slope $\\sim$-0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous findings.

We identify PNe whose progenitor stars\nare younger than 1 Gyr (YPPNe), and those whose progenitor stars are older than\n7.5 Gyr (OPPNe), based on the comparison between evolutionary yields and\nelemental abundances of the PNe. By studying OPPNe and YPPNe separately we\nfound that: (i) The OPPNe oxygen gradient is shallower ($\\sim-0.015$ dex\nkpc$^{-1}$) than that derived from YPPNe ($\\sim-0.027$ dex kpc$^{-1}$); (ii)\nthe OPPNe inner radial distribution of oxygen is compatible with no gradient to\nthe radial extent of the thick disk population ($\\sim$10 kpc), similarly to\nwhat has been observed in thick disk stars; (iii) planetary nebulae (especially\nOPPNe) indicate that significant gradient slope is limited to Galactocentric\ndistances between $\\sim$10 to $\\sim$13.5 kpc, as observed for open clusters and\nfield stars.

Using nominal assumptions about the weak-lensing and x-ray mass\nprofiles, we find that the EG predictions (based on no dark matter) are\nacceptable fits only near the virial radius. In the cores and in the outskirts,\nthe mass profile shape differences allow us to confirm previous results that\nthe EG model can be ruled out at $>5\\sigma$. However, when we account for\nsystematic uncertainties in the observed weak-lensing and x-ray profiles, we\nfind good agreement for the EG predictions.

Using\nthe Bayesian X-ray Astronomy (BXA) package, we constrain redshift, column\ndensity, photon index and luminosity simultaneously. The redshift information\nprimarily comes from absorption edges in Compton-thin AGN, and from the Fe\nK$\\alpha$ fluorescent line in heavily obscured AGN.

This paper presents an extensive analysis of systematic effects,\nincluding the use of simulations to facilitate their removal and characterize\nthe residuals. The polarized data, which presented a number of known problems\nin the 2015 Planck release, are very significantly improved. Calibration, based\non the CMB dipole, is now extremely accurate and in the frequency range 100 to\n353 GHz reduces intensity-to-polarization leakage caused by calibration\nmismatch. The Solar dipole direction has been determined in the three lowest\nHFI frequency channels to within one arc minute, and its amplitude has an\nabsolute uncertainty smaller than $0.35\\mu$K, an accuracy of order $10^{-4}$.\nThis is a major legacy from the HFI for future CMB experiments.

This shift is dependent on the\nunderlying spectral energy of the source and the filter or bandpass through\nwhich it is observed. Wavelength-dependent refraction within a single passband\nis often referred to as differential chromatic refraction (DCR).

The Planck\ntemperature data tightly constrain the amplitude of local-type NG: $f_{\\rm\nNL}^{\\rm loc} = 2.5 \\pm 5.7$. Here, we compute previously-neglected foreground\nbiases in temperature-based $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ measurements, due to the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, gravitational lensing, the thermal and\nkinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and the cosmic infrared background. While\nstandard analyses already subtract a significant bias on $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$\ndue to the ISW-lensing bispectrum, many other secondary anisotropy terms are\npresent in the temperature bispectrum. We compute the dominant biases on\n$f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ arising from these signals. Most of the biases are\nnon-blackbody, and are thus reduced by multifrequency component separation\nmethods; however, recent analyses have found that extragalactic foregrounds are\npresent at non-negligible levels in the Planck component-separated maps.\nMoreover, the Planck FFP8 simulations do not include the foreground\ncorrelations that generate these biases. We compute the biases for individual\nfrequencies; some are comparable to the statistical error bar on $f_{\\rm\nNL}^{\\rm loc}$, even for the main CMB channels (100, 143, and 217 GHz). For\nfuture experiments, they greatly exceed the statistical error (considering\ntemperature only). Alternatively, the foreground contributions can be\nmarginalized over, but this leads to a non-negligible increase in the error bar\non $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$. A full assessment will require calculations in\ntandem with component separation, ideally using simulations. We also compute\nthese biases for equilateral and orthogonal NG, finding large effects for the\nlatter. We conclude that the search for primordial NG using Planck data may not\nyet be over. \n\n"}

Currently, our understanding of the GSS, in terms of both its geometry\nand its chemistry, results from either wide-field imaging probing only a few\nmagnitudes below the red giant branch tip, or deep imaging or spectroscopy of\nisolated regions.

Comparing the RC mean magnitude\nacross three fields at projected distances of 21, 52 and 80 kpc from M31, we\nfind a line of sight distance gradient identical to recent literature\nmeasurements in fields along the core.

Studying late-type galaxies should provide greater insight into the\nmutual growth of black holes and galaxies in more gas-rich environments. We\nhave used 40 spiral galaxies to establish how $M_{BH}$ scales with both the\ntotal stellar mass ($M_{*,tot}$) and the disk's stellar mass, having measured\nthe spheroid (bulge) stellar mass ($M_{*,sph}$) and presented the\n$M_{BH}$-$M_{*,sph}$ relation in Paper I. The relation involving $M_{*,tot}$\nmay be beneficial for estimating $M_{BH}$ either from pipeline data or at\nhigher redshift, conditions that are not ideal for the accurate isolation of\nthe bulge.

This steeper relation has\nconsequences for galaxy/black hole formation theories, simulations, and\npredicting black hole masses.

With Very Long Baseline Interferometry and working in\ndelay-delay rate space, where the contributions of pairs of images to the\ninterference pattern become localized, the scattering geometry and distribution\nof scattered images on the sky can be determined if a single,\nhighly-anisotropic scattering screen is responsible for the scintillation.\nHowever, many pulsars are subject to much more complex scattering environments\nwhere this method cannot be used. We present a novel technique to reconstruct\nthe scattered flux of the pulsar and solve for the scattering geometry in these\ncases by combining interferometric visibilities with cross-correlations of\nsingle-station intensities. This takes advantage of the fact that, considering\na single image pair in delay-delay rate space, the visibilities are sensitive\nto the sum of the image angular displacements, while the cross-correlated\nintensities are sensitive to the difference, so that their combination can be\nused to localize both images of the pair.

In many sources, CO$_2$ was found in\nthe `pure' crystalline form, as signatured by the splitting in the bending mode\nabsorption profile.

In this study, we measured both the temperature\ndependence and concentration dependence of CO$_2$ segregation in CO$_2$:H$_2$O\nmixtures, and found that no pure crystalline CO$_2$ forms if the CO$_2$:H$_2$O\nratio is less than 23%.

Partially motivated by a\nrecent suggestion that large non-isobaric clouds can `shatter' into tiny\ncloudlets, we revisit the linear theory to survey all possible regimes of\nthermal instability. We uncover seven regimes in total, one of which allows\nthree unstable condensation modes. Using the code Athena++, we determine the\nnumerical requirements to properly evolve small amplitude perturbations of the\nentropy mode into the nonlinear regime. Our 1D numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that for a typical AGN cooling function, the nonlinear evolution of\na single eigenmode in an isobarically unstable plasma involves increasingly\nlarger amplitude oscillations in cloud size, temperature and density as the\nwavelength increases. Such oscillations are the hallmark behavior of\nnon-isobaric multiphase gas dynamics and may be observable as correlations\nbetween changes in brightness and the associated periodic redshifts and\nblueshifts in systems that can be spatially resolved. Intriguingly, we discuss\nregimes and derive characteristic cloud sizes for which the saturation process\ngiving rise to these oscillations can be so energetic that the cloud may indeed\nbreak apart.

All the gauge and\nmixed gauge-gravitational anomalies are cancelled in this model with the\nintroduction of three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Unlike the conventional\nminimal U(1)$_X$ model, where a universal U(1)$_X$ charge of $-1$ is assigned\nto three RHNs, we consider an alternative charge assignment, namely, two RHNs\n($N_R^{1,2}$) have U(1)$_X$ charge $-4$ while one RHN ($N_R$) has a $+5$\ncharge.

These polarization effects, which are of the order of\n(v_t/c)^2 tau, (v_t/c) tau^2 and (kT_e/m_ec^2) tau^2, as well as the\npolarization due to the CMB quadrupole, were previously calculated by Sunyaev\nand Zel'dovich for the Rayleigh-Jeans region. We fully confirm their earlier\nresults and present exact frequency dependencies for all these effects. The\npolarization is considerably higher in the Wien region of the CMB spectrum. \n\n"}

Here, we review a number of these\nlinks. Our primary focus is on new CMB tests of inflation. We explain how the\ninflationary predictions for the geometry of the Universe and primordial\ndensity perturbations will be tested by CMB temperature fluctuations, and how\nthe gravitational waves predicted by inflation can be pursued with the CMB\npolarization. The CMB signatures of topological defects and primordial magnetic\nfields from cosmological phase transitions are also discussed. Furthermore, we\nreview current and future CMB constraints on various types of dark matter (e.g.\nmassive neutrinos, weakly interacting massive particles, axions, vacuum\nenergy), decaying particles, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe,\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays, exotic cosmological topologies, and other new\nphysics. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/9907254", "contents": "Title: Lensing Induced Cluster Signatures in Cosmic Microwave Background Abstract: We show that clusters of galaxies induce step-like wiggles on top of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB). The direction of the wiggle is parallel to\nthe large scale gradient of CMB allowing one to isolate the effect from other\nsmall scale fluctuations. The effect is sensitive to the deflection angle\nrather than its derivative (shear or magnification) and is thus tracing outer\nparts of the cluster with higher sensitivity than some other methods. A typical\namplitude of the effect is $10\\mu K (\\sigma_v/1400 kms^{-1})^2$ where\n$\\sigma_v$ is the velocity dispersion of the cluster and several $\\mu K$\nsignals extend out to a fraction of a degree. We derive the expressions for the\ntemperature profile for several simple parameterized cluster models and\nidentify some degeneracies between parameters. Finally, we discuss how to\nseparate this signal from other imprints on CMB using custom designed filters.\nDetection of this effect is within reach of the next generation of small scale\nCMB telescopes and could provide information about the cluster density profile\nbeyond the virial radius. \n\n"}

Following Barbieri et al, we entertain the\npossibility that a PGB exists with mass m_I intermediate between these two\nlimits, giving a partial contribution to DM. We evaluate the related effects on\nthe power spectrum of the matter density perturbations and on the cosmic\nmicrowave background and we derive the bounds on the density fraction, f_I, of\nthis intermediate field from current data, with room for a better sensitivity\non f_I in the near future. We also give a simple and unified analytic\ndescription of the free streaming effects both for an ultra-light scalar and\nfor a massive neutrino. \n\n"}
