Recent studies have shown that\nthe tunnelling conductance can be fit using a BCS-type density of states for a\nd-wave superconductor with a local quasiparticle scattering rate. The fit is\nmade with a scattering rate which varies linearly with energy and has a slope\nthat is positively correlated with the local value of the gap. We revisit a\nmodel of quasiparticle scattering by impurities and spin fluctuations which was\npreviously used to describe the lifetimes of nodal quasiparticles measured by\nangle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). We argue that the broadening of the local\ndensity of states is in general determined by the imaginary part of the\nself-energy of the system averaged over a small region. The size of this region\nis set by a mean free path which depends upon the energy. At low energies, this\nregion is found to be significantly larger than a gap \"patch\", so that the\ndensity of states measured by STS is homogeneous in this energy range.

In two dimensions this causal structure is invariant under the\nPoincare group if one gives up the spatial parity.

Making use of the increased\nbulk-sensitivity upon hard X-ray excitation, and comparing the results to data\ntaken at conventional VUV photoemission excitation energies, it is shown that\nthe BaFe$_2$As$_2$ cleavage surface provides an electrostatic environment that\nis slightly different to the bulk, most likely in the form of a modified\nMadelung potential. However, as the data argue against a different surface\ndoping level, and the surface-related features in the spectra are by no means\nas dominating as seen in systems such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$, we can conclude\nthat the itinerant, near-E$_F$ electronic states are almost unaffected by the\nexistence of the cleavage surface. Furthermore, exploiting the strong changes\nin photoionisation cross section between the Fe and As states across the wide\nphoton energy range employed, it is shown that the degree of energetic overlap\nbetween the iron 3d and arsenic 4p valence bands is particularly small at the\nFermi level, which can only mean a very low degree of hybridization between the\nFe 3d and As 4p states near and at E$_F$. Consequently, the itinerancy of the\ncharge carriers in this group of materials involves mainly the Fe 3d - Fe 3d\noverlap integrals with at best a minor role for the Fe 3d - As 4p hopping\nparameters, and that the states which support superconductivity upon doping are\nessentially of Fe 3d character. \n\n"}

However, N-body\nsimulations show that dark matter halos grow through a mixture of smooth\naccretion, violent encounters and fragmentations, and modeling halo collapse as\nspherical, or even as ellipsoidal, is a significant oversimplification. We\npropose that some of the physical complications inherent to a realistic\ndescription of halo formation can be included in the excursion set theory\nframework, at least at an effective level, by taking into account that the\ncritical value for collapse is not a fixed constant $\\delta_c$, as in the\nspherical collapse model, nor a fixed function of the variance $\\sigma$ of the\nsmoothed density field, as in the ellipsoidal collapse model, but rather is\nitself a stochastic variable, whose scatter reflects a number of complicated\naspects of the underlying dynamics.

This can be modeled by a\nsemiclassical expansion about a constant field for the vector potential, A_0,\nwhich is diagonal in color. We compute the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP by\nusing the Boltzmann equation in the presence of this background field. To\nleading, logarithmic order in weak coupling, the dominant diagrams are given by\nthe usual scattering processes of 2 -> 2 particles. For simplicity we also\nassume that both the number of colors and flavors are large. Near the critical\ntemperature T_c, where the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is small, the\noverall density of colored fields decreases according to their color\nrepresentation, with the density of quarks vanishes linearly with the loop, and\nthat of gluons, quadratically. This decrease in the overall density dominates\nchanges in the transport cross section. As a result, relative to that in the\nperturbative QGP, near T_c the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP is suppressed by\ntwo powers of the Polyakov loop. In a semiclassical expansion, the suppression\nof colored fields depends only upon which color representation they lie in, and\nnot upon their mass. That light and heavy quarks are suppressed in a common\nmanner may help to explain the behavior of charm quarks at RHIC. \n\n"}

This gap, also called minigap, facilitates\nexperimental detection of the pristine TS state and MFs at experimentally\naccessible temperatures T << E_{qp}.

TS states in such wires have an approximate chiral\nsymmetry supporting multiple near zero energy modes at each end leading to a\nminigap which can effectively vanish.

An even length\nchain, on the other hand, is gapped for any J_2>0.24J_1 and has the\nground-state momentum k=0. This gradual change in the ground-state wave\nfunction for chains with an odd number of sites is reflected in a dramatic\nmanner directly in the ground-state on-site magnetization as well as in the\nbi-partite von Neumann entanglement entropy. Our results are based on DMRG\ncalculations and variational calculations performed in a restricted Hilbert\nspace defined in the valence bond picture. In the vicinity of the point J_2=1/2\nJ_1, we expect the variational results to be very precise. \n\n"}

In this thesis such\nclassification is generalized to manifolds of arbitrary dimension and\nsignature. This is accomplished by interpreting the Weyl tensor as a linear\noperator on the bundle of p-forms, for any p, and computing the Jordan\ncanonical form of this operator. Throughout this work the spaces are assumed to\nbe complexified, so that different signatures correspond to different reality\nconditions, providing a unified treatment. A higher-dimensional generalization\nof the so-called self-dual manifolds is also investigated.\n  The most important result related to the Petrov classification is the\nGoldberg-Sachs theorem. Here are presented two partial generalizations of such\ntheorem valid in even-dimensional manifolds. One of these generalizations\nstates that certain algebraic constraints on the Weyl operator imply the\nexistence of an integrable maximally isotropic distribution. The other version\nof the generalized Goldberg-Sachs theorem states that these algebraic\nconstraints imply the existence of a null congruence whose optical scalars obey\nspecial restrictions.\n  On the pursuit of these results the spinorial formalism in 6 dimensions was\ndeveloped from the very beginning, using group representation theory.

A large number $N$ of light species\nin the theory, which occur in many string constructions, can amplify these\nproblems. One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,\nrequiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of\nlight species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain\naxion-driven inflation. Here we show that there is no such problem when we\ncorrectly renormalize models with many light species, taking the {\\it physical}\nPlanck scale to be $M^2_{pl} \\gtrsim N {\\cal M}_{UV}^2$, where ${\\cal M}_{UV}$\nis the cutoff for the QFT coupled to semiclassical quantum gravity. The number\nof light species then cancels out of the gravitational entropy of de Sitter or\nnear-de Sitter backgrounds at leading order. Working in detail with $N$ scalar\nfields in de Sitter space, renormalized to one loop order, we show that the\ngravitational entropy automatically obeys the covariant entropy bound.\nFurthermore, while the axion decay constant is a strong coupling scale for the\naxion dynamics, we show that it is {\\it not} in general the cutoff of 4d\nsemiclassical gravity.

In\nparticular, since the underlying state in the SP-MPS uses only Abelian\nsymmetries, one does not need the singlet embedding scheme for non-singlet\nstates, as normally employed in spin-adapted DMRG, to achieve a single\nconsistent variationally optimized state. (2) Due to the use of\n$|\\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\\rangle$ as its underlying state, the SP-MPS can be closely\nconnected to broken symmetry mean-field states. This allows to\nstraightforwardly generate the large number of broken symmetry guesses needed\nto explore complex electronic landscapes in magnetic systems. Further, this\nconnection can be exploited in the future development of quantum embedding\ntheories for open-shell systems.

For convincing conclusions, analysis methods are\nneeded which offer an unambiguous comparison between data and theory while\nallowing reliable estimates of uncertainties. The Matrix Element Method (MEM)\nis a Maximum Likelihood method which is especially tailored for signal searches\nand parameter estimation at colliders. The MEM has proven to be beneficial due\nto optimal use of the available information and a clean statistical\ninterpretation of the results. But it has a big drawback: In its original\nformulation, the likelihood calculation is intrinsically limited to the leading\nperturbative order in the coupling. Higher-order corrections improve the\naccuracy of theoretical predictions and allow for unambiguous field-theoretical\ninterpretation of the extracted information. In this work, the MEM\nincorporating corrections of next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD by defining\nevent weights suited for the likelihood calculation is presented for the first\ntime. These weights also enable the generation of unweighted events following\nthe cross section calculated at NLO accuracy. The method is demonstrated for\ntop-quark events.

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff\nconsistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy\nvariation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses\nnear the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance\nwith holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square\nroot of the Hubble parameter.

Congestion seems to be an inevitable\nresult of user's behavior coupled to the network dynamics and it effects should\nbe minimized by choosing appropriate routing strategies. But what are the\nrequirements of routing depth in order to optimize the traffic flow? In this\npaper we analyse the behavior of Internet traffic with a topologically\nrealistic spatial structure as described in a previous study (S-H. Yook et al.\n,Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.

It\nis shown that it reproduces the relevant key, statistical features of\nInternet's traffic. Moreover, we also report the existence of a critical path\nhorizon defining a transition from low-efficient traffic to highly efficient\nflow. This transition is actually a direct consequence of the web's small world\narchitecture exploited by the routing algorithm. Once routing tables reach the\nnetwork diameter, the traffic experiences a sudden transition from a\nlow-efficient to a highly-efficient behavior. It is conjectured that routing\npolicies might have spontaneously reached such a compromise in a distributed\nmanner. Internet would thus be operating close to such critical path horizon. \n\n"}

In particular, in\nthe case of the universal differential calculus on a finite set, the Euclidean\ngeometry of polyhedra is recovered from conditions of metric compatibility and\nvanishing torsion. In our rather general framework (which also comprises\nstructures which are far away from continuum differential geometry), there is\nin general nothing like a Ricci tensor or a curvature scalar.

We reexamine this PQCD deep problem. By including NLO power\ncorrections to the pion form factor, we may arrive at a perturbative\nexplanation for the data. The key realization is that we need to interprete\nthat the strong interaction coupling constant involved in the PQCD result\nshould be taken as an effective coupling constant under nonperturbative QCD\nvaccum. This implies that one can equally identify the relevant scale for the\neffective coupling constant as the factorization scale about 1 GeV. We also\nfind that the average momentum fraction variable locates about 0.5, which is in\nfavor of the asymptotic pion wave function. By employing photon-pion form\nfactor with NLO power corrections to factorize out the nonperturbative effects\ninvolved in the effective coupling constant, we can extract an effective\nrunning coupling constant, which represents an effective coupling involving in\nthe hard scattering subprocesses. The difference between the effective running\ncoupling constant and the usual perturbative running coupling constant\n($\\Lambda_{QCD}=0.3$ GeV) is very small for $Q^2> 1 GeV^2$.

We show that the Peccei-Quinn field of this\nmodel can act as curvaton.

The cold dark matter of the universe\nis mostly constituted by axions plus a small amount of lightest sparticles. The\npredictions of the model are confronted with the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy\nprobe and other cosmic microwave background radiation data. We analyze two\nrepresentative choices of parameters and derive bounds on the curvaton\ncontribution to the adiabatic perturbation.

We study the situation in which the particles are\nnoninteracting. The encoding input states obey a set of physically motivated\nconstraints on the mean values of the energy and particle number. In such a\ncase, the determination of both classical and quantum capacity reduces to a\nconstrained maximization of entropy.

A major motivation for these considerations is to compare the\ninformation carrying capacities of channels that carry bosons with those that\ncarry fermions.
