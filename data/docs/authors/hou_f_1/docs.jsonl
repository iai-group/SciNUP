Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are ideal candidates due to their large\nflux over limited time intervals, maximizing the available signal-to-noise\nratio. To date a few polarization measurements have been reported, claiming of\na high degree of polarization in the prompt emission of GRBs but with low\nstatistical evidence.\n  We used the IBIS telescope on board the INTEGRAL satellite to measure the\npolarization of the prompt gamma-ray emission of the long and bright GRB\n041219A in the 200-800 keV energy band.

We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so\ncalled GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the\noptimization algorithm.

DoAr 21 (age < 10^6 yr and mass ~ 2.2 M_sun) is a strong X-ray\nemitter, with conflicting evidence in the literature about its disk properties.\nIt shows weak but broad H-alpha emission; polarimetric variability; PAH and H2\nemission; and a strong, spatially-resolved 24-micron excess in archival Spitzer\nphotometry. Gemini sub-arcsecond-resolution 9--18 micron images show that there\nis little or no excess mid-infrared emission within 100 AU of the star; the\nexcess emission is extended over several arcseconds, is quite asymmetric, and\nis bright in the UV-excited 11.3 micron PAH emission feature.

Our hypothesis is\nthat dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by a\ncombination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with an\nexterior disk of small bodies (\"planetesimals\"). Using 5,000 long duration\nN-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50\nEarth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of\nSaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed\neccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller\nradii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking\nstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. For lower mass\nplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, sudden\njumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization of\nscattered low-mass planets in the disk. We present distributions of the final\neccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass and\ninitial system architecture. We predict a transition to lower eccentricities\nfor low mass planets at radii where disks influence the dynamics. Radial\nvelocity measurements capable of detecting planets with K~5 m/s and periods in\nexcess of 10 years will constrain this regime. We also study the population of\nresonant and non-resonant multiple planet systems.

Our\nparticle-gas hybrid scheme is based on a second order predictor-corrector\nmethod. Careful treatment of the momentum feedback on the gas guarantees exact\nconservation. The hybrid scheme is stable and convergent in most regimes\nrelevant to protoplanetary disks. We describe a semi-implicit integrator\ngeneralized from the leap-frog approach. In the absence of drag force, it\npreserves the geometric properties of a particle orbit. We also present a\nfully-implicit integrator that is unconditionally stable for all regimes of\nparticle-gas coupling. Using our hybrid code, we study the numerical\nconvergence of the non-linear saturated state of the streaming instability. We\nfind that gas flow properties are well converged with modest grid resolution\n(128 cells per pressure length \\eta r for dimensionless stopping time\ntau_s=0.1), and equal number of particles and grid cells. On the other hand,\nparticle clumping properties converge only at higher resolutions, and finer\nresolution leads to stronger clumping before convergence is reached. Finally,\nwe find that measurement of particle transport properties resulted from the\nstreaming instability may be subject to error of about 20%. \n\n"}

This has been\nfollowed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant\nexpansion of the size of the population, that began when our own particular\n`sapiens' species emerged, just a few hundred thousand years ago. The present\ninvestigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution\nmechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism\ngoverning the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently\n-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly\ngoverned by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient\nintroduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two\nhundred thousand million years. It is shown here how the value of this hitherto\nmysterious timescale governing the memetic phase is explicable in terms of what\nhappenned in the preceding genetic phase. The outcome is that the order of\nmagnitude of the Foerster timescale can be accounted for as the product of the\nrelevant (human) generation timescale, about 20 years, with the number of bits\nof information in the genome, of the order of ten thousand million.

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass\nfor Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews\net al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an\nimportant role in the circumstellar gas dynamics. \n\n"}

This dynamical configuration likely resulted from\nresonance capture as Neptune migrated outward during the late stages of planet\nformation. The details of Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, including\nits radial extent and the concurrent eccentricity evolution of the planet, are\nthe subject of considerable debate. Two qualitatively different proposals for\nresonance capture have been proposed--migration-induced capture driven by\nsmooth outward evolution of Neptune's orbit and chaotic capture driven by\ndamping of the planet's eccentricity near its current semi-major axis. We\ndemonstrate that the distribution of comparable-mass, wide-separation binaries\noccupying resonant orbits can differentiate between these two scenarios. If\nmigration-induced capture occurred, this fraction records information about the\nformation locations of different populations of KBOs. Chaotic capture, in\ncontrast, randomizes the orbits of bodies as they are placed in resonance. In\nparticular, migration-induced capture produces the following signatures. The\n2:1 resonance should contain a dynamically cold component, with inclinations\nless than 5-10 degrees, having a binary fraction comparable to that among cold\nclassical KBOs. If the 3:2 resonance also hosts a cold component, its binary\nfraction should be 20-30% lower than in the cold classical belt.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that\nthis approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation at $z\\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion\nmeasurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we\nfind that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path $\\lambda$ of the jet is\nshort, $\\lambda \\leq 0.3$ fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity\ninferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at\nshort mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low\nmomenta $p \\sim m$, where $m \\simeq 0.6$ GeV is the typical meson mass.\nMeanwhile the induced jet energy loss at short mean free path is much larger\nthan naively expected in string models. \n\n"}

Abstract: The maximum mass of a neutron star is generally determined by the equation of\nstate of the star material. In this study, we take into account dark matter\nparticles, assumed to behave like fermions with a free parameter to account for\nthe interaction strength among the particles, as a possible constituent of\nneutron stars. We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory. Furthermore, in this particular case, we point out that the dark matter\naround a neutron star should also contribute to the mass measurement due to its\npure gravitational effect. However, our numerically calculation illustrates\nthat such contribution could be safely ignored because of the usual diluted\ndark matter environment assumed.

We investigate different approaches to\nestablish the accuracy that can be reached by the LSST six-band photometry.

The photo-z reconstruction\nfrom both of these techniques is tested on real CFHTLS data and also on\nsimulated catalogs. We describe a new method to improve photo-z reconstruction\nthat efficiently removes catastrophic outliers via a likelihood ratio\nstatistical test. This test uses the posterior probability functions of the fit\nparameters and the colors.

The\n  Turbulent Stirring Recipe Abstract: Turbulence in protoplanetary disks affects planet formation in many ways.\nWhile small dust particles are mainly affected by the aerodynamical coupling\nwith turbulent gas velocity fields, planetesimals and larger bodies are more\naffected by gravitational interaction with gas density fluctuations. For the\nlatter process, a number of numerical simulations have been performed in recent\nyears, but a fully parameter-independent understanding has not been yet\nestablished. In this study, we present simple scaling relations for the\nplanetesimal stirring rate in turbulence driven by magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI), taking into account the stabilization of MRI due to Ohmic\nresistivity. We begin with order-of-magnitude estimates of the\nturbulence-induced gravitational force acting on solid bodies and associated\ndiffusion coefficients for their orbital elements. We then test the predicted\nscaling relations using the results of recent Ohmic-resistive MHD simulations\nby Gressel et al. We find that these relations successfully explain the\nsimulation results if we properly fix order-of-unity uncertainties within the\nestimates. We also update the saturation predictor for the density fluctuation\namplitude in MRI-driven turbulence originally proposed by Okuzumi & Hirose.\nCombination of the scaling relations and saturation predictor allows to know\nhow the turbulent stirring rate of planetesimals depends on disk parameters\nsuch as the gas column density, distance from the central star, vertical\nresistivity distribution, and net vertical magnetic flux. In Paper II, we apply\nour recipe to planetesimal accretion to discuss its viability in turbulent\ndisks. \n\n"}

The decays of heavy B-L Higgs bosons and heavy neutrinos\ngenerate entropy, baryon asymmetry and dark matter and also control the\nreheating temperature.

The experiment was designed, built and carried out to\nincrease our knowledge about the processes dominating the first phase of planet\nformation. During this phase, the growth of planetary precursors occurs by\nagglomeration of micrometer-sized dust grains into aggregates of at least\nmillimeters to centimeters in size. However, the formation of larger bodies\nfrom the so-formed building blocks is not yet fully understood. Recent\nnumerical models on dust growth lack a particular support by experimental\nstudies in the size range of submillimeters, because these particles are\npredicted to collide at very gentle relative velocities of below 1 cm/s that\ncan only be achieved in a reduced-gravity environment.\n  The SPACE experiment investigates the collision behavior of an ensemble of\nsilicate-dust aggregates inside several evacuated glass containers which are\nbeing agitated by a shaker to induce the desired collisions at chosen\nvelocities.

Using the simplest viscoelastic dissipation model (the\nMaxwell model) for the rocky core and including the effect of a nondissipative\nfluid envelope, we show that with reasonable (but uncertain) physical\nparameters for the core (size, viscosity and shear modulus), tidal dissipation\nin the core can accommodate the tidal-Q constraint of the Solar system gas\ngiants and at the same time allows exoplanetary hot Jupiters to form via tidal\ncircularization in the high-e migration scenario.

High-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks is\nlimited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress\nthose speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction\nof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. This signal\nattenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk's\nsurface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physical\nprocesses responsible for the dust distribution. To compensate for this\nattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the\nself-subtraction function at each separation.

It is essential for any quantitative\nsignal estimation on the basis of the data. Here, we investigate\nself-calibration methods for linear signal measurements and linear dependence\nof the response on the calibration parameters. The common practice is to\naugment an external calibration solution using a known reference signal with an\ninternal calibration on the unknown measurement signal itself. Contemporary\nself-calibration schemes try to find a self-consistent solution for signal and\ncalibration by exploiting redundancies in the measurements. This can be\nunderstood in terms of maximizing the joint probability of signal and\ncalibration. However, the full uncertainty structure of this joint probability\naround its maximum is thereby not taken into account by these schemes.\nTherefore better schemes -- in sense of minimal square error -- can be designed\nby accounting for asymmetries in the uncertainty of signal and calibration. We\nargue that at least a systematic correction of the common self-calibration\nscheme should be applied in many measurement situations in order to properly\ntreat uncertainties of the signal on which one calibrates. Otherwise the\ncalibration solutions suffer from a systematic bias, which consequently\ndistorts the signal reconstruction.

The data are well fit by this\nexomoon model, but an alternate star+planet model fits the data almost as well.\nNevertheless, these results indicate the potential of microlensing to detect\nexomoons, albeit ones that are different from the giant planet moons in our\nsolar system. The argument for an exomoon hinges on the system being relatively\nclose to the Sun. The data constrain the product M pi_rel, where M is the lens\nsystem mass and pi_rel is the lens-source relative parallax. If the lens system\nis nearby (large pi_rel), then M is small (a few Jupiter masses) and the\ncompanion is a sub-Earth-mass exomoon. The best-fit solution has a large\nlens-source relative proper motion, mu_rel = 19.6 +- 1.6 mas/yr, which would\nrule out a distant lens system unless the source star has an unusually high\nproper motion. However, data from the OGLE collaboration nearly rule out a high\nsource proper motion, so the exoplanet+exomoon model is the favored\ninterpretation for the best fit model.

In the simplest version of the\nmodel, some of the couplings need to be fine tuned to very small values. We\nformulate the problem of fine tuning of these couplings.

Here we study the feasibility of measuring\nthe mass of an individual PMO through microlensing by examining a particular\nevent, MOA-2011-BLG-274. This event was unusual as the duration was short, the\nmagnification high, the source-size effect large and the angular Einstein\nradius small. Also, it was intensively monitored from widely separated\nlocations under clear skies at low air masses. Choi et al. (2012) concluded\nthat the lens of the event may have been a PMO but they did not attempt a\nmeasurement of its mass. We report here a re-analysis of the event using\nre-reduced data. We confirm the results of Choi et al. and attempt a\nmeasurement of the mass and distance of the lens using the terrestrial parallax\neffect. Evidence for terrestrial parallax is found at a 3 sigma level of\nconfidence. The best fit to the data yields the mass and distance of the lens\nas 0.80 +/- 0.30 M_J and 0.80 +/- 0.25 kpc respectively. We exclude a host star\nto the lens out to a separation ~ 40 AU. Drawing on our analysis of\nMOA-2011-BLG-274 we propose observational strategies for future microlensing\nsurveys to yield sharper results on PMOs including those down to super-Earth\nmass. \n\n"}

Using a prolate apodization, the current\nimplementations offer raw contrasts down to $10^{-7}$ at 0.2 arcsec from a star\nover a wide bandpass (20\\%), in the presence of central obstruction and struts,\nenabling the study of young or massive gaseous planets. Observations of older\nor lighter companions at smaller separations would require improvements in\nterms of inner working angle (IWA) and contrast, but the methods originally\nused for these designs were not able to fully explore the parameter space. We\nhere propose a novel approach to improve the APLC performance. Our method\nrelies on the linear properties of the coronagraphic electric field with the\napodization at any wavelength to develop numerical solutions producing\ncoronagraphic star images with high-contrast region in broadband light.

For the high\nsignal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in\nstellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically\nunderestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We\nconstruct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the\ncovariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This\nframework specifically address the common problem of mismatches in model\nspectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model\nimperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity\nprescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that\nidentifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line\n\"outliers.\" By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local\nkernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to\nsynthetic spectral libraries.

Recently, it has become clear that RV\ndata can contain periodic signals due to stellar activity, which can be\ndifficult to distinguish from planetary signals. However, even doing the\ninference under a given set of simplifying assumptions (e.g. no stellar\nactivity) can be difficult. It is common for the posterior distribution for the\nplanet parameters, such as orbital periods, to be multimodal and to have other\nawkward features. In addition, when $N$ is unknown, the marginal likelihood (or\nevidence) as a function of $N$ is required. Rather than doing separate runs\nwith different trial values of $N$, we propose an alternative approach using a\ntrans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method within Nested Sampling.

These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star.

In a mass-radius diagram, the two lines\nintersect near the Planck point $(l_P,m_P)$, where quantum gravity effects\nbecome significant. Since canonical (non-gravitational) quantum mechanics is\nbased on the concept of wave-particle duality, encapsulated in the de Broglie\nrelations, these relations should break down near $(l_P,m_P)$. It is unclear\nwhat physical interpretation can be given to quantum particles with energy $E\n\\gg m_Pc^2 $, since they correspond to wavelengths $\\lambda \\ll l_P$ or time\nperiods $T \\ll t_P$ in the standard theory.

Given the\nuncertainties in the Galaxy model and the Sun's current phase space\ncoordinates, as well as the errors in the geological data, it is not possible\nto draw a clear connection between terrestrial extinction and the solar motion.\nIn a separate study, I find that the solar motion, which modulates the Galactic\ntidal forces imposed on Oort cloud comets, does not significantly influence\nthis cratering rate.

In an earlier work we showed that at very low temperatures and high\ndensities, H2 can be in a phase transition leading to the formation of ice\nclumps as large as comets or even planets. However, He has very different\nchemical properties and no phase transition is expected before H2 in dense\ninterstellar medium (ISM) conditions. The gravitational stability of fluid\nmixtures has been studied before, but these studies did not include a phase\ntransition.\n  First, we study the gravitational stability of van der Waals fluid mixtures\nusing linearized analysis and examine virial equilibrium conditions using the\nLennard-Jones intermolecular potential. Then, combining the Lennard-Jones and\ngravitational potentials, the non-linear dynamics of fluid mixtures are studied\nvia computer simulations using the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS.\n  Along with the classical, ideal-gas Jeans instability criterion, a fluid\nmixture is always gravitationally unstable if it is in a phase transition\nbecause compression does not increase pressure. However, the condensed phase\nfraction increases. In unstable situations the species can separate: in some\nconditions He precipitates faster than H2, while in other conditions the\nconverse occurs. Also, for an initial gas phase collapse the geometry is\nessential. Contrary to spherical or filamentary collapses, sheet-like collapses\nstarting below 15K easily reach H2 condensation conditions because then they\nare fastest and both the increase of heating and opacity are limited.\n  Depending on density, temperature and mass, either rocky H2 planetoids, or\ngaseous He planetoids form. H2 planetoids are favoured by high density, low\ntemperature and low mass, while He planetoids need more mass and can form at\ntemperature well above the critical value. \n\n"}

We show\nthat engineering data acquired for photometric calibration, consisting of\ncollateral `smear' measurements, can be used to reconstruct light curves for\nbright targets not otherwise observable with Kepler/K2. Here we present some\nexamples from Kepler Quarter 6 and K2 Campaign 3, including the delta Scuti\nvariables HD 178875 and 70 Aqr, and the red giant HR 8500 displaying solar-like\noscillations. We compare aperture and smear photometry where possible, and also\nstudy targets not previously observed.

Here, we present results of ground-based follow-up observations for\nthe K2-19 planetary system. We have performed high-dispersion spectroscopy and\nhigh-contrast adaptive-optics imaging of the host star with the HDS and HiCIAO\non the Subaru 8.2m telescope. We find that the host star is relatively old (>8\nGyr) late G-type star ($T_{eff}$ ~ 5350 K, $M_s$ ~ 0.9 $M_{Sun}$, and $R_{s}$ ~\n0.9 $R_{Sun}$). We do not find any contaminating faint objects near the host\nstar which could be responsible for (or dilute) the transit signals. We have\nalso conducted transit follow-up photometry for the inner planet with KeplerCam\non the FLWO 1.2m telescope, TRAPPISTCAM on the TRAPPIST 0.6m telescope, and\nMuSCAT on the OAO 1.88m telescope. We confirm the presence of transit-timing\nvariations, as previously reported by Armstrong and coworkers. We model the\nobserved transit-timing variations of the inner planet using the synodic\nchopping formulae given by Deck & Agol (2015). We find two statistically\nindistinguishable solutions for which the period ratios ($P_{c}/P_{b}$) are\nlocated slightly above and below the exact 3:2 commensurability. Despite the\ndegeneracy, we derive the orbital period of the inner planet $P_b$ ~ 7.921 days\nand the mass of the outer planet $M_c$ ~ 20 $M_{Earth}$. Additional transit\nphotometry (especially for the outer planet) as well as precise radial-velocity\nmeasurements would be helpful to break the degeneracy and to determine the mass\nof the inner planet. \n\n"}

We report\nresults for simulations based on two dipole antennas used by the Experiment to\nDetect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES).

For EDGES and other ground-based experiments with zenith\npointing antennas, right ascension and declination correspond directly to the\nlocal sidereal time and the latitude of the deployment site, hence chromatic\nbeam effects should be taken into account when selecting sites.

From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity. The implications\nof these results for the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon are discussed. \n\n"}

This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer.

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes.

Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface.

We construct a model of the frequency modulation\nand compare it with the instantaneous frequency extracted from the\npseudo-Wigner distribution of simulated light curves of a cloudless Earth. The\nmodel provides good agreement with the simulated modulation factor, even for\nthe light curve with Gaussian noise comparable to the signal.

We study the possibility that the warm Jupiters\nare undergoing secular eccentricity oscillations excited by an outer companion\n(a planet or star) in an eccentric and/or mutually inclined orbit. In this\nmodel the warm Jupiters migrate periodically, in the high-eccentricity phase of\nthe oscillation when the pericenter distance is small, but are typically\nobserved at much lower eccentricities.

While 3D climate studies can calculate the water\nvapor, ice albedo, and cloud feedback self-consistently and therefore allow for\na deeper understanding and the identification of relevant climate processes, 1D\nmodel studies rely on fewer model assumptions and can be more easily applied to\nthe large parameter space possible for exoplanets. We evaluate the\napplicability of 1D climate models to estimate the potential habitability of\nEarth-like exoplanets by comparing our 1D model results to those of 3D climate\nstudies in the literature. We applied a cloud-free 1D radiative-convective\nclimate model to calculate the climate of Earth-like planets around different\ntypes of main-sequence stars with varying surface albedo and relative humidity\nprofile. These parameters depend on climate feedbacks that are not treated\nself-consistently in most 1D models. We compared the results to those of 3D\nmodel calculations in the literature and investigated to what extent the 1D\nmodel can approximate the surface temperatures calculated by the 3D models.

In this paper (PaperII), we explore the\nreliability of the measured total gas mass, dust surface density and dust\ntemperature maps derived from modified blackbody fitting of synthetic Herschel\nobservations. We found from our pixel-by-pixel analysis of the measured dust\nsurface density and dust temperature a worrisome error spread especially close\nto star-formation sites and low-density regions, where for those \"contaminated\"\npixels the surface densities can be under/overestimated by up to three orders\nof magnitude. In light of this, we recommend to treat the pixel-based results\nfrom this technique with caution in regions with active star formation. In\nregions of high background typical in the inner Galactic plane, we are not able\nto recover reliable surface density maps of individual synthetic regions, since\nlow-mass regions are lost in the FIR background.

Space-based detectors will observe\nlong-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to their\nlocation on the sky, using Doppler shifts of the signal to locate the sky\nposition. While these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector or\nnetwork, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards one\nexpects from electromagnetic astronomy. Another technique that can be used for\nsky localization is null-stream pointing. In the case where multiple\nindependent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitational\nwaves will appear in each of the data streams. Taking the signals from multiple\ndetectors in linear combination with each other, one finds there is a two\nparameter family of coefficients that effectively null the gravitational wave\nsignal; those two parameters are the angles that define the sky location of the\nsource. This technique has been demonstrated for a network of ground-based\ninterferometric observatories, and for 6-link space interferometers.

Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity.

In this\nwork, we present a method to photometrically classify type Ia supernovae based\non machine learning with redshifts that are derived from the SN light-curves.\nThis method is implemented on real data from the SNLS deferred pipeline, a\npurely photometric pipeline that identifies SNe Ia at high-redshifts\n($0.2<z<1.1$).\n  Our method consists of two stages: feature extraction (obtaining the SN\nredshift from photometry and estimating light-curve shape parameters) and\nmachine learning classification. We study the performance of different\nalgorithms such as Random Forest and Boosted Decision Trees. We evaluate the\nperformance using SN simulations and real data from the first 3 years of the\nSupernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), which contains large spectroscopically and\nphotometrically classified type Ia samples. Using the Area Under the Curve\n(AUC) metric, where perfect classification is given by 1, we find that our\nbest-performing classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) has an AUC\nof $0.98$.\n  We show that it is possible to obtain a large photometrically selected type\nIa SN sample with an estimated contamination of less than $5\\%$.

A cumulative probability distribution indicates that the darkest\n10% of the nights at Dome A have sky brightness of S_B = 22.98, S_V = 21.86,\nand S_R = 21.68 mag arcsec^{-2}.

Hence, by\nstudying spot-induced modulations, one can learn about stellar surface\n(differential) rotation and magnetic activity. Recently, Reinhold & Arlt (2015)\nproposed a method based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of light curves to\nidentify the sign of the differential rotation at the stellar surface. Our goal\nis to understand how the modulation of the stellar light curve due to the\npresence of spots and the corresponding periodogram are affected by both the\nstellar and spot properties. We generate synthetic light curves of stars with\ndifferent properties (inclination angle, limb darkening, and rotation rate) and\nspot configurations (number of spots, latitude, intensity contrast, and size).\nBy analysing their Lomb-Scargle periodograms, we compute the ratio between the\nheights of the second and first harmonics of the rotation period\n(peak-height-ratio).

Outline\n  of the magnetospheric rebound model Abstract: The Kepler mission has discovered that multiple close-in super-Earth planets\nare common around solar-type stars, but their period ratios do not show strong\npile-ups near mean motion resonances (MMRs). One scenario is that super-Earths\nform in a gas-rich disk, and they interact gravitationally with the surrounding\ngas, inducing their orbital migration. Disk migration theory predicts, however,\nthat planets would end up at resonant orbits due to their differential\nmigration speed. Motivated by the discrepancy between observation and theory,\nwe seek for a mechanism that moves planets out of resonances. We examine the\norbital evolution of planet pairs near the magnetospheric cavity during the gas\ndisk dispersal phase. Our study determines the conditions under which planets\ncan escape resonances. We perform two-planet N-body simulations, varying the\nplanet masses, stellar magnetic field strengths, disk accretion rates and gas\ndisk depletion timescales. As planets migrate outward with the expanding\nmagnetospheric cavity, their dynamical configurations can be rearranged.\nMigration of planets is substantial (minor) in a massive (light) disk. When the\nouter planet is more massive than the inner planet, the period ratio of two\nplanets increases through outward migration. On the other hand, when the inner\nplanet is more massive, the final period ratio tends to remain similar to the\ninitial one. Larger stellar magnetic field strengths result in planets stopping\ntheir migration at longer periods. We highlight \\textit{magnetospheric rebound}\nas an important ingredient able to reconcile disk migration theory with\nobservations. Even when planets are trapped into MMR during the early gas-rich\nstage, subsequent cavity expansion would induce substantial changes to their\norbits, moving them out of resonance. \n\n"}

However,\ncurrent and planned space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes\npresent complex pupil geometries, including secondary mirror central\nobscurations, that prevent vortex coronagraphs from rejecting on-axis sources\nentirely. Recent solutions combining the vortex phase mask with a ring-apodized\npupil have been proposed to circumvent this issue, but provide a limited\nthroughput for vortex charges $>2$. We present a family of pupil plane\napodizations that compensate for pupil geometries with circularly symmetric\ncentral obstructions caused by on-axis secondary mirrors for charge 2, 4, and 6\nvector vortex coronagraphs. These apodizations are derived analytically and\nallow the vortex coronagraph to retain theoretically perfect nulling in the\npresence of central obscurations.

To address this\nissue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering\nbetween a free-floating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound\nplanet. We distinguish between three different possible scattering outcomes,\nwhere the free-floating planet may get captured after the interaction with the\nbinary, remain unbound, or \"kick-out\" the bound planet and replace it. The\nsimulation was performed for different masses of the free-floating planets and\nstars, as well as different impact parameters, inclination angles and approach\nvelocities. The outcome statistics are used to construct an analytical\napproximation of the cross section for capturing a free-floating planet by\nfitting their dependence on the tested variables.

The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with\ntime in a low viscosity disk ($\\alpha = 5\\times10^{-5}$), so even low-mass\nplanets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open\nmultiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed.

Such\nchains naturally form as a result of convergent migration of the planets in the\nproto-planetary disk. In this article, I present an analytical model of\nresonant chains of any number of planets. Using this model, I show that a\nsystem captured in a resonant chain can librate around several possible\nequilibrium configurations. The probability of capture around each equilibrium\ndepends on how the chain formed, and especially on the order in which the\nplanets have been captured in the chain. Therefore, for an observed resonant\nchain, knowing around which equilibrium the chain is librating allows for\nconstraints to be put on the formation and migration scenario of the system. I\napply this reasoning to the four planets orbiting Kepler-223 in a 3:4:6:8\nresonant chain. I show that the system is observed around one of the six\nequilibria predicted by the analytical model.

We discuss the validity of the model and find that\n10 ${\\mu}$as astrometric precision is achievable with a single 100 s exposure\nof a R = 6 or a J = 5 star. We discuss observational limitations from the\noptical distortion correction and pixel-level artifacts, which need to be\ncalibrated at the level of 10 - 20 ${\\mu}$as so as to not dominate the error\nbudget. To suppress those systematics, we suggest a series of short exposures,\ndithered by at least several hundred pixels, to reach an effective per-visit\nastrometric precision of better than 10 ${\\mu}$as. If this can be achieved, a\ndedicated WFIRST GO program will be able to detect Earth-mass exoplanets with\norbital periods of 1 yr around stars within a few pc as well as Neptune-like\nplanets with shorter periods or around more massive or distant stars.

The chemical composition of this material is usually assumed to be\nunchanged during the disk lifetime. However, chemistry can alter the relative\nabundances of molecules in this planet-building material. To assess the impact\nof disk chemistry during the era of planet formation, an extensive kinetic\nchemistry gas-grain reaction network is utilised to evolve the abundances of\nchemical species over time. Given a high level of ionisation, chemical\nevolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes becomes significant after a few\ntimes $10^{5}$ yrs, and is still ongoing by 7 Myr between the H$_{2}$O and the\nO$_{2}$ icelines. Importantly, the changes in the abundances of the major\nelemental carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules imply that the traditional\n\"stepfunction\" for the C/O ratios in gas and ice in the disk midplane (as\ndefined by sharp changes at icelines of H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$ and CO) evolves over\ntime, and cannot be assumed fixed. In addition, at lower temperatures (< 29 K),\ngaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO$_{2}$ and other\nmore complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O$_{2}$ and CO\nthermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature\nthan suggested by its binding energy. Chemistry in the disk midplane is\nionisation-driven, and evolves over time. In order to reliably predict the\natmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed\natmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have\nformed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and\nimplemented into planet formation models. \n\n"}

This in\nturn affects planet formation. Recently, the effect of disk wind torque has\nbeen considered with the suggestion that it would carve out the surface density\nof the disk from inside and would induce global gas flows (wind-driven\naccretion). We aim to investigate effects of global gas flows on type I\nmigration and also examine planet formation. A simplified approach was taken to\naddress this issue, and N-body simulations with isolation-mass planets were\nalso performed. In previous studies, the effect of gas flow induced by\nturbulence-driven accretion has been taken into account for its desaturation\neffect of the corotation torque. If more rapid gas flows (e.g., wind-driven\naccretion) are considered, the desaturation effect can be modified. In\nMRI-inactive disks, in which the wind-driven accretion dominates the disk\nevolution, the gas flow at the midplane plays an important role. If this flow\nis fast, the corotation torque is efficiently desaturated. Then, the fact that\nthe surface density slope can be positive in the inner region due to the wind\ntorque can generate an outward migration region extended to super-Earth mass\nplanets. In this case, we observe that no planets fall onto the central star in\nN-body simulations with migration forces imposed to reproduce such migration\npattern.

By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity.

Atmospheric Effects for an Unmagnetized Planet Abstract: Understanding the impact of active M-dwarf stars on the atmospheric\nequilibrium and surface conditions of a habitable zone Earth-like planet is key\nto assessing M dwarf planet habitability. Previous modeling of the impact of\nelectromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on an\nEarth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in\nozone were possible, but the atmosphere recovered. These stars more\nrealistically exhibit frequent flaring with a power-law distribution of\nenergies. Here we use a coupled 1D photochemical and radiative-convective model\nto investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and\nsurface UV of an Earth-like planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field.\nWe use time-resolved flare spectra obtained for the dM3 star AD Leo, combined\nwith flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically 10$^{30.5}$ to\n10$^{34}$ erg) from the 4-year Kepler light curve for the dM4 flare star\nGJ1243. Our model results show repeated EM-only flares have little effect on\nthe ozone column depth, but that multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the\nozone column. Combining the realistic flare and proton event frequencies with\nnominal CME & SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like planet\ncan be depleted by 94% in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery\nunlikely and suggests further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs O3\ndepletion allows a constant 0.1-1 W m$^{-2}$ of UV-C at the planet's surface,\nwhich is likely detrimental to organic complexity. Our results suggest that\nactive M dwarf hosts may comprehensively destroy ozone shields and subject the\nsurface of magnetically-unprotected Earth-like planets to long-term radiation\nthat can damage complex organic structures. However, this does not preclude\nhabitability, as a safe haven for life could still exist below an ocean\nsurface. \n\n"}

The PSF smears the image of any recorded object and\ntherefore needs to be taken into account when inferring properties of galaxies\nfrom astronomical images. In the case of cosmic shear, the PSF is one of the\ndominant sources of systematic errors and must be treated carefully to avoid\nbiases in cosmological parameters. Recently, forward modeling approaches to\ncalibrate shear measurements within the Monte-Carlo Control Loops ($MCCL$)\nframework have been developed. These methods typically require simulating a\nlarge amount of wide-field images, thus, the simulations need to be very fast\nyet have realistic properties in key features such as the PSF pattern. Hence,\nsuch forward modeling approaches require a very flexible PSF model, which is\nquick to evaluate and whose parameters can be estimated reliably from survey\ndata. We present a PSF model that meets these requirements based on a fast\ndeep-learning method to estimate its free parameters. We demonstrate our\napproach on publicly available SDSS data. We extract the most important\nfeatures of the SDSS sample via principal component analysis. Next, we\nconstruct our model based on perturbations of a fixed base profile, ensuring\nthat it captures these features. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network\nto estimate the free parameters of the model from noisy images of the PSF. This\nallows us to render a model image of each star, which we compare to the SDSS\nstars to evaluate the performance of our method. We find that our approach is\nable to accurately reproduce the SDSS PSF at the pixel level, which, due to the\nspeed of both the model evaluation and the parameter estimation, offers good\nprospects for incorporating our method into the $MCCL$ framework. \n\n"}

This\nneglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with\nthese waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet\nformation, and the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine\nlinear calculations and shearing box simulations in order to investigate the\nvertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic stratifications and\nwave amplitudes. For sub-adiabatic profiles we find that spiral waves develop a\npair of counter-rotating poloidal rolls. Particularly strong in the nonlinear\nregime, these vortical structures issue from the baroclinicity supported by the\nbackground vertical entropy gradient. They are also intimately connected to the\ndisk's g-modes which appear to interact nonlinearly with the density waves.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the poloidal rolls are ubiquitous in\ngravitoturbulence, emerging in the vicinity of GI spiral wakes, and potentially\ntransporting grains off the disk midplane. Other than hindering sedimentation\nand planet formation, this phenomena may bear on observations of the disk's\nscattered infrared luminosity.

Arcmancer\nsupports Riemannian and semi-Riemannian spaces of any dimension and metric, and\nhas novel features such as support for multiple simultaneous coordinate charts,\nembedded geometric shapes, local coordinate systems and automatic parallel\npropagation. The Arcmancer interface is extensively documented and\nuser-friendly.

High-contrast exoplanet imaging is a rapidly growing field as can be\nseen through the significant resources invested. In fact, the detection and\ncharacterization of exoplanets through direct imaging is featured at all major\nground-based observatories. Aims. We aim to improve the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) achievable for ground-based, adaptive-optics assisted exoplanet imaging\nby applying sophisticated post-processing algorithms. In particular, we\ninvestigate the benefits of including time domain information. Methods. We\nintroduce a new speckle-suppression technique in data post-processing based on\nwavelet transformation. This technique explicitly considers the time domain in\na given data set (specifically the frequencies of speckle variations and their\ntime dependence) and allows us to filter-out speckle noise. We combine our\nwavelet-based algorithm with state-of-the-art principal component analysis\n(PCA) based PSF subtraction routines and apply it to archival data sets of\nknown directly imaged exoplanets. The data sets were obtained in the L filter\nwhere the short integration times allow for a sufficiently high temporal\nsampling of the speckle variations. Results. We demonstrate that improvements\nin the peak SNR of up to forty to sixty percent can be achieved. We also show\nthat, when combined with wavelet-denoising, the PCA PSF model requires\nsystematically smaller numbers of components for the fit to achieve the highest\nSNR. The improvement potential is, however, data set dependent or, more\nspecifically, closely linked to the field rotation available in a given data\nset: larger amounts of rotation allow for a better suppression of the speckle\nnoise.

These planets,\nknown as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have attained their\norbits in situ. Instead, they must have migrated in. Here we propose that these\nplanets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a\nscaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their\nhigh mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via\nchaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo\norbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This\nproposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed\nby Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities\nand inclinations, and possibly extending beyond AU distances; while only a\nsmall fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none\nclosely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of\n~10-50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove\nangular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of ~5-10\ndays. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally\ncaptured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally\nexplains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant\ntransiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods\n(1-3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model\nalso predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and\ninclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of ~10-50 degrees; (ii)\nseveral outer planetary companions extending to beyond AU distances, both of\nwhich may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations. \n\n"}

To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods.

This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran.

In the low mass region\n($m_{inv}<1.5$ GeV/$c^{2}$), resonance peaks are observed in\n$\\Delta\\gamma$($m_{inv}$). An event shape engineering (ESE) method is used to\nmodel the background shape in $m_{inv}$ to extract the potential CME signal at\nlow $m_{inv}$. In the comparative method, the $\\Psi_{\\rm RP}$ is assessed by\nspectator neutrons measured by ZDC, and the $\\Psi_{\\rm PP}$ by the\n2$^{nd}$-harmonic event plane measured by the TPC.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used to explore the\nposterior distribution for model parameters, but, due to the high correlations\nbetween parameters, nonlinearity, and potential multi-modality in the\nposterior, many samplers perform very inefficiently. Therefore, we assess the\nperformance of several MCMC samplers that use varying degrees of geometric\ninformation about the target distribution.

This is\nbecause, the differential masses and radii are better constrained than absolute\nplanetary masses and radii. We explore such correlations and data specific to\nthe multiplanetary-system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our\nunderstanding of planet interiors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rocky\ninterior of planets in a multi-planetary system can be preferentially probed by\nstudying the most dense planet representing a rocky interior analogue. Our\nmethodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo scheme. Our interior estimates account for the anticipated\nvariability in the compositions and layer thicknesses of core, mantle, water\noceans and ice layers, and a gas envelope. Our results show that (1) interior\nestimates significantly depend on available abundance proxies and (2) that the\nimportance of inter-dependent planetary data for interior characterization is\ncomparable to changes in data precision by 30 %. For the interiors of\nTRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that possible water mass fractions generally range\nfrom 0-25 %.

The dispersion is reduced by the so-called \"Fano factor\", which\nempirically encapsulates the correlations in the process of ionization. In\nmodelling the energy response of an ionization measurement device, the effect\nof the Fano factor is commonly folded into the overall energy resolution. While\nsuch an approximate treatment is appropriate when a significant number of\nionization pairs are expected to be produced, the Fano factor needs to be\naccounted for directly at the level of pair creation when only a few are\nexpected. To do so, one needs a discrete probability distribution of the number\nof pairs created $N$ with independent control of both the expectation $\\mu$ and\nFano factor $F$. Although no distribution $P(N|\\mu,F)$ with this convenient\nform exists, we propose the use of the COM-Poisson distribution together with\nstrategies for utilizing it to effectively fulfill this need.

For atmospheric\ncharacterization, the James Webb Space Telescope will only be able to target a\nsmall fraction of the most interesting systems, and the usefulness of\nground-based observatories will remain limited by a range of effects related to\nEarth's atmosphere.

For that purpose,\nwe wish to analyze first the dielectric responses of the medium both in\npresence and absence of strong magnetic field.

On the other hand the imaginary part is decreased for both slow\nand fast moving partons, due to the fact that the imaginary contribution due to\nquark-loop vanishes. With these ingredients, we found that the oscillation in\nthe (scaled) induced charge density, due to the very fast partons becomes less\npronounced in the presence of strong magnetic field whereas for smaller parton\nvelocity, no significant change is observed. For the (scaled) wake potential\nalong the motion of fast moving partons (which is of Lennard-Jones (LJ) type),\nthe depth of negative minimum in the backward region gets reduced drastically,\nresulting in the reduction of the amplitude of oscillation.

Such a current\narises in some condensed matter systems and may also appear in QCD dense matter\nas a consequence of quantum anomalies. We calculate the interaction between two\nvortices carrying a current j and find a constraint on the magnitude of j where\na superconductor is always type-I, even when the cannonical Landau-Ginzburg\nparameter indicates type-II behaviour. If this condition is met, the magnetic\nfield is expelled from the superconducting regions of the neutron star leading\nto the formation of the intermediate state where alternating domains of\nsuperconducting matter and normal matter coexist. We further argue that even\nwhen the induced current is small the vortex Abrikosov lattice will\nnevertheless be destroyed due to the helical instability studied previously in\nmany condensed matter systems. This would also resolve the apparent\ncontradiction with the precession of the neutron stars.

The quark spectral function and the quasi-dispersion relations\nare calculated at one-loop order. We find that there appears a three-peak\nstructure in the quark spectral function with a collective nature when T is\ncomparable with m, irrespective of the type of boson considered. Such a\nmulti-peak structure was first found in a chiral model yielding scalar\ncomposite bosons with a decay width. We elucidate the mechanism through which\nthe new quark collective excitations are realized in terms of the Landau\ndamping of a quark (an antiquark) induced by scattering with the thermally\nexcited boson, which gives rise to mixing and hence a level repulsion between a\nquark (antiquark) and an antiquark-hole (quark-hole) in the thermally excited\nantiquark (quark) distribution. Our results suggest that the quarks in the QGP\nphase can be described within an interesting quasi-particle picture with a\nmulti-peak spectral function.

The conversion rates\nvia the elastic $q(\\bar q)g\\to gq(\\bar q)$ and the inelastic $q\\bar\nq\\leftrightarrow gg$ scatterings are evaluated in the lowest order in QCD.\nIncluding both jet energy loss and conversions in the expanding quark-gluon\nplasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions, we have found a net\nconversion of quark to gluon jets.

However, a much larger net quark to gluon jet conversion\nrate than the one given by the lowest-order QCD is needed to account for the\nobserved similar ratios in central Au+Au and p+p collisions at same energy.\nImplications of our results are discussed. \n\n"}

General Aspects and 3+1 Formulation for Nuclear Collisions Abstract: Relativistic non-ideal fluid dynamics is formulated in 3+1 space--time\ndimensions. The equations governing dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics are\ngiven in terms of the time and the 3-space quantities which correspond to those\nfamiliar from non-relativistic physics. Dissipation is accounted for by\napplying the causal theory of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. As a\nspecial case we consider a fluid without viscous/heat couplings in the causal\nsystem of transport/relaxation equations. For the study of physical systems we\nconsider pure (1+1)-dimensional expansion in planar geometry, (1+1)-dimensional\nspherically symmetric ({\\em fireball}) expansion, (1+1)-dimensional\ncylindrically symmetric expansion and a (2+1)-dimensional expansion with\ncylindrical symmetry in the transverse plane ({\\em firebarell} expansion).

{"id": "nucl-th/9609030", "contents": "Title: Hot Spots and Turbulent Initial Conditions of Quark-Gluon Plasmas in\n  Nuclear Collisions Abstract: As a result of multiple mini-jet production, initial conditions of the QCD\nplasma formed in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions may be inhomogeneous,\nwith large fluctuations of the local energy density (hot spots), and turbulent,\nwith a chaotic initial transverse velocity field. Assuming rapid local\nthermalization, the evolution of such plasmas is computed using longitudinal\nboost-invariant 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamics. We compare the evolution in case\nthat the speed of sound in the plasma is constant to one resulting from an\nequation of state involving a strong first order transition, with a minimum of\nthe velocity of sound as a function of energy density. We find that azimuthally\nasymmetric fluctuations and correlations of the transverse energy flow can\ndevelop in both cases due to the initial inhomogeneities. Hot spots also\nenhance significantly high-transverse momenta direct photon yields. In the case\nwith a phase transition, the hadronization surface evolves into an unusual\nfoam-like structure. Also in that case, we find that hadronization is\nconsiderably delayed relative to the ideal gas case, just as previous studies\nhave found for homogeneous initial conditions. The time-delay signature of a\nrapid cross-over transition region in the QCD equation of state (as observable\nvia meson interferometry) is thus found to be remarkably robust to\nuncertainties in the initial conditions in heavy-ion reactions. \n\n"}

This contribution is of purely kinematic origin.\nAt next order we find a generic contribution of order $(qR)^3$ which is a\nresult of odd modifications to the source emission function. We argue, that the\nscale for typical HBT correlations in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is\n$q/K \\ll qR \\sim 1$, so that the third order correction actually dominates the\nphase in the experimentally relevant momentum range.
