A more complete\nintroduction to the series can be found in that article (arXiv:math/0610573).\nIn the current paper, a theory of topological regular neighborhoods is\ndescribed, which represents the full analogue in TOP of piecewise linear\nregular neighborhoods (or block bundles) in PL. In simplest terms, a\ntopological regular neighborhood of a manifold M locally flatly embedded in a\nmanifold Q (BdM and BdQ empty) is a closed manifold neighborhood V which is\nhomeomorphic fixing BdV and M to the mapping cylinder of some proper surjection\nBdV-->M. The principal theorem asserts the existence and uniqueness of such\nneighborhoods, for dim Q>7. One application is that a cell-like surjection of\ncell complexes is a simple homotopy equivalence (first proved for\nhomeomorphisms by Chapman). There is a notion of transversality for such\nneighborhoods, and the theory also holds for locally tamely embedded polyhedral\nin topological manifolds. \n\n"}

To each three-component\nlink in Euclidean 3-space, we associate a geometrically natural generalized\nGauss map from the 3-torus to the 2-sphere, and show that the pairwise linking\nnumbers and Milnor triple linking number that classify the link up to link\nhomotopy correspond to the Pontryagin invariants that classify its generalized\nGauss map up to homotopy. This can be viewed as a natural extension of the\nfamiliar fact that the linking number of a two-component link in 3-space is the\ndegree of its associated Gauss map from the 2-torus to the 2-sphere. When the\npairwise linking numbers are all zero, we give an integral formula for the\ntriple linking number analogous to the Gauss integral for the pairwise linking\nnumbers, but patterned after J.H.C. Whitehead's integral formula for the Hopf\ninvariant. The integrand in this formula is geometrically natural in the sense\nthat it is invariant under orientation-preserving rigid motions of 3-space,\nwhile the integral itself can be viewed as the helicity of a related vector\nfield on the 3-torus. In the first paper of this series [math.GT 1101.3374] we\ndid this for three-component links in the 3-sphere.

The\nVassiliev filtration has a natural extension to tangles in any thickened\nsurface $M\\times I$ but the corresponding category of diagrams lacks some\nfiniteness properties which are essential to the above construction.

A similar\nstatement holds for the number of equivalence classes of fixed-point free\n$S^1$-actions under some further conditions on the fundamental group. The\nconnection between the classification of the $S^1$-manifolds and the\nfundamental group is given by a certain decomposition, called fiber-sum\ndecomposition, of the $S^1$-manifolds. More concretely, each fiber-sum\ndecomposition naturally gives rise to a Z-splitting of the fundamental group.\nThere are two technical results in this paper which play a central role in our\nconsiderations.

Specifically, we are interested in maps f\nfrom K to R^d that have no r-Tverberg points, i.e., no r-fold points with\npreimages in r pairwise disjoint simplices of K, and we seek necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of such maps.\n  We present a higher-multiplicity analogue of the completeness of the Van\nKampen obstruction for embeddability in twice the dimension.

A seed is a\ncombinatorial data which can be encoded as an $n\\times n$ matrix with integer\nentries, or as a quiver in special cases, together with $n$ formal variables. A\nmutation is a certain rule for transforming a seed into another seed; the new\nvariables are related to the previous variables by some rational expressions.\nTo each seed one attaches an $n$-dimensional torus, and by gluing the tori\nalong the birational maps defined by the mutation formulas, one constructs a\ncluster variety. Quantization of a cluster variety assigns to each seed a\nnon-commutative ring which deforms the classical ring of functions on the torus\nattached to the seed, as well as to each mutation an isomorphism of skew fields\nof fractions of these non-commutative rings. A representation realizes the\nnon-commutative rings as algebras of operators on Hilbert spaces, and the\nquantum mutation isomorphisms as unitary maps between the Hilbert spaces that\nintertwine the operators for the rings.

We first show that any $\\mathbb{R}$-tree\nwith dense orbits in the boundary of the corresponding outer space can be\nreconstructed as a quotient of the boundary of the group by its dual\nlamination. We then describe the dual lamination in terms of a band complex on\ncompact $\\mathbb{R}$-trees (generalizing Coulbois-Hilion-Lustig's compact\nheart), and we analyze this band complex using versions of the Rips machine and\nof the Rauzy-Veech induction. An important output of the theory is that the\nabove map from the boundary of the group to the $\\mathbb{R}$-tree is 2-to-1\nalmost everywhere.\n  A key point for our intended application is a unique duality result for\narational trees. It says that if two trees have a leaf in common in their dual\nlaminations, and if one of the trees is arational and relatively free, then\nthey are equivariantly homeomorphic.\n  This statement is an analogue of a result in the free group saying that if\ntwo trees are dual to a common current and one of the trees is free arational,\nthen the two trees are equivariantly homeomorphic.

We apply $alk$ to the study of\ncausality in Lorentz manifolds. Let $M^m$ be a spacelike Cauchy surface in a\nglobally hyperbolic spacetime $(X^{m+1}, g)$. The spherical cotangent bundle\n$ST^*M$ is identified with the space $N$ of all null geodesics in $(X,g).$\nHence the set of null geodesics passing through a point $x\\in X$ gives an\nembedded $(m-1)$-sphere $S_x$ in $N=ST^*M$ called the sky of $x.$ Low observed\nthat if the link $(S_x, S_y)$ is nontrivial, then $x,y\\in X$ are causally\nrelated. This motivated the problem (communicated by Penrose) on the Arnold's\n1998 problem list to apply link theory to the study of causality. The spheres\n$S_x$ are isotopic to fibers of $(ST^*M)^{2m-1}\\to M^m.$ They are nonzero\nhomologous and $lk(S_x,S_y)$ is undefined when $M$ is closed, while $alk(S_x,\nS_y)$ is well defined. Moreover, $alk(S_x, S_y)\\in Z$ if $M$ is not an\nodd-dimensional rational homology sphere. We give a formula for the increment\nof $\\alk$ under passages through Arnold dangerous tangencies. If $(X,g)$ is\nsuch that $alk$ takes values in $\\Z$ and $g$ is conformal to $g'$ having all\nthe timelike sectional curvatures nonnegative, then $x, y\\in X$ are causally\nrelated if and only if $alk(S_x,S_y)\\neq 0$. We show that $x,y$ in\nnonrefocussing $(X, g)$ are causally unrelated iff $(S_x, S_y)$ can be deformed\nto a pair of $S^{m-1}$-fibers of $ST^*M\\to M$ by an isotopy through skies.

We propose\nto attack a very similar problem, which 80 years later remains open, about the\ntopology of the space of closed curves on S^2 which are locally convex (i.e.,\nwithout inflection points). One of the main difficulties is the absence of the\ncovering homotopy principle for the map sending a non-closed locally convex\ncurve to the Frenet frame at its endpoint.\n  In the present paper we study the spaces of locally convex curves in S^n with\na given initial and final Frenet frames.
