In scenarios with very shallow\nelectron density profiles, these transformations have been shown to couple with\nordinary matter effects, jointly producing spectral distortions both in normal\nand inverted hierarchy. In this work we consider a complementary scenario,\ncharacterized by higher electron density, as indicated by post-bounce\nshock-wave simulations. In this case, early collective flavor transitions are\ndecoupled from later, ordinary matter effects. Moreover, such transitions\nbecome more amenable to both numerical computations and analytical\ninterpretations in inverted hierarchy, while they basically vanish in normal\nhierarchy. We numerically evolve the neutrino density matrix in the region\nrelevant for self-interaction effects. In the approximation of averaged\nintersection angle between neutrino trajectories, our simulations neatly show\nthe collective phenomena of synchronization, bipolar oscillations, and spectral\nsplit, recently discussed in the literature.

However, the excess at lower\nenergies is presently unexplained.\n  A new data set of neutrinos from the NuMI beam line measured with the\nMiniBooNE detector at Fermilab has been analyzed. The measurement of NuMI\nneutrino interactions in MiniBooNE provide a clear proof-of-principle of the\noff-axis beam concept that is planned to be used by future neutrino experiments\nsuch as T2K and NOvA.

The neutrinos emitted from the remnant at the\ncenter, the protoneutron star (PNS), heat the material above the PNS surface.\nThis heat is partly converted into kinetic energy and the material accelerates\nto an outflow that is known as the neutrino driven wind.

The essential features of this scenario\nare that the gaugino masses are of the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB)\nform, while scalar and trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms are highly\nsuppressed. Renormalization group effects yield an allowable sparticle mass\nspectrum, while at the same time avoiding charged LSPs; the latter are common\nin models with negligible soft scalar masses, such as no-scale or gaugino\nmediation models. Since scalar and trilinear soft terms are highly suppressed,\nthe SUSY induced flavor and CP-violating processes are also suppressed.

Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and\nunambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana\nneutrino mass, m_bb. In order to make sense of how the different experimental\napproaches compare, we apply this recipe to a selection of proposals, comparing\nthe resulting sensitivities. We also propose a \"physics-motivated range\" (PMR)\nof the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different\nnuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in\nterms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,\nisotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass.

As a specific example, we consider a model with gauged B - L_e - 2\nL_tau number that contains an extremely light new vector boson m_Z' < 10^-18 eV\nand extraordinarily weak coupling alpha' < 10^-52. In that case, differences\nbetween nu_mu to nu_tau and anti-nu_mu to anti-nu_tau oscillations can result\nfrom a long-range potential due to neutrons in the Earth and the Sun that\ndistinguishes nu_mu and nu_tau on Earth, with a potential difference of ~\n6*10^-14 eV, and changes sign for anti-neutrinos. We show that existing solar,\nreactor, accelerator, and atmospheric neutrino oscillation constraints can be\nlargely accommodated for values of parameters that help explain the possible\nMINOS anomaly by this new physics, although there is some tension with\natmospheric constraints.

We construct asymptotically AdS\nsolutions of Einstein's gravity dual to such processes at strong coupling,\nperturbatively in the amplitude expansion, where the expansion parameter is the\nratio of the amplitude of the non-hydrodynamic shear-stress tensor to the\npressure.

Abstract: Following a simulation approach of recent publications we explore the\nviability of the neutrino-heating explosion mechanism in dependence on the\nspatial dimension. Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also\nobserve that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino\nluminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that\nexplosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that\nthe average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension\nand thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,\nmass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic\nenergy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.\nCoherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing\naccretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions\nbecause they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.\nWhile 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the\nopposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the\nturbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial\nscales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D\nis in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on\nsmaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more\nsimilar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be\ntightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including\nnonaxisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength. \n\n"}

The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is\n13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc.\nInflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian\nrandom phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from\nunity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s =\n0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k =\n-0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a\nreduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the\nstandard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model\nincluding tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a\nfactor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB\npredictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume\neven further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit,\nthe inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted\nin WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology. \n\n"}

Our question is motivated per se, and by\nseveral alternative symmetries that appear in models that provide a DM\nparticle. To this end, we devise a strategy to determine whether a heavy mother\nparticle decays into one visible massless particle and one or two DM particles.\nThe counting of DM particles in these decays is relevant to distinguish the\nminimal choice of Z_2, from a Z_3, stabilization symmetry, under which the\nheavy particle and the DM are charged and the visible particle is not. Our\nmethod is novel in that it chiefly uses the peak of the energy spectrum of the\nvisible particle and only secondarily uses the M_T2 endpoint of events in which\nthe heavy mother particles are pair-produced. We present new theoretical\nresults concerning the energy distribution of the decay products of a\nthree-body decay, which are crucial for our method. To demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our method in investigating the stabilization symmetry, we apply\nit in distinguishing the decay of a bottom quark partner into a b quark and one\nor two DM particles.

The flavor content of the signal evolves\ndue to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a\nhighly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper\nwe investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different\nprogenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the\nMikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage\nthrough the star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium\nsupernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during\na window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral features of collective\nand shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost\nturbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive\nprogenitors we again find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to\na minimal modification of the signal, and the emerging neutrino spectra retain\nboth collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts of turbulence is\nadded, 30% and 50%, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the\nhigh density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times.\nYet at the same time we find the other mixing channels - the low density\nresonance channel and the non-resonant channels - begin to develop turbulence\nsignatures.

In this\nframework the {\\it symmetry group condition} has been derived which allows to\nget relations between the lepton mixing elements immediately without explicit\nmodel building. The condition has been applied to different residual neutrino\nsymmetries $G_\\nu$. For generic (mass independent) $G_\\nu = {\\bf Z}_2$ the\ncondition leads to two relations between the mixing parameters and fixes one\ncolumn of the mixing matrix. In the case of $G_\\nu = {\\bf Z}_2 \\times {\\bf\nZ}_2$ the condition fixes the mixing matrix completely. The non-generic (mass\nspectrum dependent) $G_\\nu$ lead to relations which include mixing angles,\nneutrino masses and Majorana phases.

In light of this discovery, we explore the possibility that\nsome of the Sub-PeV cosmic neutrinos might originate in our Galaxy's TeV\nunidentified (TeV UnID) sources. While typically resolved at TeV energies,\nthese sources lack prominent radio or X-ray counterparts, and so have been\nconsidered promising sites for hadron acceleration within our Galaxy. Modeling\nthe TeV UnID sources as Galactic hypernova remnants, we predict Sub-PeV\nneutrino fluxes and spectra consistent with their contributing a minority of\nn_nu <~ 2 of the observed events. This is consistent with our analysis of the\nspatial distribution of the Sub-PeV neutrinos and TeV UnID sources, which finds\nthat a best-fit of one, and maximum of 3.8 (at 90%-confidence), of the ~16\nnon-atmospheric Sub-PeV neutrinos may originate in TeV UnID sources, with the\nremaining 75% to 95% of events being drawn from an isotropic background.

In this whitepaper, we have quantified the impact of PDF uncertainties\nin the W mass extractions from the transverse mass distribution at the LHC. The\ncalculation has been performed using the NNPDF2.3 set, which includes direct\nconstrains on the W boson production kinematics with data for electroweak gauge\nboson production from the LHC. Our results confirm previous estimates that PDF\nuncertainties in the determination of $M_W$ from the $m_W^T$ distribution are\nmoderate, around 10 MeV at most. We briefly discuss also the case of the lepton\n$p_T$ distribution. \n\n"}

The Standard Model\nis doing fine, including QCD, the electroweak sector and flavour physics. The\ngood news is that a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson has appeared with the\npredicted mass, but the bad news is that the LHC has provided no hint of other\nnew physics. On the other hand, physics beyond the Standard Model is needed to\nexplain neutrino masses and mixing, and we look forward to experiments\nrevealing their mass hierarchy and CP violation. Cosmology and astrophysics\nalso require new physics to explain the origin of matter, dark matter, dark\nenergy and the CMB fluctuations.

Abstract: The general question, crucial to an understanding of the internal structure\nof the nucleon, of how to split the total angular momentum of a photon or gluon\ninto spin and orbital contributions is one of the most important and\ninteresting challenges faced by gauge theories like Quantum Electrodynamics and\nQuantum Chromodynamics. This is particularly challenging since all QED\ntextbooks state that such an splitting cannot be done for a photon (and a\nfortiori for a gluon) in a gauge-invariant way, yet experimentalists around the\nworld are engaged in measuring what they believe is the gluon spin! This\nquestion has been a subject of intense debate and controversy, ever since, in\n2008, it was claimed that such a gauge-invariant split was, in fact, possible.\nWe explain in what sense this claim is true and how it turns out that one of\nthe main problems is that such a decomposition is not unique and therefore\nraises the question of what is the most natural or physical choice. The\nessential requirement of measurability does not solve the ambiguities and leads\nus to the conclusion that the choice of a particular decomposition is\nessentially a matter of taste and convenience. In this review, we provide a\npedagogical introduction to the question of angular momentum decomposition in a\ngauge theory, present the main relevant decompositions and discuss in detail\nseveral aspects of the controversies regarding the question of gauge\ninvariance, frame dependence, uniqueness and measurability. We stress the\nphysical implications of the recent developments and collect into a separate\nsection all the sum rules and relations which we think experimentally relevant.\nWe hope that such a review will make the matter amenable to a broader community\nand will help to clarify the present situation. \n\n"}

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam\nand a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines\n300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at\n5 $\\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating\nphase range.

All the earlier\nmodel predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we\npoint out that for a given tree operator $O_i$, the contribution from its\nFiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to\ncancel the internal $W$-emission amplitude induced from $O_i$. The wave\nfunction of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor\nwith the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these\nsymmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that\nhalf of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.\nSince this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,\nwe advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the\ntree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why\nmost previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above\nconsideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary\nto the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should\nbe proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$. \n\n"}

Paraparticles of order p=2 must be pair\nproduced, so the lightest such particles are absolutely stable and so are\nexcellent candidates to be associated with dark matter and/or dark energy. If\nthere is a portal to such particles, from a new scalar A1 boson they might be\ncascade emitted as a pair of para-Majorana neutrinos as in A1 ---> A2 para-nu\npara-nu or as a pair of neutral spin-zero paraparticles such as in A1 ---> A2\npara-A para-B, where para-B is the anti-paraparticle to para-A.

The expected signature will be a kink in the electron energy\nspectrum in tritium beta-decay. In this article we consider the systematic\neffect of electron backscattering on the detector used in the spectrometer. For\nthis purpose we provide a set of Monte-Carlo simulation results of electron\nbackscattering on a silicon detector with a thin golden window with realistic\nelectric and magnetic fields in the spectrometer. We have found that the\nprobability of such an effect reaches up to 20-30\\%. The scattered electron\ncould be reflected backwards to the detector by electrostatic field or by\nmagnetic mirror. There is also a few percent probability to escape from the\nspectrometer through its entrance.

Since the classically conformal symmetry forbids all dimensional\nparameters in the model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry is broken by the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass terms of the U(1)' gauge boson\n($Z$' boson) and the right-handed neutrinos. Through a mixing quartic coupling\nbetween the U(1)' Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet field, the radiative\nU(1)' gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the breaking of the electroweak\nsymmetry. In this model context, we first investigate the electroweak vacuum\ninstability problem in the SM. Employing the renormalization group equations at\nthe two-loop level and the central values for the world average masses of the\ntop quark ($m_t=173.34$ GeV) and the Higgs boson ($m_h=125.09$ GeV), we perform\nparameter scans to identify the parameter region for resolving the electroweak\nvacuum instability problem.

We consider a\n5-dimensional (5D) framework of the MSSM with the Randall-Sundrum warped\nbackground metric, and show that such a mass hierarchy is naturally achieved in\nterms of geometry. In our setup, the supersymmetry is broken at the ultraviolet\n(UV) brane, while all the MSSM multiplets reside in the 5D bulk.

Such events would be\nobservationally indistinguishable from neutral current deep-inelastic\nscattering events due to neutrinos. Consequently, one reason for deviations,\nbreaks or excesses in the expected astrophysical power-law neutrino spectrum\ncould be the flux of such a particle. Motivated by features in the recent\n1347-day IceCube high energy starting event data (HESE), we focus on particular\nboosted dark matter ($\\chi$) related realizations of this premise. Here, $\\chi$\nis assumed to be much lighter than, and the result of, the slow decay of a\nmassive scalar ($\\phi$) which constitutes a major fraction of the Universe's\ndark matter. We show that this hypothesis, coupled with a standard power-law\nastrophysical neutrino flux is capable of providing very good fits to the\npresent data, along with a possible explanation of other features in the HESE\nsample.

Various dark sector models exist, among which the\ncontribution of the dark sector neutrinos to the VMB experiment is examined.\nThe contribution comes from the mixing of photon with the dark sector Z boson\nand violates parity, thus inducing a parity-violating electromagnetic\ninteraction.

Tetraquarks in this framework can have two spin configurations\ncontaining either spin-0 diquark or spin-1 diquark and each configuration forms\na nonet in flavor space.

Instead, what is presented in\nthis paper is a test of one of the predictions of CPT conservation, i.e., the\nsame mass and mixing parameters in neutrinos and antineutrinos. In order to do\nthat we calculate the current CPT bound on all the neutrino mixing parameters\nand study the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to such an observable.\n  After deriving the most updated bound on CPT from neutrino oscillation data,\nwe show that, if the recent T2K results turn out to be the true values of\nneutrino and antineutrino oscillations, DUNE would measure the fallout of CPT\nconservation at more than 3$\\sigma$.

The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution.

Measuring the\npolarizations of quarks produced in new physics processes, once discovered, can\nprovide crucial information about the new physics Lagrangian. In a series of\nrecent papers, we have investigated how quark polarization measurements can be\ndone in practice.

We consider\nthe possibility that black hole formation happens when the flux of neutrinos is\nstill measurably high. If this occurs, then the neutrino signal from the\nsupernova will be terminated abruptly (the transition takes $\\lesssim 0.5$ ms).\nThe properties and duration of the signal before the cutoff are important\nmeasures of both the physics and astrophysics of the cooling proto-neutron\nstar. For the event rates expected in present and proposed detectors, the\ncutoff will generally appear sharp, thus allowing model-independent\ntime-of-flight mass tests for the neutrinos after the cutoff. If black hole\nformation occurs relatively early, within a few ($\\sim 1$) seconds after core\ncollapse, then the expected luminosities are of order $L_{BH} = 10^{52}$ erg/s\nper flavor.

The least important processes are neutrino-neutrino scattering\nand e^+ e^- annihilation. The formation of the spectra and fluxes of nu_mu is\ndominated by the nucleonic processes, i.e. bremsstrahlung and elastic\nscattering with recoil, but also nu_e nu_e-bar annihilation and nu_mu e^\\pm\nscattering contribute significantly.

We point out a key quantity, the\n\"total effective energy\", which is conserved in several important regimes.\nUsing this concept, we analyze collective neutrino and antineutrino flavor\noscillation in the \"synchronized\" mode and what we term the \"bi-polar\" mode. We\nthereby are able to explain why large collective flavor mixing can develop on\nshort timescales even when vacuum mixing angles are small in, e.g., a dense gas\nof initially pure $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$ with an inverted neutrino mass\nhierarchy (an example of bi-polar oscillation). In the context of the spin\nprecession analogy, we find that the co-rotating frame provides insights into\nmore general systems, where either the synchronized or bi-polar modes could\narise. For example, we use the co-rotating frame to demonstrate how large\nflavor mixing in the bi-polar mode can occur in the presence of a large and\ndominant matter background. We use the adiabatic condition to derive a simple\ncriterion for determining whether the synchronized or bi-polar mode will occur.\nBased on this criterion we predict that neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted\nfrom a proto-neutron star in a core-collapse supernova event can experience\nsynchronized and bi-polar flavor transformations in sequence before\nconventional Mikhyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) flavor evolution takes over.\nThis certainly will affect the analyses of future supernova neutrino signals,\nand might affect the treatment of shock re-heating rates and nucleosynthesis\ndepending on the depth at which collective transformation arises. \n\n"}

There is only a weak (tens of\nper cent) dependence on the power \\beta describing the growth of the supernova\nrate with the redshift. Different original neutrino spectra correspond to large\ndifferences in the observed spectrum of events at a water Cerenkov detector:\nfor typical supernova rates, the ratio of the numbers of events in the first\nand second energy bins (of 5 MeV width) varies in the interval 1.5 - 4.3 for\npure water (energy threshold 18 MeV) and in the range 1 - 2.5 for water with\nGadolinium (10 MeV threshold).

Still the flavor\ndependence of the nucleon's spin is a significant fundamental question that is\nnot understood. Experiments measuring the spin content of the nucleon have\nreported conflicting results on the amount of nucleon spin carried by strange\nquarks. Quasi-elastic neutrino scattering, observed using a novel detection\ntechnique, provides a theoretically clean measure of this quantity.\n  The optimum neutrino beam energy needed to measure the strange spin of the\nnucleon is 1 GeV. This is also an ideal energy to search for neutrino\noscillations at high $\\Delta m^2$ in an astrophysically interesting region.\nModels of the r-process in supernovae which include high-mass sterile neutrinos\nmay explain the abundance of neutron-rich heavy metals in the universe.

Applications include\nthe chargino and neutralino sectors, the Higgs sector and how its results\nchange when phases are included, measuring the (relative) gluino phase, CP\nviolation in K and B systems and whether all CP violation can be due to soft\nphases, how to learn if the LSP is the cold dark matter of the universe, and\nbaryogenesis.

This includes the 45 and 54 representations, and holds regardless of\nthe affine level at which SO(10) is realized.

In the present work we argue that the interpretation of the\nexperimental data presented at the Quark Matter Conference is not correct and\nthat Brown-Rho scaling is valid.

For the elementary neutrino-nucleon interaction,\nwe take into account quasielastic scattering, Delta excitation and the\nexcitation of the resonances in the second resonance region. Our model for the\nneutrino-nucleus collisions includes in-medium effects such as Fermi motion,\nPauli blocking, nuclear binding, and final-state interactions. They are\nimplemented by means of the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU)\ncoupled-channel transport model.

We find that final-state\ninteractions modify considerably the distributions through rescattering,\ncharge-exchange and absorption. Side-feeding induced by charge-exchange\nscattering is important in both cases. In the case of pions, there is a strong\nabsorption associated with the in-medium pionless decay modes of the Delta,\nwhile nucleon knockout exhibits a considerable enhancement of low energy\nnucleons due to rescattering.
