The\nsingle-cycle propagation equations in the temporal domain including\nhigher-order nonlinear terms are presented. The balance between the quadratic\n(SHG) and the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity plays a crucial role: we define an\neffective soliton number -- related to the difference between the SHG and the\nKerr soliton numbers -- and show that it has to be larger than unity for\nsuccessful pulse compression to take place. This requires that the phase\nmismatch be below a critical level, which is high in a material where the\nquadratic nonlinearity dominates over the cubic Kerr nonlinearity. Through\nextensive numerical simulations we find dimensionless scaling laws, expressed\nthrough the effective soliton number, which control the behaviour of the\ncompressed pulses. These laws hold in the stationary regime, in which\ngroup-velocity mismatch effects are small, and they are similar to the ones\nobserved for fiber soliton compressors.

We analyze three such cases of failure.\n  First, a simple generalization of the Abraham and Minkowski momenta to\ndispersive media entails multiplying each per-photon momentum by $n/n_g$, where\n$n$ is the refractive index and $n_g$ is the group index. The resulting forms\nare experimentally relevant for the case of the Abraham momentum, but not for\nthe Minkowski momentum. We show how dispersion modulates the displacement of a\nsphere embedded in a dispersive medium by a pulse.\n  Second, pulse transformation in a nonstationary medium is modulated by the\npresence of dispersion. Using an explicit description of the kinetics of\ndispersive nonstationary inhomogeneous media, we show how the group velocity\ncan modulate pulse response to a change in the refractive index and how Doppler\nshifts may become large in a dispersive medium as the velocity of the Doppler\nshifting surface approaches the group velocity. We explain a simple way to use\nexisting technology to either compress or decompress a given pulse, changing\nits bandwidth and spatial extent by several orders of magnitude while otherwise\npreserving its envelope shape.\n  Finally, we note that the nature of a single optical cavity quasimode depends\non intracavity dispersion.

For a well-chosen mode in\na high-Q cavity, this can amount to either an increase or a decrease in total\nvacuum field energy by several orders of magnitude.

To this\nend, we performed numerical simulations of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for a H$_2^+$ model ion interacting with two time-delayed laser\npulses. The scenario considered corresponds to a pump-probe scheme, in which\nthe first (pump) pulse excites the molecular ion to the first excited\ndissociative state and the second (probe) pulse ionizes the electron as the ion\ndissociates. The results of our numerical simulations for the ionization yield\nas a function of the time delay between the two pulses exhibit characteristic\noscillations due to interferences between the partial electron waves emerging\nfrom the two protons in the dissociating hydrogen molecular ion.

Laser cooling of atoms and molecules largely relies on\nthe internal level structure of the species being cooled. As a result, only a\nsmall number of elements and a tiny number of molecules can be cooled this way.\nIn the case of micromirrors, the problem lies in the engineering of\nmicromirrors that need to satisfy a large number of constraints---these include\na high mechanical Q-factor, high reflectivity and very good optical quality,\nweak coupling to the substrate, etc.---in order to enable efficient cooling.\nDuring the course of this thesis, I will draw these two sides of laser cooling\ncloser together by means of a single, generically applicable scattering theory\nthat can be used to explain the interaction between light and matter at a very\ngeneral level.

We first investigate a\nreference case where linear coupling among the spatial modes of the fiber is\nweak and after averaging over birefringence fluctuations, we obtain new Manakov\nequations for multimode fibers. Such an averaging reduces the number of\nintermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms average\nout. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their\neffectiveness is reduced.

We also present an exact formalism based on multipole\nexpansions and scattering matrices to determine the optical response of a metal\nsphere on a dielectric substrate of finite thickness, taking into account\nretardation and nonlocal effects. We find that the substrate-based calculations\nshow a similar-sized blueshift as calculations based on a sphere in a\nhomogeneous environment, and that they both agree qualitatively with the EELS\nmeasurements. \n\n"}

The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances\ncomparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range.\nFor vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold\nenhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the\nwavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the\nspontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no\ncorrelation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS.\nAt any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a\nclosely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i.e., by\nthe static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic\ninverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media.\nGeneralizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak\nabsorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two\nmain theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy\ntransfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS.

The optical trapping mechanism is based on the\ninteraction energy of a dipole and the electric field of the laser light. In\natom trapping, the dominant contribution typically comes from the allowed\noptical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic\nparticles it is given by the bulk polarizability of the material. These two\ndifferent regimes of optical trapping have coexisted for decades without any\ndirect link, resulting in two very different contexts of applications: one\nbeing the trapping of small objects mainly in biological settings, the other\none being dipole traps for individual neutral atoms in the field of quantum\noptics.

In particular, high-sensitivity spectroscopic\ntechniques based on high-finesse mid-IR cavities hold high promise for medical\napplications. Due to exceptional purity and low losses, whispering gallery mode\nmicroresonators based on polished alkaline earth metal fluoride crystals (i.e\nthe $\\mathrm{XF_2}$ family, where X $=$ Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr,...) have attained\nultra-high quality (Q) factor resonances (Q$>$10$^{8}$) in the near-IR and\nvisible spectral ranges.

Using an uncoated chalcogenide\n(ChG) tapered fiber, light from a continuous wave quantum cascade laser (QCL)\nis efficiently coupled to several crystalline microresonators at 4.4 $\\mu$m\nwavelength. We measure the optical Q factor of fluoride crystals in the mid-IR\nusing cavity ringdown technique. We observe that $\\mathrm{MgF_2}$\nmicroresonators feature quality factors that are very close to the fundamental\nabsorption limit, as caused by the crystal's multiphonon absorption\n(Q$\\sim$10$^{7}$), in contrast to near-IR measurements far away from these\nfundamental limits.

Here we extend this to a more general problem of estimating the length\nof an incoherently radiating extended (line) object. We find, as expected by\nthe Rayleigh criterion, the Fisher information (FI) per integrated photon\nvanishes in the limit of small length for ideal image plane direct detection.\nConversely, for a Hermite-Gaussian (HG) pre-detection mode sorter, this\nnormalized FI does not decrease with decreasing object length, similar to the\ntwo point object case. However, unlike in the two-object problem, the FI per\nphoton of both detection strategies gradually decreases as the object length\ngreatly exceeds the Rayleigh limit, due to the relative inefficiency of\ninformation provided by photons emanating from near the center of the object\nabout its length. We evaluate the quantum Fisher information per unit\nintegrated photons and find that the HG mode sorter exactly achieves this limit\nat all values of the object length. Further, a simple binary mode sorter\nmaintains the advantage of the full mode sorter at highly sub-Rayleigh length.\nIn addition to this FI analysis, we quantify improvement in terms of the actual\nmean squared error of the length estimate.

On the other hand, for low\nrefractive index colloidal polystyrene suspensions, the dependent scattering\nmechanism mainly involves the far-field interference effect, and the effective\nexciting field amplitude for electric dipole almost remains unchanged under\ndifferent structural correlations. The present study has profound implications\nfor understanding the role of structural correlations in dependent scattering\nmechanism. \n\n"}

The advantage of the tunneling injection\nprocess stems from the fact that it avoids hot carrier injection, which is a\nkey performance-limiting factor in all semiconductor lasers. The tunneling\ninjection process is not fully understood microscopically and therefore it is\ndifficult to optimize those laser structures. We present here a numerical study\nof the broad band carrier dynamics in a tunneling injection quantum dot gain\nmedium in the form of an optical amplifier operating at 1.55 um. Charge carrier\ntunneling occurs in a hybrid state that joins the quantum dot first excited\nstate and the confined quantum well - injection well states. The hybrid state,\nwhich is placed energetically roughly one LO phonon above the ground state and\nhas a spectral extent of about 5 meV , dominates the carrier injection to the\nground state.

We\nobtain experimental evidence for our theory with quantitative measurements of\nSmith--Purcell radiation. Our framework allows us to make two predictions. One\nis a new regime of radiation operation---at subwavelength separations, slower\n(nonrelativistic) electrons can achieve stronger radiation than fast\n(relativistic) electrons. The second is a divergence of the emission\nprobability in the limit of lossless materials. We further reveal that such\ndivergences can be approached by coupling free electrons to photonic bound\nstates in the continuum (BICs). Our findings suggest that compact and efficient\nfree-electron radiation sources from microwaves to the soft X-ray regime may be\nachievable without requiring ultrahigh accelerating voltages. \n\n"}

These noise-like patterns are characterized by strong statistical\nproperties, such as the so-called memory effect, which are at the core of\nimaging techniques for applications as diverse as tissue imaging, motion\ntracking, and non-line-of-sight imaging. Our framework allows for these\nproperties to be replicated computationally, in a way that is orders of\nmagnitude more efficient than alternatives based on directly solving the wave\nequations. At the core of our framework is a path-space formulation for the\ncovariance of speckle patterns arising from a scattering volume, which we\nderive from first principles. We use this formulation to develop two Monte\nCarlo rendering algorithms, for computing speckle covariance as well as\ndirectly speckle fields.

When many parametric oscillators are coupled\ndissipatively, they can be analogous to networks of Ising spins, forming an\neffective coherent Ising machine (CIM) that efficiently solves computationally\nhard optimization problems. In the companion paper, we studied experimentally\nthe minimal realization of a CIM, i.e. two coupled parametric oscillators [L.\nBello, M. Calvanese Strinati, E. G. Dalla Torre, and A. Pe'er, Phys.

We found that the presence of an energy-conserving\ncoupling between the oscillators can dramatically change the dynamics, leading\nto everlasting beats, which transcend the Ising description. Here, we analyze\nthis effect theoretically by solving numerically and, when possible,\nanalytically the equations of motion of two parametric oscillators.

For microwave photonic applications such as filters, coherent\nradars, subnoise detection, optical communications and low-noise microwave\ngeneration, frequency combs are key building blocks.

A\ncrucial role is played by the fact that gap solitons may feature a negative\ndynamical mass, keeping their mobility in the OL. First, the respective system\nof coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) is reduced to a system of\nequations for envelopes of the lattice wave functions. Two generic dynamical\nregimes are revealed by simulations of the reduced system, viz., shuttle\noscillations of pairs of solitons with positive and negative masses, and\nsplitting of the pair. The co-accelerating motion of the interacting solitons,\nwhich keeps constant separation between them, occurs at the boundary between\nthe shuttle motion and splitting.

The approach relies on operator algebra to derive an equation for the\nfrequency shifts, which eventually turn out in a simple and physically sound\nform. Numerically the equations are well-behaved, easy implementable, and can\nbe solved very fast. Like in perturbation theory a reference system is first\nconsidered, which then subsequently is used to solve another related, but\ndifferent system. For our method precision is only limited by the reference\nsystem basis functions and the error induced in frequency is of second order\nfor first-order basis set error. As an example we apply our method to the\nproblem of variations in the air-hole diameter in a photonic crystal fiber. \n\n"}

With the progress of technology and\nof experimental science, this assumption is no longer true. Yet, information in\nthe literature is scarce or absent. This report describes the measurement of\nthe AM noise of rf/microwave sources in terms of Salpha(f), i.e., the power\nspectrum density of the fractional amplitude fluctuation alpha. The proposed\nschemes make use of commercial power detectors based on Schottky and tunnel\ndiodes, in single-channel and correlation configuration. There follow the\nanalysis of the front-end amplifier at the detector output, the analysis of the\nmethods for the measurement of the power-detector noise, and a digression about\nthe calibration procedures. The measurement methods are extended to the\nrelative intensity noise (RIN) of optical beams, and to the AM noise of the\nrf/microwave modulation in photonic systems. Some rf/microwave synthesizers and\noscillators have been measured, using correlation and moderate averaging. As an\nexample, the flicker noise of a low-noise quartz oscillator (Wenzel 501-04623E)\nis Salpha = 1.15E-13/f, which is equivalent to an Allan deviation of\nsigma_alpha = 4E-7.
