The observed incidence\nrate of DLAs together with the observed space density and size distribution of\nthe emitters suggest a duty cycle of ~ 0.2 - 0.4 for the Ly alpha emission from\nDLA host galaxies. We further show that Ly alpha cooling is expected to\ncontribute little to the Ly alpha emission for the majority of emitters.

The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the\nannihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale\nannihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe.\nIf the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass\ncan force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a\nnon-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and\nsplittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m_phi ~\nMeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to\nexplain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the\nINTEGRAL satellite.

Massive stars in\nnewly formed or primordial globular clusters could have played an important\nrole during the epoch of cosmological reionisation (z>~6) as sources of\nenergetic, neutral hydrogen ionising UV photons. We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray\nbackground at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate\nthe total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast\nthis with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main\nsequence lives. For reasonable estimates, we find that the bolometric\nluminosity of the cluster peaks at ~10^42 erg/s during the first few million\nyears, but declines to ~10^41 erg/s after ~5 million years as the most massive\nstars evolve off the main sequence. From this time onwards, the total\nbolometric luminosity is dominated by HMXBs and falls gradually to ~10^40 erg/s\nafter ~50 million years. Assuming a power-law spectral energy distribution for\nthe HMXBs, we calculate the effective number of neutral hydrogen ionisations\nper HMXB and show that HMXBs can be as important as sources of ionising\nradiation as massive stars.

We then show that using the\nTrans-Planckian ansatz (as a quantum gravity effect) close to the black hole\nhorizon, leads to an accelerating cosmological solution, far from the horizon.\nInterestingly, this acceleration matches current observations for stellar mass\nblack holes. Based on our current understanding of the black hole accretion\nhistory in the Universe, we then make a prediction for how the effective dark\nenergy density should evolve with redshift, which can be tested with future\ndark energy probes. \n\n"}

The optical spectrum of this object exhibits\nrather narrow Hbeta (FWHM(Hbeta) ~ 1500 km s^-1), weak forbidden lines and is\ntherefore classified as a narrow-line type I quasar. This class of objects is\nthought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at high\nEddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core\nindicates the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi simultaneous\nradio-optical-X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented.

The high-mass cutoff of the halo mass function\ntakes the same form as the one obtained from the Press-Schechter formalism, but\nwith a linear threshold $\\delta_L$ that depends on the definition of the halo.\nWe show that a simple formula, which obeys this high-mass asymptotic and uses\nthe fit obtained for Gaussian initial conditions, matches numerical simulations\nwhile keeping the mass function normalized to unity. Next, by deriving the\nreal-space halo two-point correlation in the spirit of Kaiser (1984) and taking\na Fourier transform, we obtain good agreement with simulations for the\ncorrection to the halo bias due to primordial non-Gaussianity. Therefore,\nneither the halo mass function nor the bias require an ad-hoc parameter $q$\nprovided one uses the correct linear threshold $\\delta_L$ and pays attention to\nhalo displacements.

In the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs, this common\norigin is mass accretion episodes of fall-back matter on a newly born compact\nobject. The prompt emission pulses are produced by a bipolar jet of highly\nrelativistic plasmoids (CBs) ejected in the early, major episodes of mass\naccretion. As the accretion material is consumed, one may expect the engine's\nactivity to weaken. X-ray flares ending the prompt emission and during the\nafterglow phase are produced in such delayed episodes of mass accretion. The\ncommon engine, environment and radiation mechanisms (inverse Compton scattering\nand synchrotron radiation) produce their observed similarities. Flares in both\nlong GRBs and short hard gamma ray bursts (SHBs) can also be produced by\nbipolar ejections of CBs following a phase transition in compact objects due to\nloss of angular momentum and/or cooling. Optical flares, however, are mostly\nproduced in collisions of CBs with massive stellar winds/ejecta or with density\nbumps along their path.

Broadband (4-200 keV)\nspectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard\nspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft\nstate. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during\nthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the\nsoftening in the hard intermediate state.

Assuming the\nelectrical neutrality and beta equilibrium for the stellar matter, we have\nstudied how the density dependence of lepton chemical potentials varies for\ndifferent models of nuclear interactions that are constrained by experiments up\nto nuclear matter density, n_0, but extrapolate differently(unconstrained)\nbeyond n_0 and calculated the relative abundances of nucleons(neutron and\nproton) and leptons(electron and muon) and their density dependencies. We find\nthat the density dependence of the electron chemical potential is strongly\ndependent on the structure of the nuclear symmetry energy relevant to\nsoftness/stfness of the nuclear matter EOS that measures the energy relevant to\nthe neutron-proton asymmetry. As a consequence, the relative abundances of\nneutrons, protons, electrons, and muons as well as the kaon condensation are\nstrongly dependent on the nuclear symmetry energy. An intriguing result in our\nfinding is that contrary to the accepted lore, kaon condensation in neutron\nstar matter, which is considered to be the first phase transitions beyond n_0\nand plays a crucial role in certain scenarios of compact-star formation, is not\ndirectly tied to the softness or stiffness of the EOS beyond n_0.

We find bursts with a wide variety of characteristics in\nserendipitous wide-field X-ray observations by EURECA/WATCH, RXTE/ASM,\nBeppoSAX/WFC, HETE-2/FREGATE, INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI, and Swift/BAT, as well as\npointed observations by RXTE/PCA and HEXTE. Most of them reach a peak flux of\n~15 Crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a Crab. One of the bursts\nshows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. This allows us to\nevaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. The burst durations are between\n10 sec to 5 min. However, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, a\nfaint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. One\nvery long burst lasted for several hours. This superburst candidate was\nfollowed by a normal type-I burst only 19 days later. This is, to our\nknowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. A superburst\nin this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% L_Edd. The\nintermediate-duration bursts occurred when 4U 0614+091's persistent emission\nwas lowest and calm, and when bursts were infrequent (on average one every\nmonth to 3 months). The average burst rate increased significantly after this\nperiod. The maximum average burst recurrence rate is once every week to 2\nweeks. The burst behaviour may be partly understood if there is at least an\nappreciable amount of helium present in the accreted material from the donor\nstar.

Pushed by evidence of\nslow rotation prior to core-collapse, we focus on asphericities in neutrino\nemission and matter motions outside the protoneutron star. Based on the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) models, which mimic SASI-aided neutrino heating\nexplosions, we compute the neutrino anisotropies via the ray-tracing method in\na post-processing manner and calculate the resulting waveforms. With these\ncomputations, it is found that the waveforms exhibit more variety in contrast\nto the ones previously estimated by the ray-by-ray analysis (e.g., Kotake et\nal. (2007)). In addition to a positively growing feature, which was predicted\nto determine the total wave amplitudes predominantly, the waveforms are shown\nto exhibit large negative growth for some epochs during the growth of SASI.\nThese features are found to stem from the excess of neutrino emission in\nlateral directions, which can be precisely captured by the ray-tracing\ncalculation. Due to the negative contributions and the neutrino absorptions\nappropriately taken into account by the ray-tracing method, the wave amplitudes\nbecome more than one-order-of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation,\nthus making their detections very hard for a galactic source.On the other hand,\nit is pointed out that the GW spectrum from matter motions have its peak near\n$\\sim 100$ Hz, which could be characteristic for the SASI-induced supernova\nexplosions.(abridged) \n\n"}

Normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z,\nbecause Inverse Compton (IC) losses off the CMB cool CR electrons and positrons\nrapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. However, we find that\nthis effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because\nescape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this\neffect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of\nstar-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between\nmagnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also\ncompete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical\nredshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0\nFRC as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. Additionally, we\nprovide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some\nhigh-z submillimeter galaxies.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal.

To avoid missing these signals or biasing parameter estimation it\nis important that we consider waveform models that account for eccentricity.\nThe ingredients needed to compute post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms produced by\nspinning black holes inspiralling on quasi-eccentric orbits have been available\nfor almost two decades at 2 PN order, and this work has recently been extended\nto 2.5 PN order. However, the computational cost of directly implementing these\nwaveforms is high, requiring many steps per orbit to evolve the system of\ncoupled differential equations. Here we employ the standard techniques of a\nseparation of timescales and a generalized Keplerian parameterization of the\norbits to produce efficient waveforms describing spinning black hole binaries\nwith arbitrary masses and spins on quasi-eccentric orbits to 1.5 PN order. We\nseparate the fast orbital timescale from the slow spin-orbit precession\ntimescale by solving for the orbital motion in a non-interial frame of\nreference that follows the orbital precession.

The\nperspectives offered by the capture of stars by supermassive black holes are to\nbe cherished, because the study of the motion of falling stars will constitute\na giant step forward in the understanding of gravitation in the regime of\nstrong field. After an account on the perception of free fall in ancient times\nand on the behaviour of a gravitating mass in Newtonian physics, this chapter\ndeals with last century debate on the repulsion for a Schwarzschild black hole\nand mentions the issue of an infalling particle velocity at the horizon.\nFurther, black hole perturbations and numerical methods are presented, paving\nthe way to the introduction of the self-force and other back-action related\nmethods. The impact of the perturbations on the motion of the falling particle\nis computed via the tail, the back-scattered part of the perturbations, or via\na radiative Green function. In the former approach, the self-force acts upon\nthe background geodesic; in the latter, the geodesic is conceived in the total\n(background plus perturbations) field. Regularisation techniques (mode-sum and\nRiemann-Hurwitz $z$ function) intervene to cancel divergencies coming from the\ninfinitesimal size of the particle. An account is given on the state of the\nart, including the last results obtained in this most classical problem,\ntogether with a perspective encompassing future space gravitational wave\ninterferometry and head-on particle physics experiments. As free fall is\npatently non-adiabatic, it requires the most sophisticated techniques for\nstudying the evolution of the motion. In this scenario, the potential of the\nself-consistent approach, by means of which the background geodesic is\ncontinuously corrected by the self-force contribution, is examined. \n\n"}

We analyse the fraction of the\ngamma-ray-selected Sample G which have detectable radio pulses and the fraction\nof the radio-selected Sample R which have detectable gamma-ray pulses.

The same interaction can lead to dark matter pair\nproduction at a hadron collider, and with the addition of initial state\nradiation this may lead to mono-jet signals. Mono-jet searches at the Tevatron\ncan thus place limits on DM direct detection rates.

Non-standard dark matter candidates are also constrained. The\nintroduction of a light mediator significantly weakens the collider bound. A\ndirect detection discovery that is in apparent conflict with mono-jet limits\nwill thus point to a new light state coupling the standard model to the dark\nsector.

As the\njet advances, the density around the head of the jet decreases, and its Lorentz\nfactor reaches as high as 200 at the photosphere and 400 inside the\nphotosphere. For an on-axis observer, the photosphere appears concave shaped\ndue to the low density and high beaming factor of the jet. The luminosity\nvaries because of the abrupt change in the position of the photosphere due to\nthe internal structure of the jet. Comparing our results with GRB090902B, the\nflux level of the thermal-like component is similar to our model, although the\npeak energy looks a little bit higher (but still within a factor of 2).

During this 11 months period, the source was\ncharacterized by a complex variability at optical, UV and gamma-ray bands, on\ntime scales down to 6-12 hours. The brightest gamma-ray isotropic luminosity,\nrecorded on 2009 March 26, was ~ 2x10^48erg s^-1. The spectrum in the Fermi-LAT\nenergy range shows a mild curvature well described by a log-parabolic law, and\ncan be understood as due to the Klein-Nishina effect. The gamma-ray flux has a\ncomplex correlation with the other wavelengths. There is no correlation at all\nwith the X-ray band, a weak correlation with the UV, and a significant\ncorrelation with the optical flux. The gamma-ray flux seems to lead the optical\none by about 13 days. From the UV photometry we estimated a black hole mass of\n~ 5.4x10^8 solar masses, and an accretion rate of ~ 0.5 solar masses/year.\nAlthough the power in the thermal and non-thermal outputs is smaller compared\nto the very luminous and distant flat spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089\nexhibits a quite large Compton dominance and a prominent big blue bump (BBB) as\nobserved in the most powerful gamma-ray quasars.

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed. Both\nkinematic studies and completeness-correction studies seem to point to a\ncharacteristic potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close\nto the mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy\nformation. Among the more pressing problems associated with this interpretation\nis to understand the selection biases that limit our ability to detect the\nlowest mass galaxies. The least massive satellite halos are likely to host\nstealth galaxies with very-low surface brightness and this may be an important\nlimitation in the hunt for low-mass fossils from the epoch of reionization. \n\n"}

There is strong tension\nbetween getting a large enough lepton signal while respecting constraints on\nthe fluxes of associated gamma rays. We first show that these constraints\nbecome significantly more stringent than in previous studies when the\ncontributions from background e^+ e^- are taken into account, so much so that\neven cored DM density profiles are ruled out. We then show how DM annihilations\nwithin subhalos can get around these constraints. Specifically, if most of the\nobserved lepton excess comes from annihilations in a nearby (within 1 kpc)\nsubhalo along a line of sight toward the galactic center, it is possible to\nmatch both the lepton and gamma ray observations. We demonstrate that this can\nbe achieved in a simple class of particle physics models in which the DM\nannihilates via a hidden leptophilic U(1) vector boson, with explicitly\ncomputed Sommerfeld enhancement factors.

GeV\ngamma-ray pulsations from both were discovered using the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope. Twelve years of radio and polarization data allow detailed\ninvestigations. The two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and in\ngamma-ray data. Both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset far\nfrom the radio peak. The high dispersion measure for PSR J0248+6021 (DM = 370\npc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant HII region W5\nin the Perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the Galaxy as\nobtained from models of average electron distributions. Its high transverse\nvelocity and the low magnetic field along the line-of-sight favor this small\ndistance. Neither gamma-ray, X-ray, nor optical data yield evidence for a\npulsar wind nebula surrounding PSR J0248+6021.

Extreme cases,\nsuch as the case with the maximum compression ratio that corresponds to\ngamma=1.1, are examined. As gamma decreases, the shock compression ratio rises,\nand an increasingly narrow inter shock region with a more pronounced initial\nmixture of R-T unstable gas is produced. Consequently, the remnant outline may\nbe perturbed by small-amplitude, small-wavelength bumps. However, as the\ninstability decays over time, the extent of convective mixing in terms of the\nratio of the radius of the R-T fingers to the blast wave does not strongly\ndepend on the value of gamma for gamma >= 1.2. As a result of the age of the\nremnant, the unstable gas cannot extend sufficiently far to form metal-enriched\nfilaments of ejecta material close to the periphery of Tycho's supernova\nremnant. The consistency of the dynamic properties of Tycho's remnant with the\nadiabatic model gamma=5/3 reveals that the injection of cosmic rays is too weak\nto alter the shock structure.

We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of\nMrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon\nindex of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with\nthe Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral\nvariability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy\nrange is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20.

The\naverage spectral energy distribution of Mrk 501 is well described by the\nstandard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. In the framework of this\nmodel, we find that the dominant emission region is characterized by a size <~\n0.1 pc (comparable within a factor of few to the size of the partially-resolved\nVLBA core at 15-43 GHz), and that the total jet power (~10^{44} erg s^{-1})\nconstitutes only a small fraction (~10^{-3}) of the Eddington luminosity.

For an\naccretion rate that corresponds to the inferred jet power, and to a fit of the\nobserved SED by an ADAF model, the density of injected pairs is found to be\nsmaller than the Goldreich-Julian density by a factor of a few.

This is\ndue in part to the proximity of a hot soft photon bath from the stellar surface\nto putative radiation dissipation regions in the inner magnetosphere. Moreover,\nbecause the scattering process becomes resonant at the cyclotron frequency, the\neffective cross section exceeds the classical Thomson value by over two orders\nof magnitude, thereby enhancing the efficiency of continuum production and the\ncooling of relativistic electrons. This paper presents computations of the\nelectron cooling rates for this process, which are needed for resonant Compton\nmodels of non-thermal radiation from such highly-magnetized pulsars. The\ncomputed rates extend previous calculations of magnetic Thomson cooling to the\ndomain of relativistic quantum effects, sampled near and above the quantum\ncritical magnetic field of 44.13 TeraGauss.

However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other\ncandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor\nand Segue 1, might be better options.

By starting from a torus threaded with weak toroidal magnetic\nfields and by controlling the central density of the initial torus, rho_0, we\ncan reproduce three distinct modes of accretion flow. In model A with the\nhighest central density, an optically and geometrically thick supercritical\naccretion disk is created. The radiation force greatly exceeds the gravity\nabove the disk surface, thereby driving a strong outflow (or jet). Because of\nthe mild beaming, the apparent (isotropic) photon luminosity is ~22L_E (where\nL_E is the Eddington luminosity) in the face-on view. Even higher apparent\nluminosity is feasible if we increase the flow density. In model B with a\nmoderate density, radiative cooling of the accretion flow is so efficient that\na standard-type, cold, and geometrically thin disk is formed at radii greater\nthan ~7R_S (where R_S is the Schwarzschild radius), while the flow is\nradiatively inefficient otherwise.

The flow thus becomes radiatively inefficient accretion\nflow, which is geometrically thick and optically thin.

Our\nanalysis is concentrated on a detailed numerical investigation of hot\ntwo-dimensional, Bondi-Hoyle accretion flows with various Mach numbers.

The beaming effect is due\nto the increase (decrease) of the brightness of any light source approaching\n(receding from) the observer. To first order, the beaming and the\nreflection/heating effects modulate the stellar brightness at the orbital\nperiod, with phases separated by a quarter of a period, whereas the ellipsoidal\neffect is modulated with the orbital first harmonic. The phase and harmonic\ndifferences between the three modulations allow the algorithm to search for a\ncombination of the three effects and identify stellar candidates for low-mass\ncompanions. The paper presents the algorithm, including an assignment of a\nlikelihood factor to any possible detection, based on the expected ratio of the\nbeaming and ellipsoidal effects, given an order-of-magnitude estimate of the\nthree effects.

The absorption of electron-type\nneutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the\n\"neutrino mechanism\"). Because the heating rate is proportional to the square\nof neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-type\nneutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (CnuO) may in principle increase\nthe heating rate and drive explosions. In order to assess the potential\nimportance of CnuO for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundary\nvalue problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the PNS surface (r_nu)\nand the shock (r_S), including a scheme for flavor conversion via CnuO. For a\ngiven r_nu, PNS mass (M), accretion rate (Mdot), and assumed values of the\nneutrino energies from the PNS, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosity\nabove which accretion is impossible and explosion results. We show that CnuO\ncan decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only if\nthe flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_S and if there is no matter\nsuppression. The magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (M,\nMdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavor\nconversion. We quantify these dependencies and find that CnuO could lower the\ncritical luminosity only for small M and Mdot, and large r_nu. However, for\nthese parameter values CnuO are suppressed due to matter effects. By\nquantifying the importance of CnuO and matter suppression at the critical\nneutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studies\nthat CnuO are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse\nsupernovae significantly. \n\n"}

At higher redshifts, the PTA error boxes are larger, and may\ncontain as many as 100 massive-galaxy interlopers.

This scheme combines\ntools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which\nprovides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and\ncurrent octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since\nwe are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for\nthe computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH\nperturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of\nself-adjusting Kerr geodesics.

Once present CMB\ndata are combined with external information about, e.g., the Hubble parameter,\nthe difference between the methods becomes small compared to the uncertainty of\nN_eff.

Most of the work on the earliest enrichment was carried out\nassuming that the first stars were extremely massive and that the associated\nsupernovae were unusually energetic, enough to completely unbind the baryons in\nthe host cosmic minihalo and disperse the synthesized metals into the\nintergalactic medium. Recent work, however, suggests that the first stars may\nin fact have been somewhat less massive, with a characteristic mass scale of a\nfew tens of solar masses. We present a cosmological simulation following the\ntransport of the metals synthesized in a Population III supernova assuming that\nit had an energy of 1e51 ergs, compatible with standard Type II supernovae. A\nyoung supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic HII region in the\nfree expansion phase and is followed for 40 Myr employing adaptive mesh\nrefinement and Lagrangian tracer particle techniques. The supernova remnant\nremains partially trapped within the minihalo and the thin snowplow shell\ndevelops pronounced instability and fingering. Roughly half of the ejecta turn\naround and fall back toward the center of the halo, with 1% of the ejecta\nreaching the center in 30 kyr and 10% in 10 Myr. The average metallicity of the\ncombined returning ejecta and the pristine filaments feeding into the halo\ncenter from the cosmic web is 0.001 - 0.01 Z_sun, but the two remain unmixed\nuntil accreting onto the central hydrostatic core that is unresolved at the end\nof the simulation.

The optical\nspectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,\nH-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening\nof the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by\nincreasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha\nluminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant\nprogenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict. The [O I] line exhibits double-peaked structure on top of the broader\nunderlying profile, possibly due to emission from individual clumps of ejecta\nor ring-like structures of metal-rich debris.

The ultimate\ngoal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass\nand, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass.\nProbing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a\nlight WIMP in direct and indirect searches.

This effect is especially important in luminous and\nultraluminous infrared galaxies, which are locally rare but dominate the star\nformation at redshifts of z~1-2. We perform a detailed investigation of the SN\nactivity in the nearby luminous infrared galaxy Arp 299 and estimate that up to\n83% of the SNe in Arp 299 and in similar galaxies in the local Universe are\nmissed by observations at optical wavelengths. For rest-frame optical surveys\nwe find the fraction of SNe missed due to high dust extinction to increase from\nthe average local value of ~19% to ~38% at z~1.2 and then stay roughly constant\nup to z~2. It is therefore crucial to take into account the effects of\nobscuration by dust when determining SN rates at high redshift and when\npredicting the number of CCSNe detectable by future high-z surveys such as\nLSST, JWST, and Euclid.

Seven intense gamma-ray\nevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or two\ndays. These durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-ray\nemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than the\nresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid which\nthen cools as it propagates outwards. Cross-correlating the AGILE-GRID light\ncurve with X-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events of\ngamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectral\nX-ray states (RXTE/ASM count rate > 3 counts/s), that coincide with local and\noften sharp minima of the hard X-ray flux (Swift/BAT count rate < 0.02\ncounts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts.

Here we build a simple\ntruncated disc, hot inner flow, plus standard conical synchrotron jet model to\nexplore what this predicts for the X-ray emission mechanism as a function of\nmass accretion rate.\n  We find that the change in X-ray spectral index can be quantitatively (not\njust qualitatively) explained by the seed photon switch in the hot flow i.e.\nthis supports models where the X-rays are always produced by the hot flow. By\ncontrast, standard conical jet models are as radiatively inefficient as the hot\nflow so there is no transition in X-ray production mechanism with $\\dot{m}$.\nIncluding the effects of electron cooling allows the jet X-rays to drop more\nslowly with accretion rate and hence overtake the X-rays from the hot flow,\nhowever this produces a corresponding change in the radio-X-ray correlation,\nwhich is not observed.

First, during the course of our 7.3 hour\nHST observations, the blazar increased in flux rapidly by ~40% (-0.45 mag/h)\nfollowed by a slower decline (+0.36 mag/h) to previous far-UV flux levels. We\nmodel this flare using asymmetric flare templates and constrain the physical\nsize and energetics of the emitting region. Furthermore, the spectral index of\nthe object softens considerably during the course of the flare from\nalpha(nu)=-1.0 to alpha(nu)=-1.4. Second, we constrain the source redshift\ndirectly using the ~30 intervening absorption systems. A system at z=0.2315 is\ndetected in Lya, Lyb, OVI, and NV and defines the lower bound on the source\nredshift. No absorbers are seen in the remaining spectral coverage\n(0.2315<z(Lya)<0.47) and we set a statistical upper bound of z<0.322 (95%\nconfidence) on the blazar.

These sources produce\noutflows of radio-emitting particles whose structure can be imaged with VLBI.\nLS 5039 is a gamma-ray binary that has shown variable VLBI structures in the\npast. We aim to characterise the radio morphological changes of LS 5039 and\ndiscriminate if they are either repeatable or erratic. We observed LS 5039 with\nthe VLBA at 5 GHz during five consecutive days to cover the 3.9-day orbit and\nan extra day to disentangle between orbital or secular variability.

The detection of non-thermal emission from SNRs\ndemonstrates the presence of energetic particles, but direct signatures of\nprotons and other ions remain elusive. If these particles receive a sizeable\nfraction of the explosion energy, the morphological and spectral evolution of\nthe SNR must be modified. To assess this, we run 3D hydrodynamic simulations of\na remnant coupled with a non-linear acceleration model. We obtain the\ntime-dependent evolution of the shocked structure, impacted by the\nRayleigh-Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities at the contact discontinuity and by\nthe back-reaction of particles at the forward shock. We then compute the\nprogressive temperature equilibration and non-equilibrium ionization state of\nthe plasma, and its thermal emission in each cell. This allows us to produce\nthe first realistic synthetic maps of the projected X-ray emission from the\nSNR. Plasma conditions (temperature, ionization age) can vary widely over the\nprojected surface of the SNR, especially between the ejecta and the ambient\nmedium owing to their different composition.

This paper aims to provide signatures\nallowing identification of radiation from low-energy cosmic rays in X-ray\nspectra showing the 6.4 keV line.

Using a model of\nX-ray production by cosmic-ray ions, we obtain a best-fit metallicity of the\nambient medium of 1.7 plus-minus 0.2 times the solar metallicity. A large flux\nof low-energy cosmic ray ions could be produced in the ongoing supersonic\ncollision between the star cluster and an adjacent molecular cloud.

This hyperaccretion disk is optically thin to\nneutrinos in the radial direction, therefore the neutrinos produced at one\nradius can travel for a long distance in the disk. Those neutrinos can thus be\nabsorbed with certain probability by the disk matter at the other radius and\nheat the disk there. The effect of this \"global neutrino heating\" has been\nignored in previous works and is the focus of this paper. We find that around\nthe \"ignition\" radius r_{ign}, the global neutrino heating rate could be\ncomparable to or even larger than the local viscous heating rate thus must be\nan important process. Two possible consequences are in order if the \"global\nneutrino heating\" is taken into account: i) the temperature of the disk is\nslightly raised and the \"ignition\" radius r_{ign} slightly shifts to a larger\nradius, both lead to the increasing of the total neutrino flux; ii) what is\nmore interesting is that, the temperature of the ADAF just beyond r_{ign} may\nbe raised above the virial temperature thus the accretion will be suppressed.\nIn this case, the activity of the black hole is expected to oscillate between\nan active and inactive phases.

If the timescale of the inactive phase is comparable to or\nless than this value, this intermittent activity may explain the slow\nvariability component of the GRBs.

We study the constraints on the formation of such pre-LMXBs in\ndetail (since these are low probability events), and calculate their collective\nproperties and formation rate. To this end, we first consider the changes in\nthe binary parameters in the various steps involved, viz., the common-envelope\n(CE) phase, the supernova, and the tidal evolution.

We analyze\ndeep X-ray observations of the Orion massive star-forming region using the\nChandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) catalog. We studied the stellar\ndistribution as a function of extinction, with cells of 0.03 pc x 0.03 pc, the\ntypical size of protostellar cores. We derived stellar density maps and\ncalculated cluster stellar densities. We found that low-mass stars cluster\ntoward the three massive star-forming regions: the Trapezium Cluster (TC), the\nOrion Hot Core (OHC), and OMC1-S. We derived low-mass stellar densities of\n10^{5} stars pc^{-3} in the TC and OMC1-S, and of 10^{6} stars pc^{-3} in the\nOHC. The close association between the low-mass star clusters with massive star\ncradles supports the role of these clusters in the formation of massive stars.\nThe X-ray observations show for the first time in the TC that low-mass stars\nwith intermediate extinction are clustered toward the position of the most\nmassive star, which is surrounded by a ring of non-extincted low-mass stars.\nThis 'envelope-core' structure is also supported by infrared and optical\nobservations. Our analysis suggests that at least two basic ingredients are\nneeded in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and a cluster of\nlow-mass stars. The scenario that better explains our findings assumes high\nfragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales that forms a\nlow-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion. Finally,\nalthough coalescence does not seem a common mechanism for building up massive\nstars, we show that a single stellar merger may have occurred in the evolution\nof the OHC cluster, favored by the presence of disks, binaries, and gas\naccretion. \n\n"}

Originally classified as a\nhead-tail radio galaxy, the nature of this object is subject of controversy\nsince its nucleus shows blazar-like behavior. Aims. In order to understand the\nnature of IC 310 and the origin of the VHE emission we studied the spectral and\nflux variability of IC 310 from the X-ray band to the VHE gamma-ray regime.\nMethods. The light curve of IC 310 above 300GeV has been measured with the\nMAGIC telescopes from Oct. 2009 to Feb. 2010. Fermi-LAT data (2008-2011) in the\n10-500GeV energy range were also analyzed. In X-ray, archival observations from\n2003 to 2007 with XMM, Chandra, and Swift-XRT in the 0.5-10keV band were\nstudied. Results. The VHE light curve reveals several high-amplitude and\nshort-duration flares. Day-to-day flux variability is clearly present. The\nphoton index between 120GeV and 8TeV remains at the value $\\Gamma\\sim2.0$\nduring both low and high flux states. The VHE spectral shape does not show\nsignificant variability, whereas the flux at 1TeV changes by a factor of\n$\\sim7$.

In this paper, we revisit XENON100's\nconstraint on dark matter in this mass range, and consider how various\nuncertainties and assumptions made might alter this conclusion. We also note\nthat while XENON100's two nuclear recoil candidates each exhibit very low\nratios of ionization-to-scintillation signals, making them difficult to\nattribute to known electronic or neutron backgrounds, they are consistent with\noriginating from dark matter particles in the mass range favored by CoGeNT and\nCDMS.

Many current pulsation codes apply a\nsecond order finite-difference scheme, combined with Richardson extrapolation\nto reach fourth order accuracy on eigenfunctions. Although this is a simple and\nrobust approach, a number of drawbacks exist thus making fourth order schemes\ndesirable. A robust and simple finite-difference scheme, which can easily be\nimplemented in either 1D or 2D stellar pulsation codes is therefore required.\n  Aims: One of the difficulties in setting up higher order finite-difference\nschemes for stellar pulsations is the so-called mesh-drift instability. Current\nways of dealing with this defect include introducing artificial viscosity or\napplying a staggered grids approach. However these remedies are not well-suited\nto eigenvalue problems, especially those involving non-dissipative systems,\nbecause they unduly change the spectrum of the operator, introduce\nsupplementary free parameters, or lead to complications when applying boundary\nconditions.\n  Methods: We propose here a new method, inspired from the staggered grids\nstrategy, which removes this instability while bypassing the above\ndifficulties. Furthermore, this approach lends itself to superconvergence, a\nprocess in which the accuracy of the finite differences is boosted by one\norder.\n  Results: This new approach is shown to be accurate, flexible with respect to\nthe underlying grid, and able to remove mesh-drift. \n\n"}

All of these works have found an apparent intrinsic limitation to\ngeometries that are poloidal-field-dominated, with a toroidal-to-poloidal\nenergy ratio inside the star that are <10%, unless surface currents are\nincluded and magnetic fields are allowed to be discontinuous. This limitation\nis in stark contrast with the general expectation that much higher toroidal\nfields should be present in the stellar interior and casts doubt about the\nstability and hence realism of these configurations.

Our model makes use of\nthe scale factor method, which estimates the ratio of the total number of MSPs\nin the Galaxy to the known sample.

An empirical RFI distribution model is derived that allows the\nsimulation of RFI in radio observations.

With several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniform\ndistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existing\npropagation models.

Most of the scenarios proposed to\nexplain their nature assume that ULXs are powered by accretion on to a black\nhole (BH). In this case, the detection of compact radio emission and the\nlocation of the ULXs in the Fundamental Plane (X-ray versus radio-luminosity\nplane) can provide an estimate of the ULX BH mass and help address the question\nof their physical nature. We present the results of a high-resolution (very\nlong baseline interferometry) radio observational campaign aimed at detecting\nand studying compact radio emission in four ULXs with known radio counterparts.\nWe find that one of the targets (N4559-X4) was previously misclassified: its\nlow X-ray luminosity indicates that the source is not a ULX. No\nmilliarcsec-scale radio emission is detected for N4559-X4 nor for the ULXs\nN4490-X1 and N5194-X2, for which upper limits on the radio luminosities are\nestimated.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars.

As energetic particles traverse\nmatter and electromagnetic fields, they leave marks in the form of neutral\ninteraction products. Among those, gamma rays trace interactions of nuclei that\ninelastically collide with interstellar gas, as well as of leptons that undergo\nBremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton scattering. Data collected by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) are therefore telling us the story of cosmic rays\nalong their journey from sources through their home galaxies. Supernova\nremnants emerge as a notable gamma-ray source population, and older remnants\ninteracting with interstellar matter finally show strong evidence of the\npresence of accelerated nuclei. Yet the maximum energy attained by shock\naccelerators is poorly constrained. Cygnus X, a massive star-forming region\nestablished by the LAT as housing cosmic-ray sources, provides a test case to\nstudy the impact of wind-driven turbulence on the early propagation.\nInterstellar emission resulting from the large-scale propagation of cosmic rays\nin the Milky Way is revealed in unprecedented detail that challenges some of\nthe simple assumptions used for the modeling. Moreover, the cosmic-ray induced\ngamma-ray luminosities of galaxies scale quasi-linearly with their massive-\nstar formation rates, and suggests that for most systems a substantial fraction\nof energy in cosmic rays escapes into the intergalactic medium. The nuclear\nproduction models and the distribution of target gas and radiation fields, not\ndetermined precisely enough yet, are key to exploiting the full potential of\ngamma-ray data. Nevertheless, data being collected by Fermi and complementary\nobservations are bringing us ever closer to solving the cosmic-ray mystery.\n(abridged) \n\n"}

Abstract: We present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)\n130427A under the hypothesis that the GRB central engine is an\naccretion-powered magnetar. In this framework, initially proposed to explain\nGRBs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion of\nmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to the\naccretion rate. The emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces are\nable to pause accretion. We show that the X-ray and optical afterglow is well\nexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contribution\nfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. Our modelling does not require any\ncontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglow\nlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times.

We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta.

The\naccretion regimes that allow growth of the WDs are usually calculated assuming\nconstant mass-transfer rates. However, it is possible that these systems are\ninfluenced by effects that cause the rate to fluctuate on various timescales.\nWe investigate how long-term mass-transfer variability affects accreting WDs\nsystems. We show that, if such variability is present, it expands the parameter\nspace of binaries where the WD can effectively increase its mass. Furthermore,\nwe find that the supernova type Ia (SNIa) rate is enhanced by a factor 2-2.5 to\na rate that is comparable with the lower limit of the observed rates. The\nchanges in the delay-time distribution allow for more SNIae in stellar\npopulations with ages of a few Gyr. Thus, mass-transfer variability gives rise\nto a new formation channel of SNIa events that can significantly contribute to\nthe SNIa rate. Mass-transfer variability is also likely to affect other binary\npopulations through enhanced WD growth. For example, it may explain why WDs in\ncataclysmic variables are observed to be more massive than single WDs, on\naverage. \n\n"}

We calculate the\nmultipole moments of these stars up to hexadecapole order by constructing\nuniformly-rotating and unmagnetized stellar solutions to the Einstein\nequations.

We\nfind that the multipole moments extracted from these numerical solutions are\nconsistent with each other. We confirm that the current-dipole is related to\nthe mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of state independent fashion,\nwhich does not break for rapidly rotating neutron stars or quark stars.

Because\ngravitational waves (GWs) are almost impossible to obscure via dust absorption\nor other astrophysical processes, the strength of the detected signal is\ndictated solely by the emission strength and the distance to the source.\nAssuming that the space density of an arbitrary population of GW sources does\nnot evolve, we show explicitly that the distribution of detected\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) values depends solely on the detection threshold; it is\nindependent of the detector network (interferometer or pulsar timing array),\nthe individual detector noise curves (initial or Advanced LIGO), the nature of\nthe GW sources (compact binary coalescence, supernova, or some other discrete\nsource), and the distributions of source variables (only non-spinning neutron\nstars of mass exactly $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ or a complicated distribution of masses\nand spins).

As high\nresolution spectral data of \\emph{Swift}/XRT is available for the early\nafterglow, we investigate the shape and evolution of the thermal component in\nthis phase using data from the \\emph{Swift}/BAT, the \\emph{Swift}/XRT, and the\n\\emph{Fermi}/GBM detectors. An independent fit to the BAT and XRT data reveals\ntwo correlated blackbodies with monotonically decreasing temperatures. Hence we\ninvestigated the combined data with a model consisting of two blackbodies and a\npower-law (2BBPL), a model suggested for several bright GRBs. We elicit the\nfollowing interesting features of the 2BBPL model: a) the same model is\napplicable from the peak of the last pulse in the prompt emission to the\nafterglow emission, b) the ratio of temperatures and the fluxes of the two\nblack bodies remains constant throughout the observations, c) the black body\ntemperatures and fluxes show a monotonic decrease with time, with the BB fluxes\ndropping about a factor of two faster than that of the power-law emission, d)\nattributing the blackbody emission to photospheric emissions, we find that the\nphotospheric radii increase very slowly with time, and the lower temperature\nblackbody shows a larger emitting radius than that of the higher temperature\nblack body.

While the existence of a blackbody-like component has\nbeen shown to be significant and not a byproduct of background fluctuations, it\nis very possible that it can be an artifact of spectral evolution of a single\ncomponent that is being poorly resolved in time. Herein, this possibility is\ntested by simulating a single component evolving in time and then folding the\nspectra through the $Fermi$ detector response to generate time-tagged event\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data. We then fit both the time integrated and\nresolved generated spectral data with a multi-component model using standard\ntools.

Within a month the accretion rate reaches super-Eddington levels. It\nthen drops gradually over a time scale of a year to sub-Eddington regimes. The\ninitially geometrically thick disk becomes a thin one and eventually an ADAF at\nvery low accretion rates. As such, TDEs explore the whole range of accretion\nrates and configurations. A challenging question is what the corresponding\nlight curves of these events are. We explore numerically the disk luminosity\nand the conditions within the inner region of the disk using a fully general\nrelativistic slim disk model. Those conditions determine the magnitude of the\nmagnetic field that engulfs the black hole and this, in turn, determines the\nBlandford-Znajek jet power. We estimate this power in two different ways and\nshow that they are self-consistent. We find, as expected earlier from analytic\nargu- ments (Krolik & Piran 2012), that neither the disk luminosity nor the jet\npower follows the accretion rate throughout the disruption event. The disk\nluminosity varies only logarithmi- cally with the accretion rate at\nsuper-Eddington luminosities. The jet power follows initially the accretion\nrate but remains a constant after the transition from super- to sub- Eddington.\nAt lower accretion rates at the end of the MAD phase the disk becomes thin and\nthe jet may stop altogether. These new estimates of the jet power and disk\nluminosity that do not simply follow the mass fallback rate should be taken\ninto account when searching for TDEs and analysing light curves of TDE\ncandidates. Identification of some of the above mentioned transitions may\nenable us to estimate better TDE parameters. \n\n"}

So far, this scenario was not demonstrated\nfrom first principles. Kushnir and Katz (2014) have recently shown, by using\none-dimensional simulations, that if the neutrinos failed to explode the star,\na thermonuclear explosion of the outer shells is possible for some (tuned)\ninitial profiles. However, the energy released was small and negligible amounts\nof ejected $^{56}$Ni were obtained, implying that these one-dimensional\ncollapse induced thermonuclear explosions (CITE) are unlikely to represent\ntypical CCSNe. Here I provide evidence supporting a scenario in which the\nmajority of CCSNe are the result of CITE. I use two-dimensional simulations to\nshow that collapse of stars that include slowly (few percent of breakup)\nrotating $\\sim0.1-10\\,M_{\\odot}$ shells of mixed helium-oxygen, leads to an\nignition of a thermonuclear detonation wave that unbinds the stars' outer\nlayers.

All five objects were identified as super-Eddington\naccreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs). The highest measured accretion rates\nfor the objects in this campaign are $\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}\\gtrsim 200$, where\n$\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}= \\dot{M}_{\\bullet}/L_{\\rm Edd}c^{-2}$, $\\dot{M}_{\\bullet}$\nis the mass accretion rates, $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$\nis the speed of light. We find that the H$\\beta$ time lags in SEAMBHs are\nsignificantly shorter than those measured in sub-Eddington AGNs, and the\ndeviations increase with increasing accretion rates. Thus, the relationship\nbetween broad-line region size ($R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}$) and optical luminosity at\n5100\\AA, $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}-L_{5100}$, requires accretion rate as an additional\nparameter.

The progenitor is a tight binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) core\nand a neutron star (NS) companion, a subclass of the newly proposed\n\"ultra-stripped\" binaries. The CO-NS short-period orbit causes the NS to\naccrete appriciable matter from the SN ejecta when the CO core collapses,\nultimately causing it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and producing a GRB.\nThese tight binaries evolve through the SN explosion very differently than\ncompact binaries studied in population synthesis calculations. First, the\nhypercritical accretion onto the NS companion alters both the mass and momentum\nof the binary. Second, because the explosion timescale is on par with the\norbital period, the mass ejection can not be assumed to be instantaneous. This\ndramatically affects the post-SN fate of the binary. Finally, the bow shock\ncreated as the accreting NS plows through the SN ejecta transfers angular\nmomentum, braking the orbit. These systems remain bound even if a large\nfraction of the binary mass is lost in the explosion (well above the canonical\n50\\% limit), and even large kicks are unlikely to unbind the system. Indeed,\nBdHNe produce a new family of NS-BH binaries unaccounted for in current\npopulation synthesis analyses and, although they may be rare, the fact that\nnearly 100\\% remain bound implies they may play an important role in the\ncompact merger rate, important for gravitational waves (GWs) that, in turn, can\nproduce a new class of ultrashort GRBs. \n\n"}

Using analytical models of\nstructure formation and dark matter halo properties, we compute the gamma-ray\nflux distribution due to annihilations in extragalactic dark matter halos, as\nit would be observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.

We present the results of more than 400\nmillion gravitational scattering experiments of binary-binary, triple-single,\nand triple-binary scattering. We compute the cross sections for all possible\noutcomes and explore their dependencies on incoming velocity, mass, semi-major\naxis, and eccentricity, including analytic fits and discussion of the velocity\ndependence. For the production of new triple systems by scattering we find that\ncompact triples are preferred, with ratios of outer to inner semi-major axes of\n~few--100, flat or quasi-thermal eccentricity distributions, and flat\ndistributions in cosine of the mutual inclination. Dynamically formed triples\nare thus subject to strong KL oscillations, the \"eccentric Kozai mechanism,\"\nand non-secular effects.

They\nrepresent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are\ndetectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on\nthe equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of\nthe postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant\ncan be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be\ndescribed by concepts of asteroseismology. The understanding of the different\nmechanisms shaping the gravitational-wave signal yields a physically motivated\nanalytic model of the gravitational-wave emission, which may form the basis for\ntemplate-based gravitational-wave data analysis. We explore the observational\nconsequences of a scenario of two families of compact stars including hadronic\nand quark stars.

The\nfate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation\nstar formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al.

We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]\nemission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted\nsynthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense\nshell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities\nthat are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a\ndense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good\ntracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered.

All hadron masses decrease universally with the scalar field\ngrowth, whereas meson-nucleon coupling constants can vary differently. More\nspecifically we focus on two modifications of the KVOR model studied\npreviously. One extension of the model (KVORcut) demonstrates that the equation\nof state stiffens if the increase of the scalar-field magnitude with the\ndensity is bounded from above at some value for baryon densities above the\nsaturation nuclear density. This can be realized if the nucleon vector-meson\ncoupling constant changes rapidly as a function of the scalar field slightly\nabove the desired value. The other version of the model (MKVOR) utilizes a\nsmaller value of the nucleon effective mass at the nuclear saturation density\nand a saturation of the scalar field in the isospin asymmetric matter induced\nby a strong variation of the nucleon isovector-meson coupling constant as\nfunction of the scalar field. A possibility of hyperonization of the matter in\nneutron star interiors is incorporated.

Originally consisting of just four\nidentical IACTs (CT1-4) with an effective mirror diameter of 12$\\,$m each, it\nwas expanded with a fifth IACT (CT5) with a mirror diameter of 28$\\,$m in 2012.\nBeing the largest IACT worldwide, CT5 allows to lower the energy threshold of\nH.E.S.S., making the array sensitive at energies where space-based detectors\nrun out of statistics. Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable.

The disk shows strong azimuthal asymmetry in the dust continuum\nemission, while gas emission is more symmetric. In this paper, we investigate\nhow gas and dust are distributed in the dust-bright northern part of the disk\nand in the dust-faint southern part. We construct two axisymmetric disk models.\nOne reproduces the radial profiles of the continuum and the velocity moments 0\nand 1 of CO lines in the north and the other reproduces those in the south. We\nhave found that the dust is concentrated in a narrow ring having ~50AU width\n(in FWHM; w_d=30AU in our parameter definition) located at ~170-200AU from the\ncentral star. The dust particles are strongly concentrated in the north. We\nhave found that the dust surface density contrast between the north and south\namounts to ~70.

We find that the gas component extends at least from\n~100AU to ~250AU from the central star, and there should also be tenuous gas\nremaining inside and outside of these radii. The azimuthal asymmetry of gas\ndistribution is much smaller than dust. The gas surface density differs only by\na factor of ~3-10 between the north and south.

They are\ncommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. Evidence of\nultra-fast (v>0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of AGN has been\ncollected in the past decade by sensitive X-ray observations for sizable\nsamples of AGN, mostly at low redshift. Here we present ultra-deep XMM-Newton\nand Chandra spectral data of an obscured (Nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsically\nluminous (L2-10keV~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named PID352) at z~1.6 (derived\nfrom the X-ray spectral analysis) in the Chandra Deep Field-South. The source\nis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observed\nenergies of E~2-3 keV. While the emission line is interpreted as being due to\nneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorption\nfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (FeXXV, FeXXVI) with an\noutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionization\nmodels. The mass outflow rate - ~2 Msun/yr - is similar to the source accretion\nrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,\ncorresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. PID352 represents one\nof the few cases where indications of X-ray outflowing gas have been observed\nat high redshift thus far.

On a theoretical\nground, the response of gas to a bar is generally thought to cause nuclear\nstarbursts and, possibly, AGN activity once the perturbed gas reaches the\ncentral super-massive black hole. By means of high resolution numerical\nsimulations we detail the purely dynamical effects that a forming bar exerts on\nthe gas of an isolated disc galaxy. The galaxy is initially unstable to the\nformation of non-axisymmetric structures, and within 1 Gyr it develops spiral\narms that eventually evolve into a central stellar bar on kpc scale. A first\nmajor episode of gas inflow occurs during the formation of the spiral arms\nwhile at later times, when the stellar bar is establishing, a low density\nregion is carved between the bar co-rotational and inner Lindblad resonance\nradii. The development of such \"dead zone\" inhibits further massive gas\ninflows. Indeed, the gas inflow reaches its maximum during the relatively fast\nbar formation phase and not, as often assumed, when the bar is fully formed. We\nconclude that the low efficiency of long-lived, evolved bars in driving gas\ntoward galactic nuclei is the reason why observational studies have failed to\nestablish an indisputable link between bars and AGNs. On the other hand, the\nhigh efficiency in driving strong gas inflows of the intrinsically transient\nprocess of bar formation suggests that the importance of bars as drivers of AGN\nactivity in disc galaxies has been overlooked so far. We finally prove that our\nconclusions are robust against different numerical implementations of the\nhydrodynamics routinely used in galaxy evolution studies. \n\n"}

Removal of\nfrequency-dependent interstellar medium (ISM) delays due to dispersion and\nscattering is a key issue in the detection process. Current timing algorithms\nroutinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to\ncold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct\nfor delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering\nintroduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in\npulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for\ninterstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements\nthat can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from\nfrequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.\nCyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest\n(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency\ndecomposition.

In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system.

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration\nand the Virgo Collaboration have verified that this observation is consistent\nwith General Relativity. This paper expands their analysis to a larger class of\nanomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on non-standard\ntheoretical physics mechanisms. We find that these events constrain a plethora\nof mechanisms associated with the generation and propagation of gravitational\nwaves, including the activation of scalar fields, gravitational leakage into\nlarge extra dimensions, the variability of Newton's constant, a modified\ndispersion relation, gravitational Lorentz violation and the strong equivalence\nprinciple. Though other observations limit many of these mechanisms already,\nGW150914 and GW151226 are unique in that they are direct probes of dynamical\nstrong-field gravity and of gravitational wave propagation. We also show that\nGW150914 constrains inferred properties of exotic compact object alternatives\nto Kerr black holes. We argue, however, that the true potential for GW150914 to\nboth rule out exotic objects and constrain physics beyond General Relativity is\nseverely limited by the lack of understanding of the merger regime in almost\nall relevant modified gravity theories. This event thus significantly raises\nthe bar that these theories have to pass, both in terms of having a sound\ntheoretical underpinning, and being able to solve the equations of motion for\nbinary merger events.

Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young\nsupernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational\nconsequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into\nthe interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back\nthrough the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM)\nassociated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM.

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion.

However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk.

We estimate their optical brightness with\ntheir R magnitude measured two hours after the trigger and compare the rest\nframe prompt properties of different classes of GRB afterglow brightness.

Our calculations\nshow a spike in the central density profile, with properties determined by the\ndark matter microphysics, and the densities can reach the `mean density' of a\nblack hole (from dividing the black-hole mass by the volume enclosed by the\nSchwarzschild radius). For a galaxy halo of given compactness\n($\\chi=2GM/Rc^2$), certain values for the dark matter entropy yield a dense\ncentral object lacking an event horizon.

Our\nsimultaneous Nustar/Swift observations show that the 0.5-79 keV spectrum can be\ndescribed by a combination of a power law with a photon index of Gamma~2, a\nblack body with a temperature of kT_bb~0.5 keV (presumably arising from the\nneutron star surface), and disk reflection. Modeling the reflection spectrum\nsuggests that the inner accretion disk was located at R_in>100 GM/c2 (>225 km)\nfrom the neutron star. The apparent truncation may be due to evaporation of the\ninner disk into a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow, or due to the\npressure of the neutron star magnetic field.

Here, we analyse whether a\ncombination of cosmic ray (CR) heating and thermal conduction can offset\nradiative cooling. To this end, we compile a large sample of 39 cool core\nclusters and determine steady state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation.

Radiative\ncooling is balanced by CR heating in the cluster centres and by thermal\nconduction on larger scales, thus demonstrating the relevance of both heating\nmechanisms. Our mass deposition rates vary by three orders of magnitude and are\nlinearly correlated to the observed star formation rates. Clusters with large\nmass deposition rates show larger cooling radii and require a larger radial\nextent of the CR injection function. Interestingly, our sample shows a\ncontinuous sequence in cooling properties: clusters hosting radio mini halos\nare characterised by the largest cooling radii, star formation and mass\ndeposition rates in our sample and thus signal the presence of a higher cooling\nactivity.

Self-regulation cycle and\n  non-thermal emission Abstract: Self-regulated feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to be\ncritical in balancing radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centres\nof galaxy clusters and in regulating star formation in central galaxies. In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii. Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs). In contrast, the\npredicted non-thermal emission is well below observational data in cooling\ngalaxy clusters without RMHs.

Abstract: Long-duration, spectrally-soft Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with\nType Ic Core Collapse (CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of\nmassive stars. In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine\nmust bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most\nof these jets do not break out, and are instead \"choked\" inside the star, as\nthe central-engine activity time, $t_{\\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling\nthe long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for\ntheir central-engine activity times, $\\propto t_{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha}$ for $t_{\\rm\ne}>t_{\\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\\alpha\\sim4$) and a typical GRB\njet breakout time of $t_{\\rm b}\\sim 60\\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The\nlatter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding\nthe progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity\nGRBs.

Multi-wavelength Constraints on\n  the Global Structure of the Accretion Flow Abstract: We present a detailed multi-wavelength study of an unobscured, highly\nsuper-Eddington Type-1 QSO RX J0439.6-5311. We combine the latest XMM-Newton\nobservation with all archival data from infrared to hard X-rays. The optical\nspectrum is very similar to that of 1H 0707-495 in having extremely weak [O\n{\\sc iii}] and strong Fe {\\sc ii} emission lines, although the black hole mass\nis probably slightly higher at $5-10 \\times10^{6}~\\rm M_{\\odot}$. The broadband\nSED is uniquely well-defined due to the extremely low Galactic and intrinsic\nabsorption, so the bolometric luminosity is tightly constrained. The optical/UV\naccretion disc continuum is seen down to 900 \\AA, showing that there is a\nstandard thin disc structure down to $R \\ge$ 190-380 $R_{\\rm g}$ and\ndetermining the mass accretion rate through the outer disc. This predicts a\nmuch higher bolometric luminosity than observed, indicating that there must be\nstrong wind and/or advective energy losses from the inner disc, as expected for\na highly super-Eddington accretion flow. Significant outflows are detected in\nboth the NLR and BLR emission lines, confirming the presence of a wind. We\npropose a global picture for the structure of a super-Eddington accretion flow\nwhere the inner disc puffs up, shielding much of the potential NLR material,\nand show how inclination angle with respect to this and the wind can explain\nvery different X-ray properties of RX J0439.6-5311 and 1H 0707-495.

Aiming to\nuncover the explosion mechanism and origin of the asymmetric, centrally filled\nX-ray morphology of W49B, we have performed spatially resolved X-ray\nspectroscopy and a search for potential point sources.

We apply topological data analysis (TDA), sensitive to all statistical\nmoments and independent of the assumption of Gaussian statistics, to the gas\ndensity fluctuations in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the\nmulti-phase ISM. This simulation admits dynamo action, so produces physically\nrealistic magnetic fields.

This approach is based on the\nmultipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the global\nphysical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state),\nbut not to canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It\nleads to simple derivation of the CFS instability criterion for normal modes\nand the evolution equations for a star, affected by this instability. The\napproach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS\ninstability: it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission\nremoves angular momentum from the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation\nenergy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy, than the released amount\nof the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability in slowly\nrotating Newtonian stars.

We demonstrate that the former is the limiting case of the\nlatter when the radial extent of the precessing flow is very small, and that\nsolid lower limits to the black hole spin can be obtained by considering the\ntest particle model alone. We also show that the global precession model\nnaturally accounts for the range of frequencies observed for Type-C QPOs\nwithout the need to invoke a truncation of the inner accretion flow before it\nreaches the innermost stable circular orbit. Finally, we show that, in order to\nmaintain rigid precession, the thick accretion flow should be radially narrow,\nand that if it extends beyond $10-10^2$ gravitational radii it aligns with the\nblack hole spin too fast to produce a coherent QPO. \n\n"}

These\nobservations were made during the 2015 June outburst of the source when it was\ngoing through an epoch of violent activity in all wavelengths ranging from\nradio to $\\gamma$-rays. The multiwavelength variability timescale favors a\ncompact emission region, most likely originating in a jet outflow, for both\nobserving epochs presented in this work. The simultaneous INTEGRAL/Imager on\nBoard the Integral Satellite (IBIS) 20--40 keV light curve obtained during the\nJune 27 observing run correlates very strongly with the optical light curve,\nwith no detectable delay between the optical bands as well as between the\noptical and hard X-rays. The average slope of the dereddened spectral energy\ndistribution was roughly flat between the $I_C$- and $V$-bands during the June\n27 run, even though the optical and X-ray flux varied by $>$25$\\times$ during\nthe run, ruling out an irradiation origin for the optical and suggesting that\nthe optically thick to optically thin jet synchrotron break during the\nobservations was at a frequency larger than that of $V$-band, which is quite\nextreme for X-ray binaries. These observations suggest that the optical\nemission originated very close to the base of the jet. A strong H$\\alpha$\nemission line, probably originating in a quasi-spherical nebula around the\nsource, also contributes significantly in the $R_C$-band.

In\nparticular, for the acceleration of particles and their collimation in jets, an\nordered component of the magnetic field seems to be essential. Here we discuss\nthe role of large-scale magnetic fields in transporting the charged particles\nand dust grains from the bound orbits in the equatorial plane of a rotating\n(Kerr) black hole and the resulting acceleration along trajectories escaping\nthe system in a direction parallel to the symmetry axis (perpendicular to the\naccretion disk).

Based on analytic considerations\nand verified with an extensive set of 2D axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we have estimated a threshold intrinsic jet luminosity, $L_{\\rm\nj}^{\\rm thr}$, for successfully launching a jet. This threshold depends on the\nstructure of the progenitor and, thus, it is sensible to its mass and to its\nmetallicity.

We tie these together energetically by assuming\nNovikov-Thorne emissivity, and use this to define a size scale for the hard\nX-ray corona as equal to the radius where the remaining accretion energy down\nto the black hole can power the observed X-ray emission. We test this on three\nAGN with well defined SEDs as well as on larger samples to show that the\naverage hard X-ray luminosity is always approximately a few percent of the\nEddington luminosity across a large range of Eddington ratio.

We show\nthat this conclusion is valid only for non-magnetized jets.

The method is designed\nto be applicable to simple spectra where the photosphere can be mostly\ndescribed by absorptions from single transitions with a single photospheric\nvelocity.

We\nfind that the prominent absorption features seen in the blue are dominated by\nnumerous lines of OII, as previously suggested, and that the apparent\nabsorption feature widths are dominated by line density and not by doppler\nbroadening.

Similarly to the cloud Sgr B2, another well-known emitter of the\niron line in the GC, the Arches cloud demonstrates temporal decline of the\nX-ray emission. The most natural origin of this emission is irradiation of\nprimary photons of an X-ray flare from a distant source, most likely Sgr A*.\nHowever, recent observations of the Arches cloud discovered variations of\nequivalent width of the 6.4 keV iron line, which indicated that the X-ray\nemission from the cloud is a combination of two components with different\norigin and different equivalent width, one of which is time-variable, while the\nother is stationary during the period of observations. We considered two\ndifferent scenarios: a) this emission is formed by reflection from two clouds,\nwhich are at some distance from each other, when they are irradiated by two\ndifferent flares; and b) the other scenario assumes a combination of X-ray\nfluxes produced in the same cloud by reflection of primary photons and by\nsubrelativistic cosmic rays.

Methods: We performed\nspectrographic observations of V902 Mon in 2016 with the 2.2m Calar Alto\ntelescope, and X-ray photometry and spectroscopy with XMM-Newton in October\n2017. This data was supplemented by several years of AAVSO visual photometry.\nResults: We have confirmed V902 Mon as an IP based on detecting the spin\nperiod, with a value of 2,208s, at multiple epochs.

We want\nto assess the role of Galactic cosmic rays in the formation of atomic hydrogen,\nby using recent developments in the characterisation of the low-energy spectra\nof cosmic rays and advances in the modelling of their propagation in molecular\nclouds. We model the attenuation of the interstellar cosmic rays entering a\ncloud and compute the dissociation rate of molecular hydrogen due to collisions\nwith cosmic-ray protons and electrons as well as fast hydrogen atoms. We\ncompare our results with the available observations. The cosmic-ray\ndissociation rate is entirely determined by secondary electrons produced in\nprimary ionisation collisions. These secondary particles constitute the only\nsource of atomic hydrogen at column densities above $\\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

The\naccretion flow of a collapsing core on to the newly born neutron star suffers\nthe spiral standing accretion shock instability (SASI).

The measurement is accomplished by\ncorrelating these clusters with galaxies detected in the Dark Energy Survey\nYear 3 data.

The lightcurves of three Seyfert\ngalaxies are also consistent with a linear relationship between RMS variability\nand flux, suggesting that it is an intrinsic feature of the broadband noise\nvariability in compact accreting systems over more than 6 decades of central\nobject mass. The RMS variability responds to flux variations on all measured\ntime-scales, raising fundamental difficulties for shot-noise models which seek\nto explain this result by invoking variations in the shot parameters. We\nsuggest that models should be explored where the longest time-scale variations\nare fundamental and precede the variations on shorter time-scales. Possible\nmodels which can explain the linear RMS-flux relation include the fractal\nbreak-up of large coronal flares, or the propagation of fluctuations in mass\naccretion rate through the accretion disk. The linear relationship between RMS\nvariability and flux in Cyg X-1 and SAX J1808.4-3658 is offset on the flux\naxis, suggesting the presence of a second, constant-flux component to the\nlightcurve which contributes 25% of the total flux.

UV radiation can be produced by a starburst or AGN activity. We\nargue that momentum-driven winds are an efficient mechanism for feedback during\nthe formation of galaxies. We show that above a limiting luminosity, momentum\ndeposition from star formation can expel a significant fraction of the gas in a\ngalaxy. The limiting, Eddington-like luminosity is $L_{\\rm M}\\simeq(4f_g c/G)\n\\sigma^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the galaxy velocity dispersion and $f_g$ is the\ngas fraction. A starburst that attains $L_{\\rm M}$ moderates its star formation\nrate and its luminosity does not increase significantly further. We argue that\nellipticals attain this limit during their growth at $z \\gtrsim 1$ and that\nthis is the origin of the Faber-Jackson relation.

We solve the force-free Grad-Shafranov\nequation to calculate the magnetic structure and growth of a tower embedded in\na stellar environment. The pressure of the toroidal magnetic field,\ncontinuously generated by differential rotation of the central engine, drives a\nrapid expansion which becomes vertically collimated after lateral force balance\nwith the surrounding gas pressure is reached. The collimation naturally occurs\nbecause hoop stress concentrates magnetic field toward the rotation axis and\ninhibits lateral expansion. This leads to the growth of a self-collimated\nmagnetic tower. When embedded in a massive star, the supersonic expansion of\nthe tower drives a strong bow shock behind which an over-pressured cocoon\nforms. The cocoon confines the tower by supplying collimating pressure and\nprovides stabilization against disruption due to MHD instabilities. Because the\ntower consists of closed field lines starting and ending on the central engine,\nmixing of baryons from the cocoon into the tower is suppressed. The channel\ncleared by the growing tower is thus plausibly free of baryons and allows the\nescape of magnetic energy from the central engine through the star.

It follows that a consistent description of the magnetized ICM can\nprovide a simple explanation of several (or of all) of these still open\nproblems, and thus weakens the need for the inclusion of other\nnon-gravitational effects which have been proposed so far for the explanation\nof some of these features. This (initial, but not conclusive) analysis can be\nregarded as a starting point for a more refined analytical exploration of the\nphysics of the magnetized intra-cluster medium, and it provides testable\npredictions that can be proven or disproven with the next coming sensitive\nobservations of groups and clusters in the X-ray band and in the radio\nfrequency band. \n\n"}
