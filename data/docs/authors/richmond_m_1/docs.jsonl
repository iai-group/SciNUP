Abstract: The recently-discovered lack of close binaries, among extreme horizontal\nbranch (EHB) stars in Galactic globular clusters, has thus far constituted a\nmajor puzzle, in view of the fact that blue subdwarf stars - the field\ncounterparts of cluster EHB stars - are well-known to present a high binary\nfraction. In this Letter, we provide new results that confirm the lack of close\nEHB binaries in globular clusters, and present a first scenario to explain the\ndifference between field and cluster EHB stars. First, in order to confirm that\nthe lack of EHB binaries in globular clusters is a statistically robust result,\nwe undertook a new analysis of 145 horizontal branch stars in NGC6752, out of\nwhich forty-one belong to the EHB. To search for radial-velocity variations as\na function of time, we repeated high-resolution (R=18500) spectroscopy of all\nstars, four times during a single night of observations. We detected a single,\nhot (25000 K), radial-velocity variable star as a close-binary candidate. From\nthese results, we estimate an upper-limit for the close (period P < 5 day)\nbinary fraction f among NGC6752 EHB stars of 16% (95% confidence level), with\nthe most probable value being f=4%. Thus our results clearly confirm the lack\nof close binaries among the hot HB stars in this cluster.

This fact allows us to take into\naccount a very large variety of processes, still finding potentially measurable\nconsequences. In this contribution we highlight some of the detailed physics\nthat were recently studied in connection with cosmological hydrogen and helium\nrecombination. The impact of these considerations is two-fold: (i) the\nassociated release of photons during this epoch leads to interesting and unique\ndeviations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) energy spectrum from a\nperfect blackbody, which, in particular at decimeter wavelength, may become\nobservable in the near future. Despite the fact that the abundance of helium is\nrather small, it also contributes a sizeable amount of photons to the full\nrecombination spectrum, which, because of differences in the dynamics of the\nhelium recombinations and the non-trivial superposition of all components, lead\nto additional distinct spectral features. Observing the spectral distortions\nfrom the epochs of hydrogen and helium recombination, in principle would\nprovide an additional way to determine some of the key parameters of the\nUniverse (e.g. the specific entropy, the CMB monopole temperature and the\npre-stellar abundance of helium), not suffering from limitations set by cosmic\nvariance. Also it permits us to confront our detailed understanding of the\nrecombination process with direct observational evidence. (ii) with the advent\nof high precision CMB data, e.g. as will be available using the Planck Surveyor\nor CMBpol, a very accurate theoretical understanding of the ionization history\nof the Universe becomes necessary for the interpretation of the CMB temperature\nand polarization anisotropies.

We demonstrate that rapid (\\Delta\nz< 0.1-0.2), strong (\\Delta T > 10^4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve\nacross the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than\nimplied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic\nquasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess\nenergy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and\nlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals\nshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons\nresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy\ninside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and\nmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating\nrates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and\nweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be\nreionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest\nheating rates (\\Delta T < 10^4 K).

The first one is the 0.4 dex discrepancy\nbetween the 7Li abundance derived from the spectra of metal-poor halo stars on\nthe one hand, and from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, based on the cosmological\nparameters constrained by the WMAP measurements, on the other hand. Lithium,\nindeed, can be depleted in the convection zone of unevolved stars. The\nunderstanding of the hydrodynamics of the crucial zone near the bottom of the\nconvective envelope in dwarfs or turn-off stars of solar metallicity has\nrecently made enormous progress with the inclusion of internal gravity waves.\nHowever, similar work for metal-poor stars is still lacking. Therefore it is\nnot yet clear whether the depletion occurring in the metal-poor stars\nthemselves is adequate to produce a 7Li plateau. The second problem pertains to\nthe large amount of 6Li recently found in metal-poor halo stars. The\nconvection-related asymmetry of the 7Li line could mimic the signal attributed\nso far to the weak blend of 6Li in the red wing of the 7Li line. Theoretical\ncomputations show that the signal generated by the asymmetry of 7Li is 2.0,\n2.1, and 3.7 per cent for [Fe/H]= -3.0, -2.0, -1.0, respectively (Teff =6250 K\nand log g=4.0 [cgs]). In addition we re-investigate the statistical properties\nof the 6Li plateau and show that previous analyses were biased. Our conclusion\nis that the 6Li plateau can be reinterpreted in terms of intrinsic line\nasymmetry, without the need to invoke a contribution of 6Li. (abridged) \n\n"}

Somewhere above this band, a turnover is predicted where the jets\nbecome optically thin, revealing a power-law spectrum.

The clustering of quasars and their dark environment Abstract: We use semi-analytic modeling on top of the Millennium simulation to study\nthe joint formation of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes.\n  Our goal is to test scenarios in which black hole accretion and quasar\nactivity are triggered by galaxy mergers, and to constrain different models for\nthe lightcurves associated with individual quasar events. In the present work\nwe focus on studying the spatial distribution of simulated quasars. At all\nluminosities, we find that the simulated quasar two-point correlation function\nis fit well by a single power-law in the range 0.5 < r < 20 h^{-1} Mpc, but its\nnormalization is a strong function of redshift. When we select only quasars\nwith luminosities within the range typically accessible by today's quasar\nsurveys, their clustering strength depends only weakly on luminosity, in\nagreement with observations. This holds independently of the assumed lightcurve\nmodel, since bright quasars are black holes accreting close to the Eddington\nlimit, and are hosted by dark matter haloes with a narrow mass range of a few\n10^12 h^{-1} M_sun. Therefore the clustering of bright quasars cannot be used\nto disentangle lightcurve models, but such a discrimination would become\npossible if the observational samples can be pushed to significantly fainter\nlimits.\n  Overall, our clustering results for the simulated quasar population agree\nrather well with observations, lending support to the conjecture that galaxy\nmergers could be the main physical process responsible for triggering black\nhole accretion and quasar activity. \n\n"}

In a first phase (up to MJD 54760), the photon index and\ntemperature of the disc do not vary significantly, and have values reminiscent\nof the Hard State (HS). The timing analysis is also consistent with that of a\nHS, and shows in particular a rather high degree of variability (~30%), and a\nstrong ~0.5-1 Hz QPO with its first harmonic.

The gas accumulation that\nensues triggers the Rossby wave instability, that in turn saturates into\nanticyclonic vortices. It was suggested that the trapping of solids within them\nleads to a burst of planet formation on very short timescales. We perform\ntwo-dimensional global simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a\nnon-magnetized thin protoplanetary disk with the Pencil Code. We use multiple\nparticle species of radius 1, 10, 30, and 100 cm, solving for the particles'\ngravitational interaction by a particle-mesh method. The dead zone is modeled\nas a region of low viscosity. Adiabatic and locally isothermal equations of\nstate are used. We find that the Rossby wave instability is triggered under a\nvariety of conditions, thus making vortex formation a robust process. Inside\nthe vortices, fast accumulation of solids occurs and the particles collapse\ninto objects of planetary mass in timescales as short as five orbits. Because\nthe drag force is size-dependent, aerodynamical sorting ensues within the\nvortical motion, and the first bound structures formed are composed primarily\nof similarly-sized particles.

This feature has previously been\ninterpreted as an indirect signature of rapid photo-heating in the IGM during\nthe epoch of HeII reionisation. We examine this interpretation using a\nsemi-analytic model of inhomogeneous HeII reionisation and high resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations of the Lya forest. We instead find that a rapid\n(\\Delta z ~ 0.2) boost to the IGM temperature (\\Delta T ~ 10^4 K) beginning at\nz=3.4 produces a well understood and generic evolution in the Lya effective\noptical depth, where a sudden reduction in the opacity is followed by a\ngradual, monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the low\ndensity IGM. This behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow feature in the\nobservational data. If photo-heating during HeII reionisation is instead\nextended over several redshift units, as recent theoretical studies suggest,\nthen the Lya opacity will evolve smoothly with redshift. We conclude that the\nsharp dip observed in the Lya forest effective optical depth is instead most\nlikely due to a narrow peak in the hydrogen photo-ionisation rate around z=3.2,\nand suggest that it may arise from the modulation of either reprocessed\nradiation during HeII reionisation, or the opacity of Lyman limit systems. \n\n"}

Weak lensing\nobservables are sensitive to both the distance-redshift relation and the growth\nof structure in the Universe. If the cause of accelerated cosmic expansion is\ndark energy within general relativity (GR), both cosmic distances and structure\ngrowth are governed by the properties of dark energy. Consequently, one may use\nlensing to check for this consistency and test GR. After reviewing the\nphenomenology of such tests, we address one major challenge to such a program.\nThe evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe is highly uncertain and\ncan influence lensing observables, manifesting as modified structure growth for\na fixed cosmic distance scale. Using two proposed methods, we show that one\ncould be led to reject the null hypothesis of GR when it is the true theory if\nthis uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected. Recent simulations suggest\nthat we can correct for baryonic effects using a parametrized model in which\nthe halo mass-concentration relation is modified. The correction renders biases\nsmall compared to statistical uncertainties. We study the ability of future\nweak lensing surveys to constrain the internal structures of halos and test the\nnull hypothesis of GR simultaneously. Compared to nulling information from\nsmall-scales to mitigate sensitivity to baryonic physics, this internal\ncalibration program should provide limits on deviations from GR that are\nseveral times more constraining. Specifically, we find that limits on general\nrelativity in the case of internal calibration are degraded by only ~30% or\nless compared to the case of perfect knowledge of nonlinear structure. \n\n"}

Abstract: We compute the effect of an orbiting gas disc in promoting the coalescence of\na central supermassive black hole binary. Unlike earlier studies, we consider a\nfinite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gas\nnecessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i.e.\nthat the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre--existing accretion\ndisc. We consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary's\ngravitational radiation. We study the effects of star formation in the gas disc\nin a simple energy feedback framework. The disc spectrum differs in detail from\nthat found before. In particular, tidal torques from the secondary black hole\nheat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. These\nrims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, but\ncan on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light from\nthe disc. This may lead to detectable high--photon--energy variability on the\nrelatively long orbital timescale of the secondary black hole, and thus offer a\nprospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary. We also find that the\ndisc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable timescale only if its mass\nis at least comparable with that of the secondary black hole, and if the\ninitial binary separation is relatively small, i.e. $a_0 \\lesssim 0.05$ pc.\nStar formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc.\nIn the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the disc\nmass. As a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratio\nis $\\la 0.001$. Gas discs thus appear not to be an effective solution to the\n`last parsec' problem for a significant class of mergers. \n\n"}

The energy budget of the star-planet interaction is discussed assuming\nthat the planet may trigger a release of the energy of the coronal field by\ndecreasing its relative helicity. The observed intermittent character of the\nstar-planet interaction is explained by a topological change of the stellar\ncoronal field, induced by a variation of its relative helicity.

Models with steeper profiles are able to simultaneously\nfit both X-ray and WMAP data better than a beta-model. However, the agreement\nis not perfect and we find that it is still difficult to make the X-ray and SZE\nresults agree. A model assuming point source contamination in SZE clusters\nrenders a better fit to the one-dimensional SZE profiles thus suggesting that\ncontamination from point sources could be contributing to a diminution of the\nSZE signal. Selecting a model that better fits both X-ray and WMAP data away\nfrom the very central region, we estimate the level of contamination and find\nthat on average, the point source contamination is on the level of 16 mJy (at\n41 GHz), 26 mJy (at 61 GHz) and 18 mJy (at 94 GHz). These estimated fluxes are\nmarginally consistent with the estimated contamination derived from radio and\ninfrared surveys thus suggesting that the combination of a steeper gas profile\nand the contribution from point sources allows us to consistently explain the\nX-ray emission and SZE in galaxy clusters as measured by ROSAT and WMAP. \n\n"}

Their\noutbursts in the gamma ray relative to the optical/X rays might be surmised to\nbe enhanced in BL Lacs as these photons are upscattered via the inverse Compton\n(IC) process. From the observed correlations among the spectral parameters\nduring optical/X-ray variations we aim at predicting corresponding correlations\nin the gamma-ray band, and the actual relations between the gamma-ray and the\nX-ray variability consistent with the SSC emission process. We start from the\nhomogeneous single-zone SSC source model, with log-parabolic energies\ndistributions of emitting electron as required by the X-ray data of many\nsources.

We show that the baryon dissipation increases the velocity\ndispersion of dark matter within the virial radius by 5% - 10%. The effect is\nmainly driven by the change in density and gravitational potential in inner\nregions of cluster, and it is larger in lower mass systems where gas cooling\nand star formation are more efficient.

Galaxies selected based on their\nstellar mass exhibit no velocity bias, while galaxies selected based on their\ntotal mass show positive bias of ~10%, consistent with previous results based\non collisionless dark matter- only simulations.

The internal extinction, derived from the TIR-to-FUV luminosity\nratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in Sb-Sbc galaxies. The TIR-to-FUV\nratio correlates with the UV spectral slope beta, following a sequence shifted\nto redder UV colors with respect to that of starbursts.

The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles. The phase differences\namong the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle\nefficiency and hence the growth rate. Oscillations in the growth rate as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A\nvertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of\nsuper-Alfvenic accretion that is considered. In contrast, we find that a\nhorizontal magnetic field strongly increases the efficiencies of the vorticity\ncycles that bend the field lines, resulting in a significant increase of the\ngrowth rate if the different cycles are in phase. These magnetic effects are\nsignificant for large-scale modes if the Alfven velocity is a sizable fraction\nof the flow velocity. \n\n"}

The adaptive smoothing scheme allows to take full\nadvantage of the spatially resolved photometric information contained in an\nimage in that at any location the minimal smoothing is applied to reach the\nrequested S/N. Support is given to match more images on the same smoothing\nlength, such that proper estimates of local colours can be done, with a big\npotential impact on multi-wavelength studies of extended sources (galaxies,\nnebulae). Different modes to estimate local S/N are provided. In addition to\nclassical arithmetic-mean averaging mode, the code can operate in median\naveraging mode, resulting in a significant enhancement of the final image\nquality and very accurate flux conservation. To this goal also other code\noptions are implemented and discussed in this paper. Finally, we analyze in\ngreat detail the effect of the adaptive smoothing on galaxy photometry, in\nparticular in terms of surface brightness (SB) profiles and aperture\nphotometry: deviations in SB with respect to the original image can be limited\nto <0.01 mag, with flux difference in apertures of less than 0.001 mag. \n\n"}

We describe a procedure for identifying locations in\nkinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,\nand apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution covering\nthe 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of M32. Targets for\ndetailed investigation are selected as areas of localized brightness\nenhancement. Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from\na single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars\nwith very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving\nnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral\ntype. The lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper AGB\nwithin the central arcsec of M32 has a dispersion in J-K of only a few\nhundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii.

Seemingly\nunrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk of\nunknown origin orbiting the BH in M31, and possibly many other systems. We show\nthat these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.\nMulti-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to BH scales show that when\nsufficient gas is driven towards a BH, gravitational instabilities form a\nlopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background. The stellar relic of this disk is long\nlived and retains the eccentric pattern. Simulations that yield quasar-level\naccretion rates produce relic stellar disks with kinematics, eccentric\npatterns, precession rates, and surface density profiles in reasonable\nagreement with observations of M31. The observed properties of nuclear stellar\ndisks can thus be used to constrain the formation history of super-massive BHs. \n\n"}

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc. At larger radii there is no statistically significant\nseparation between populations; the upper limit to the cumulative scoured mass\nat ~kpc is ~2-4 M_BH. This does not depend strongly on stellar mass. The\ndispersion in M(<R) appears larger in the core population, possibly reflecting\nthe fact that scouring increases the scatter in profile shapes. These results\nare in good agreement with models of scouring from BH binary systems. \n\n"}

The lack of a substantially larger reservoir of\ncold gas argues against the LBGs being UV luminous super starbursts embedded in\nmuch larger UV-dark systems and as a result increases the likelihood that at\nleast those LBGs with multiple components are starbursts triggered by mergers.\nThe sources responsible for reionization are expected to be starbursts similar\nto these systems, but with lower luminosities, masses and consequently with\nstar formation timescales far shorter than the recombination timescale. If so,\nthe ionized bubbles expected in the IGM during the reionization era will\ninfrequently have UV-luminous sources at their centres. \n\n"}

The former is the standard\napproach when estimating cluster masses, while the latter is the more common\nmethod among peak finding efforts. While both approaches have identical\nsignal-to-noise in the weak lensing limit, it is possible that higher order\ncorrections or systematics considerations make one estimator preferable over\nthe other. In this paper, we consider the efficacy of both estimators within\nthe context of stacked weak lensing mass estimation in the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES). We find the two estimators have nearly identical statistical precision,\neven after including higher order corrections, but that these corrections must\nbe incorporated into the analysis to avoid observationally relevant biases in\nthe recovered masses. We also demonstrate that finite bin-width effects may be\nsignificant if not properly accounted for, and that the two estimators exhibit\ndifferent systematics, particularly with respect to contamination of the source\ncatalog by foreground galaxies. Thus, the two estimators may be employed as a\nsystematics cross-check of each other. Stacked weak lensing in the DES should\nallow for the mean mass of galaxy clusters to be calibrated to about 2%\nprecision (statistical only), which can improve the figure of merit of the DES\ncluster abundance experiment by a factor of ~3 relative to the self-calibration\nexpectation.

A\npassive contaminant mimics small dust grains that are aerodynamically well\ncoupled to the gas, and chondrules are modeled by Lagrangian particles that\ninteract with the gas through drag. Whenever a chondrule enters a region\npermeated by dust, its radius grows at a rate that depends on the local dust\ndensity and the relative velocity between itself and the dust.

All the SMA sources have fluxes in the 3-5 mJy range and\nall are detected at 1.4 GHz. Three of them are detected by Chandra, and one is\na previously unknown X-ray SMG. This is the first time that single-dish SMGs\nare resolved into multiple unrelated sources and also the first time that the\nSMA has discovered new SMGs.

This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the\ngas from the protoplanetary disk. Due to their different aerodynamic\nproperties, planetesimals of different sizes and shapes experience different\ndrag forces from the gas during this time. Such differential forces produce a\nwind-shearing (WISH) effect between close by, different size planetesimals. For\nany two planetesimals, a WISH radius can be considered, at which the\ndifferential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual\ngravitational pull between the planetesimals. We find that the WISH radius\ncould be much smaller than the Hill radius, i.e. WISH could play a more\nimportant role than tidal perturbations by the star. Here we study the WISH\nradii for planetesimal pairs of different sizes and compare the effects of wind\nand gravitational shearing (drag force vs. gravitational tidal force). We then\ndiscuss the role of WISH for the stability and survival of binary\nplanetesimals. Binaries are sheared apart by the wind if they are wider than\ntheir WISH radius. WISH-stable binaries can inspiral and possibly coalesce due\nto gas drag.

Our results suggest that even WISH-stable binaries may merge in\ntimes shorter than the lifetime of the gaseous disk. This may constrain\ncurrently observed binary planetesimals to have formed far from the star or at\na late stage after the dispersal of most of the disk gas.

Abstract: FU Orionis (FUOR) outbursts are major optical brightening episodes in\nlow-mass protostars that correspond to rapid mass-accretion events in the\ninnermost region of a protostellar disc. The outbursts are accompanied by\nstrong outflows, with the inferred mass outflow rates reaching ~10% of the mass\ninflow rates. Shu et al. proposed that the outflows represent accreted disc\nmaterial that is driven centrifugally from the spun-up surface layers of the\nprotostar by the stellar magnetic field. This model was critiqued by Calvet et\nal., who argued that it cannot reproduce the photospheric absorption-line\nshifts observed in the prototype object FU Ori. Calvet et al. proposed that the\nwind is launched, instead, from the surface of the disc on scales of a few\nstellar radii by a non-stellar magnetic field. In this paper we present results\nfrom numerical simulations of disc accretion on to a slowly rotating star with\nan aligned magnetic dipole moment that gives rise to a kilogauss-strength\nsurface field. We demonstrate that, for parameters appropriate to FU Ori, such\na system can develop a strong, collimated disc outflow of the type previously\nidentified by Romanova et al. in simulations of protostars with low and\nmoderate accretion rates. At the high accretion rate that characterizes FUOR\noutbursts, the radius at which the disc is truncated by the stellar magnetic\nfield moves much closer to the stellar surface, but the basic properties of the\noutflow, which is launched from the vicinity of the truncation radius along\nopened-up stellar magnetic field lines, remain the same, and are distinct from\nthose of the mechanism proposed by Shu et al.

The outflow energy is processed into copious e+- until the plasma enters\nouter parts of the loop where the magnetic field is reduced below 10^13 G. In\nthe outer zone, photons scattered by the outflow do not convert to e+- pairs\nand the outflow radiates its energy away. The escaping radiation forms a\ndistinct hard X-ray peak in the magnetar spectrum. It has the following\nfeatures: (1) Its luminosity L=10^35-10^36 erg/s can easily exceed the thermal\nluminosity from the magnetar surface.

We also show that the two samples of\nhosts produce SNe Ia with similar color distributions. The relatively simple\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) expected for passive galaxies enable us to\nmeasure stellar masses of early-type SN hosts.

In\nprinciple, these can change the results at the order-of-magnitude level.

Whether the layer continues the isobaric contraction depends on the\ndensity at this moment: if the density is high enough for collisionally\nexciting H2 rovibrational levels (>10^4/cc), enhanced H2 collisional\ndissociation suppresses the gas to cool further. In this case, the layer\nfragments into massive (>10^5Msun) clouds, which collapse isothermally (~8000K)\nby the Ly alpha cooling without subsequent fragmentation.

These sub-domains break into even\nsmaller sub-sub domains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of\nlocally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity\nfield responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining\nthe sub voids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale\ncomponents of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids\nbut they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy\nformation and evolution. The super-Hubble expansion inside voids makes them\ncosmic magnifiers by stretching their internal primordial density fluctuations\nallowing us to probe the small scales in the primordial density field. Voids\nalso act like time machines by \"freezing\" the development of the medium-scale\ndensity fluctuations responsible for the formation of the tenuous web of\nstructures seen connecting proto galaxies in computer simulations. As a result\nof this freezing haloes in voids can remain \"connected\" to this tenuous web\nuntil the present time. This may have an important effect in the formation and\nevolution of galaxies in voids by providing an efficient gas accretion\nmechanism via coherent low-velocity streams that can keep a steady inflow of\nmatter for extended periods of time. \n\n"}

Such supersonic motion may source\nshocks that heat the Universe. This motion may also suppress star formation in\nthe first halos. Even a small amount of coupling of the 21cm signal to this\nmotion has the potential to vastly enhance the 21cm brightness temperature\nfluctuations at 15<z<40 as well as to imprint acoustic oscillations in this\nsignal. We present estimates for the size of this coupling, which we calibrate\nwith a suite of cosmological simulations. Our simulations, discussed in detail\nin a companion paper, are initialized to self-consistently account for gas\npressure and the dark matter-baryon relative velocity, v_bc (in contrast to\nprior simulations). We find that the supersonic velocity difference\ndramatically suppresses structure formation at 10-100 comoving kpc scales, it\nsources shocks throughout the Universe, and it impacts the accretion of gas\nonto the first star-forming minihalos (even for halo masses as large as ~10^7\nMsun). However, we find that the v_bc-sourced temperature fluctuations can\ncontribute only as much as ~10% of the fluctuations in the 21cm signal. We do\nfind that v_bc could source an O(1) component in the power spectrum of the 21cm\nsignal via the X-ray (but not ultraviolet) backgrounds produced once the first\nstars formed. In a scenario in which ~10^6 Msun minihalos reheated the Universe\nvia their X-ray backgrounds, we find that the pre-reionization 21cm signal\nwould be larger than previously anticipated and exhibit significant acoustic\nfeatures. We show that structure formation shocks are unable to heat the\nUniverse sufficiently to erase a strong 21cm absorption trough at z ~ 20 that\nis found in most models of the sky-averaged 21cm intensity. \n\n"}

Our main result is that the bar fraction is\nsignificantly lower among gas rich disc galaxies than gas poor ones. This is\nnot explained by known trends for more massive (stellar) and redder disc\ngalaxies to host more bars and have lower gas fractions: we still see at fixed\nstellar mass a residual correlation between gas content and bar fraction. We\ndiscuss three possible causal explanations: (1) bars in disc galaxies cause\natomic gas to be used up more quickly, (2) increasing the atomic gas content in\na disc galaxy inhibits bar formation, and (3) bar fraction and gas content are\nboth driven by correlation with environmental effects (e.g. tidal triggering of\nbars, combined with strangulation removing gas).

Momentum\ntransfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray\ntracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. We find\nthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the\nturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular\nvelocity of early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation\npressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x\n10^{-2} Msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x\n10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure is\nincluded. Its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} Z_sun is consistent with the\nobserved dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation.

Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars.

We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a\ntoroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where\nthe ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created\nby various processes acting early in a neutron star's life.

Peculiar motions of galaxies\nintroduce systematic deviations between the observed galaxy redshifts z and the\ncorresponding cosmological redshifts z_cos. A novel method for estimating the\nangular power spectrum of the peculiar velocity field based on observations of\ngalaxy redshifts and apparent magnitudes m (or equivalently fluxes) is\npresented. This method exploits the fact that a mean relation between z_cos and\nm of galaxies can be derived from all galaxies in a redshift-magnitude survey.\nGiven a galaxy magnitude, it is shown that the z_cos(m) relation yields its\ncosmological redshift with a 1-sigma error of sigma_z~0.3 for a survey like\nEuclid (~10^9 galaxies at z<~2), and can be used to constrain the angular power\nspectrum of z-z_cos(m) with a high signal-to-noise ratio.

In this work we search for GeV emission\nfrom three nearby galaxy clusters: Coma, Virgo and Fornax.

Instead, we determine upper limits on emission due to dark matter\nannihilation and cosmic rays. For Fornax and Virgo the limits on CR emission\nare consistent with theoretical models, but for Coma the upper limit is a\nfactor of 2 below the theoretical expectation. Allowing for systematic\nuncertainties associated with the treatment of CR, the upper limits on the\ncross section for dark matter annihilation from our clusters are more stringent\nthan those from analyses of dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way.

Here we introduce TAM waves, solutions of fixed total angular\nmomentum to the Helmholtz equation, for three-dimensional scalar, vector, and\ntensor fields. The vector TAM waves of given total angular momentum can be\ndecomposed further into a set of three basis functions of fixed orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM), a set of fixed helicity, or a basis consisting of a\nlongitudinal (L) and two transverse (E and B) TAM waves.

We show how all of the vector and tensor TAM waves can\nbe obtained by applying derivative operators to scalar TAM waves.

The planet's mass and orbit, as well as the disc's\ncollisional activity are explored as free parameters.\n  We find that collisions always significantly damp planet-induced structures.\nFor the case of an embedded planet, the planet's signature, mostly a density\ngap around its radial position, should remain detectable in head-on images if\nM_planet > M_Saturn. If the system is seen edge-on, however, inferring the\npresence of the planet is much more difficult, although some planet-induced\nsignatures might be observable under favourable conditions.\n  For the inner-ring/external-planet case, planetary perturbations cannot\nprevent collision-produced small fragments from populating the regions beyond\nthe ring: The radial luminosity profile exterior to the ring is close to the\none it should have in the absence of the planet.

From the observed\nrotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nGalactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal\nsphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii.

In addition, surveys\nhave non-trivial geometries, which make the interpretation of the observations\neven trickier, but the uncertainty can nevertheless be worked out within the\nGaussian approximation. With the recent realization that Gaussian treatments of\nthe power spectrum lead to biased error bars about the dilation of the baryonic\nacoustic oscillation scale, efforts are being directed towards developing\nnon-Gaussian analyses, mainly from N-body simulations so far. Unfortunately,\nthere is currently no way to tell how the non-Gaussian features observed in the\nsimulations compare to those of the real Universe, and it is generally hard to\ntell at what level of accuracy the N-body simulations can model complicated\nnon-linear effects such as mode coupling and galaxy bias.

In this paper, we study the hot\nX-ray coronae beyond the optical disks of two normal massive spirals, NGC1961\nand NGC6753. Based on XMM-Newton X-ray observations, hot gaseous emission is\ndetected to ~60 kpc - well beyond their optical radii. The hot gas has a\nbest-fit temperature of kT~0.6 keV and an abundance of ~0.1 Solar, and exhibits\na fairly uniform distribution, suggesting that the quasi-static gas resides in\nhydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well of the galaxies. The bolometric\nluminosity of the gas in the (0.05-0.15)r_200 region (r_200 is the virial\nradius) is ~6e40 erg/s for both galaxies.

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun.

For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection.

Equally important, the SED is\nunusually red for a SLSN, with a color temperature of 6800 K near maximum\nlight, in contrast to previous H-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the UV. The\nspectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with\na photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in the\nrest-frame UV.

Gravitational lensing by large-scale\n  structure Abstract: On the arcminute angular scales probed by Planck, the CMB anisotropies are\ngently perturbed by gravitational lensing. Here we present a detailed study of\nthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217GHz\nfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. We use\nthe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a\n(noisy) map of the CMB lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure\nof the mass distribution back to the CMB last-scattering surface. Our lensing\npotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact\nwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale\nstructure. We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding\ngenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting LCDM model for\nthe Planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100\ncorrectly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures\nwhich source the lensing potential.

Previous studies have focused on if and how AGN feedback\nheats the gas, but little paid attention to its triggering mechanism. Using\nspherically symmetric simulations, we investigate how large-scale cooling flows\nare accreted by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in eight well-observed\nsystems and find an interesting dichotomy. In massive clusters, the gas\ndevelops a central cooling catastrophe within about the cooling time (typically\n~ 100 - 300 Myr), resulting in a cold-mode accretion onto SMBHs. However, in\nour four simulated systems on group and galaxy scales at a low metallicity\nZ=0.3Z_{sun}, the gas quickly settles into a long-term state which has a cuspy\ncentral temperature profile extending to several tens to about 100 pc.

The present study aims at characterizing the\nvariation of the molecular outflow properties with time, and at studying the\nSiO excitation conditions in outflows associated with massive YSOs.

We detect SiO and HCO+ outflow emission in all the sources,\nand bipolar structures in six of them. The outflow parameters are similar to\nthose found toward other massive YSOs. We find an increase of the HCO+ outflow\nenergetics as the object evolve, and a decrease of the SiO abundance with time,\nfrom 10^(-8) to 10^(-9).

Additionally the baryon feedback impose also\nan equilibrium condition, which when coupled with the imposed baryonic scale\nlength induce a new type of similarity. The new self similar solution implies\nthat the acceleration generated by dark matter is scale free, which in turns\nimplies that the baryonic acceleration at a reference radius is also scale\nfree. Constant dark matter and baryonic accelerations at a reference radius\nhave effectively been observed for a large class of different galaxies, which\nis in support of this approach. The new self similar properties implies that\nthe total acceleration at larger distances is scale free, the transition\nbetween the dark matter and baryons dominated regime occurs at a constant\nacceleration, and the maximum of the velocity curve which defines the amplitude\nof the velocity curve at larger distances is proportional to $M^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nThese results demonstrates that in this self similar model, cold dark matter is\nconsistent with the basics of MOND phenomenology for the galaxies.

The 6 to 18-mu\nregion is interspersed with a great many weak lines, to which the plateaus are\nassigned. Similarly, the far IR spectrum is ascribed to the phonon (skeletal)\nspectrum which is readily identified beyond 18 mu. The absorptivities and\nabsorption cross-sections per interstellar H atom deduced from these spectra\nare comparable with those of laboratory dust analogs and astronomical\nmeasurements, respectively. Moreover, the 5-35 mu spectra of two typical\nProto-Planetary Nebula were reasonably well simulated with combinations of\nmolecules containing functional groups which carry the 21- and 30-mu bands, and\nmolecules devoid of these but carrying strong phonon spectra.

For our estimate, we have\nonly considered mergers of BBHs which escape from GCs (BBH escapers). BBH\nescapers merge more quickly than BBHs inside GCs because of their small\nsemi-major axes. N-body simulation can not deal with a GC with the number of\nstars N ~ 10^6 due to its high calculation cost. We have simulated dynamical\nevolution of small-N clusters (10^4 <~ N <~ 10^5), and have extrapolated our\nsimulation results to large-N clusters. From our simulation results, we have\nfound the following dependence of BBH properties on N.

Emission-line flux\nmaps show the same two-armed nuclear spiral we have discovered in previous\nobservations with the HST-ACS camera.

The gas density is highest (500 - 900 cm^(-3)) at the nucleus and\nin the northern border of the east arm, at a region where the radio jet seems\nto be deflected. Channel maps show blueshifts but also some redshifts at the\neastern arm and jet location which can be interpreted as originated in the\nfront and back walls of an outflow pushed by the radio jet, suggesting also\nthat the outflow is launched close to the plane of the sky. We estimate a mass\noutflow rate along the east arm of 0.26 - 0.32 Msun yr^(-1) (depending on the\nassumed outflow geometry), which is between one and two orders of magnitude\nhigher than the mass accretion rate to the active nucleus, implying that there\nis mass-loading of the nuclear outflow from circumnuclear gas.

In particular, we argue for a covariant mass bound conjecture: in a\nspacetime free of horizon, the mass inside a surface $A$ cannot exceed $16 \\pi\nG^2 m^2< A $, while the reverse holds in a spacetime with horizons. This is\ngiven a precise definition using the formalism of light-sheets. We show that\n$\\hbar/c$ may be also given a geometrical interpretation, namely $4 \\pi\n\\hbar^2/m^2< A$. We then combine these inequalities and find/review the\nfollowing: (1) Any system must have a size greater than the Planck length, in\nthe sense that there exists a minimal area (2) We comment on the Minimal Length\nScenarios and the fate of Lorentz symmetry near the Planck scale (3) Quanta\nwith transplanckian frequencies are allowed in a large enough boxes (4) There\nexists a mass-dependent maximal acceleration given by $m c^3/\\hbar$ if $m<m_p$\nand by $c^4/G m$ if $m>m_p$ (5) There exists a mass dependent maximal force and\npower (6) There exists a maximal energy density and pressure (7) Physical\nsystems must obey the Holographic Principle (8) Holographic bounds can only be\nsaturated by systems with $m>m_p$; systems lying on the ``Compton line'' $l\n\\sim 1/m$ are fundamental objects without substructures (9) We speculate on a\nnew bound from above for the action.

In HAEBEs, the objects with CO detections all have flared discs in\nwhich the gas and dust are thermally decoupled. We use a small model grid to\nanalyse our observations and find that an increased amount of flaring means\nhigher line flux, as it increases the mass in warm gas.

We find that HAEBE\nsources with CO detections have high Luv and strong PAH emission, again\nconnected to the heating of the gas.

Within the context of this picture, significant\norbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets\ncan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment\nwith the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital\nobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star\ninteractions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit\nmisalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum\ntransfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational\nevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and\naccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote\nparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that\nwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is\nlargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.\nspecific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface\nfields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of\nmagnitude).

Abstract: Radio relics in galaxy clusters are thought to be associated with powerful\nshock waves that accelerate particles via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\nAmong the particles accelerated by DSA, relativistic protons should outnumber\nelectrons by a large factor. While the relativistic electrons emit synchrotron\nemission detectable in the radio band, the protons interact with the thermal\ngas to produce gamma-rays in hadronic interactions. Using simple models for the\npropagation of shock waves through clusters, the distribution of thermal gas\nand the efficiency of DSA, we find that the resulting hadronic $\\gamma$-ray\nemission lies very close or above the upper limits from the FERMI data on\nnearby clusters. This suggests that the relative acceleration efficiency of\nelectrons and protons is at odds with predictions from DSA.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of linking the\ncircular velocity of galaxies, as determined from the Fundamental Plane and\nTully-Fisher relations, to the slope of the IMF with parameterizations guided\nby several of these studies. For each empirical relation, we generate stellar\nmasses of ~600,000 SDSS galaxies at z ~ 0.1, by fitting the optical photometry\nto large suites of synthetic stellar populations that sample the full range of\ngalaxy parameters. We generate stellar mass functions and examine the\nstellar-to-halo mass relations using sub-halo abundance matching. At the\nmassive end, the stellar mass functions become a power law, instead of the\nfamiliar exponential decline. As a result, it is a generic feature of these\nmodels that the central galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation is significantly\nflatter at high masses (slope ~ -0.3 to -0.4) than in the case of a universal\nIMF (slope ~ -0.6). We find that regardless of whether the IMF varies\nsystematically in all galaxies or just early types, there is still a\nwell-defined peak in the central stellar-to-halo mass ratio at halo masses of ~\n10E12 solar masses. In general, the IMF variations explored here lead to\nsignificantly higher integrated stellar densities if the assumed dependence on\ncircular velocity applies to all galaxies, including late-types; in fact the\nmore extreme cases can be ruled out, as they imply an unphysical situation in\nwhich the stellar fraction exceeds the universal baryon fraction. \n\n"}

Photometric\nclassifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light\ncurves that were not observed spectroscopically. From these observations, 4607\ntransients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae,\nmaking this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We\npresent a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy\nproperties including stellar masses, star-formation rates, and the average\nstellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2\ndistance moduli for a total of 1443 SN Ia with spectroscopic redshifts as well\nas photometric redshifts for a further 677 purely-photometric SN Ia candidates.\nUsing the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SN Ia\nsample and assuming a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, we determine Omega_M = 0.315\n+/- 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant\nat 5.7 sigmas. \n\n"}

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic\nsolutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux\nthrough the star increases with decreasing rotation period. The observational\ndata can be matched if we assume the emissions to go as the power 3-4 of $f_m$.\nAssuming that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism saturates with increasing\nrotation, we can provide an explanation for the observed saturation of emission\nat low Rossby numbers. The main failure of our model is that it predicts an\nincrease of magnetic cycle period with increasing rotation rate, which is the\nopposite of what is found observationally. Much of our calculations are based\non the assumption that the magnetic buoyancy makes the magnetic flux tubes to\nrise radially from the bottom of the convection zone.

CO line and dust continuum emission are\ndetected at the location of a strong MIPS source that is offset by ~1.5\" from\nthe Ly-alpha peak. Neither of these emission components is resolved with the\n1.7\" beam, showing that the gas and dust are confined to within ~7kpc from this\ngalaxy. No millimeter source is found at the location of the Ly-alpha peak,\nruling out a central compact source of star formation as the power source for\nthe Ly-alpha emission. Combined with a spatially-resolved spectrum of Ly-alpha\nand HeII, we constrain the kinematics of the extended gas using the CO emission\nas a tracer of the systemic redshift. Near the MIPS source, the Ly-alpha\nprofile is symmetric and its line center agrees with that of CO line, implying\nthat there are no significant bulk flows and that the photo-ionization from the\nMIPS source might be the dominant source of the Ly-alpha emission.

We performed two-dimensional period\nanalysis of its light curves by using a method called \"least absolute shrinkage\nand selection operator\" (Lasso) and \"phase dispersion minimization\" (PDM)\nanalysis, and we found that the period of negative superhumps systematically\nchanged between a superoutburst and the next superoutburst. The trend of the\nperiod change can beinterpreted as reflecting the change of the disk radius.\nThis change of the disk radius is in good agreement with the predicted change\nof the disk radius by the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model. The normal\noutbursts within a supercycle showed a general trend that the rising rate to\nmaximum becomes slower as the next superoutburst approaches. The change can be\ninterpreted as the consequence of the increased gas-stream flow onto the inner\nregion of the disk as the result of the tilted disk. Some of the superoutbursts\nwere found to be triggered by a precursor normal outburst when the positive\nsuperhumps appeared to develop. The positive and negative superhumps co-existed\nduring the superoutburst.

We investigate the influence on the\ndisc structure caused by a jump in the alpha parameter of the viscosity to\nmodel a dead-zone structure in the disc. We focus on M-dot discs, which have a\nconstant net mass flux. Using the resulting disc structure, we investigate the\nconsequences for the formation of planetesimals and determine the regions of\noutward migration for proto-planets. We performed numerical hydrosimulations of\nM-dot discs in the r-z-plane. We used the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code\nFARGOCA that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation as well\nas a two-temperature solver that includes radiation transport in the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation. Viscosity transitions inside the disc\ncreate transitions in density that stop inward migration for small planets\nthrough the so-called \"planet trap\" mechanism. This mechanism also works for\nplanets down to M_P > 0.5M_E. Additionally, the viscosity transitions change\nthe pressure gradient in the disc, which facilitates planetesimal formation via\nthe streaming instability. However, a very steep transition in viscosity is\nneeded to achieve in a pressure bump in the disc. The transition in viscosity\nfacilitates planetesimal formation and can stop the migration of small-mass\nplanets (M_P>0.5M_E), but still does not halt inward migration of smaller\nplanets and planetesimals that are affected by gas drag.

Our three directions are as follows. (i) Taking the variable\nsodium absorption lines in some SN Ia to originate in a massive circumstellar\nmatter (CSM), as has been claimed recently, we use the results of Sternberg et\nal.

(ii) We next use results that show\nthat whenever there are hydrogen lines in SN Ia the hydrogen mass in the CSM is\nlarge (> 1 M_Sun), hence the explosion is a SNIP.

In Tauris et al. (2013), it was demonstrated that\nhelium star companions to neutron stars (NSs) may experience mass transfer and\nevolve into naked ~1.5 M_sun metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass\nlimit. Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution\nleading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the\nbinary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron\ncore-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium\nejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or\nType Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star\ndonors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital\nperiods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also\ndiscuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -\nas well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the\nevolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN\nexplosion. We find that ultra-stripped SNe are possible for both EC SNe and Fe\nCCSNe, and that the amount of helium ejected is correlated with P_orb - the\ntightest systems even having donors being stripped down to envelopes of less\nthan 0.01 M_sun. We estimate the rise time of ultra-stripped SNe to be in the\nrange 12 hr - 8 days, and light curve decay times between 1 and 50 days.\nUltra-stripped SNe may produce NSs in the mass range 1.10 - 1.80 M_sun and are\nhighly relevant for LIGO/VIRGO since most (possibly all) merging double NS\nsystems have evolved through this phase.

For a type-I planet, which\nis formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal\nemission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately $10^6$ years.\nTherefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in\nthis orbital region. In contrast, a type-II planet, which is formed inside the\ncritical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared\natmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L\nbands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star\ncontrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$.

We\nmodel different types of decaying cosmic MHD turbulence in the expanding\nuniverse and characterize the large-scale magnetic fields in such a medium.\nDirect numerical simulations of freely decaying MHD turbulence are performed\nfor different magnetogenesis scenarios: magnetic fields generated during cosmic\ninflation as well as electroweak and QCD phase transitions in the early\nuniverse.\n  Magnetic fields and fluid motions are strongly coupled due to the high\nReynolds number in the early universe. Hence, we abandon the simple adiabatic\ndilution model to estimate magnetic field amplitudes in the expanding universe\nand include turbulent mixing effects on the large-scale magnetic field\nevolution. Numerical simulations have been carried out for non-helical and\nhelical magnetic field configurations.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$.

Building on the iHOD framework developed by Zu &\nMandelbaum (2015a), we consider two quenching scenarios: 1) a \"halo\" quenching\nmodel in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in\nboth centrals and satellites; and 2) a \"hybrid\" quenching model in which the\nquenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass while the satellite\nquenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fit models\ndescribe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching\nprovides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}\nM_\\odot/h^2$. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo\nmass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct\nweak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which\nquenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which\ngalaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed $M_*$, fail to reproduce the\nobserved halo mass for massive blue centrals.

By\nestimating the radii of low-mass stars in three young clusters (NGC 2264, NGC\n2547, NGC 2516, with ages of 5, 35 and 140 Myr respectively), we aim to\nestablish whether similar radius inflation is seen in single, magnetically\nactive stars. We use radial velocities from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and\npublished photometry to establish cluster membership and combine GES\nmeasurements of vsini with published rotation periods to estimate average radii\nfor groups of fast-rotating cluster members as a function of their luminosity\nand age. The average radii are compared with the predictions of both standard\nevolutionary models and variants that include magnetic inhibition of convection\nand starspots. At a given luminosity, the stellar radii in NGC 2516 and NGC\n2547 are larger than predicted by standard evolutionary models at the ages of\nthese clusters.

Among these eight, modulations during quiescence are\nevident at the known orbital periods in the SU UMa stars QZ Vir and RZ Leo, and\nat our newly determined orbital periods of 1RXS J0632+2536 and WD 1144+011. The\nperiodogram analysis for the quiescent light curve of QZ Vir reveals\nmulti-period modulations and the coexistence of orbital and superhump periods.\nThe phased orbital light curves for the other 3 CVs in quiescence display wide\n(about half cycle) and shallow (< 0.5 mag) eclipse features. Besides these\nmodulations, their quiescent light curves reveal several transient events: a\nsudden decrease of system light in 1RXS J0632+2536, a low level flare-like\nevent in QZ Vir, a short brightening event in RZ Leo and a temporary\ndisappearance of the orbital modulation in WD 1144+011. The two known dwarf\nnovae UV Gem and TW Vir and the CVs USNO-B1.01144-00115322 and\nCSS130516:111236.7+002807 show outbursts, including 1 complete and 3 incomplete\nnormal outbursts and 2 complete superoutbursts. An incomplete but typical\nnormal outburst confirms the dwarf nova identification of the\nUSNO-B1.01144-00115322. The one complete normal outburst in UV Gem possibly\nprovides the orbital period, since its modulations are shorter than the\npreviously observed superhump period. The superoutbursts of TW Vir and\nCSS130516:111236.7+002807, along with their corresponding superhump periods,\nindicate that both objects are SU UMa stars. The derived superhump period of\nCSS130516:111236.7+002807 is 1.44 hr, implying that this new SU UMa star is\nclose to the period minimum. \n\n"}

X-ray and optical spectroscopy Abstract: The long-period, highly eccentric O-star binary 9 Sgr, known for its\nnon-thermal radio emission and its relatively bright X-ray emission, went\nthrough its periastron in 2013. Such an event can be used to observationally\ntest the predictions of the theory of colliding stellar winds over a broad\nrange of wavelengths. We have conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign\nof 9 Sgr around the 2013 periastron. In this paper, we focus on X-ray\nobservations and optical spectroscopy. The optical spectra allow us to revisit\nthe orbital solution of 9 Sgr and to refine its orbital period to 9.1 years.\nThe X-ray flux is maximum at periastron over all energy bands, but with clear\ndifferences as a function of energy. The largest variations are observed at\nenergies above 2 keV, whilst the spectrum in the soft band (0.5 - 1.0 keV)\nremains mostly unchanged indicating that it arises far from the collision\nregion, in the inner winds of the individual components. The level of the hard\nemission at periastron clearly deviates from the 1/r relation expected for an\nadiabatic wind interaction zone, whilst this relation seems to hold at the\nother phases covered by our observations. The spectra taken at phase 0.946\nreveal a clear Fe xxv line at 6.7 keV, but no such line is detected at\nperiastron (phi = 0.000) although a simple model predicts a strong line that\nshould be easily visible in the data.

The outburst was\ncomposed of a precursor and the main superoutburst. The precursor outburst\noccurred at least 5 d before the maximum of the main superoutburst. Despite\nthis separation, long-period superhumps were continuously seen between the\nprecursor and main superoutburst.

We show\nthat spurious haloes are a feature of traditional N-body simulations of\ncosmological structure formation models, including WDM and Cold Dark Matter\n(CDM) models, in which gravitational collapse proceeds in an initially\nanisotropic fashion, and arises naturally as a consequence of\ndiscreteness-driven relaxation. We demonstrate this using controlled N-body\nsimulations of plane-symmetric collapse and show that spurious haloes are\nseeded at shell crossing by localised velocity perturbations induced by the\ndiscrete nature of the density field, and that their characteristic separation\nshould be approximately the mean inter-particle separation of the N-body\nsimulation, which is fixed by the mass resolution within the volume.

Using the spectroscopic data\nwe computed time-resolved Doppler tomograms of the system demonstrating its\nbehavior at different orbital phases. In the tomograms one can see the periodic\nbrightening of different regions within one orbital cycle. We interpret this\nbrightening as being due to the interaction of four phase-locked shock waves in\nthe disk with a specific internal precessing density wave that develops inside\nthe disk, because of the tidal influence of the secondary star, and this\ndensity wave propagates up to the disk's outer regions. When the outer part of\nthe density wave in its precessional motion reaches a shock wave the local\ndensity grows, which amplifies the shock (by increasing $\\rho V^{2}/2$). This\nresults in an additional energy release in the shock and can be observed as a\nbrightening. Analysis of the tomographic results and the photometric data shows\nthat two main sources contribute to the light curves of the system: the\nradiation of the \"hot line\" and the bow-shock gives us two major orbital humps,\nlocated approximately at the orbital phases $\\phi=0.25$ and $\\phi=0.75$; the\namplification of the four shock waves may give us up to four \"superhumps\"\nshifting over the light curve with the precessional period. These two effects,\nwhen overlapping, change the shape of the light curves, shift the hump maxima,\nand they sometimes produce more than two humps in the light curve. We should\nemphasize that when saying \"superhumps\" we imply an effect that is observed in\nquiescent light curves of WZ Sge stars, as opposed to \"classical\" superhumps\nusually observed in outbursts. \n\n"}

We find that the environmental influence on\ngalactic chemical abundances is strongest for galaxies with masses of 10^9.1\nM_sun to 10^9.6 Msun. The galaxies in the densest environments may exceed the\naverage oxygen abundances by about 0.05 dex (the median value of the\noverabundances for 101 galaxies in the densest environments) and show higher\nabundances in nitrogen by about 0.1. The abundance excess decreases with\nincreasing galaxy mass and with decreasing environmental density. Since only a\nsmall fraction of late-type galaxies is located in high-density environments\nthese galaxies do not have a significant influence on the general X/H - M\nrelation. The metallicity - mass relations for isolated galaxies and for\ngalaxies with neighbors are very similar.

In this paper, we present MUSE observations of an\nelliptical galaxy in Abell 2670 with long tails of material visible in the\noptical spectra, as well as blobs with tadpole-like morphology.

The stellar component does not have significant rotation, while the\nionized gas defines a clear star-forming gas disk. We argue, based on deep\noptical images of the galaxy, that the gas was most likely acquired during a\npast wet merger. It is possible that the star-forming blobs are also remnants\nof the merger. In addition, the direction and kinematics of the one-sided\nionized tails, combined with the tadpole morphology of the star-forming blobs,\nstrongly suggests that the system is undergoing ram pressure from the\nintracluster medium.

Abstract: The recent Madala hypothesis, a conjecture that seeks to explain anomalies\nwithin Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data (particularly in the transverse\nmomentum of the Higgs boson), is interesting for more than just a statistical\nhint at unknown and unpredicted physics. This is because the model itself\ncontains additional new particles that may serve as Dark Matter (DM)\ncandidates. These particles interact with the Standard Model via a scalar\nmediator boson $S$. More interesting still, the conjectured mass range for the\nDM candidate ($65$ - $100$ GeV) lies within the region of models viable to try\nexplain the recent Galactic Centre (GC) gamma-ray excess seen by Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS).\nTherefore, assuming $S$ decays promptly, it should be possible to check what\nconstraints are imposed upon the effective DM annihilation cross-section in the\nMadala scenario by hunting signatures of $S$ decay that follows DM annihilation\nwithin dense astrophysical structures. In order to make use of existing data,\nwe use the Reticulum II dwarf galaxy and the galactic centre gamma-ray excess\ndata sets from Fermi-LAT, and compare these to the consequences of various\ndecay paths for $S$ in the aforementioned environments.

Consistent\nwith recent studies, the dynamo action is found to be sensitive to the aspect\nratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the\ndirection normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial\ndirection). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To\nexplain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a\nlong box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most\nefficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a\nresult, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal\n(stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux\nspreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are\npermeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the\ninstability.

HSC is a new prime focus\noptical imager with a 1.5 diameter field of view on the 8.2-meter Subaru\ntelescope. The superb median seeing on the HSC $i$-band images of $0.56$ arcsec\nallows the reconstruction of high angular resolution mass maps via weak\nlensing, which is crucial for the weak lensing cluster search.

In\nthis work, we present the first results of the cross power spectrum (CPS)\nbetween radio images observed by the Murchison Widefield Array and the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB), measured by the Planck experiment.

Cluster members are selected\nby a photometric-redshift criterion, and categorized as star-forming,\nquiescent, or intermediate according to their dust-corrected rest-frame colors\nand magnitudes. We employ a \"delayed-then-rapid\" quenching model that relates a\nsimulated cluster mass accretion rate to the observed numbers of each type of\ngalaxy in the cluster to constrain $t_Q$. For galaxies of mass $M_* \\gtrsim\n10^{10.5}~ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, we find a quenching timescale of $t_Q=$ 1.24 Gyr\nin the $z\\sim1.5$ cluster sample, and $t_Q=$ 1.50 Gyr at $z\\sim1$. Using values\ndrawn from the literature, we compare the redshift evolution of $t_Q$ to\ntimescales predicted for different physical quenching mechanisms. We find $t_Q$\nto depend on host halo mass such that quenching occurs over faster timescales\nin clusters relative to groups, suggesting that properties of the host halo are\nresponsible for quenching high-mass galaxies. Between $z=0$ and $z=1.5$, we\nfind that $t_Q$ evolves faster than the molecular gas depletion timescale and\nslower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent with the evolution of\nthe dynamical time.

In contrast, all known globular clusters have\nsimilar ratios of neutron-capture elements to those of halo stars, suggesting\nthat globular clusters form as part of relatively massive galaxies rather than\nin their own dark matter halos. The low neutron-capture element abundances may\nbe the strongest evidence that Gru I and Tri II are (or once were) galaxies\nrather than globular clusters, and we expect future observations of these\nsystems to robustly find non-zero velocity dispersions or signs of tidal\ndisruption.

A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that $r_{\\rm sp}$\ninferred from the observed radial distribution of galaxies is affected by\nselection effects related to the optical cluster-finding algorithms. We test\nthis possibility by measuring the splashback feature in clusters selected via\nthe SZ effect in data from the South Pole Telescope SZ survey and the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope Polarimeter survey. The measurement is accomplished by\ncorrelating these clusters with galaxies detected in the Dark Energy Survey\nYear 3 data. The SZ observable used to select clusters in this analysis is\nexpected to have a tighter correlation with halo mass and to be more immune to\nprojection effects and aperture-induced biases than optically selected\nclusters.

In particular, we study the effectiveness of\nCP-violating source terms induced by dimension-six Yukawa interactions for\nquarks and charged leptons. Despite the relatively small Yukawa coupling,\nCP-violating source terms involving taus are quite effective and can account\nfor the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. We obtain analytical and\nnumerical expressions for the total baryon asymmetry, the former providing\nimportant insight into what makes lepton CP violation relatively effective\ncompared to quark CP violation. Leptons also play an important role if the\nCP-violating source involves top quarks. While the tau Yukawa coupling in the\nStandard Model is small, it significantly enhances the baryon asymmetry by\ntransferring the chiral asymmetry in quarks, which is washed out by strong\nsphalerons, to a chiral asymmetry in leptons. We conclude that leptons should\nnot be ignored even if CP violation is limited to the quark sector. The role of\nleptons can be further increased in scenarios of new physics with additional\nchiral-symmetry-breaking interactions between quarks and leptons, as can happen\nin models with additional Higgs bosons or leptoquarks. Finally, we study\nCP-violating dimension-six Yukawa interactions for lighter quarks and leptons\nbut conclude that these lead to too small baryon asymmetries. \n\n"}

Exploring the faintest regions of\n  the bright early-type galaxies inside the virial radius Abstract: This paper is based on the multi-band (ugri) Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) with\nthe VLT Survey Telescope (VST). We study bright early-type galaxies (m_B<15\nmag) in the 9 square degrees around the core of the Fornax cluster, which\ncovers the virial radius. The main goal of the present work is to provide the\nanalysis of the light distribution for all galaxies out to unprecedented limits\n(in radius and surface brightness) and to release the main products resulting\nfrom this analysis in all FDS bands. From the isophote fit, we derive the\nazimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles, the position angle and\nellipticity profiles as a function of the semi-major axis. In each band, we\nderive the total magnitudes, effective radii, integrated colors and stellar\nmass-to-light ratios. The long integration times, the arcsec-level angular\nresolution of OmegaCam@VST and the large covered area of FDS allow us to map\nthe light and color distributions out to large galactocentric distances (up to\nabout 10-15 R_e) and surface brightness levels beyond mu_r = 27 mag/arcsec^2\n(mu_B > 28 mag/arcsec^2).

Long-duration\n  gamma-ray bursts and supernova $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ bumps Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) associated with supernovae (SNe) are\npossibly born out of the death of a massive star. After the star collapses, a\nstellar-mass black hole (BH) is formed, surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk\nwith outflows. Blandford-Znajek jets can be launched and then break out from\nthe envelope to power LGRBs. The jet luminosity depends on the net inflow\naccretion rate at the inner radius of the disk. Furthermore, $\\rm ^{56}Ni$\nsynthesis should occur in the strong outflows from the accretion disk. The\ndecay of $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ is considered to be the possible origin of SN bumps in\nthe subsequent optical afterglows of LGRBs. If $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ originates\nentirely from the outflows, there is competition between the luminosities of\nLGRBs and those of the corresponding $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ bumps because of the\nmaterial distribution between the disk inflows and outflows. In this paper, we\ninvestigated these two luminosities based on 15 cases of LGRB-SN in the\nframework of the BH hyperaccretion inflow-outflow model. Then, one can\nconstrain the characteristics of the progenitor stars of these LGRBs.

This study presents non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of\nvarious single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars\nof diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after\nexplosion. Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition\nprofile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main\ninfluence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta\non week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,\nshifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted\nsolar metallicity), creating blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and\nmagnetar properties introduces various stretches and shifts to the light curve\n(rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum, all\nmodels show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely\nOIII and CIII lines. Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the\nhigh-brightness phase.

We detect 50 objects with\nrest equivalent width larger than 20 A and a luminous, highly extended Lya halo\naround 1138-262. If the radio galaxy is at the center of a forming cluster,\nthese objects are candidate Lya emitting cluster galaxies. \n\n"}

The\nspectrum of such sources should exhibit an absorption edge due to\npair-production against UV photons along the line of sight. One expects a sharp\ndrop in the number density of UV photons at the Lyman edge E_{L}. This implies\nthat the universe becomes transparent after gamma-ray photons redshift below E\n(m_{e}c^2)^{2}/E_{L} 18 GeV. Thus, there is only a limited redshift interval\nover which GeV photons can pair produce. This implies that any observed\nabsorption will probe radiation fields in the very early universe, regardless\nof the subsequent star formation history of the universe. Furthermore,\nmeasurements of differential absorption between blazars at different redshifts\ncan cleanly isolate the opacity due to UV emissivity at high redshift. An\nobservable absorption edge should be present for most reasonable radiation\nfields with sufficient energy to reionize the universe.

It is well known that the\nprimordial polarization of the CMB is very sensitive to the details of\nreionization. Combining a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, in which the\noptical depth to the reionization epoch is in the range 0.014 to 0.048, with a\nhigh resolution N-body simulation we find that reionization generates a peak\nwith amplitude 0.05~0.15 \\mu K at large angular scales. The position of this\npeak reveals the size of the horizon at reionization, whilst its amplitude is a\nmeasure of the optical depth to reionization. On small scales, ionized patches\nprior to full reionization create a second order polarization signal due to the\ncoupling of the free electron density fluctuation with the quadrupole moment of\nthe temperature anisotropy. Careful study reveals that the coupling generates\nthe same power spectra for electric and magnetic modes, whose amplitudes of\npolarization anisotropies from this process are predicted to be ~10nK.

Abstract: The existence of ultra-fast rotating neutron stars (spin period P < 1 ms) is\nexpected on the basis of current models for the secular evolution of\ninteracting binaries, though they have not been detected yet. Their formation\ndepends on the quantity of matter accreted by the neutron star which, in turn,\nis limited by the mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. An efficient mass\nejection can avoid the formation of ultra-fast pulsars or their accretion\ninduced collapse to a black hole. We propose that significant reductions of the\nmass-transfer rate may cause the switch-on of a radio pulsar phase, whose\nradiation pressure may be capable of ejecting out of the system most of the\nmatter transferred by the companion. This can prevent, for long orbital periods\nand if a sufficiently fast spin has been reached, any further accretion, even\nif the original transfer rate is restored, thus limiting the minimum spin\nperiod attainable by the neutron star. We show that close systems (orbital\nperiods P_orb \\sim 1 hr are the only possible hosts for ultra-fast spinning\nneutron stars.

For deep surveys with z_m = 1, intrinsic\nalignments are believed to be a significant contaminant of the lensing signal,\npreventing high-precision measurements of the matter power spectrum. In this\npaper we show how distance information, either spectroscopic or photometric\nredshifts, can be used to down-weight nearby pairs in an optimised way, to\nreduce the errors in the shear signal arising from intrinsic alignments.\nProvided a conservatively large intrinsic alignment is assumed, the optimised\nweights will essentially remove all traces of contamination.

By analogy with the mathematical\ndescription of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a\nformalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both\nfrequency and angular scale.

Requiring that any new physics contributions involve\nlight degrees of freedom, one of the likely candidates which can affect the\ncooling process would be a nonzero magnetic moment for the neutrino.

Bimodality can\nappear due to different mechanisms of explosion which leads to the formation of\ntwo types of compact stars or due to two different sets of parameters mastering\na particular kick mechanism.

{"id": "astro-ph/0405488", "contents": "Title: Gamma-ray bursts from synchrotron self-Compton emission Abstract: The emission mechanism of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still a matter of\ndebates. The standard synchrotron energy spectrum of cooling electrons F_E ~\nE^{-1/2} is much too soft to account for the majority of the observed spectral\nslopes. An alternative in the form of quasi-thermal Comptonization in a high\ncompactness source has difficulties in reproducing the peak of the observed\nphoton distribution below a few hundred keV. We show here that for typical\nparameters expected in the GRB ejecta the observed spectra in the 20-1000 keV\nBATSE energy range can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of the\nsynchrotron radiation in a partially self-absorbed regime. If the particles are\ncontinuously accelerated/heated over the life-time of a source rather than\nbeing instantly injected, a prominent peak develops in their distribution at a\nLorentz factor gamma ~ 30-100, where synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses are\nbalanced by acceleration and heating due to synchrotron self-absorption. The\nsynchrotron peak should be observed at 10-100 eV, while the self-absorbed\nlow-energy tail with F_E ~ E^2 can produce the prompt optical emission (like in\nthe case of GRB 990123). The first Compton scattering radiation by nearly\nmonoenergetic electrons can then be as hard as F_E ~ E^1 reproducing the\nhardness of most of the observed GRB spectra. The second Compton peak should be\nobserved in the high energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for the\nemission detected by EGRET in GRB 941017. A significant electron-positron pair\nproduction reduces the available energy per particle, moving the spectral peaks\nto lower energies as the burst progresses.

A number of papers report that\nsolar models evolved with standard opacities and diffusion treatment using\nthese new abundances give poor agreement with helioseismic inferences. Here we\nexplore evolved solar models with varying diffusion treatments to reduce the\nphotospheric abundances while keeping the interior abundances about the same as\nearlier standard models. While enhanced diffusion improves agreement with some\nhelioseismic constraints compared to a solar model evolved with the new\nabundances using nominal input physics, the required increases in thermal\ndiffusion rates are unphysically large, and none of the variations tried\nrestores the good agreement attained using the earlier abundances.

The size of this flux deficit varies\nmonotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light-profile, i.e., its\nconcentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R^{1/4} profile, the deficit is\n0.20 mag; for an R^{1/8} profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide\na simple method for recovering total (Sersic) magnitudes from Petrosian\nmagnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (R_90/R_50 or R_80/R_20) within\nthe Petrosian aperture.

We show that concerns recently raised on the efficiency of\ncompetitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally averaged properties\nwhich are inappropriate for the detailed physics of a forming stellar cluster.\nA full treatment requires a realistic treatment of the cluster potential, the\ndistribution of turbulent velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not\ntravel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the\nvelocity-sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower\nvelocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.\nStars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from\nlow relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the\nhigher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter\nthe cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete\nsignificantly and thus retain their low-masses. In competitive accretion, most\nstars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set\nfrom the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete\nthat become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be\nresponsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass\ndistribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars. Global\nkinematics of competitive accretion models include large-scale mass infall,\nwith mean inflow velocities of order 0.5 km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall\nsignatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities and the\nvelocity dispersion present. \n\n"}

Distinct from PBHs formed with mass about the horizon mass (Type I),\nthe PBHs with the scaling relation (Type II) can be created with a range of\nmasses at a given formation time. In general, only the case in which the PBH\nformation is concentrated at one epoch has been considered. However, it is\nexpected that PBH formation is possible over a broad range of epochs if the\ndensity fluctuation has a rather large amplitude and smooth scale dependence.\nIn this paper, we study the PBH formation for both types assuming the power\nspectrum of double inflationary models in which the small scale fluctuations\ncould have large amplitudes independent of the CMBR anisotropy. The mass\nspectrum of Type II PBHs is newly constructed without limiting the PBH\nformation period. The double inflationary power spectrum is assumed to be of\ndouble simple power-law which are smoothly connected.

Abstract: We consider hairy black hole solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton theory,\ncoupled to a Gauss-Bonnet curvature term, and we study their stability under\nsmall, spacetime-dependent perturbations.

In the gravitational sector, and in the limit of\nan infinitely large horizon, the coloured black holes are also found to be\nunstable. Similar behaviour is exhibited by the magnetically charged black\nholes while the bulk of the neutral black holes are proven to be stable under\nsmall, gauge-dependent perturbations. Finally, the electrically charged black\nholes are found to be characterized only by the existence of a gravitational\nsector of perturbations.

The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale. In this work, we construct one such model and evaluate the resulting\nspectrum of density perturbations in the power-law inflationary scenario. While\nour model reproduces the standard spectrum on small scales, it naturally\npredicts a suppression of power on large scales. In fact, the spectrum we\nobtain has some features which are similar to the one that has recently been\nobtained from non-commutative inflation.
