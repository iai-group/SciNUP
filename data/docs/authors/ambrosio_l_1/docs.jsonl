We show a new mechanism that could provide a great resonant and\nnonresonant transmission enhancement of the light or de Broglie particle waves\npassed through the apertures not by the surface waves, but by the constructive\ninterference of diffracted waves (beams generated by the apertures) at the\ndetector placed in the far-field zone.

We give a new proof, which does not\nrequire the compactness of M. More generally, we prove that the evolution of\nany half-flat G-structure on a six-manifold M defines an extension of M to a\nRicci-flat seven-manifold N, for any real form G of SL(3,C). If G is\nnoncompact, then the holonomy group of N is a subgroup of the noncompact form\nG_2^* of G_2^C. Similar results are obtained for the extension of nearly\nhalf-flat structures by nearly parallel G_2- or G_2^*-structures, as well as\nfor the extension of cocalibrated G_2- and G_2^*-structures by parallel\nSpin(7)- and Spin(3,4)-structures, respectively. As an application, we obtain\nthat any six-dimensional homogeneous manifold with an invariant half-flat\nstructure admits a canonical extension to a seven-manifold with a parallel G_2-\nor G_2^*-structure. For the group H_3 \\times H_3, where H_3 is the\nthree-dimensional Heisenberg group, we describe all left-invariant half-flat\nstructures and develop a method to explicitly determine the resulting parallel\nG_2- or G_2^*-structure without integrating. In particular, we construct three\neight-parameter families of metrics with holonomy equal to G_2 and G_2^*.\nMoreover, we obtain a strong rigidity result for the metrics induced by a\nhalf-flat structure (\\omega,\\rho) on H_3 \\times H_3 satisfying \\omega(Z,Z)=0\nwhere Z denotes the centre. Finally, we describe the special geometry of the\nspace of stable three-forms satisfying a reality condition.

We also generalize and give new and shorter\nproofs of a number of known results. In particular we answer a question of M.\nMatsumoto about local conformal mapping between two Minkowski spaces, we\ndescribe all possible conformal self maps and all self similarities on a\nFinsler manifold. We also classify all compact conformally flat Finsler\nmanifolds, solve a conjecture of S. Deng and Z. Hou on the Berwaldian character\nof locally symmetric Finsler spaces, and extend the classic result of H.C. Wang\nabout the maximal dimension of the isometry groups of Finsler manifolds to\nmanifolds of all dimensions.\n  Most proofs in this paper go along the following scheme: using the\ncorrespondence $F \\mapsto g_F$we reduce the Finslerian problem to a similar\nproblem for the Binet-Legendre metric, which is easier and is already solved in\nmost cases we consider. The solution of the Riemannian problem provides us with\nthe additional information that helps to solve the initial Finslerian problem.\n  Our methods apply even in the absence of the strong convexity assumption\nusually assumed in Finsler geometry. The smoothness hypothesis can also be\nreplaced by that of partial smoothness, a notion we introduce in the paper. Our\nresults apply therefore to a vast class of Finsler metrics not usually\nconsidered in the Finsler literature. \n\n"}

Many problems in this subject, certainly the\ntextbook classics, have matrices as variables, and the formulas naturally\ncontain non-commutative polynomials in matrices. These polynomials depend only\non the system layout and do not change with the size of the matrices involved,\nhence such problems are called \"dimension-free\". Analyzing dimension-free\nproblems has led to the development recently of a non-commutative (nc) real\nalgebraic geometry (RAG) which, when combined with convexity, produces\ndimension-free Semidefinite Programming. This article surveys what is known\nabout convexity in the non-commutative setting and nc SDP and includes a brief\nsurvey of nc RAG.

The elliptic operators considered have a degeneracy along a\nportion of the domain boundary which is similar to the degeneracy of a model\nlinear operator identified by Daskalopoulos and Hamilton (1998) in their study\nof the porous medium equation or the degeneracy of the Heston operator (1993)\nin mathematical finance. Existence of a solution to the Dirichlet problem on a\nhalf-ball, where the operator becomes degenerate on the flat boundary and a\nDirichlet condition is only imposed on the spherical boundary, provides the key\nadditional ingredient required for our Perron method. The solution to the\nDirichlet problem on the half-ball can be converted to a Dirichlet problem on\nan infinite slab via a suitable diffeomorphism which becomes holomorphic in\ndimension two. The required Schauder regularity theory and existence of a\nsolution to the Dirichlet problem on the slab can nevertheless be obtained\nusing previous work of the author and C. Pop [arXiv:1210.6727].

Our main technical result is the existence of\nan approximate homomorphism from the algebra to its subalgebra of fixed points,\nwhich is a left inverse for the canonical inclusion. Upon combining this with\nresults regarding local approximations, we show that a number of classes\ncharacterized by inductive limit decompositions with weakly semiprojective\nbuilding blocks, are closed under formation of crossed products by such\nactions. Similarly, in the presence of the Rokhlin property, if the algebra has\nany of the following properties, then so do the crossed product and the fixed\npoint algebra: being a Kirchberg algebra, being simple and having tracial rank\nzero or one, having real rank zero, having stable rank one, absorbing a\nstrongly self-absorbing C*-algebra, satisfying the Universal Coefficient\nTheorem (in the simple, nuclear case), and being weakly semiprojective.

In\nSec.2 we show how to eliminate any backward-traveling components, first in the\ncase of ideal NDW pulses, and then, in Sec.3, for realistic finite-energy NDW\npulses. In particular, in subsec.3.1 we forward a general functional expression\nfor any totally-forward non-diffracting pulses. Then, in Sec.4 an efficient\nmethod is set forth for the analytic description of truncated beams, a\nbyproduct of its being the elimination of any need of lengthy numerical\ncalculations. In Sec.5 we explore the question of the subluminal NDWs, or\nbullets, in terms of two different methods, the second one allowing the\nanalytic description of non-diffracting waves with a static envelope (\"Frozen\nWaves\", FW), in terms of continuous Bessel beam superpositions.

We consider the\ndiffeological dual formally checking that the assignment to each space of its\ndual defines a covariant functor from the category of finite-dimensional\ndiffeological vector spaces to the category of standard (that is, carrying the\nusual smooth structure) vector spaces. We verify that the diffeological tensor\nproduct enjoys the typical properties of the usual tensor product, after which\nwe focus on the so-called smooth direct sum decompositions, a phenomenon\nexclusive to the diffeological setting. We then consider the so-called\npseudo-metrics (diffeological analogues of scalar products), and discuss the\nconsequent decompositions of vector spaces into a smooth direct sum of the\nmaximal isotropic subspace and a characteristic subspace; we show that such a\ndecomposition actually depends only on the choice of the coordinate system.\nFurthermore, we show that, contrary to what was erroneously claimed (by me)\nelsewhere, a characteristic subspace is not unique and is not invariant under\nthe diffeomorphisms of the space on itself. The maximal isotropic subspace is\non the other hand an invariant of the space itself, and this fact allows to\nassign to each its well-defined characteristic quotient, obtaining another\nfunctor, this time a contravariant one, to the category of standard vector\nspaces.

When the\ncosmology constant vanishes, or in the Minkowski spacetime case, these two\nsubsets have the same convex hull in the space of Killing fields. In presence\nof the cosmology constant, the convex hull of $ \\mathcal{O}$ is properly\ncontained in that of $\\mathcal{S}$. This leads to two different notions of\nenergy for an asymptotically AdS spacetime, the spinor energy and the observer\nenergy.

When one works with functional integrals, it\nis not immediately clear how this algebraic feature manifests itself in the\nformalism.

Such bounds play an important\nrole in classical information theory, particularly in coding and Shannon\ntheory; entropy power inequalities are special instances of them. The arguably\nmost elementary kind of information combining is the addition of two binary\nrandom variables (a CNOT gate), and the resulting quantities play an important\nrole in Belief propagation and Polar coding. We investigate this problem in the\nsetting where quantum side information is available, which has been recognized\nas a hard setting for entropy power inequalities.\n  Our main technical result is a non-trivial, and close to optimal, lower bound\non the combined entropy, which can be seen as an almost optimal \"quantum Mrs.\nGerber's Lemma\". Our proof uses three main ingredients: (1) a new bound on the\nconcavity of von Neumann entropy, which is tight in the regime of low pairwise\nstate fidelities; (2) the quantitative improvement of strong subadditivity due\nto Fawzi-Renner, in which we manage to handle the minimization over recovery\nmaps; (3) recent duality results on classical-quantum-channels due to Renes et\nal.

{"id": "1806.10430", "contents": "Title: Deterministics descriptions of the turbulence in the Navier-Stokes\n  equations Abstract: This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the\nNavier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent\nchapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's\ndissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic\nsetting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a\nstationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and\non the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the\nKolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in\nthe form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.\nKolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of\nstatistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research\narea consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the\nNavier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion\nand in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the\npurpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the\nNavier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for\nthe study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition\nand then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the\nNavier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of\nthese damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation\nrate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are\ninterested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes\nintroduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular\ntype of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study\nis motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations\nwith a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of\nthe stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these\nsolutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then\nall non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal\nvariables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns\nthe decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of\nstationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the\nNavier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary\nsolutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical\nequations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is\nto study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the\nturbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according\nto the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency\ndecay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent\nsetting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs\nfrequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a\nprecise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in\nthe turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the\nstationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the\nuniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external\nforce. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these\nsolutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a\ngeneral framework of Morrey spaces. \n\n"}

In this direction, we have recently introduced Forman's\ndiscretization of Ricci curvature to the realm of undirected networks.\nInvestigation of this edge-centric network measure, Forman-Ricci curvature, in\ndiverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that the curvature\nmeasure captures several aspects of the organization of undirected complex\nnetworks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed\nin nature, and the definition of the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected\nnetworks is unsuitable for the analysis of such directed networks. Hence, we\nhere extend the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected networks to the case of\ndirected networks. The simple mathematical formula for the Forman-Ricci\ncurvature of a directed edge elegantly incorporates vertex weights, edge\nweights and edge direction. Furthermore we have compared the Forman-Ricci\ncurvature with the adaptation to directed networks of another discrete notion\nof Ricci curvature, namely, the well established Ollivier-Ricci curvature.\nHowever, the two above-mentioned curvature measures do not account for\nhigher-order correlations between vertices. To this end, we adjusted Forman's\noriginal definition of Ricci curvature to account for directed simplicial\ncomplexes and also explored the potential of this new, augmented type of\nForman-Ricci curvature, in directed complex networks. \n\n"}

We thus\nobtain geometric properties of the maximalrepresentations, that is\nrepresentations whose Toledo invariant achieves the maximum value: we show that\nmaximal representations have discrete image, are faithful and completely\nreducible and they always preserve a maximal tube type subdomain. This extends\nto the case of a general Hermitian group some of the properties of the\nrepresentations in Teichmuller space, as well as results due to Goldman,\nToledo, Hernandez, Bradlow--Garcia-Prada--Gothen. An announcement of these\nresults in the case of surfaces without boundary -- where the role of tube type\ndomains had already been emphasized -- appeared in 2003 by the same authors.\n  The congruence relations for the Toledo invariant involve a rotation number\nfunction related to a continuous homogeneous quasimorphism which gives an\nexplicit way to compute the Toledo invariant. This rotation number generalizes\nconstructions due to Ghys, Barge--Ghys, and Clerc--Koufany.\n  We establish moreover properties of boundary maps associated to maximal\nrepresentations which generalize naturally, for the causal structure of the\nShilov boundary, monotonicity properties of quasiconjugations of the circle.\nThis, together with the congruence relations leads to the result that the\nsubset of maximal representations is always real semialgebraic. \n\n"}
