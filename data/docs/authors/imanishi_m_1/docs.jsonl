Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Abstract: A thorough critical literature survey has been carried out for reliable\nmeasurements of oxygen and neon abundances of planetary nebulae (PNe) and HII\nregions. By contrasting the results of PNe and of HII regions, we aim to\naddress the issues of the evolution of oxygen and neon in the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) and in the late evolutionary phases of low- and intermediate-mass\nstars (LIMS), as well as the currently hotly disputed solar Ne/O abundance\nratio. Through the comparisons, we find that neon abundance and Ne/O ratio\nincrease with increasing oxygen abundance in both types of nebulae, with\npositive correlation coefficients larger than 0.75. The correlations suggest\ndifferent enrichment mechanisms for oxygen and neon in the ISM, in the sense\nthat the growth of neon is delayed compared to oxygen. The differences of\nabundances between PNe and HII regions, are mainly attributed to the results of\nnucleosynthesis and dredge-up processes that occurred in the progenitor stars\nof PNe. We find that both these alpha-elements are significantly enriched at\nlow metallicity (initial oxygen abundance <= 8.0) but not at metallicity higher\nthan the SMC. The fact that Ne/O ratios measured in PNe are almost the same as\nthose in HII regions, regardless of the metallicity, suggests a very similar\nproduction mechanism of neon and oxygen in intermediate mass stars (IMS) of low\ninitial metallicities and in more massive stars, a conjecture that requires\nverification by further theoretical studies. This result also strongly suggests\nthat both the solar neon abundance and the Ne/O ratio should be revised upwards\nby ~0.22 dex from the Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval values or by ~0.14 dex from\nthe Grevesse & Sauval values. \n\n"}

Using a\nlarge sample of 37 short and 421 long GRBs, we find a strong correlation\nbetween the afterglow brightness measured after 11 hours and the observed\nfluence of the prompt emission. Both the optical (R band) and X-ray flux\ndensities (F_R and F_X) scale with the gamma-ray fluence, F_gamma. For bursts\nwith a known redshift, a tight correlation exists between the afterglow flux\ndensities at 11 hours (rest-frame) and the total isotropic gamma-ray energy,\nEgi: F_{R,X} ~ Egi^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 1. The constant of proportionality is\nnearly identical for long and short bursts, when Egi is obtained from the Swift\ndata. Additionally, we find that for short busts with F_gamma >10^{-7} erg\ncm^{-2}, optical afterglows are nearly always detected by reasonably deep early\nobservations. Finally, we show that the ratio F_R/F_X has very similar values\nfor short and long bursts.

Abstract: We address the question of whether numerical particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations and laboratory laser-plasma experiments can (or will be able to, in\nthe near future) model realistic gamma-ray burst (GRB) shocks. For this, we\ncompare the radiative cooling time, t_cool, of relativistic electrons in the\nshock magnetic fields to the microscopic dynamical time of collisionless\nrelativistic shocks -- the inverse plasma frequency of protons, omega_pp^{-1}.\nWe obtain that for t_cool*omega_pp^{-1}\\lesssim ~few hundred, the electrons\ncool efficiently at or near the shock jump and are capable of emitiing away a\nlarge fraction of the shock energy. Such shocks are well-resolved in existing\nPIC simulations; therefore, the microscopic structure can be studied in detail.\nSince most of the emission in such shocks would be coming from the vicinity of\nthe shock, the spectral power of the emitted radiation can be directly obtained\nfrom finite-length simulations and compared with observational data. Such\nradiative shocks correspond to the internal baryon-dominated GRB shocks for the\nconventional range of ejecta parameters. Fermi acceleration of electrons in\nsuch shocks is limited by electron cooling, hence the emitted spectrum should\nbe lacking a non-thermal tail, whereas its peak likely falls in the multi-MeV\nrange. Incidentally, the conditions in internal shocks are almost identical to\nthose in laser-produced plasmas; thus, such GRB-like plasmas can be created and\nstudied in laboratory experiments using the presently available Petawatt-scale\nlaser facilities. An analysis of the external shocks shows that only the highly\nrelativistic shocks, corresponding to the extremely early afterglow phase, can\nhave efficient electron cooling in the shock transition.

The\nmodel is applicable in simulations in which individual star forming regions -\nthe giant molecular complexes - can be identified (resolution of tens of pc)\nand their mean internal density estimated reliably, even if internal structure\nis not resolved. In agreement with previous studies, calculations based on our\nmodel show that the transition from atomic to fully molecular phase depends\nprimarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly related to the dust\nabundance, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium. The clumpiness simply\nboosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as a\ncatalyst of molecular hydrogen formation and as an additional shielding from\ndissociating UV radiation. The upshot is that it is difficult to form\nfully-shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low.

From WMAP five-year data, baryon acoustic oscillations\nand type Ia supernovae luminosity distances, we obtain an upper limit of the\ndark energy density at the last scattering surface (lss), $\\Omega_{\\rm\nEDE}(z_{\\rm lss})<2.3\\times10^{-2}$ (95% C.L.). When we include higher redshift\nobservational probes, such as measurements of the linear growth factors,\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest (\\lya), this limit improves\nsignificantly and becomes $\\Omega_{\\rm EDE}(z_{\\rm lss})<1.4\\times10^{-3}$ (95%\nC.L.).

This has been proposed many times in the past, and simple, single\nradius models can qualitatively match the observed increase in QPO frequency by\ndecreasing a characteristic radius, as predicted by the truncated disc models.\nHowever, this also predicts that the frequency is strongly dependent on spin,\nand gives a maximum frequency at the last stable orbit which is generally much\nhigher than the remarkably constant maximum frequency at ~10Hz observed in all\nblack hole binaries. The key aspect of our model which makes it match these\nobservations is that the precession is of a radially extended region of the hot\ninner flow. The outer radius is set by the truncation radius of the disc as\nabove, but the inner radius lies well outside of the last stable orbit at the\npoint where numerical simulations show that the density drops off sharply for a\nmisaligned flow. Physically motivated analytic estimates for this inner radius\nshow that it increases with a_*, decreasing the expected frequency in a way\nwhich almost completely cancels the expected increase with spin. This ties the\nmaximum predicted frequency to around 10Hz irrespective of a_*, as observed.\nThis is the first QPO model which explains both frequencies and spectrum in the\ncontext of a well established geometry for the accretion flow. \n\n"}

The absence of absorption towards the nearby quasar 1748+700\nyields an upper limit of 5 10^{17} cm^{-2} for the column density of cold HI\ngas along a line of sight which should intersect the disk at a radius of 29\nkpc.

At present day SFR the median pseudobulge could have grown the present\nday stellar mass in 8 Gyr. In almost all galaxies in our sample the specific\nSFR (SFR per unit stellar mass) of the bulge is higher than that of the outer\ndisk, suggesting that almost all galaxies are increasing their B/T through\ninternal star formation. In pseudobulges, SFR density correlates, positvely,\nwith mass density, this is consistent with that stellar mass being formed by\nmoderate, extended star fromation. As well, SFR density and stellar mass of\npseudobulges are shown to be correlated with the stellar mass of the outer\ndisk. Classical bulges have the lowest specific SFR implying a growth times\nthat are longer than a Hubble time. We identify a class of bulges that have\nnuclear morphology similar to pseudobulges, significantly lower specific SFR\nthan pseudobulges, and are closer to classical bulges in structural parameter\ncorrelations.

In this work we investigate\nwhether dwarf galaxy accretion is consistent with the radial profile of star\nformation observed in the Milky Way, which is strongly concentrated toward the\ncenter of the gaseous disk of the Galaxy. Using realistic parameters for the\nGalactic potential, gaseous halo, Galactic disk, velocities of dwarf galaxies,\nand effects of drag on stripped gas in the halo, we model the distribution of\nradii at which dwarf galaxies accrete onto the Galactic disk. We also model the\nradial distribution of the accretion of gas that cools directly out of the halo\nby examining the results of recent simulations. We show that dwarf galaxies\ncannot reproduce the concentration of accretion toward the center of the Galaxy\nrequired by star formation. We also show that clouds that cool directly from\nthe halo can reproduce this central concentration, and conclude that this\ndifference is largely due to the discrepancy in absolute specific angular\nmomentum between the two mechanisms. \n\n"}

In hierarchical formation scenarios, SMBHs are expected to\nform binaries following the merger of their host galaxies. If these binaries do\nnot coalesce before the merger with a third galaxy, the formation of a black\nhole triple system is possible. Numerical simulations of the dynamics of\ntriples within galaxy cores exhibit phases of very high eccentricity (as high\nas $e \\sim 0.99$). During these phases, intense bursts of gravitational\nradiation can be emitted at orbital periapsis. This produces a gravitational\nwave signal at frequencies substantially higher than the orbital frequency. The\nlikelihood of detection of these bursts with pulsar timing and the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna ({\\it LISA}) is estimated using several population\nmodels of SMBHs with masses $\\gtrsim 10^7 {\\rm M_\\odot}$.

Most of these\nclusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of\nobservational constraints. At this age the cluster light is dominated by\nluminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22\nMsun for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study we investigate to\nwhat extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the\norbital motions of binaries. We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical\nmass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion,\nexceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a\nconstant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. This can be\nreproduced by models of virialised star clusters hosting a massive star\npopulation of which ~25 is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of ~0.6 and\nperiods of ~1000 days.

We conduct 2-D hydrodynamic simulations\nto study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the natural\nproducts of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by the\nthermal and ram pressures of the ICM. We find that the temperature of a\nsimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,\nconsistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas\ntemperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically\nrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a\nresult, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram\npressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the\ncoronae. The density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,\nif present, and hence the formation of stars. The increase also enhances\nradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black\nholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in\nclusters than in the field. The radiation enhancement is consistent with a\nsubstantially higher surface brightness of the X-ray emission detected from\ncoronae in cluster environment. The total X-ray luminosity of a corona,\nhowever, depends on the relative importance of the surrounding thermal and ram\npressures. These environment dependences should at least partly explain the\nlarge dispersion in the observed diffuse X-ray luminosities of spheroids with\nsimilar stellar properties.

Furthermore, observations\nindicate that the scatter in the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation increases rapidly\nwith decreasing averaging scale. How the scale-dependent scatter is generated\nand how one recovers a tight ~ kpc scale Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation in the\nfirst place is still largely debated.

But other essential ingredients of standard\ntheories can in principle be tested: quantum mechanics, uncertainty principle,\nenergy and momentum conservation, effective space-time dimensions, hamiltonian\nand lagrangian formalisms, postulates of cosmology, vacuum dynamics and\nparticle propagation, quark and gluon confinement, elementariness of\nparticles... Standard particle physics or string-like patterns may have a\ncomposite origin able to manifest itself through specific cosmic-ray\nsignatures. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays, but also cosmic rays at lower\nenergies, are probes of both \"conventional\" and new Physics. Status, prospects,\nnew ideas, and open questions in the field are discussed. The Post Scriptum\nshows that several basic features of modern cosmology naturally appear in a\nSU(2) spinorial description of space-time without any need for matter,\nrelativity or standard gravitation. New possible effects related to the\nspinorial space-time structure can also be foreseen. Similarly, the existence\nof spin-1/2 particles can be naturally related to physics beyond Planck scale\nand to a possible pre-Big Bang era. \n\n"}

The naive expectation that the anisotropy amplitude scales as D(E) is\nshown to be an oversimplification which does not reflect in the predicted\nanisotropy for any realistic distribution of the sources. The fluctuations in\nthe anisotropy pattern are dominated by nearby sources, so that predicting or\nexplaining the observed anisotropy amplitude and phase becomes close to\nimpossible. We find however that the very weak energy dependence of the\nanisotropy amplitude below $10^{5}$ GeV and the rise at higher energies, can\nbest be explained if the diffusion coefficient is $D(E)\\sim E^{1/3}$.

Since there are three basic physical units, of mass, length and\ntime, there are up to three free parameters in such a rescaling of the units,\n$N_f \\leq 3$. In Newtonian hydrodynamics, e.g., there are indeed usually three\nfree parameters, $N_f = 3$. If, however, the dynamical equations contain a\nuniversal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or the\ngravitational constant $G$, then the requirement that its value remains the\nsame imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of free\nparameters by one, to $N_f = 2$. This is the case, for example, in\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$\nappears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units to\nscale by the same factor, or in Newtonian gravity where the gravitational\nconstant $G$ appears in the equations. More generally, when there are $N_{udc}$\nindependent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then the\nnumber of free parameters is $N_f = max(0,3-N_{udc})$. When both gravity and\nrelativity are included, there is only one free parameter ($N_f = 1$, as both\n$G$ and $c$ appear in the equations so that $N_{udc} = 2$), and the units of\nmass, length and time must all scale by the same factor. The explicit\nrescalings for different types of systems are discussed and summarized here.\nSuch rescalings of the units also hold for discrete particles, e.g. in N-body\nor particle in cell simulations. They are very useful when numerically\ninvestigating a large parameter space or when attempting to fit particular\nexperimental results, by significantly reducing the required number of\nsimulations. \n\n"}

We explore general properties of circumbinary disks by reformulating\nstandard equations for the viscous disk evolution in terms of the viscous\nangular momentum flux F_J. In steady state F_J is a linear function of the\nspecific angular momentum, which is a generalization of (but is not equivalent\nto) the standard constant \\dot M disk solution. If the torque produced by the\ncentral binary is effective at stopping gas inflow and opening a gap (or\ncavity) in the disk, then the inner part of the circumbinary disk can be\napproximated as a constant F_J disk. We compute properties of such disks in\ndifferent physical regimes relevant for SMBH binaries and use these results to\nunderstand the gas-assisted evolution of SMBH pairs starting at separations\n10^{-4}-10^{-2} pc. We find the following. (1) Pile-up of matter at the inner\nedge of the disk leads to continuous growth of the torque acting on the binary\nand can considerably accelerate its orbital evolution compared to the\ngravitational wave-driven decay.

If DM does not obey\nLorentz invariance, it couples to this vector field. We find that this coupling\naffects the inertial mass of small DM halos which no longer satisfy the\nequivalence principle. For large enough lumps of DM we identify a (chameleon)\nmechanism that restores the inertial mass to its standard value. As a\nconsequence, the dynamics of gravitational clustering are modified. Two\nprominent effects are a scale dependent enhancement in the growth of large\nscale structure and a scale dependent bias between DM and baryon density\nperturbations.

In the realistic scenario, where the hot gas is\ncooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate is\nboosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with the Bondi prediction. The\ncause is the nonlinear growth of thermal instabilities, leading to the\ncondensation of cold clouds and filaments when t_cool/t_ff < 10. Subsonic\nturbulence of just over 100 km/s (M > 0.2) induces the formation of thermal\ninstabilities, even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regime\nturbulent dissipation inhibits their growth (t_turb/t_cool < 1). When heating\nrestores global thermodynamic balance, the formation of the multiphase medium\nis violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent\ncollisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpy\ntorus promote angular momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On\nsub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel. A good\napproximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which can be used as\nsubgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by\ncosmological simulations, while accounting for fluctuations. Chaotic cold\naccretion may be common in many systems, such as hot galactic halos, groups,\nand clusters, generating high-velocity clouds and strong variations of the AGN\nluminosity and jet orientation.

Phenomenologically, this means that the DR\nsmoothness parameter (denoted here by $\\alpha_E$) can be greater than unity,\nand, therefore, all previous analyses constraining it should be rediscussed\nwith a free upper limit.

An active nucleus is likely to be present also in the\nlarge majority of the X-ray sources spectroscopically classified as NELGs or\nALGs. Sources lie in high-galactic latitude (|b| > 20 deg) XMM-Newton fields\nmainly in the southern hemisphere.

However, the galaxy properties predicted from N-body simulations are\nnot necessarily representative of the observed galaxy populations; for example,\ntheoretical uncertainties arise from the absence of baryons in N-body\nsimulations. In this work, we assess how the uncertainties in N-body\nsimulations impact the cosmological parameters inferred from galaxy redshift\nsurveys. Applying the halo model framework, we find that the velocity bias of\ngalaxies in modeling the redshift-space distortions is likely to be the\npredominant source of systematic bias. For a deep, wide survey like BigBOSS,\ncurrent 10 per cent uncertainties in the velocity bias limit k_max to 0.14\nh/Mpc. In contrast, we find that the uncertainties related to the density\nprofiles and the galaxy occupation statistics lead to relatively insignificant\nsystematic biases.

This leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of B_dip ~6x 10^{12} G.\nThis measurement confirms SGR 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.\nFollowing the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst up\nto ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsible\nfor the X-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 keV. Simultaneously,\nthe X-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about\n1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 . Deep radio, millimeter, optical and\ngamma-ray observations did not detect the source counterpart, implying\nstringent limits on its multi-band emission, as well as constraints on the\npresence of a fossil disk. By modeling the magneto-thermal secular evolution of\nSGR 0418+5729, we infer a realistic age of ~550 kyr, and a dipolar magnetic\nfield at birth of ~10^{14} G.

Our analysis shows a tendency for\nthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(S100um >8 mJy)~4.3\nMpc and r0(S100um >5 mJy)~5.8 Mpc. These values convert into minimum halo\nmasses Mmin~10^{11.6} Msun for sources brighter than 8 mJy and Mmin~10^{12.4}\nMsun for S100um > 5 mJy galaxies. We show such an increase of the clustering\nstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are very\nstrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of the\ntotal counts at S100um > 2 mJy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. By\nremoving such a contribution, we find that z <~ 1 FIR galaxies have\napproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.\nThe above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence on\ncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies between\nz~0 and z~2.5.

Before using them as efficient tools in the early Universe,\nhowever, the environmental factors that govern the formation of GRBs need to be\nunderstood. Metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in\nGRB explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a decade of\nextensive studies, not fully understood. This is largely related to two\nphenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely\nhigh-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of\nefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including\nmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.\nThe subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we\nmeasure one of the largest host-integrated metallicities, ever, and the highest\nstellar mass for z<1.9.

The\nquasar hosts are very blue and almost absent on the red sequence, showing stark\ncontrast to the color-magnitude distribution of normal galaxies. The fact that\nmore powerful AGNs reside in galaxies with higher star-formation efficiency may\nindicate that negative AGN feedback, if it exists, is not concurrent with the\nmost luminous phase of AGNs. We also find positive correlation between the mass\nof supermassive black holes (SMBHs; Mbh) and host stellar mass, but the Mbh -\nMstar relation is offset toward large Mbh or small Mstar compared to the local\nrelation.

The dispersions have been therefore interpreted as\nextragalactic, leading to the inference that the sources of the bursts are at\nGpc distances. This then implies that the bursts are extremely energetic\nevents, originating from quite small volumes (due to the millisecond burst\ndurations). To circumvent the energetic difficulties, Loeb, Shvartzvald, & Maoz\n(2014) propose that the bursts are produced by flares near the surfaces of M\nstars or contact binaries within a local volume of the galaxy. Most of the\ndispersion would then occur in the overlying stellar coronae. With the\ndispersion concentrated in a relatively high density region, the quadratic\ndispersion approximation breaks down as the plasma frequency is comparable to\n(although less than) the propagation frequency. The observed dispersion curves\nare closely quadratic, however, consistent with a low density medium, ruling\nout this model. Because any model invoking local galactic sources would require\na concentrated high density dispersing medium, it appears highly likely that\nthe dispersions occur in the intergalactic medium.

The AM originates in co-planar\nstreams of cold gas and merging galaxies tracing cosmic-web filaments, and it\nundergoes four phases of evolution. (I) Outside the halo virial radius ($R_{\\rm\nv}\\!\\sim\\!100\\,{\\rm kpc}$), the elongated streams gain AM by tidal torques with\na specific AM (sAM) $\\sim\\!1.7$ times the dark-matter (DM) spin due to the gas'\nhigher quadrupole moment. This AM is expressed as stream impact parameters,\nfrom $\\sim\\!0.3R_{\\rm v}$ to counter rotation. (II) In the outer halo, while\nthe incoming DM mixes with the existing halo of lower sAM to a spin\n$\\lambda_{\\rm dm}\\!\\sim\\!0.04$, the cold streams transport the AM to the inner\nhalo such that their spin in the halo is $\\sim\\!3\\lambda_{\\rm dm}$. (III) Near\npericenter, the streams dissipate into an irregular rotating ring extending to\n$\\sim\\!0.3R_{\\rm v}$ and tilted relative to the inner disc. Torques exerted\npartly by the disc make the ring gas lose AM, spiral in, and settle into the\ndisc within one orbit. The ring is observable with 30\\% probability as a damped\nLyman-$\\alpha$ absorber. (IV) Within the disc, $<\\!0.1R_{\\rm v}$, torques\nassociated with violent disc instability drive AM out and baryons into a\ncentral bulge, while outflows remove low-spin gas, introducing certain\nsensitivity to feedback strength. Despite the different AM histories of gas and\nDM, the disc spin is comparable to the DM-halo spin. Counter rotation can\nstrongly affect disc evolution. \n\n"}

As such, GRBs provide a unique tool for\nstudying star forming galaxies out to high-z independent of luminosity. Most of\nour understanding of the properties of GRB hosts (GRBHs) comes from optical and\nnear-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations, and we therefore have relatively\nlittle knowledge of the fraction of dust-enshrouded star formation that resides\nwithin GRBHs. Currently ~20% of GRBs show evidence of significant amounts of\ndust along the line of sight to the afterglow through the host galaxy, and\nthese GRBs tend to reside within redder and more massive galaxies than GRBs\nwith optically bright afterglows. In this paper we present Herschel\nobservations of five GRBHs with evidence of being dust-rich, targeted to\nunderstand the dust attenuation properties within GRBs better.

Several theoretical models\nimplement AGN feedback to explain the observed galaxy luminosity function, and\npossibly the color and morphological transformation of spiral galaxies into\npassive ellipticals. To understand the importance of AGN feedback, a study of\nthe AGN populations in the radio-optical domain is crucial.

The study includes an\nanalytical treatment of the evolution of the envelop lost by the star within\nthe jet, and calculations of the related high-energy radiation.\n  The model readily explains the day-long, variable on timescales of hours, GeV\ngamma-ray flare from \\c454, observed during November 2010 on top of a\nweeks-long plateau. In the proposed scenario, the plateau state is caused by a\nstrong wind generated by the heating of the star atmosphere by nonthermal\nparticles accelerated at the jet-star interaction region. The flare itself\ncould be produced by a few clouds of matter lost by the red giant after the\ninitial impact of the jet.

We here present our analysis of six CEMP stars.\nCalcium and carbon are the only elements that can be measured in all six stars.\nThe range is -5.0<=[Ca/H]< -2.1 and 7.12<=A(C)<=8.65.

When the recombination time is long compared to the flow\ntime-scale the ionization front becomes thick and encompasses the entire flow,\nwith the mass-loss rate scaling linearly with flux. If the planet's potential\nis deep the flow is approximately \"energy-limited\"; however, if the planet's\npotential is shallow we identify a new limiting mass-loss regime, which we term\n\"photon-limited\".

Here\nwe propose that a potential outcome of this atmospheric evolution is the\nformation of helium-dominated atmospheres. The hydrodynamic escape rates of\nNeptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the\ndiffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily\naffected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere\nhas very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of\na hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission\nspectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon. With our\natmospheric evolution model, we find that if the mass of the initial atmosphere\nenvelope is 1E-3 planetary mass, hydrodynamic escape can reduce the hydrogen\nabundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude in ~10 billion\nyears. Observations of exoplanet transits may thus detect signatures of helium\natmospheres and probe the evolutionary history of small exoplanets. \n\n"}

Based on a set of detailed AGB models, we\nsuggest the abundance signature of HE 0414-0343 to have arisen from a >1.3 Msun\nmass AGB star and a late-time mass transfer, that transformed HE 0414-0343 into\na CEMP-sC star.

The underlying supersymmetric particle physics model\npossesses, for the chosen values of the parameters, practically two\ninflationary paths, the trivial and the semi-shifted one. The trivial path is\nstabilized by supergravity and supports a first stage of inflation with a\nlimited number of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio can become appreciable\nwith the scalar spectral index remaining acceptable, as a result of the\ncompetition between the relatively mild supergravity and the strong radiative\ncorrections to the inflationary potential. The additional number of e-foldings\nrequired for solving the puzzles of hot big bang cosmology are generated by a\nsecond stage of inflation along the semi-shifted path. This is possible only\nbecause the semi-shifted path is almost orthogonal to the trivial one and,\nthus, not affected by the strong radiative corrections on the trivial path and\nalso because the supergravity effects remain mild. The model predicts the\nformation of an unstable network of open cosmic strings connecting monopoles to\nantimonopoles. This network decays to gravity waves well before recombination\nleading to possibly detectable signatures in future space-based laser\ninterferometer gravitational-wave detectors. \n\n"}

These\nsimulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric\nthree-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and\nTriangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an\nazimuthally symmetric GHZ.\n  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a\nlarge number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the\ngalactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being\nhabitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams\nand satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet\nformation.\n  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different\nevolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving\nbiospheres.

Among the isolated\nellipticals ~ 20% are blue, 8% are star forming, and ~ 10% are recently\nquenched, while among the Coma ellipticals ~ 8% are blue and just <= 1% are\nstar forming or recently quenched. There are four isolated galaxies (~ 4.5%)\nthat are blue and star forming at the same time.

The sample of these LAEs is the largest,\nto date, and covers a very wide Lya luminosity range of $\\log L_{Ly\\alpha} =\n41.7-44.4$ erg s$^{-1}$.

Because all of the LAEs in the bright-end hump have (a) bright\ncounterpart(s) either in the X-ray, UV, or radio data, this bright-end hump is\nnot made by gravitational lensing magnification bias but AGNs.

In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF.

We combine the Planck CMB anisotropy\ndata in temperature with the low-multipole polarization data to fit LCDM models\nwith various parameterizations of the reionization history. We obtain a Thomson\noptical depth tau=0.058 +/- 0.012 for the commonly adopted instantaneous\nreionization model. This confirms, with only data from CMB anisotropies, the\nlow value suggested by combining Planck 2015 results with other data sets and\nalso reduces the uncertainties. We reconstruct the history of the ionization\nfraction using either a symmetric or an asymmetric model for the transition\nbetween the neutral and ionized phases. To determine better constraints on the\nduration of the reionization process, we also make use of measurements of the\namplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect using additional\ninformation from the high resolution Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole\nTelescope experiments. The average redshift at which reionization occurs is\nfound to lie between z=7.8 and 8.8, depending on the model of reionization\nadopted. Using kSZ constraints and a redshift-symmetric reionization model, we\nfind an upper limit to the width of the reionization period of Dz < 2.8. In all\ncases, we find that the Universe is ionized at less than the 10% level at\nredshifts above z~10. This suggests that an early onset of reionization is\nstrongly disfavoured by the Planck data. We show that this result also reduces\nthe tension between CMB-based analyses and constraints from other astrophysical\nsources. \n\n"}

In fact, they are in this sense the most heavily\ndark matter dominated objects known. That, plus the increasingly small sizes of\nthe newly discovered ultra faint dwarfs, puts these systems in the regime where\ndynamical friction on individual stars starts to become relevant. We calculate\nthe dynamical friction timescales for pressure supported isotropic spherical\ndark matter dominated stellar systems, yielding $\\tau_{DF} =0.93 (r_{h}/10\npc)^{2} (\\sigma/ kms^{-1}) Gyr$, { where $r_{h}$ is the half-light radius}. For\na stellar velocity dispersion value of $3 km/s$, as typical for the smallest of\nthe recently detected ultra faint dwarf spheroidals, dynamical friction\ntimescales becomes smaller than the $10 Gyr$ typical of the stellar ages for\nthese systems, for $r_{h}<19 pc$. Thus, this becomes a theoretical lower limit\nbelow which dark matter dominated stellar systems become unstable to dynamical\nfriction. We present a comparison with structural parameters of the smallest\nultra faint dwarf spheroidals known, showing that these are already close to\nthe stability limit derived, any future detection of yet smaller such systems\nwould be inconsistent with a particle dark matter hypothesis. \n\n"}

Many HB stars continue to oscillate\nafter periastron and along the entire orbit, indicative of the tidal excitation\nof oscillation modes within one or both stars. These systems are among the most\neccentric binaries known, and they constitute astrophysical laboratories for\nthe study of tidal effects. We have undertaken a radial velocity (RV)\nmonitoring campaign of Kepler HB stars in order to measure their orbits. We\npresent our first results here, including a sample of 21 Kepler HB systems,\nwhere for 19 of them we obtained the Keplerian orbit and for 3 other systems we\ndid not detect a statistically significant RV variability.

However, by $z\\sim 0.5$,\nirregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\\odot$.

Also, quenching implies the\npresence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all\nredshifts over 2~dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism\nevolves. At $z>2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by\ncompact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces\na compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts\nare significantly more dense. At $1<z<2$, the majority of newly quenched\ngalaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that\nmass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the\ndisk.

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) have recently re-emerged as attractive candidates for\nmediating feedback in galaxies because of their long cooling timescales. They\ncan have energy densities comparable to the thermal gas, but do not suffer\ncatastrophic cooling losses. Recent simulations have shown that the momentum\nand energy deposited by CRs moving with respect to the ambient medium can drive\ngalactic winds. However, simulations are hampered by our ignorance of the\ndetails of CR transport. Two key limits previously considered model CR\ntransport as a purely diffusive process (with a constant diffusion coefficient)\nand as an advective streaming process. With a series of GADGET simulations, we\ncompare and contrast the results of these different assumptions. In idealised\nthree-dimensional galaxy formation models, we show that these two cases result\nin significant differences for the galactic wind mass loss rates and star\nformation suppression in dwarf galaxies with halo masses\n$M\\approx10^{10}\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$: diffusive CR transport results in more\nthan ten times larger mass loss rates compared to CR streaming models. We\ndemonstrate that this is largely due to the excitation of Alfv\\'en waves during\nthe CR streaming process that drains energy from the CR population to the\nthermal gas, which is subsequently radiated away. By contrast, CR diffusion\nconserves the CR energy in the absence of adiabatic changes and if CRs are\nefficiently scattered by Alfv\\'en waves that are propagating up the CR\ngradient. Moreover, because pressure gradients are preserved by CR streaming,\nbut not diffusion, the two can have a significantly different dynamical\nevolution regardless of this energy exchange. In particular, the constant\ndiffusion coefficients usually assumed can lead to unphysically high CR fluxes. \n\n"}

In two cases, a\nsimple point-source, point-lens microlensing model provides an excellent match\nto the long-term variability seen in these objects. For both models, the\nparameter constraints are consistent with the microlensing being due to an\nintervening stellar mass object but as yet there is no confirmation of the\npresence of an intervening galaxy.

Since the\nR index varies slightly with the Teff for values larger than 40 kK, the R index\ncan be used to derive the Teff in 30-40 kK range. A large fraction of the\nionization parameter variation is due to differences in the temperature of the\nionizing stars and then the use of the (relatively) low Teff dependent S2=[S\nII](6717+31)/Ha emission-line ratio to derive the ionization parameter is\npreferable over others in the literature. We propose linear metallicity\ndependent relationships between S2 and U. Teff and metallicity estimations for\na sample of 865 HII regions, whose emission-line intensities were compiled from\nthe literature, do not show any Teff-Z correlation. On the other hand it seems\nto be hints of the presence of an anti-correlation between Teff-U.

The state of the\nart method resolves spatial structures within a galaxy to assess the total\nstellar mass content. In comparison to unresolved studies, resolved methods\nyield, on average, higher fractions of stellar mass for galaxies. In this work\nwe improve the current method in order to mitigate a bias related to the\nresolved spatial distribution derived for the mass. The bias consists in an\napparent filamentary mass distribution, and a spatial coincidence between mass\nstructures and dust lanes near spiral arms. The improved method is based on\niterative Bayesian marginalization, through a new algorithm we have named\nBayesian Successive Priors (BSP).

Studies on optimising interstellar and intergalactic\ntrajectories are usually performed in flat spacetime using an analytical\napproach, with very little focus on optimising interstellar trajectories in a\ngeneral relativistic framework. This paper examines the use of low-acceleration\nrockets to reach galactic destinations in the least possible time, with a\ngenetic algorithm being employed for the optimisation process. The fuel\nrequired for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion\nsystems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the\nMilky Way. The results showed that to limit the amount of fuel carried on\nboard, an antimatter propulsion system would likely be the minimum\ntechnological requirement to reach star systems tens of thousands of light\nyears away. However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several\nhundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time\ndilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel. So for\nnow, it appears that humanity's ultimate goal of a galactic empire may only be\npossible at significantly higher accelerations, though the propulsion\ntechnology requirement for a journey that uses realistic amounts of fuel\nremains to be determined. \n\n"}

We measure the quenched fraction of neighbor\ngalaxies around isolated primary galaxies, dividing the isolated sample into\nstar-forming and quiescent objects. We restrict our measurements to scales $>1$\nMpc to probe the correlations between the formation histories of distinct\nhalos. Over the stellar mass range $10^{9.7} \\le M_\\ast/M_\\odot \\le 10^{10.9}$,\nwe find minimal statistical evidence for conformity. We further compare these\ndata to predictions of the halo age-matching model, in which the oldest\ngalaxies are associated with the oldest halos at fixed $M_\\ast$. For models\nwith strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity signal is\ntoo large to be consistent with the data. For weaker implementations of\nage-matching, galactic conformity is not a sensitive diagnostic of halo\nassembly bias, and would not produce a detectable signal in SDSS data. We\nreproduce the results of Kauffmann et al 2013, in which the star formation\nrates of neighbor galaxies are significantly reduced around primary galaxies\nwhen the primaries are themselves low star formers. However, we find this\nresult is mainly driven by contamination in the isolation criterion, when using\nour group catalog to remove the small fraction of satellite galaxies in the\nsample, the conformity signal largely goes away. Lastly, we show that small\nconformity signals, i.e., 2-5% differences in the quenched fractions of\nneighbor galaxies, can be produced by mechanisms other than halo assembly bias.\nFor example, if passive galaxies occupy more massive halos than star forming\ngalaxies of the same stellar mass, a conformity signal that is consistent with\nrecent measurements from PRIMUS (Berti et al 2016) can be produced. \n\n"}

The integrated CO 6-5 intensity is\naligned with the previously discovered jet/outflow of NGC1377 and is tracing\nthe dense (n>1e4 cm-3), hot gas at the base of the outflow. The velocity\nstructure is complex and shifts across the jet/outflow are discussed in terms\nof jet-rotation or separate, overlapping kinematical components. High velocity\ngas (deltaV +-145 km/s) is detected inside r<2-3 pc and we suggest that it is\nemerging from an inclined rotating disk or torus of position angle PA=140+-20\ndeg with a dynamical mass of approx 3e6 Msun. This mass is consistent with that\nof a supermassive black hole (SMBH), as inferred from the M-sigma relation. The\ngas mass of the proposed disk/torus constitutes <3% of the nuclear dynamical\nmass. In contrast to the intense CO 6-5 line emission, we do not detect dust\ncontinuum with an upper limit of S(690GHz)<2mJy.

The\nmultiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust\nclouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid.

The observations reveal what appears to be 'bluing' during\ntransits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour\ndifference of up to ~-0.05 mag.

A comparison of simulated polarization\n  with Planck observations Abstract: The efforts for comparing dust polarization measurements with synthetic\nobservations from MHD models have previously concentrated on the scale of\nmolecular clouds. Here we extend the model comparisons to kiloparsec scales,\ntaking into account hot shocked gas generated by supernovae, and a non-uniform\ndynamo-generated magnetic field at both large and small scales down to 4 pc\nspatial resolution. Radiative transfer calculations are used to model dust\nemission and polarization on the top of MHD simulations. We compute synthetic\nmaps of column density $N_H$, polarization fraction $p$, and polarization angle\ndispersion $S$, and study their dependencies on the important properties of the\nMHD simulations. These include the large-scale magnetic field and its\norientation, the small-scale magnetic field, and supernova-driven shocks.\nSimilar filament-like structures of $S$ as seen in the Planck all-sky maps are\nvisible in our synthetic results, although the smallest scale structures are\nabsent from our maps. Supernova-driven shock fronts and $S$ do not show\nsignificant correlation. Instead, $S$ can clearly be attributed to the\ndistribution of the small-scale magnetic field. We also find that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field influences the polarization properties, such that,\nfor a given strength of magnetic fluctuation, a strong plane-of-the-sky mean\nfield weakens the observed $S$, while strengthening $p$. The anticorrelation of\n$p$ and $S$, and decreasing $p$ as a function of $N_H$ are consistent across\nall synthetic observations.

This is the second in a series of papers\npresenting the results of the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity\nQuasars (SHELLQs) project, which exploits the deep multi-band imaging data\nproduced by the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program survey. The\nphotometric candidates were selected by a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm, and\nthen observed with spectrographs on the Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Subaru\nTelescope. Combined with the sample presented in the previous paper, we have\nnow identified 64 HSC sources over about 430 deg2, which include 33 high-z\nquasars, 14 high-z luminous galaxies, 2 [O III] emitters at z ~ 0.8, and 15\nGalactic brown dwarfs. The new quasars have considerably lower luminosity\n(M1450 ~ -25 to -22 mag) than most of the previously known high-z quasars.\nSeveral of these quasars have luminous (> 10^(43) erg/s) and narrow (< 500\nkm/s) Ly alpha lines, and also a possible mini broad absorption line system of\nN V 1240 in the composite spectrum, which clearly separate them from typical\nquasars. On the other hand, the high-z galaxies have extremely high luminosity\n(M1450 ~ -24 to -22 mag) compared to other galaxies found at similar redshift.\nWith the discovery of these new classes of objects, we are opening up new\nparameter spaces in the high-z Universe.

In this paper, we\ndescribe and compare the codes used to compute photometric redshifts for\nHSC-SSP, how we calibrate them, and the typical accuracy we achieve with the\nHSC five-band photometry (grizy). We introduce a new point estimator based on\nan improved loss function and demonstrate that it works better than other\ncommonly used estimators. We find that our photo-z's are most accurate at\n0.2<~zphot<~1.5, where we can straddle the 4000A break. We achieve\nsigma(d_zphot/(1+zphot))~0.05 and an outlier rate of about 15% for galaxies\ndown to i=25 within this redshift range. If we limit to a brighter sample of\ni<24, we achieve sigma~0.04 and ~8% outliers. Our photo-z's should thus enable\nmany science cases for HSC-SSP.

For instance, the\npresence of a classical bulge suggests a relatively violent history, in\ncontrast, the presence of simply an inner disc (also referred to as a\n\"pseudobulge\") indicates the occurrence of secular evolution processes in the\nmain disc. However, we still lack criteria to effectively categorise bulges,\nlimiting our ability to study their impact on the evolution of the host\ngalaxies. Here we present a recipe to separate inner discs from classical\nbulges by combining four different parameters from photometric and kinematic\nanalyses: The bulge S\\'ersic index $n_\\mathrm{b}$, the concentration index\n$C_{20,50}$, the Kormendy (1977) relation and the inner slope of the radial\nvelocity dispersion profile $\\nabla\\sigma$. With that recipe we provide a\ndetailed bulge classification for a sample of 45 galaxies from the\nintegral-field spectroscopic survey CALIFA. To aid in categorising bulges\nwithin these galaxies, we perform 2D image decomposition to determine bulge\nS\\'ersic index, bulge-to-total light ratio, surface brightness and effective\nradius of the bulge and use growth curve analysis to derive a new concentration\nindex, $C_{20,50}$. We further extract the stellar kinematics from CALIFA data\ncubes and analyse the radial velocity dispersion profile. The results of the\ndifferent approaches are in good agreement and allow a safe classification for\napproximately $95\\%$ of the galaxies. In particular, we show that our new\n\"inner\" concentration index performs considerably better than the traditionally\nused $C_{50,90}$ when yielding the nature of bulges. We also found that a\ncombined use of this index and the Kormendy (1977) relation gives a very robust\nindication of the physical nature of the bulge. \n\n"}

A key question that will help to differentiate\nbetween models is whether UDGs have counterparts in lower-mass host haloes, and\nwhat their abundance as a function of halo mass is. In this study we extend our\nprevious study of UDGs in galaxy clusters to galaxy groups.

We are able to measure a significant overdensity\nof UDGs (with sizes r_eff > 1.5 kpc) in galaxy groups down to M200=10^12 Msun,\na regime where approximately only 1 in 10 groups contains a UDG that we can\ndetect.

Some of these gradients resemble those in the\nMilky Way, where they have sometimes been interpreted as due to internal\nevolution, such as scattering off giant molecular clouds, radial migration\ndriven by spiral patterns, or orbital reso- nances with a bar. Secular\nprocesses play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks strong spiral\nor bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual\nenrichment of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into\nstars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by\nthe feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment, and\nequilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous\ndisc and its descendent stars. The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little\nafter birth and provide a faithful snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at\nthe time of their formation. In this interpretation, the age-velocity\ndispersion relation would reflect the gradual thinning of the disc rather than\nthe importance of secular orbit scattering; the outward flaring of stars would\nresult from the gas disc flare rather than from radial migration; and vertical\ngradients would arise because the gas disc gradually thinned as it enriched.\nSuch radial and vertical trends might just reflect the evolving properties of\nthe parent gaseous disc, and are not necessarily the result of secular\nevolutionary processes. \n\n"}

Galaxy clusters assemble late, doubling their\nmasses since z~0.5, and so the outer regions of clusters should be replete with\ninfalling group-mass systems. We present an XMM-Newton survey to search for\nX-ray groups in the infall regions of 23 massive galaxy clusters at z~0.2,\nidentifying 39 X-ray groups that have been spectroscopically confirmed to lie\nat the cluster redshift. These groups have mass estimates in the range\n2x10^13-7x10^14Msun, and group-to-cluster mass ratios as low as 0.02. The\ncomoving number density of X-ray groups in the infall regions is ~25x higher\nthan that seen for isolated X-ray groups from the XXL survey. The average mass\nper cluster contained within these X-ray groups is 2.2x10^14Msun, or 19% of the\nmass within the primary cluster itself. We estimate that ~10^15Msun clusters\nincrease their masses by 16% between z=0.223 and the present day due to the\naccretion of groups with M200>10^13.2Msun.

Here, we examine the effects of wave heating in\nstars containing little or no hydrogen, i.e., progenitors of type IIb/Ib SNe.\nBecause there is no massive hydrogen envelope, wave energy is thermalized near\nthe stellar surface where the overlying atmospheric mass is small but the\noptical depth is large. Wave energy can thus unbind this material, driving an\noptically thick, super-Eddington wind. Using 1D hydodynamic MESA simulations of\n$\\sim \\! 5 \\, M_\\odot$ He stars, we find that wave heating can drive pre-SN\noutbursts composed of a dense wind whose mass loss rate can exceed $\\sim \\! 0.1\n\\, M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$.

Einstein\nsuggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses,\nwhich drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting\nstructures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the\nreasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By\nreconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests\nthat both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The\nmodel is a modified $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that\ncontinuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and\ncan flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic\nuniverse with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing\ncompatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological\nmeasurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative\nmass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms\nhaloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are\nnot cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the\nobserved distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles.

The region in the\nimmediate vicinity of N6946-BH1 exhibits the youngest and most vigorous star\nformation for several hundred pc. This suggests that the progenitor is not a\nrunaway star.

Since the most efficient wavefront correction\nalgorithms (controllers and estimators) are usually model-based, the modeling\naccuracy of the system influences the ultimate wavefront correction\nperformance. Currently, wavefront correction systems are typically approximated\nas linear systems using Fourier optics. However, the Fourier optics model is\nusually biased due to inaccuracies in the layout measurements, the imperfect\ndiagnoses of inherent optical aberrations, and a lack of knowledge of the\ndeformable mirrors (actuator gains and influence functions). Moreover, the\ntelescope optical system varies over time because of instrument instabilities\nand environmental effects. In this paper, we present an\nexpectation-maximization (E-M) approach for identifying and real-time adapting\nthe linear telescope model from data. By iterating between the E-step (a Kalman\nfilter and a Rauch smoother) and the M-step (analytical or gradient-based\noptimization), the algorithm is able to recover the system even if the model\ndepends on the electric fields, which are unmeasurable hidden variables.\nSimulations and experiments in Princeton's High Contrast Imaging Lab\ndemonstrate that this algorithm improves the model accuracy and increases the\nefficiency and speed of the wavefront correction. \n\n"}

Abstract: We performed sensitive observations of the N15ND+(1-0) and 15NND+(1-0) lines\ntoward the prestellar core L1544 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The lines are\nnot detected down to 3 sigma levels in 0.2 km/s channels of around 6 mK. The\nnon-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+ of\n~700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local\nISM of ~200-300. The result indicates that N2 is depleted in 15N in the central\npart of L1544, because N2D+ preferentially traces the cold dense gas, and\nbecause it is a daughter molecule of N2. In-situ chemistry is unlikely\nresponsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase\nchemistry nor isotope selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N\ndepletion; the former prefers transferring 15N to N2, while the latter requires\nthe penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center.

The outburst timescales\nconstrain $\\alpha$, the ratio of the viscous stress to the thermal pressure,\nand so the mechanism of angular momentum transport. The eruptive state has\n$\\alpha\\approx0.1$ while the quiescent state has $\\alpha\\approx0.03$. Turbulent\ntransport due to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is generally\nconsidered to be the source of angular momentum transport in DNe. Here, we\nperform 3D local magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shearing box simulations including\nvertical stratification, radiative transfer and a net constant vertical\nmagnetic flux to investigate how transport changes between the outburst and\nquiescent states of DNe. We find that a constant $B_z$ provides a higher\n$\\alpha$ in quiescence than in outburst, in opposition to what is expected.\nIncluding resistivity quenches MRI turbulence in quiescence, suppressing\ntransport, unless the magnetic field is high enough, which again leads to\n$\\alpha\\approx0.1$. A major difference between simulations with a net poloidal\nflux and simulations without is that angular momentum transport in the former\nis shared between turbulent and wind-driven transport. We find that wind-driven\ntransport dominates in quiescence even for low magnetic fields $\\sim 1$ G. This\ncan have a major impact on observational signatures since wind-driven transport\ndoes not heat the disk. Furthermore, wind transport cannot be reduced to an\n$\\alpha$ prescription. We provide fits for $\\alpha$ and the wind torque with\n$\\beta$, ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure. We conclude that the evolution\nof the thermal-viscous instability, and its consequences on the outburst cycles\nof CVs, needs to be seriously revised to take into account that most of the\naccretion energy may be carried away by a wind instead of being locally\ndissipated. \n\n"}

This technique is of particular utility for\ndetecting signals in power spectra with frequency-dependent noise backgrounds,\nas it is only sensitive to features that are sharp relative to the inspected\nfrequency bin width. We develop a CV-based algorithm to quickly detect the\npresence of solar-like oscillations in photometric power spectra that are\ndominated by stellar granulation.

This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.

We investigate how the initial standard deviation of the\nlog-normal density field influences the dynamics of quasi-isothermal clouds\nembedded in supersonic winds. We compare uniform, fractal solenoidal, and\nfractal compressive cloud models in both 3D and 2D hydrodynamical simulations.\nWe find that the processes of cloud disruption and dense gas entrainment are\nfunctions of the initial density distribution in the cloud. Fractal clouds\naccelerate, mix, and are disrupted earlier than uniform clouds. Within the\nfractal cloud sample, compressive clouds retain high-density nuclei, so they\nare more confined, less accelerated, and have lower velocity dispersions than\ntheir solenoidal counterparts. Compressive clouds are also less prone to\nKelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, so they survive longer than\nsolenoidal clouds. By comparing the cloud properties at the destruction time,\nwe find that dense gas entrainment is more effective in uniform clouds than in\neither of the fractal clouds, and it is more effective in solenoidal than in\ncompressive models. In contrast, mass loading into the wind is more efficient\nin compressive cloud models than in uniform or solenoidal models.

The latter is always smaller than the former, which is dominated by\nnearby bright rich clusters. In practice however, those bright clusters are\neasy to indentify and can thus be subtracted from the map. After this\nsubtraction, the correlation term dominates degree-scale fluctuations over the\nPoisson term, as the main contribution to the correlation term comes from\ndistant clusters. We find that the correlation term is detectable by Planck\nexperiment. Since the degree scale spectrum is quite insensitive to the highly\nuncertain core structures of halos, our predictions are robust on these scales.\nMeasuring the correlation term on degree scales thus cleanly probes the\nclustering of distant halos.

The radio radiation is due to synchrotron by relativistic\nelectrons, and the inverse Compton (IC) scattering by the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation of the same electrons is the most natural source for the\nHXR and perhaps the EUV emissions. However, simple estimates give a weaker\nmagnetic field than that suggested by Faraday rotation measurements.\nConsequently, non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) and TB have also been suggested\nas sources of these emissions. We show that NTB cannot be the source of the\nHXRs and that the difficulty with the low magnetic field in the IC model is\nalleviated if we take into account the effects of observational bias,\nnonisotropic pitch angle distribution and spectral breaks.

Abstract: The spectral energy distributions of galactic black holes in the low/hard\nstate and of low-luminosity AGN possess many common features, the most\nprominent being: compact, flat (or inverted) spectrum radio cores with high\nbrightness temperatures; excess red and infrared emission, often correlated\nwith the radio flux; an extremely weak (or absent) quasi-thermal hump and a\nhard X-ray power-law with high energy cut-off. These sources are thought to be\naccreting at low rates and advection (or convection) dominated accretion flows\nare usually considered the best candidates to explain them. Here we present an\nalternative possibility, involving strong, unbound, magnetic coronae generated\nby geometrically thin, optically thick accretion discs at low accretion rates.\nFirst we show that, if angular momentum transport in the disc is due to\nmagnetic turbulent stresses, the magnetic energy density and effective viscous\nstresses inside the disc are proportional to the geometric mean of the total\n(gas plus radiation) and gas pressure. Therefore the corona is less powerful in\na radiation pressure dominated disc, and the relative fraction of the power\nliberated in the corona increases as the accretion rate decreases. Furthermore,\nwe discuss reasons why energetically dominant coronae are ideal sites for\nlaunching powerful jets/outflows, both MHD and thermally driven. In analysing\nthe spectral properties of such coronal outflow dominated accretion discs, we\nreach the important conclusion that if the jet/outflow is, as is likely,\nradiatively inefficient, then so is the source overall, even without advection\nof energy into the black hole being relevant for the dynamics of the accretion\nflow. \n\n"}

Implemented using SPH, our scheme is a significantly modified and\nextended version of the grid-based method of Yepes et al.

We\ndiscuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it predicts a\nself-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in particular,\nstabilises the star forming gaseous layers of disk galaxies. The\nparameterisation of this mode can be reduced to a single free quantity which\ndetermines the overall timescale for star formation. We fix this parameter to\nmatch the observed rates of star formation in local disk galaxies. When\nnormalised in this manner, cosmological simulations nevertheless overproduce\nthe observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated to\nextend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with star\nformation.

Even this low level of turbulence is sufficient to\nproduce multiple star formation in 80% of the cores; the mean number of stars\nand brown dwarfs formed from a single core is 4.55, and the maximum is 10.

The spinning fragment has a deformed shape and looks like an oblate\nellipsoid. Due to the virtual non-compressibility of nuclear matter, and the\npolarization of the spin in the plane transverse to the input momentum of the\nprojectile nucleus such an ellipsoid has a reduced mean interaction\ncross-section compared with a non-spinning fragment which has a spherical\nshape. Purely geometrical arguments dictate that such an ellipsoidal nucleus\nshould have additional fluctuations of cross-section even at a fixed impact\nparameter dependent on the orientation angle between the axis of the ellipsoid\nand the vector connecting the centers of projectile and target nucleus. The\nnumber of 'wounded nucleons' in the projectile nucleus participating in the\ninteraction correlates strongly with the interaction cross-section.

This area of the disk is likely radiation pressure dominated and subject\nto various dynamical instabilities. Here, we show that density inhomogeneities\nin the disk atmosphere resulting from the photon bubble instability (PBI) can\ncause rapid changes in the X-ray reflection features, even when the\nilluminating flux is constant. Using a simulation of the development of the\nPBI, we find that, for the disk parameters chosen, the Fe K and O VIII Ly\\alpha\nlines vary on timescales as short as a few hundredths of an orbital time. In\nresponse to the changes in accretion disk structure, the Fe K equivalent width\n(EW) shows variations as large as ~100 eV.

Initial Conditions Abstract: The relation between the results of cosmological N-body simulations, and the\ncontinuum theoretical models they simulate, is currently not understood in a\nway which allows a quantification of N dependent effects. In this first of a\nseries of papers on this issue, we consider the quantification of such effects\nin the initial conditions of such simulations. A general formalism developed in\n[1] allows us to write down an exact expression for the power spectrum of the\npoint distributions generated by the standard algorithm for generating such\ninitial conditions. Expanded perturbatively in the amplitude of the input (i.e.\ntheoretical, continuum) power spectrum, we obtain at linear order the input\npower spectrum, plus two terms which arise from discreteness and contribute at\nlarge wavenumbers. For cosmological type power spectra, one obtains as\nexpected, the input spectrum for wavenumbers k smaller than that characteristic\nof the discreteness. The comparison of real space correlation properties is\nmore subtle because the discreteness corrections are not as strongly localised\nin real space. For cosmological type spectra the theoretical mass variance in\nspheres and two point correlation function are well approximated {\\it above} a\nfinite distance.

The most promising way of probing it\nis through polarization measurements of the synchrotron emission from the GRB\nejecta, which includes the gamma-ray emission and the reverse shock emission.\nMeasuring polarization in gamma-rays with current instruments is extremely\ndifficult: so far there is only one claim of detection (in GRB 021206) which\ndespite the favorable conditions remains very controversial. The emission from\nthe reverse shock that propagates into the ejecta as it is decelerated by the\nambient medium peaks in the optical after tens of seconds (the `optical flash')\nand dominates the optical emission up to about ten minutes after the GRB.\nUnfortunately, no polarization measurements of this optical emission have been\nmade to date. However, after the reverse shock finishes crossing the shell of\nGRB ejecta, the shocked ejecta cools adiabatically and radiates at lower and\nlower frequencies, peaking in the radio after $\\sim 1$ day (the `radio flare').\nWe use VLA data of radio flares from GRBs to constrain the polarization of this\nemission.

Observed I-band luminosities are converted to stellar masses using\nthe IMF-dependent relation between stellar mass-to-light ratio, M/L, and color.\nThe model treats halo concentration, spin parameter, and disc mass fraction as\nindependent log-normal random variables. Our main conclusion is that the VL and\nRL zero-points and the uncorrelated residuals can only be reproduced\nsimultaneously if adiabatic contraction is avoided. One or the other could be\nfixed by appealing to unrealistic values for M/L, halo concentration c, and\nspin parameter lambda, but not all together. The small VL scatter is naturally\ndetermined by the predicted scatter in c and in M/L, quite independent of the\nlarge scatter in lambda. However, the RL scatter, driven by the scatter in\nlambda, can be as low as observed only if sigma_lambda simeq 0.25, about half\nthe value predicted for CDM haloes. This may indicate that discs form in a\nspecial subset of haloes.

It has generally been thought that the\nhard X-rays result from Compton upscattering of thermal accretion disk photons\nby a hot, coronal plasma whose properties are inferred via spectral fitting.\nInterestingly, these properties-especially those from certain magnetized corona\nmodels-are very similar to the derived plasma conditions at the jet footpoints.\nHere we explore the question of whether the `corona' and `jet base' are in fact\nrelated, starting by testing the strongest premise that they are synonymous. In\nsuch models, the radio through the soft X-rays are dominated by synchrotron\nemission, while the hard X-rays are dominated by inverse Compton at the jet\nbase - with both disk and synchrotron photons acting as seed photons.

The models reproduce the rotation curves of\nboth galaxies, the disk surface brightness profiles as well as the profile of\nisophotal ellipticity and position angle. The models are centrally dominated by\nbaryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. The simulated\ndisk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio in\nagreement with the observed colors. We show that non-circular motions combined\nwith gas pressure support and projection effects results in a large\nunderestimation of the circular velocity in the central $\\sim 1$ kpc region,\ncreating the illusion of a constant density core.

Before its dissipation and\nsubsequent conversion into coronal photon power, the randomized gravitational\nbinding energy responsible for powering ULX phenomena must separate from the\nmass of its origin by a means other than, and quicker than, electron\nscattering-mediated radiative diffusion.

We find that once the surface\ndensity of the disc exceeds a critical value, the disc fragments into dense\nclumps. The clumps accrete material from the remaining disc and merge into\nlarger clumps; the upper mass of a merged clump is a few tens to a few hundreds\nof solar mass. This picture fits well with the observed young stellar discs\nnear the SgrA* black hole in the Galactic Center. In particular, we show how\nthe masses and spatial distribution of the young stars, and the total mass in\nthe Galactic Center discs can be explained. However, explaining the origin of\nthe several young stars closest to the black hole (the S-stars) is more\nproblematic: their orbits are compact, eccentric, and have random orientation.\nWe propose that the S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then\nmigrated through their parent disc via type I or runaway migration. Their\norbits were then randomized by the Rauch-Tremaine resonant relaxation. We then\nexplore the consequences of the star-formation scenario for AGN discs, which\nare continuously resupplied with gas.

Since HS1700+6416 is slightly less redshifted\n(z=2.72) than HE2347-4342, we only probe the post-reionization phase of HeII,\nseen in the evolution of the HeII opacity, which is consistent with a simple\npower law. The HeII/HI ratio eta is estimated using a line profile-fitting\nprocedure and an apparent optical depth approach, respectively. The expected\nmetal line absorption in the far-UV is taken into account as well as molecular\nabsorption of galactic H_2. About 27% of the eta values are affected by metal\nline absorption. In order to investigate the applicability of the analysis\nmethods, we create simple artificial spectra based on the statistical\nproperties of the HI Ly alpha forest. The analysis of the artificial data\ndemonstrates that the apparent optical depth method as well as the line\nprofile-fitting procedure lead to confident results for restricted data samples\nonly (12.0 < log N(HI) < 13.0). The reasons are saturation in the case of the\napparent optical depth and thermal line widths in the case of the profile fits.\nFurthermore, applying the methods to the unrestricted data set may mimic a\ncorrelation between eta and the strength of the HI absorption. For the\nrestricted data samples a scatter of 10 - 15% in eta would be expected even if\nthe underlying value is constant.

We find that the initially laminar equilibrium flow spontaneously\ndevelops into turbulence in our unstratified local model. Marginally coupled\nsolids (that couple to the gas on a Keplerian time-scale) trigger an upward\ncascade to large particle clumps with peak overdensities above 100.

We show that relative beaming (prompt vs. afterglow) may\nbe constrained by analysis of the \"fast transient\" x-ray sources catalogued by\nPye and McHardy (1983) from the Ariel V survey as well as several other (e.g.\nHEAO-A1/A2) surveys. After removing contamination from likely stellar\ntransients, and scaling from x-ray/$\\gamma$-ray fluence ratios recently derived\nfrom Ginga and BeppoSAX, approximately half of the sources were possible prompt\nemission or afterglows from GRBs with gamma-ray fluence of >~1.2 X 10$^{-5}\n/erg-cm^2. Since the rate of these candidate afterglow events, 0.15 /day, is\nconsistent with the BATSE logN-logS distribution, no difference in prompt vs.\nafterglow beaming is required.

We are specifically interested in\ninvestigating whether a high pressure IGM, such as that in clusters of\ngalaxies, can prevent the gas from escaping from the galaxy. The interface\nbetween the outflow and ambient IGM is demarcated by a dense expanding shell\nformed by the gas swept-up by the outflow. A sufficiently high IGM pressure can\nbring the shell to a halt well before it escapes the galaxy. Galaxies in such\nhigh pressure environments are, however, to be ploughing through the IGM at\nrelatively high velocities. Hence, they will also be subject to ram pressure,\nwhich acts to strip the gas from the galaxy. We have carried out simulations\nthat take into account the combined impact of ram pressure and thermal\npressure. We find that ram pressure deforms the shell into a tail-like\nstructure, fragments it into dense clouds and eventually drags the clouds away\nfrom the galaxy.
