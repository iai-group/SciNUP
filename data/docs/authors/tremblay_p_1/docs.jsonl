We now consider\nmoderately supersonic cloud collisions (precollision cloud velocities of order\n1.2 km s$^{-1}$ to 2.4 km s$^{-1}$).\n  In the current paper, we present five SPH simulations of fast head-on and/or\noff-centre cloud collisions to study the evolution of ram pressure confined gas\nslabs. The relevant thermodynamics in the problem is simplified by adopting a\nsimple barytropic equation of state. We explore the parameter space by varying\nthe pre-collision velocity and the temperature of the post collision gas slab.\n  The temperature in a pressure compressed gas slab is crucial to its dynamical\nevolution. The pressure confined gas slabs become Jeans unstable if the average\nsound crossing time, $t_{cr}$, of putative clumps condensing out of them, is\nmuch larger than their free fall time, $t_{ff}$.

These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

In general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planets\none can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axes\nvia the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

It is found that after a brief initial stage of flux\nemergence during which the two polarities of the bipolar region become\nseparated and the tubes intersecting the photosphere become vertical,\nsignificant rotational motion sets in within each polarity. The rotational\nmotions of the two polarities are found to twist up the inner field lines of\nthe emerged fields such that they change their orientation into an inverse\nconfiguration (i.e. pointing from the negative polarity to the positive\npolarity over the neutral line). As a result, a flux rope with sigmoid-shaped,\ndipped core fields form in the corona, and the center of the flux rope rises in\nthe corona with increasing velocity as the twisting of the flux rope footpoints\ncontinues.

We\ninvestigate the 5-35 um Spitzer IRS spectra of a sample of 13 group I sources\nand 20 group II sources. We focus on the continuum emission to study the\nunderlying disk geometry. We have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7]\ncontinuum flux ratios. The 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellar\nphotosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-IR emission\nproduced by the inner disk. We have compared our data to self-consistent\npassive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We\nconfirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between\ngroup I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small\ndust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and\n[13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources. Moreover, the [30/13.5] flux\nratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample. To\nexplain these correlations with the models, we need to introduce an artificial\nscaling factor for the inner disk height. In roughly 50% of the Herbig Ae/Be\nstars in our sample, the inner disk must be inflated by a factor 2 to 3 beyond\nwhat hydrostatic calculations predict. The total disk mass in small dust grains\ndetermines the degree of flaring. We conclude, however, that for any given disk\nmass in small dust grains, the shadowing of the outer (tens of AU) disk is\ndetermined by the scale height of the inner disk (1 AU).

Planet\nformation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal\nmechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model. [abridged] We finally develop\nan analytical framework to study the effects of metallicity dependent\nphotoevaporation on the formation of gas giants in the core accretion scenario.\nWe show that accounting for this effect strengthens the conclusion that planet\nformation is favoured at higher metallicity.

In the present paper, we estimate the relative role of the\ndifferent terms which appear in the modified stellar structure equations. We\nnote that the Lorentz tension plays a non negligible role in addition to the\nmagnetic pressure. This is interesting because most of the previous stellar\nevolution codes ignored that term and the geometry of the field. The solar\nstructure perturbations are, as already known, small and consequently we have\nbeen able to estimate each term semi-analytically.

We perform many\ndirect $N$-body simulations with various initial conditions and two different\nchoices of IMFs. One is a standard Kroupa IMF without any mass segregation. The\nother is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted. We\nargue that if Arches was created with a mass segregated IMF similar to what is\nobserved today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass star\nshould be created. However, whether a collisional runaway leads to the\nformation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) depends strongly on the\nmass loss rate via winds from massive stars. Growth of stellar mass through\ncollisions can be quenched by strong wind mass loss. In that case, the\ninter-cluster as well as intra-cluster medium are expected to have a\nsignificant Helium enrichment which may be observed via Helium recombination\nlines. The excess amount of gas lost in winds may also be observed via X-ray\nobservations as diffused X-ray sources. \n\n"}

The masses of the nuclei are taken from nuclear structure\ncalculations which are based on the same nuclear Lagrangian. For known nuclei\nexperimental data is used directly.

To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important\neffect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble\nmodel for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor\nof six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy\ncontained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is\nincluded; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated\naccompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling\nand evolution. While more detailed models are certainly called for, this work\nillustrates the possible strong importance of dust in wind-blown bubbles, and\nis a first step toward models of dusty, wind-blown bubbles. \n\n"}

This gives a consistent description of the quenching\nmechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore\nthe effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in\nparticular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically\ndiffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers\n(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the\nmagnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the\nnorthern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the\nmagnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works.

Comparison with Observation, Clump Properties, and Scaling to\n  Physical Units Abstract: Ambipolar diffusion is important in redistributing magnetic flux and in\ndamping Alfven waves in molecular clouds. The importance of ambipolar diffusion\non a length scale $\\ell$ is governed by the ambipolar diffusion Reynolds\nnumber, $\\rad=\\ell/\\lad$, where $\\lad$ is the characteristic length scale for\nambipolar diffusion. The logarithmic mean of the AD Reynolds number in a sample\nof 15 molecular clumps with measured magnetic fields (Crutcher 1999) is 17,\ncomparable to the theoretically expected value. We identify several regimes of\nambipolar diffusion in a turbulent medium, depending on the ratio of the flow\ntime to collision times between ions and neutrals; the clumps observed by\nCrutcher (1999) are all in the standard regime of ambipolar diffusion, in which\nthe neutrals and ions are coupled over a flow time. We have carried out\ntwo-fluid simulations of ambipolar diffusion in isothermal, turbulent boxes for\na range of values of $\\rad$. The mean Mach numbers were fixed at $\\calm=3$ and\n$\\ma=0.67$; self-gravity was not included. We study the properties of\noverdensities--i.e., clumps--in the simulation and show that the slope of the\nhigher-mass portion of the clump mass spectrum increases as $\\rad$ decreases,\nwhich is qualitatively consistent with Padoan et al.

For a value of $\\rad$ similar to the observed value, we find a\nslope that is consistent with that of the high-mass end of the Initial Mass\nFunction for stars. However, the value we find for the spectral index in our\nideal MHD simulation differs from theirs, presumably because our simulations\nhave different initial conditions.

The\napplication of the method is performed with the statistical construction of\nsynthetic color-magnitude diagrams using PMS evolutionary models. We convert\neach isochrone into 2D probability distributions of artificial PMS stars in the\nCMD by applying the aforementioned biases that dislocate these stars from their\noriginal CMD positions. A maximum-likelihood technique is then applied to\nderive the probability for each observed star to have a certain age, as well as\nthe best age for the entire cluster. We apply our method to the photometric\ncatalog of ~2000 PMS stars in the young association LH 95 in the LMC, based on\nthe deepest HST/ACS imaging ever performed toward this galaxy, with a detection\nlimit of V~28, corresponding to M~0.2 Msun.

An example of such a post-CME ray was observed by various coronagraphs,\nincluding these of the SECCHI instrument suite of the STEREO twin spacecraft\nand the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph LASCO onboard the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ray was observed in the aftermath of a CME\nwhich occurred on 9 April 2008. The twin STEREO spacecraft were separated by\nabout degrees on that day. This significant separation combined with a third\n\"eye\" view supplied by LASCO allow for a truly multi-viewpoint observation of\nthe ray and of the CME.

Our\ngoal is to test whether the de Jager et al. (1988) prescription, used in some\nstellar evolution models, is still valid in view of more recent mass-loss\ndeterminations. By considering 40 Galactic RSGs presenting an infrared excess\nand an IRAS 60-mu flux larger than 2 Jy, and assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio\nof 200, it is found that the de Jager rate agrees within a factor 4 with most\nMdot estimates based on the 60-mu signal.

The two objects that do not follow the\nde Jager prescription (by an order of magnitude) are mu Cep and NML Cyg. We\nhave also considered the RSGs of the Magellanic Clouds.

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass\nfor Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews\net al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an\nimportant role in the circumstellar gas dynamics. \n\n"}

In particular, the mutual interaction\nbetween all these components is the cause of the high value of the polarization\n($\\approx$ 20%) and of its fluctuations.

In two cases (SN 2003fg and SN 2009dc) the explosion sites were\noutside 99% of the host's light, and in one case (SN 2006gz) the host's radial\nmetallicity slope indicates that the explosion site is in a metal-poor region.\nThe fourth case (SN 2007if) has the lowest spectroscopically measured SN Ia\nhost metallicity (Childress et al. 2011. It may be possible to explain each of\nthese unusually bright events through some progenitor scenario specific to that\ncase, but a much simpler and straightforward conclusion would be to ascribe the\ncontrolling factor to the only physical aspect they have in common --- metal\npoor environments. \n\n"}

We present a new single degenerate (SD) model for\nSN Ia progenitors, in which the WD mass possibly reaches 2.3-2.7 M_sun. Three\nbinary evolution processes are incorporated; optically thick winds from\nmass-accreting WDs, mass-stripping from the binary companion star by the WD\nwinds, and WDs being supported by differential rotation. The WD mass can\nincrease by accretion up to 2.3 (2.7) M_sun from the initial value of 1.1 (1.2)\nM_sun, being consistent with high luminosity SNe Ia such as SN 2003fg, SN\n2006gz, SN 2007if, and SN 2009dc. There are three characteristic mass ranges of\nexploding WDs. In an extreme massive case, differentially rotating WDs explode\nas an SN Ia soon after the WD mass exceeds 2.4 M_sun because of a secular\ninstability at T/|W|\\sim 0.14. For a mid mass range of M_WD=1.5-2.4 M_sun, it\ntakes some time (spinning-down time) until carbon is ignited to induce an SN Ia\nexplosion after the WD mass has reached maximum, because it needs a loss or\nredistribution of angular momentum. For a lower mass case of rigidly rotating\nWDs, M_WD=1.38-1.5 M_sun, the spinning-down time depends on the timescale of\nangular momentum loss from the WD. The difference in the spinning-down time may\nproduce the \"prompt\" and \"tardy\" components. We also suggest the very bright\nsuper-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia are born in a low metallicity environment. \n\n"}

Using data from different sources and wavelengths, we\nconstruct 3-D photoionization models and derive the physical quantitities of\nthe ionizing source and nebular gas. The procedure, discussed in detail in the\nprevious papers, consists of the use of 3-D photoionization codes constrained\nby observational data to derive the three-dimensional nebular structure,\nphysical and chemical characteristics and ionizing star parameters of the\nobjects by simultaneously fitting the integrated line intensities, the density\nmap, the temperature map, and the observed morphologies in different emission\nlines.

We explore the\nuse of the new BT2 (Barber et al. 2006) water line list in fitting the spectra,\nand we find that it does a much better job than the well-known HITRAN (Rothman\net al. 1998) water line list in the observed wavelength range and for the warm\ntemperatures probed by our data. By comparing the observed spectra with\nsynthetic disk emission models, we find that the water and OH emission lines\nhave similar widths (FWHM ~ 18 km s-1). If the line widths are set by disk\nrotation, the OH and water emission lines probe a similar range of disk radii\nin this source.

The absorption of electron-type\nneutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the\n\"neutrino mechanism\"). Because the heating rate is proportional to the square\nof neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-type\nneutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (CnuO) may in principle increase\nthe heating rate and drive explosions. In order to assess the potential\nimportance of CnuO for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundary\nvalue problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the PNS surface (r_nu)\nand the shock (r_S), including a scheme for flavor conversion via CnuO. For a\ngiven r_nu, PNS mass (M), accretion rate (Mdot), and assumed values of the\nneutrino energies from the PNS, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosity\nabove which accretion is impossible and explosion results. We show that CnuO\ncan decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only if\nthe flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_S and if there is no matter\nsuppression. The magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (M,\nMdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavor\nconversion. We quantify these dependencies and find that CnuO could lower the\ncritical luminosity only for small M and Mdot, and large r_nu. However, for\nthese parameter values CnuO are suppressed due to matter effects. By\nquantifying the importance of CnuO and matter suppression at the critical\nneutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studies\nthat CnuO are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse\nsupernovae significantly. \n\n"}

Interpreting Li Abundances in RGB and\n  AGB Stars Abstract: We reanalyze the problem of Li abundances in red giants of nearly solar\nmetallicity. After an outline of the problems affecting our knowledge of the Li\ncontent in low-mass stars (M<3Mo), we discuss deep-mixing models for the RGB\nstages suitable to account for the observed trends and for the correlated\nvariations of the carbon isotope ratio; we find that Li destruction in these\nphases is limited to masses below about 2.3 Mo. Subsequently, we concentrate on\nthe final stages of evolution for both O-rich and C-rich AGB stars. Here, the\nconstraints on extra-mixing phenomena previously derived from heavier nuclei\n(from C to Al), coupled to recent updates in stellar structure models\n(including both the input physics and the set of reaction rates used), are\nsuitable to account for the observations of Li abundances below A(Li)= log\ne(Li) = 1.5 (and sometimes more). Also their relations with other\nnucleosynthesis signatures of AGB phases (like the abundance of F, the C/O and\n12C/13C ratios) can be explained. This requires generally moderate efficiencies\n(\\dot M <= 0.3 - 0.5 x 10^-6 Mo/yr) for non-convective mass transport. At such\nrates, slow extra-mixing does not modify remarkably Li abundances in early-AGB\nphases; on the other hand, faster mixing encounters a physical limit in\ndestroying Li, set by the mixing velocity. Beyond this limit, Li starts to be\nproduced; therefore its destruction on the AGB is modest. Li is then\nsignificantly produced by the third dredge up. We also show that effective\ncirculation episodes, while not destroying Li, would easily bring the 12C/13C\nratios to equilibrium, contrary to the evidence in most AGB stars, and would\nburn F beyond the limits shown by C(N) giants. Hence, we do not confirm the\ncommon idea that efficient extra-mixing drastically reduces the Li content of\nC-stars with respect to K-M giants. \n\n"}

By introducing the\nMadelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the dynamics of the\nsystem in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic Euler\nequations. The non-relativistic and Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational\ncondensate can be described as a gas, whose density and pressure are related by\na barotropic equation of state.

We\nestimate that a survey of ~10^4 young (~10 Myr old) post-accretion pre-MS stars\nmonitored for ~10 years should yield at least a few deep eclipses from\ncircumplanetary disks and disks surrounding low mass companion stars.

SuperWASP\nand ASAS light curves for this star show a remarkably long, deep, and complex\neclipse event centered on 29 April 2007. At least 5 multi-day dimming events of\n>0.5 mag are identified, with a >3.3 mag deep eclipse bracketed by two pairs of\n~1 mag eclipses symmetrically occurring +-12 days and +-26 days before and\nafter. Hence, significant dimming of the star was taking place on and off over\nat least a ~54 day period in 2007, and a strong >1 mag dimming event occurred\nover a ~12 day span. We place a firm lower limit on the period of 850 days\n(i.e. the orbital radius of the eclipser must be >1.7 AU and orbital velocity\nmust be <22 km/s). The shape of the light curve is similar to the lop-sided\neclipses of the Be star EE Cep.

In this model, gravitationally\nbound cores form uniformly in the clump following a prescribed core formation\nefficiency per unit time. After a contraction timescale which is equal to a few\ntimes their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and populate the\nIMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account in the form\nof stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective energy of the winds to the\ngravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is removed from the clump\nand core and star formation are quenched. The power of the radiation driven\nwinds has a strong dependence on metallicity and it increases with increasing\nmetallicity. Thus, winds from stars in the high metallicity models lead to a\nrapid evacuation of the gas from the protocluster clump and to a reduced star\nformation efficiency, as compared to their low metallicity counterparts. We\nderive the metallicity dependent star formation efficiency per unit time in\nthis model as a function of the gas surface density Sigma_g.

The second type, electron-capture supernovae, is\nassociated with the collapse of a lower-mass oxygen-neon-magnesium core as it\nloses pressure support owing to the sudden capture of electrons by neon and/or\nmagnesium nuclei. It has hitherto been impossible to identify the two distinct\nfamilies of neutron stars produced in these formation channels. Here we report\nthat a large, well-known class of neutron-star-hosting X-ray pulsars is\nactually composed of two distinct sub-populations with different characteristic\nspin periods, orbital periods and orbital eccentricities. This class, the\nBe/X-ray binaries, contains neutron stars that accrete material from a more\nmassive companion star. The two sub-populations are most probably associated\nwith the two distinct types of neutron-star-forming supernovae, with\nelectron-capture supernovae preferentially producing system with short spin\nperiod, short orbital periods and low eccentricity.

The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) requires a minimum\nionisation fraction to drive turbulence in a disc. The inner parts of the disc\naround a young stellar object are sufficiently hot to be thermally ionised.\nFurther out, cosmic rays ionise the surface layers and a dead zone forms at the\nmid-plane where the disc is too cool for the MRI to operate. The surface\ndensity in the turbulent active layer is often assumed to be constant with\nradius because the cosmic rays penetrate a constant layer. However, if a\ncritical magnetic Reynolds number, Re_{M,crit}, is used to determine the extent\nof the dead zone, the surface density in the layer generally increases with\nradius. For small critical magnetic Reynolds number of order 1, the constant\nlayer approximation may be a reasonable fit.

Two\nmechanisms are thought to contribute to the ejection of runaway stars, both\ninvolve binarity (or higher multiplicity). In the binary supernova scenario a\nrunaway star receives its velocity when its binary massive companion explodes\nas a supernova (SN). In the alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway\nstars are formed through gravitational interactions between stars and binaries\nin dense, compact clusters or cluster cores. Here we study the ejection\nscenario. We make use of extensive N-body simulations of massive clusters, as\nwell as analytic arguments, in order to to characterize the expected ejection\nvelocity distribution of runaways stars. We find the ejection velocity\ndistribution of the fastest runaways (>~80 km s^-1) depends on the binary\ndistribution in the cluster, consistent with our analytic toy model, whereas\nthe distribution of lower velocity runaways appears independent of the binaries\nproperties. For a realistic log constant distribution of binary separations, we\nfind the velocity distribution to follow a simple power law; Gamma(v) goes like\nv^(-8/3) for the high velocity runaways and v^(-3/2) for the low velocity ones.\nWe calculate the total expected ejection rates of runaway stars from our\nsimulated massive clusters and explore their mass function and their binarity.\nThe mass function of runaway stars is biased towards high masses, and depends\nstrongly on their velocity. The binarity of runaways is a decreasing function\nof their ejection velocity, with no binaries expected to be ejected with v>150\nkm s^-1.

In this article, we review various\nprogenitor models proposed in the past years and summarize many observational\nresults that can be used to put constraints on the nature of their progenitors.\nWe also discuss the origin of SN Ia diversity and the impacts of SN Ia\nprogenitors on some fields. The currently favourable progenitor model is the\nsingle-degenerate (SD) model, in which the WD accretes material from a\nnon-degenerate companion star. This model may explain the similarities of most\nSNe Ia. It has long been argued that the double-degenerate (DD) model, which\ninvolves the merger of two CO WDs, may lead to an accretion-induced collapse\nrather than a thermonuclear explosion. However, recent observations of a few\nSNe Ia seem to support the DD model, and this model can produce normal SN Ia\nexplosion under certain conditions. Additionally, the sub-luminous SNe Ia may\nbe explained by the sub-Chandrasekhar mass model. At present, it seems likely\nthat more than one progenitor model, including some variants of the SD and DD\nmodels, may be required to explain the observed diversity of SNe Ia. \n\n"}

It is\none magnitude dimmer than would be predicted from its observed value of\nDelta-m15, and shows broad spectral features. We base our analysis on detailed\ncalculations for the explosion, light curves, and spectra. We demonstrate that\nconsistency is key for both validating the models and probing the underlying\nphysics. We show that this SN can be understood within the physics underlying\nthe Delta-m15 relation, and in the framework of pulsating delayed detonation\nmodels originating from a Chandrasekhar mass, white dwarf, but with a\nprogenitor core composed of 80% carbon. We suggest a possible scenario for\nstellar evolution which leads to such a progenitor. We show that the unusual\nlight curve decline can be understood with the same physics as has been used to\nunderstand the Delta-m15 relation for normal SNe Ia. The decline relation can\nbe explained by a combination of the temperature dependence of the opacity and\nexcess or deficit of the peak luminosity, alpha, measured relative to the\ninstantaneous rate of radiative decay energy generation. What differentiates SN\n2001ay from normal SNe Ia is a higher explosion energy which leads to a shift\nof the Ni56 distribution towards higher velocity and alpha < 1. This result is\nresponsible for the fast rise and slow decline. We define a class of SN\n2001ay-like SNe Ia, which will show an anti-Phillips relation. \n\n"}

A recent study by us,\nviz., that of Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012; Paper I), which involves realistic\nN-body computations of star clusters mimicking R136, indicates that such\n\"super-canonical\" (SC) stars can be formed out of a dense stellar population\nwith a canonical initial mass function (IMF) through dynamically induced\nmergers of the most massive binaries. Here we study the formation of SC stars\nin the R136 models of Paper I in detail. To avoid forming extraneous SC stars\nfrom initially highly eccentric primordial binaries as in Paper I, we compute\nadditional models with only initially circular primordial binaries. We also\ntake into account the mass-evolution of the SC stars using detailed stellar\nevolutionary models that incorporate updated treatments of stellar winds. We\nfind that SC stars begin to form via dynamical mergers of massive binaries from\napprox. 1 Myr cluster age.

The\nsimulations include vertical stratification and assume zero net vertical\nmagnetic flux. We employ a super time-stepping technique to ameliorate the\nCourant restriction on the diffusive time step. We find that in idealized\nstratified simulations, with a spatially constant ambipolar Elsasser number Am,\nturbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) behaves in a\nsimilar manner as in prior unstratified calculations. Turbulence dies away for\nAm < 1, and becomes progressively more vigorous as ambipolar diffusion is\ndecreased. Near-ideal MHD behavior is recovered for Am > 1000. In the\nintermediate regime (10 < Am < 1000) ambipolar diffusion leads to substantial\nincreases in both the period of the MRI dynamo cycle and the characteristic\nscales of magnetic field structures. To quantify the impact of ambipolar\nphysics on disk accretion, we run simulations at 30 AU and 100 AU that include\na vertical Am profile based upon far ultraviolet (FUV) ionized disk models.\nThese models develop a vertically layered structure analogous to the Ohmic dead\nzone that is present at smaller radii.

This discrepancy is\nvery likely due to the assumption of zero vertical magnetic field in our\nsimulations and suggests that vertical magnetic fields are essential for\nMRI-driven accretion in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. \n\n"}

We confirmed spectroscopically 16 new members of the IC\n348 cluster, including 13 brown dwarfs, contributing significantly to the\nsubstellar census of the cluster, where only 30 brown dwarfs were previously\nknown. Five of the new members have a L0 spectral type, the latest-type objects\nfound to date in this cluster. At 3 Myr, evolutionary models estimate these\nbrown dwarfs to have a mass of ~13 Jupiter masses. Combining the new members\nwith previous census of the cluster, we constructed the IMF complete down to 13\nJupiter masses. Conclusions. The IMF of IC 348 is well fitted by a log-normal\nfunction, and we do not see evidence for variations of the mass function down\nto planetary masses when compared to other young clusters. \n\n"}

Such a perturber is sufficiently distant to\nallow the triple system to remain intact for millions of orbits while\nefficiently exchanging angular momentum with the WD-WD binary. In ~ 5% of the\ninitial orientations, the inner orbit efficiently scans the (equal energy)\nphase space in the region of zero angular momentum. In these systems, the\nbinary experiences increasingly closer, stochastic, pericenter approaches r_p ~\na/2N with the increasing number (N) of orbits elapsed. Within N~10^5(a/30AU)\norbits, a collision is likely to occur. This is shown by performing \\simten\nthousand 3-body integrations and is explained by simple analytic arguments. The\ncollisions are conservatively restricted to \"clean\" collisions in which all\npassages prior to the collision are greater than 4R_WD=4x10^9cm. In particular,\nwithin the last single orbit, the pericenter changes from r_p>4R_WD to a\ncollision value of r_p<2R_WD. The effects of tidal deformations and General\nRelativistic (GR) corrections are negligible in these scenarios. The WDs\napproach each other with a high velocity >3000 km/s and the collision is likely\nto detonate the WDs leading to a type Ia SNe. If a significant fraction of WDs\nreside in such triples, the rate of such collisions is as high as the SNe Ia\nrate, and it is possible that some or all type Ia SNe occur in this way.

At a typical observing wavelength, this\ndelay can vary by tens of microseconds on five-year time scales, far in excess\nof signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays, such as that induced by a\ngravitational-wave background. Measurement of these delay variations is not\nonly crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides an\nunparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. In\nthis paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independent\nred-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion can\nattenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. We present a robust\nmethod for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply it\nto observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Correction for dispersion\nvariations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. We discuss\nscheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such as\nscintillation, that can exacerbate the problem. Comparison with scintillation\nmeasurements confirms previous results that the spectral exponent of electron\ndensity variations in the interstellar medium often appears steeper than\nexpected. We also find a discrete change in dispersion measure of PSR\nJ1603-7202 of ~2x10^{-3} cm^{-3}pc for about 250 days.

The chiral SU(3) model is one\nof the few models for the deconfinement PT, which contains quarks and hadrons\nin arbitrary proportions (i.e. a \"solution\") and gives a continuous transition\nfrom pure hadronic to pure quark matter above a critical point. The study shows\nthe universality of the applied concept of non-congruence for the two PTs with\nan upper critical point, and illustrates the different typical scales involved.\nIn addition, we find a principle difference between the liquid-gas and the\ndeconfinement PTs: in contrast to the ordinary Van-der-Waals-like PT, the phase\ncoexistence line of the deconfinement PT has a negative slope in the\npressure-temperature plane. As another qualitative difference we find that the\nnon-congruent features of the deconfinement PT become vanishingly small around\nthe critical point. \n\n"}

We propose that (1)\nthe nearly complete absence of unprocessed ices along the line-of-sight is due\nto the flattened envelope structure of HOPS-68, which lacks cold absorbing\nmaterial in its outer envelope, and possesses an extreme concentration of\nmaterial within its inner (10 AU) envelope region and (2) an energetic event\nled to the evaporation of inner envelope ices, followed by cooling and\nre-condensation, explaining the sequestration of spherical, CO2 ice mantles in\na hydrogen-poor mixture. The mechanism responsible for the sublimation could be\neither a transient accretion event or shocks in the interaction region between\nthe protostellar outflow and envelope. The proposed scenario is consistent with\nthe rarity of the observed CO2 ice profile, the formation of nearly pure CO2\nice, and the production of spherical ice mantles.

Studying a 27 Msun progenitor, we\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity can develop in 3D\nsimulations with detailed neutrino transport despite the presence of\nconvection. This result was obtained with the Prometheus-Vertex code with the\nsame sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in 1D and 2D models.\nWhile buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass motions in the\npostshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with growing amplitude sets in during a\nphase of shock retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose growth is\nonly quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO interface leads to strong shock\nexpansion in response to a dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the\nphase of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the postshock layer\nexhibits nonradial deformation dominated by the lowest-order spherical\nharmonics (l=1, m=0,-1,+1) in distinct contrast to the higher multipole\nstructures associated with neutrino-driven convection.

The use\nof integral field spectroscopy enables us to obtain both spatial and spectral\ninformation of the explosion site, allowing the identification of the parent\nstellar population of the supernova progenitor star. The spectrum of the parent\npopulation provides metallicity determination via strong-line method and age\nestimation obtained via comparison with simple stellar population (SSP) models.\nWe adopt this information as the metallicity and age of the supernova\nprogenitor, under the assumption that it was coeval with the parent stellar\npopulation. The age of the star corresponds to its lifetime, which in turn\ngives the estimate of its initial mass. With this method we were able to\ndetermine both the metallicity and initial (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor stars\nof the type Ib and Ic supernovae. We found that on average SN Ic explosion\nsites are more metal-rich and younger than SN Ib sites.

The probes explore a box of stars representative of the local Solar\nneighbourhood, to investigate how self-replication affects exploration\ntimescales when compared with a single non-replicating probe.\n  We explore three different scenarios of probe behaviour: i) standard powered\nflight to the nearest unvisited star (no slingshot techniques used), ii) flight\nto the nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to\nthe next unvisited star that will give the maximum velocity boost under a\nslingshot trajectory.\n  In all three scenarios we find that as expected, using self-replicating\nprobes greatly reduces the exploration time, by up to three orders of magnitude\nfor scenario i) and iii) and two orders of magnitude for ii). The second case\n(i.e. nearest-star slingshots) remains the most time effective way to explore a\npopulation of stars. As the decision-making algorithms for the fleet are\nsimple, unanticipated \"race conditions\" amongst probes are set up, causing the\nexploration time of the final stars to become much longer than necessary.

The luminosities of the sources are typically several\nthousand L_sun while the effective temperatures are 4000-8000 K. Such stars\ncould be post-AGB stars of mass 0.4-0.8 M_sun or pre-main-sequence stars (young\nstellar objects) with masses of 7-19 M_sun. If the stars are pre-main-sequence\nstars, they are substantially cooler and younger than stars at the birth line\nwhere Galactic protostars are first supposed to become optically visible out of\ntheir molecular clouds. They should therefore be hidden in their present\nevolutionary state. The second explanation for these stars is that they are\npost-AGB or post-RGB stars that have recently undergone a binary interaction\nwhen the red giant of the binary system filled its Roche lobe. Being\noxygen-rich, they have gone through this process before becoming carbon stars.\nMost of the stars vary slowly on timescales of 1000 days or more suggesting a\nchanging circumstellar environment. Apart from the slow variations, most stars\nalso show variability with periods of tens to hundreds of days. One star shows\na period that is rapidly decreasing and we speculate that this star may have\naccreted a large blob of gas and dust onto a disk whose orbital radius is\nshrinking rapidly.

The heating rates in our simulations are well fit by this\nformula. The best-fit values of $c_1$ are $\\sim 1$. The best-fit values of\n$c_2$ decrease (i.e., stochastic heating becomes more effective) as the grid\nsize and Reynolds number of the RMHD simulations increase. As an example, in a\n$1024^2 \\times 256$ RMHD simulation with a dissipation wavenumber of order the\ninverse ion gyroradius, we find $c_2 = 0.21$. We show that stochastic heating\nis significantly stronger in strong RMHD turbulence than in a field of randomly\nphased Alfv\\'en waves with the same power spectrum, because coherent structures\nin strong RMHD turbulence increase orbit stochasticity in the regions where\nions are heated most strongly. We find that $c_1$ increases by a factor of\n$\\sim 3$ while $c_2$ changes very little as the ion thermal speed increases\nfrom values $\\ll v_{\\rm A}$ to values $\\sim v_{\\rm A}$, where $v_{\\rm A}$ is\nthe Alfv\\'en speed.

Pre-launch\n  description Abstract: The Gaia satellite will survey the entire celestial sphere down to 20th\nmagnitude, obtaining astrometry, photometry, and low resolution\nspectrophotometry on one billion astronomical sources, plus radial velocities\nfor over one hundred million stars. Its main objective is to take a census of\nthe stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of revealing its formation and\nevolution. Gaia's unique feature is the measurement of parallaxes and proper\nmotions with hitherto unparalleled accuracy for many objects. As a survey, the\nphysical properties of most of these objects are unknown. Here we describe the\ndata analysis system put together by the Gaia consortium to classify these\nobjects and to infer their astrophysical properties using the satellite's data.\nThis system covers single stars, (unresolved) binary stars, quasars, and\ngalaxies, all covering a wide parameter space. Multiple methods are used for\nmany types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user according to\ndifferent models and assumptions. Prior to its application to real Gaia data\nthe accuracy of these methods cannot be assessed definitively. But as an\nexample of the current performance, we can attain internal accuracies (RMS\nresiduals) on F,G,K,M dwarfs and giants at G=15 (V=15-17) for a wide range of\nmetallicites and interstellar extinctions of around 100K in effective\ntemperature (Teff), 0.1mag in extinction (A0), 0.2dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]),\nand 0.25dex in surface gravity (logg).

For hot Jupiters the bow shock will not form\ndirectly between the planet and the star, causing an asymmetric distribution of\nmass around the exoplanet and hence an asymmetric transit. As the planet orbits\nthorough varying wind conditions, the strength and geometry of its bow shock\nwill change, thus producing transits of varying shape. We model this process\nusing magnetic maps of HD 189733 taken one year apart, coupled with a 3D\nstellar wind model, to determine the local stellar wind conditions throughout\nthe orbital path of the planet. We predict the time-varying geometry and\ndensity of the bow shock that forms around the magnetosphere of the planet and\nsimulate transit light curves.

A weakly twisted flux rope (FR) is then\nbuilt up slowly in the embedded core region, largely through flux-cancellation\nphotospheric reconnections, forming a bald patch separatrix surface (BPSS)\nseparating the FR from its ambient field. The FR grows gradually until its axis\nruns into a torus instability (TI) domain near the end of the third day, and\nthe BPSS also develops a fully S-shape. Unlike in the case of standard TI, the\nFR does not erupt instantly since it is still attached at the photosphere along\nthe bald patch (BP) portion of the polarity inversion line.

For this reason we present\na set of high resolution simulations studying the effect of supernova\nexplosions on magnetized, primordial halos. We focus on the evolution of an\ninitially small-scale magnetic field formed during the collapse of the halo. We\nvary the degree of magnetization, the halo mass, and the amount of explosion\nenergy in order to account for expected variations as well as to infer\nsystematical dependencies of the results on initial conditions. Our simulations\nsuggest that core collapse supernovae with an explosion energy of 10^51 erg and\nmore violent pair instability supernovae with 10^53 erg are able to disrupt\nhalos with masses up to a about 10^6 and 10^7 M_sun, respectively. The peak of\nthe magnetic field spectra shows a continuous shift towards smaller k-values,\ni.e. larger length scales, over time reaching values as low as k = 4. On small\nscales the magnetic energy decreases at the cost of the energy on large scales\nresulting in a well-ordered magnetic field with a strength up to ~ 10^-8 G\ndepending on the initial conditions. The coherence length of the magnetic field\ninferred from the spectra reaches values up to 250 pc in agreement with those\nobtained from autocorrelation functions. We find the coherence length to be as\nlarge as $50\\%$ of the radius of the supernova bubble. Extrapolating this\nrelation to later stages we suggest that significantly strong magnetic fields\nwith coherence lengths as large as 1.5 kpc could be created.

In spite of the diversity of the magnetic\nfield topologies among the stars in our sample, we find that stellar wind\nflowing near the (rotational) equatorial plane carries most of the stellar\nangular momentum, but there is no preferred colatitude contributing to mass\nloss, as the mass flux is maximum at different colatitudes for different stars.\nWe find that more non-axisymmetric magnetic fields result in more asymmetric\nmass fluxes and wind total pressures $p_{\\rm tot}$ (defined as the sum of\nthermal, magnetic and ram pressures). Because planetary magnetospheric sizes\nare set by pressure equilibrium between the planet's magnetic field and $p_{\\rm\ntot}$, variations of up to a factor of $3$ in $p_{\\rm tot}$ (as found in the\ncase of a planet orbiting at several stellar radii away from the star) lead to\nvariations in magnetospheric radii of about 20 percent along the planetary\norbital path.

In this framework, an evolutionary track is determined by\nthree environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass M_c, the mean\nsurface density of the ambient star-forming clump Sigma_cl, and the\nrotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.\nEvolutionary sequences with various M_c, Sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed. We\nfind that in a fiducial model with M_c=60Msun, Sigma_cl=1 g/cm^2 and\nbeta_c=0.02, the final star formation efficiency >~0.43. For each evolutionary\ntrack, RT simulations are performed at selected stages, with temperature\nprofiles, SEDs, and images produced.

The r-mode interpretation has connections with proposed spin-evolution\nscenarios for systems such as XTE J1751-305. Here we examine in detail this\ninteresting possible interpretation. Using the ratio of the observed\noscillation frequency to the star's spin frequency, we derive an approximate\nneutron star mass-radius relation which yields reasonable values for the mass\nover the range of expected stellar radius (as constrained by observations of\nradius-expansion burst sources).

Those with a more massive\ncomponent filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the\nRoche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes\nthat, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor),\nmass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of\nmass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show\nthat the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive\ncomponent (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the\nvalue determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge\nsticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical)\nmass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting\nfrom the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why\nwe observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to\npredictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the\nThermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass\nequalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with\nthis phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are\ncomparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27\nSD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both\ntypes of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer.

While spatial\ninhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for much\nof the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arise\nfrom atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to,\nclouds. To better understand the role that thermal variability might play we\npresent a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developed\none-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. We focus\non the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem\nthrough omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results\ndemonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at\npressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the\nupper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared\nwater opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal\nperturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations,\nthe emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent\nbehaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at\ndifferent wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in\nthe atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative\nexchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation\nevolves in time.

We present a\nmolecular survey from 218200 MHz to 221800 MHz carried out with the IRAM\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer. These observations were complemented with a\nlong integration single-dish spectrum taken with the IRAM 30m telescope. We\nused a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) single temperature code to model\nthe whole dataset. The interferometric spectrum is crowded with a total of ~300\nlines from which a few dozens remain unidentified yet. The spectrum has been\nmodeled with a total of 20 species and their isomers, isotopologues and\ndeuterated compounds. Complex molecules like methyl formate (CH3OCHO), ethanol\n(CH3CH2OH), glycolaldehyde (CH2OHCHO), acetone (CH3COCH3), dimethyl ether\n(CH3OCH3), ethyl cyanide (CH3CH2CN) and the aGg' conformer of ethylene glycol\n(aGg'-(CH2OH)_2) are among the detected species. The detection of vibrationally\nexcited lines of CH3CN, CH3OCHO, CH3OH, OCS, HC3N and CH3CHO proves the\nexistence of gas and dust at high temperatures. In fact, the gas kinetic\ntemperature estimated from the vibrational lines of CH3CN, ~405 K, is similar\nto that measured in massive hot cores. Our data allow an extensive comparison\nof the chemistry in FIRS~2 and the Orion hot core. We find a quite similar\nchemistry in FIRS 2 and Orion. Most of the studied fractional molecular\nabundances agree within a factor of 5. Larger differences are only found for\nthe deuterated compounds D2CO and CH2DOH and a few molecules (CH3CH2CN, SO2,\nHNCO and CH3CHO). Since the physical conditions are similar in both hot cores,\nonly different initial conditions (warmer pre-collapse phase in the case of\nOrion) and/or different crossing time of the gas in the hot core can explain\nthis behavior. \n\n"}

Around 4 years of almost continuous ultra\nhigh-precision photometry have been obtained reaching a duty cycle higher than\n90% for many of these stars. However, almost regular gaps due to nominal\noperations are present in the light curves at different time scales. In this\npaper we want to highlight the impact of those regular gaps in asteroseismic\nanalyses and we try to find a method that minimizes their effect in the\nfrequency domain. To do so, we isolate the two main time scales of quasi\nregular gaps in the data. We then interpolate the gaps and we compare the power\ndensity spectra of four different stars: two red giants at different stages of\ntheir evolution, a young F-type star, and a classical pulsator in the\ninstability strip. The spectra obtained after filling the gaps in the selected\nsolar-like stars show a net reduction in the overall background level, as well\nas a change in the background parameters. The inferred convective properties\ncould change as much as 200% in the selected example, introducing a bias in the\np-mode frequency of maximum power. When global asteroseismic scaling relations\nare used, this bias can lead up to a variation in the surface gravity of 0.05\ndex. Finally, the oscillation spectrum in the classical pulsator is cleaner\ncompared to the original one. \n\n"}

Using archival data from observations with the\nXMM-Newton and the Swift observatories spanning over ~10 yr, we show that WR 25\nis a periodic variable in X-rays with a period of $208 \\pm 3$ days. X-ray light\ncurves in the 0.5-10.0 keV energy band show phase-locked variability, where the\nflux increased by a factor of ~2 from minimum to maximum, being maximum near\nperiastron passage. The light curve in the soft energy band (0.5-2.0 keV) shows\ntwo minima indicating the presence of two eclipses. However, the light curve in\nthe hard energy band (2.0-10.0 keV) shows only one minimum during the apastron\npassage. The X-ray spectra of WR 25 were explained by a two-temperature plasma\nmodel. Both the cool and the hot plasmas were constant at 0.628+/-0.008 and\n2.75+/-0.06 keV throughout an orbital cycle, where the cooler plasma could be\ndue to the small scale shocks in a radiation-driven outflow and the high\ntemperature plasma could be due to the collision of winds. The column density\nvaried with the orbital phase and was found to be maximum after the periastron\npassage, when the WN star is in front of the O star. The abundances of WR 25\nwere found to be non-solar. Optical V-band data of WR 25 also show the\nphase-locked variability, being at maximum near periastron passage. The results\nbased on the present analysis indicate that WR 25 is a colliding wind binary\nwhere the presence of soft X-rays is attributed to individual components;\nhowever, hard X-rays are due to the collision of winds. \n\n"}

Overall, extant synthetic\nfluxes predict quite realistic broad-band colours and bolometric corrections,\nespecially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the\npredictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of\nhydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free\nparameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)\nchanges for different values of [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]; in particular, how\nsuitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch\nand lower main sequence populations with different [alpha/Fe], due to the\nconcomitant loops and swings in the CMD.

Our three directions are as follows. (i) Taking the variable\nsodium absorption lines in some SN Ia to originate in a massive circumstellar\nmatter (CSM), as has been claimed recently, we use the results of Sternberg et\nal. (2014) to imply that > ~20% of SN Ia occur inside a PN (or a PN\ndescendant), hence classify them as SNIPs. (ii) We next use results that show\nthat whenever there are hydrogen lines in SN Ia the hydrogen mass in the CSM is\nlarge (> 1 M_Sun), hence the explosion is a SNIP. We make the simplest\nassumption that the probability for explosion is constant in time for up to\nabout 10^5 yrs after the merger of the core with the white dwarf (WD) in the\nframe of the core-degenerate scenario.

Since oppositely directed current channels repel,\nthe equilibrium is liable to an ideal magnetohydrodynamic tilt instability.\nThis tilt evolution, previously studied in planar settings, involves two\nmagnetic islands or fluxropes, which on Alfvenic timescales undergo a combined\nrotation and separation. This in turn leads to the creation of (near) singular\ncurrent layers, posing severe challenges to numerical approaches. Using our\nopen-source grid-adaptive MPI-AMRVAC software, we revisit the planar evolution\ncase in compressible MHD, as well as its extension to 2.5D and full 3D\nscenarios. As long as the third dimension remains ignorable, pure tilt\nevolutions result which are hardly affected by out of plane magnetic field\ncomponents.

[...] The\nSouthern MAssive Stars at High angular resolution survey (SMASH+) was designed\nto fill this gap by providing the first systematic interferometric survey of\nGalactic massive stars.

Taking\nadvantage of NACO's field-of-view, we further uniformly searched for visual\ncompanions in an 8''-radius down to Delta H = 8. This paper describes the\nobservations and data analysis, reports the discovery of almost 200 new\ncompanions in the separation range from 1mas to 8'' and presents the catalog of\ndetections, including the first resolved measurements of over a dozen known\nlong-period spectroscopic binaries.\n  Excluding known runaway stars for which no companions are detected, 96\nobjects in our main sample (DEC < 0 deg; H<7.5) were observed both with PIONIER\nand NACO/SAM.

The keys to reproduce this result are a low initial\nwater ice abundance after the pre-collapse phase together with the fact that\natomic oxygen cannot freeze-out and form water ice in regions with T(dust)>15\nK.

We address some properties of this type of systems by using a\nSlater-Koster tight-binding model. We predict that topological\nsuperconductivity is nearly universal when ferromagnetic transition metal\nchains form straight lines on superconducting substrates and that it is\npossible for more complex chain structures. The proximity induced\nsuperconducting gap is $\\sim \\Delta E_{so} / J$ where $\\Delta$ is the $s$-wave\npair-potential on the chain, $E_{so}$ is the spin-orbit splitting energy\ninduced in the normal chain state bands by hybridization with the\nsuperconducting substrate, and $J$ is the exchange-splitting of the\nferromagnetic chain $d$-bands. Because of the topological character of the 1D\nsuperconducting state, Majorana end modes appear within the gaps of finite\nlength chains. We find, in agreement with experiment, that when the chain and\nsubstrate orbitals are strongly hybridized, Majorana end modes are\nsubstantially reduced in amplitude when separated from the chain end by less\nthan the coherence length defined by the $p$-wave superconducting gap. We\nconclude that Pb is a particularly favorable substrate material for\nferromagnetic chain topological superconductivity because it provides both\nstrong $s-$wave pairing and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, but that there\nis an opportunity to optimize properties by varying the atomic composition and\nstructure of the chain.

We solve for gas streamlines including the\nindirect stellar potential in the frame rotating with the pattern speed, under\nthe drastic simplification that gas does not feel its own gravity. Near\nco-rotation, the gas disk takes the form of a horseshoe-shaped annulus.

Interstellar turbulence is non-universal, with a wide range of\nMach numbers, magnetic fields strengths, and driving mechanisms. Although some\nof these parameters were explored, most previous works assumed that the gas is\nisothermal.

We use grid resolutions of 2048^3 cells and\ncompare polytropic exponents Gamma=0.7 (soft EOS), Gamma=1 (isothermal EOS),\nand Gamma=5/3 (stiff EOS).

The ratio of primordial to enriched\nstars thus has a U-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near the\nhalf-light radius.

Thus the fate of\nrapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate\nchannel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature\nof ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically\nderiving the existence of a characteristic length scale which establishes a\ntransition from central ignitions to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this\ncriterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection\nand ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events\nwithin Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel are\nbuoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase. We thus\ninfer that single-degenerate SNe Ia are generally expected to lead to\noverluminous 1991T-like SNe Ia events. We establish that the rates predicted\nfrom both the population of supersoft X-ray sources and binary population\nsynthesis models of the single-degenerate channel are broadly consistent with\nthe observed rates of overluminous SNe Ia, and suggest that the population of\nsupersoft X-ray sources are the dominant stellar progenitors of SNe 1991T-like\nevents.

This makes them powerful probes of the properties of their host\ngalaxies, such as kinematics and chemical abundances.

To characterize\ntheir composition we analyzed one giant star in NGC 5053, and two in NGC 5634.\nWe analize high-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra by means of the MyGIsFOS\ncode, determining atmospheric parameters and abundances for up to 21 species\nbetween O and Eu.

However,\nthe gravities obtained in this way correspond to unrealistic low stellar masses\n(0.1-0.5 Msun) for most of the surveyed giants. Instead, when photometric\ngravities are adopted, the [FeII/H] distribution shows no evidence of spread at\nvariance with the [FeI/H] distribution. This difference has been recently\nobserved in other clusters and could be due to non-local thermodynamical\nequilibrium effects driven by over-ionization mechanisms, that mainly affect\nthe neutral species (thus providing lower [FeI/H]) but leave [FeII/H]\nunaltered. We confirm that the s-process elements show significant star-to-star\nvariations and their abundances appear to be correlated with the difference\nbetween [FeI/H] and [FeII/H]. This puzzling finding suggests that the peculiar\nchemical composition of some cluster stars may be related to effects able to\nspuriously decrease [FeI/H]. We conclude that M22 is a globular cluster with no\nevidence of intrinsic iron spread, ruling out that it has retained the\nsupernovae ejecta in its gravitational potential well. \n\n"}

We aim at\ndeveloping an efficient software package for the analysis of medium- to\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of single stars and those in binary systems. The\nmajor requirements are that the code has a high performance, represents the\nstate-of-the-art analysis tool, and provides accurate determinations of\natmospheric parameters and chemical compositions for different types of stars.\nWe use the method of atmosphere models and spectrum synthesis, which is one of\nthe most commonly used approaches for the analysis of stellar spectra. Our Grid\nSearch in Stellar Parameters (GSSP) code makes use of the OpenMPI\nimplementation, which makes it possible to run in parallel mode. The method is\nfirst tested on the simulated data and is then applied to the spectra of real\nstellar objects. The majority of test runs on the simulated data were\nsuccessful in the sense that we could recover the initially assumed sets of\natmospheric parameters.

We focus on the cluster NGC 1856, showing a splitting in the upper\npart of the main sequence, well visible in the color m_{F336W}-m_{F555W}$, and\na very wide turnoff region. Using population synthesis available from the\nGeneva stellar models, we show that the cluster data can be interpreted as\nsuperposition of two main populations having the same age (~350Myr), composed\nfor 2/3 of very rapidly rotating stars, defining the upper turnoff region and\nthe redder main sequence, and for 1/3 of slowly/non-rotating stars. Since rapid\nrotation is a common property of the B-A type stars, the main question raised\nby this model concerns the origin of the slowly/non-rotating component. Binary\nsynchronization is a possible process behind the slowly/non-rotating\npopulation; in this case, many slowly/non-rotating stars should still be part\nof binary systems with orbital periods in the range from 4 to 500 days.

Whether initially\nweak magnetic fields can be amplified by this instability to dynamically\nrelevant strengths is still a matter of debate. One of the main uncertainties\nconcerns the process that terminates the growth of the instability. Parasitic\ninstabilities of both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing-mode type have been\nsuggested to play a crucial role in this process, disrupting MRI channel flows\nand quenching magnetic field amplification. We perform two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional sheering-disc simulations of a differentially rotating\nprotoneutron star layer in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics with unprecedented\nhigh numerical accuracy, finding that Kelvin-Helmholtz parasitic modes dominate\ntearing modes in the regime of large hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers, as encountered close to the surface of protoneutron stars.

The impact of the SN blast wave on the companion is followed by\nmeans of 3D SPH simulations using the Stellar GADGET code. For main-sequence\n(MS) companions, we find that the amount of removed mass, impact velocity, and\nchemical contamination of the companion that results from the impact of the SN\nejecta, strongly increases with decreasing binary separation and increasing\nexplosion energy. Their relationship can be approximately fitted by power laws,\nwhich is consistent with the results obtained from impact simulations of\nSNe~Ia.

The first concept is phenomenological and stipulates that the\nmagnetosphere undergoes periodic switching between two meta-stable states as\nfirst suggested by Lyne et al. The second concept, precession, was first\nconsidered as a candidate for the modulation of B1828-11 by Stairs et al..

We used\nthe detailed comparison between chemical abundances derived from neutral and\nfrom ionized spectral lines as a powerful stellar \"weighing device\" to measure\nstellar mass and to identify an evolved BSS in 47 Tucanae. In particular,\nhigh-resolution spectra of three bright stars located slightly above the level\nof the \"canonical\" horizontal branch sequence in the color-magnitude diagram of\n47 Tucanae, have been obtained with UVES spectrograph. The measurements of iron\nand titanium abundances performed separately from neutral and ionized lines\nreveal that two targets have stellar parameters fully consistent with those\nexpected for low-mass post-horizontal branch objects, while for the other\ntarget the elemental ionization balance is obtained only by assuming a mass of\n~1.4Msol, which is significantly larger than the main sequence turn-off mass of\nthe cluster (~0.85 Msol). The comparison with theoretical stellar tracks\nsuggests that this is a BSS descendant possibly experiencing its core\nhelium-burning phase. The large applicability of the proposed method to most of\nthe globular clusters in our Galaxy opens the possibility to initiate\nsystematic searches for evolved BSSs, thus giving access to still unexplored\nphases of their evolution. \n\n"}

In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation.

By\nsimply comparing electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission timescales, we\nconstrain upper limits to the ellipticity of magnetars by assuming that they\npower the observed SLSNe. We find that their ellipticity typically needs to be\nless than about a few 1e-3. This indicates that the toroidal magnetic field\nstrengths in these magnetars are typically less than a few 1e16 G so that their\ndistortions remain small. Because light-curve modelling of SLSNe shows that\ntheir dipole magnetic field strengths are of the order of 1e14 G, the ratio of\npoloidal to toroidal magnetic field strengths is found to be larger than ~ 0.01\nin magnetars powering SLSNe. \n\n"}

Results from\n  the CALYPSO IRAM-PdBI survey Abstract: Context. \"Snow lines\", marking regions where abundant volatiles freeze out\nonto the surface of dust grains, play an important role for planet growth and\nbulk composition in protoplanetary disks. They can already be observed in the\nenvelopes of the much younger, low-mass Class 0 protostars that are still in\ntheir early phase of heavy accretion. Aims. We aim at using the information on\nthe sublimation regions of different kinds of ices to understand the chemistry\nof the envelope, its temperature and density structure, and the history of the\naccretion process. Methods. As part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program, we have\nobtained observations of C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$ and CH$_3$OH towards nearby\nClass 0 protostars with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer at\nsub-arcsecond resolution. For four of these sources we have modeled the\nemission using a chemical code coupled with a radiative transfer module.\nResults. We observe an anti-correlation of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ in NGC\n1333-IRAS4A, NGC 1333-IRAS4B, L1157, and L1448C, with N$_2$H$^+$ forming a ring\naround the centrally peaked C$^{18}$O emission due to N$_2$H$^+$ being\nchemically destroyed by CO. The emission regions of models and observations\nmatch for a CO binding energy of 1200 K, which is higher than the binding\nenergy of pure CO ices ($\\sim$855 K). Furthermore, we find very low CO\nabundances inside the snow lines in our sources, about an order of magnitude\nlower than the total CO abundance observed in the gas on large scales in\nmolecular clouds before depletion sets in. Conclusions. The high CO binding\nenergy may hint at CO being frozen out in a polar ice environment like\namorphous water ice or in non-polar CO$_2$-rich ice. The low CO abundances are\ncomparable to values found in protoplanetary disks, which may indicate an\nevolutionary scenario where these low values are already established in the\nprotostellar phase.

While rotational mixing\nsignificantly affects the evolution of Cepheid progenitors (intermediate-mass\nstars), the impact of the resulting changes in stellar structure and\ncomposition on Cepheids on their pulsational properties is hitherto unknown.\nHere we present the first detailed pulsational instability analysis of stellar\nevolution models that include the effects of rotation, for both fundamental\nmode and first overtone pulsation. We employ Geneva evolution models spanning a\nthree-dimensional grid in mass (1.7 - 15 $M_\\odot$), metallicity (Z = 0.014,\n0.006, 0.002), and rotation (non-rotating, average & fast rotation). We\ndetermine (1) hot and cool instability strip (IS) boundaries taking into\naccount the coupling between convection and pulsation, (2) pulsation periods,\nand (3) rates of period change. We investigate relations between period and (a)\nluminosity, (b) age, (c) radius, (d) temperature, (e) rate of period change,\n(f) mass, (g) the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relation (FWGLR). We\nconfront all predictions aside from those for age with observations, finding\ngenerally excellent agreement. We tabulate period-luminosity relations (PLRs)\nfor several photometric pass-bands and investigate how the finite IS width,\ndifferent IS crossings, metallicity, and rotation affect PLRs. We show that a\nWesenheit index based on H, V, and I photometry is expected to have the\nsmallest intrinsic PLR dispersion. We confirm that rotation resolves the\nCepheid mass discrepancy. Period-age relations depend significantly on rotation\n(rotation increases Cepheid ages), offering a straightforward explanation for\nevolved stars in binary systems that cannot be matched by conventional\nisochrones assuming a single age.

It is far\nfrom getting a clear answer. This paper studies the effects of three above\ncauses on the CMDs of star clusters systematically. A rapid stellar\nevolutionary code and a recently published database of rotational effects of\nsingle stars have been used, via an advanced stellar population synthesis\ntechnique. As a result, we find a consistent result for rotation to recent\nworks, which suggests that rotation is able to explain, at least partially, the\neMSTOs of clusters, if clusters are not too old ($<$ 2.0\\,Gyr). In addition, an\nage spread of 200 to 500\\,Myr reproduces extended turn-offs for all clusters\nyounger than 2.5\\,Gyr, in particular, for those younger than 2.2\\,Gyr.

{"id": "1605.07741", "contents": "Title: Stellar rotation effects in polarimetric microlensing Abstract: It is well known that the polarization signal in microlensing events of hot\nstars is larger than that of main-sequence stars. Most hot stars rapidly rotate\naround their stellar axes. The stellar rotation makes ellipticity and\ngravity-darkening effects which break the spherical symmetry of the source\nshape and the circular symmetry of the source surface brightness respectively.\nHence, it causes a net polarization signal for the source star. This\npolarization signal should be considered in polarimetry microlensing of fast\nrotating stars. For moderate rotating stars, lensing can magnify or even\ncharacterize small polarization signals due to the stellar rotation through\npolarimetry observations. The gravity-darkening effect due to a rotating source\nstar makes asymmetric perturbations in polarimetry and photometry microlensing\ncurves whose maximum happens when the lens trajectory crosses the projected\nposition of the rotation pole on the sky plane. The stellar ellipticity makes a\ntime shift (i) in the position of the second peak of the polarimetry curves in\ntransit microlensing events and (ii) in the peak position of the polarimetry\ncurves with respect to the photometry peak position in bypass microlensing\nevents. By measuring this time shift via polarimetry observations of\nmicrolensing events, we can evaluate the ellipticity of the projected source\nsurface on the sky plane. Given the characterizations of the FOcal Reducer and\nlow dispersion Spectrograph (FORS2) polarimeter at Very Large Telescope (VLT)\ntelescope, the probability of observing this time shift is so small.

In particular, our\nresults show that the emergence and evolution of active regions are accompanied\nby multi-scale flow patterns, and that the meridional flows display the\nNorth-South asymmetry closely correlating with the magnetic activity. The\nlatitudinal variations of the meridional circulation speed, which are probably\nrelated to the large-scale converging flows, are mostly confined in shallow\nsubsurface layers.

By targeting stars in a coeval cluster we can study\nthe mass-loss rate evolution whilst keeping the variables of mass and\nmetallicity fixed. Mass-loss rates were determined by fitting DUSTY models to\nmid-IR photometry from WISE and Spitzer/IRAC. We find that the \\mdot\\ in red\nsupergiants increases as the star evolves, and is well described by \\mdot\\\nprescription of de Jager, used widely in stellar evolution calculations.

To this end, we compute\nself-consistent, semi-analytic models of putative self-gravitating discs for\nfive candidate disc systems. Our aim is not to fit exactly the observations,\nbut to demonstrate that the expected dust continuum emission from marginally\nunstable self-gravitating discs can be quite weak, due to high optical depth at\nthe midplane even at millimetre wavelengths.

We describe each outcome as a series of discrete\ntransformations in energy space, using the diagrams first presented in Leigh \\&\nGeller (2012; see the Appendix). Furthermore, we develop a formalism for\ncalculating probabilities for these outcomes to occur, expressed using the\ndensity of escape configurations per unit energy, and based on the Monaghan\ndescription originally developed for the three-body problem. We compare this\nanalytic formalism to results from a series of binary-binary encounters with\nidentical point particles, simulated using the \\texttt{FEWBODY} code. Each of\nour three encounter outcomes produces a unique velocity distribution for the\nescaping star(s). Thus, these distributions can potentially be used to\nconstrain the origins of dynamically-formed populations, via a direct\ncomparison between the predicted and observed velocity distributions.

We utilize observations at X-ray,\nUV, optical, and radio wavelengths to infer the properties of two large flares.\nThe X-ray spectrum of the primary outburst can be described over the 0.3-100\nkeV bandpass by either a single very high temperature plasma or a nonthermal\nthick-target bremsstrahlung model, and we rule out the nonthermal model based\non energetic grounds.

Different simulations predict\ndifferent initial mass functions of the first stars, ranging from predominantly\nlow mass (0.1-10 Msol), to massive (10-100 Msol), or even supermassive\n(100-1000 Msol). The mass distribution of the first stars should lead to unique\nchemical imprints on the low-mass second and later generation metal-poor stars\nstill in existence. The chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708, which has the\nlowest abundances of Ca and Fe of any star known, indicates it was enriched by\na single massive supernova. However, even weak spectral lines may be affected\nby strong 3D and NLTE effects in metal-poor stars. If these effects are ignored\nor treated incorrectly, errors in the inferred abundances may significantly\nbias the inferred properties of the polluting supernovae. We redetermine the\nchemical composition of SMSS0313-6708 using 3D NLTE radiative transfer to\nobtain accurate abundances for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca and Fe. The model atoms\nemploy realistic collisional rates, with no calibrated free parameters. We find\nsignificantly higher abundances in 3D NLTE than 1D LTE by 0.8 dex for Fe, and\n0.5 dex for Mg, Al and Ca, while Li and Na are unaffected to within 0.03 dex.\nIn particular, our upper limit for [Fe/H] is now a factor ten larger, at [Fe/H]\n< -6.53 (3 sigma), than previous estimates based on <3D> NLTE (i.e. using\naveraged 3D models). This higher estimate is due to a conservative upper limit\nestimation, updated NLTE data, and 3D-<3D> NLTE differences, all of which lead\nto a higher abundance determination.

Then, the ejecta from AIC collide to the dense circumstellar\nmedium, making a strong shock. The strong shock can produce synchrotron\nemission which can be observed in radio frequencies. Even if AIC occurs as a\nresult of white dwarf mergers, we argue that AIC may cause fast radio bursts if\na certain condition is satisfied. If AIC forms neutron stars which are so\nmassive that rotation is required to support themselves (i.e., supramassive\nneutron stars), the supramassive neutron stars may immediately lose their\nrotational energy by the r-mode instability and collapse to black holes.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk.

In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone.

Using this\nresult, we compare observed and predicted color distributions of SN Ia hosts\nfor the MENeaCS cluster supernova survey, and for the SDSS Stripe 82 supernova\nsurvey.

Abstract: The search for dark matter (DM) is one of the most active and challenging\nareas of current research. Possible DM candidates are ultralight fields such as\naxions and weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Axions piled up in the\ncenter of stars are supposed to generate matter/DM configurations with\noscillating geometries at a very rapid frequency, which is a multiple of the\naxion mass $m_B$ [1,2]. Borra and Trottier recently found peculiar ultrafast\nperiodic spectral modulations in $236$ main sequence stars in the sample of\n$2.5$ million spectra of galactic halo stars of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nthat were interpreted as optical signals from extraterrestrial civilizations,\npossible candidates for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)\nprogram [3].

We re-assess the potential of asteroseismology for probing the chemical\nstratification in white dwarf cores, in light of new highly efficient tools\nrecently developed for that purpose.\n  Methods. Using the forward modeling approach and a new parameterization for\nthe core chemical stratification in ZZ Ceti stars, we test several situations\ntypical of the usually limited constraints available, such as small numbers of\nobserved independent modes, to carry out asteroseismology of these stars.\n  Results. We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical\nstratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions\nexpected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the\nsignificant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping)\neffects.

Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our\nSpitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted\nplanets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them.

No quantitative limits have previously been set for CasA and the\nCrab, while for SN1987A we merely updated existing limits in view of new\nestimates of the dust content.

In a passively evolving binary model (meaning no binary\ninteractions), with a flat mass ratio distribution and a Salpeter IMF, the\nresulting 90% confidence upper limit on the initial binary fraction of F<63% is\nin considerable tension with observed massive binary statistics.

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1.

Dust scattering was\nrecently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its\nbasic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the\neffects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined\ndisks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate\nsemi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer\nequation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling.

We particularly investigate star formation\nfrom gas chemically contaminated by SNe and AGB stars within MCs with different\ninitial conditions and environments. The principal results are as follows. GCs\nwith multiple generation of stars can be formed from merging of hierarchical\nstar cluster complexes that are developed from high-density regions of fractal\nMCs. Feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars can control the formation\nefficiencies of stars formed from original gas of MCs and from gas ejected from\nAGB stars.

The original MC masses need to be as large as 10^7 Msun for a\ncanonical initial stellar mass function (IMF) so that the final masses of stars\nformed from AGB ejecta can be 10^5 Msun.

This depression is much greater than that\nexpected from the neglect of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, in\nparticular the dominant effect of overionisation. Here we attempt to reproduce\nthe apparent Fe discrepancy, and investigate differences in reported sodium\nabundances. We compare in detail the methods and results of the recent study\nwith those of an earlier study of NGC 6752 AGB stars. Iron and sodium\nabundances are derived using Fe I, Fe II, and Na I lines. Various uncertainties\nare explored. We reproduce the large Fe I depression found by the recent study,\nusing different observational data and computational tools. Further\ninvestigation shows that the degree of the apparent Fe I depression is strongly\ndependent on the adopted stellar effective temperature. To minimise\nuncertainties in Fe I we derive temperatures for each star individually using\nthe infrared flux method (IRFM). We find that the $T_{\\rm{eff}}$ scales used by\nboth the previous studies are cooler, by up to 100 K; such underestimated\ntemperatures amplify the apparent Fe I depression.

We use a set of\nhydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in\ncollapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host\nprotostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without\nradiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic\nfeedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface\ndensity and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas\nfrom the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of\nspiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative\nfeedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is\nepisodic. We also investigate whether mass estimates from position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams are accurate for early-phase discs. We find that the protostellar\nsystem mass (i.e. the mass of the protostar and its disc) is underestimated by\nup to 20%, due to the impact of an enhanced radial pressure gradient on the\ngas. The mass of early-phase discs is a significant fraction of the mass of the\nprotostar, so position-velocity diagrams cannot accurately provide the mass of\nthe protostar alone.

Parker's\nconjecture that spontaneous current singularities lead to nanoflares that heat\nthe corona has been controversial. In ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), can\ngenuine current singularities emerge from a smooth 3D line-tied magnetic field?\nTo numerically resolve this issue, the schemes employed must preserve magnetic\ntopology exactly to avoid artificial reconnection in the presence of singular\ncurrent densities. Structure-preserving numerical methods are favorable for\nmitigating numerical dissipation, and variational integration is a powerful\nmachinery for deriving them. In this thesis, we develop variational integrators\nfor ideal MHD in Lagrangian labeling by discretizing Newcomb's Lagrangian on a\nmoving mesh using discretized exterior calculus. With the built-in frozen-in\nequation, the schemes are free of artificial reconnection, hence optimal for\nstudying current singularity formation.\n  Using this method, we first study a fundamental prototype problem in 2D, the\nHahm-Kulsrud-Taylor (HKT) problem. It considers the effect of boundary\nperturbations on a 2D plasma magnetized by a sheared field, and its linear\nsolution is singular. We find that with increasing resolution, the nonlinear\nsolution converges to one with a current singularity. We then extend the HKT\nproblem to 3D line-tied geometry, which models the solar corona by anchoring\nthe field lines in the boundaries. The linear solution, which is singular in\n2D, is found to be smooth. The nonlinear solution turns out smooth for short\nsystems. Nonetheless, the scaling of peak current density vs. system length\nsuggests that the nonlinear solution may become singular at a finite length.\nWith the results in hand, we cannot confirm or rule out this possibility\nconclusively, since we cannot obtain solutions with system lengths near the\nextrapolated critical value. \n\n"}

Assuming a velocity profile which prescribes a\nflat or flared emitting surface in Keplerian rotation, we uncover significant\nresiduals with a peak of $\\approx7\\delta v$, where $\\delta v = 0.21$ km\ns$^{-1}$ is the width of a spectral resolution element. The residuals reveal\nthe possible presence of a severely warped and twisted inner disk extending to\nat most 100au. Adapting the model to include a misaligned inner gas disk with\n(i) an inclination almost edge-on to the line of sight, and (ii) a position\nangle almost orthogonal to that of the outer disk reduces the residuals to $<\n3\\delta v$. However, these findings are contrasted by recent VLT/SPHERE,\nMagAO/GPI, and VLTI/PIONIER observations of HD100546 that show no evidence of a\nseverely misaligned inner dust disk down to spatial scales of $\\sim 1$au. An\nalternative explanation for the observed kinematics are fast radial flows\nmediated by (proto)planets.

However, for massive data sizes,\nlike those anticipated from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), it will be\ndifficult if not impossible to apply any MCMC technique due to its inherent\ncomputational cost. We formulate Bayesian inference problems with\nsparsity-promoting priors (motivated by compressive sensing), for which we\nrecover maximum a posteriori (MAP) point estimators of radio interferometric\nimages by convex optimisation.

Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising\nsources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger\nresults because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this\nwork, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the\nsources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear\ncomposition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the\nnuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the\nmass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the\nconnection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider\nthe hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR\nnuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is\neasier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically\npropagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models\nand compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results\nshow that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the\nAuger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in\nfitting the spectrum.

Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a\nmeasurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest\nspectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but\nare manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen.

Recent observations of the massive young stellar object S255 NIRS 3\nhave revealed a large increase in both methanol maser flux density and IR\nemission, which have been interpreted as the result of an accretion outburst,\npossibly due to instabilities in a circumstellar disk. This indicates that this\ntype of accretion event could be common in young/forming early-type stars and\nin their lower mass siblings, and supports the idea that accretion onto the\nstar may occur in a non-continuous way. Aims. As accretion and ejection are\nbelieved to be tightly associated phenomena, we wanted to confirm the accretion\ninterpretation of the outburst in S255 NIRS 3 by detecting the corresponding\nburst of the associated thermal jet. Methods. We monitored the radio continuum\nemission from S255 NIRS 3 at four bands using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray. The millimetre continuum emission was also observed with both the\nNorthern Extended Millimeter Array of IRAM and the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array. Results. We have detected an exponential\nincrease in the radio flux density from 6 to 45 GHz starting right after July\n10, 2016, namely about 13 months after the estimated onset of the IR outburst.\nThis is the first ever detection of a radio burst associated with an IR\naccretion outburst from a young stellar object. The flux density at all\nobserved centimetre bands can be reproduced with a simple expanding jet model.\nAt millimetre wavelengths we infer a marginal flux increase with respect to the\nliterature values and we show this is due to free-free emission from the radio\njet.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis.

At\nsolar metallicity, launching of magneto-centrifugally-driven outflows is the\ndominant feedback process to set SFEs, while radiation pressure, which has been\nregarded to be pivotal, has only minor contribution even in the formation of\nover-100Msun stars. Photoevaporation becomes significant in over-20Msun star\nformation at low metallicities of <1e-2Zsun, where dust absorption of ionizing\nphotons is inefficient. We conclude that if initial prestellar core properties\nare similar, then massive stars are rarer in extremely metal-poor environments\nof 1e-5 - 1e-3Zsun. Our results give new insight into the high-mass end of the\ninitial mass function and its potential variation with galactic and\ncosmological environments. \n\n"}

In this paper, we investigate the\nhypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead\nemission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model\ncombined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion\nrates ($\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large\ndust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from\nhot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO\nemission with respect to the continuum. On the other hand, low accretion rates\n($\\lesssim10^{-6}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in smaller dust\nsublimation radii, a correspondingly smaller emitting area of CO, and thus also\nlower CO emission with respect to the continuum. In general, moderate accretion\nrates produce the most prominent, and therefore detectable, CO first overtone\nemission. We compare our findings to a recent near-infrared spectroscopic\nsurvey of MYSOs, finding results consistent with our hypothesis. We conclude\nthat the detection rate of CO bandhead emission in the spectra of MYSOs could\nbe the result of MYSOs exhibiting a range of mass accretion rates, perhaps due\nto the variable accretion suggested by recent multi-epoch observations of these\nobjects. \n\n"}

We have observed 11 massive, dense and young star-forming clumps with\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in the thermal dust continuum\nemission at $\\sim 1$~mm with an angular resolution of 0.25 arcseconds with the\naim of determining their population of fragments. We find fragments on\nsub-arcsecond scales in 8 out of the 11 sources. The ALMA images indicate two\ndifferent fragmentation modes: a dominant fragment surrounded by companions\nwith much smaller mass and size, and many ($\\geq 8$) fragments with a gradual\nchange in masses and sizes. On average, the largest number of fragments is\nfound towards the warmer and more massive clumps. Also, the warmer clumps tend\nto form fragments with larger mass and size.

This dust ring was previously\nidentified as a large disk in lower-resolution observations. We detect highly\nstructured dust polarization toward the inner disks and the extended ring with\ntypical polarization fractions ~ 1.7% and ~ 2.4%, respectively. The two\ncomponents also show distinct polarization morphologies. The inner disks have\nuniform polarization angles aligned with their minor axes. This morphology is\nconsistent with expectations from dust scattering. By contrast, the extended\ndust ring has an azimuthal polarization morphology not previously seen in\nlower-resolution observations. We find that our observations are well fit by a\nstatic, oblate spheroid model with a flux-frozen, poloidal magnetic field. We\npropose that the polarization traces magnetic grain alignment likely from flux\nfreezing on large scales and magnetic diffusion on small scales. Alternatively,\nthe azimuthal polarization may be attributed to grain alignment by the\nanisotropic radiation field.

Abstract: Investigating the chemical homogeneity of stars born from the same molecular\ncloud at virtually the same time is very important for our understanding of the\nchemical enrichment of the interstellar medium and with it the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy. One major cause of inhomogeneities in the abundances\nof open clusters is stellar evolution of the cluster members. In this work, we\ninvestigate variations in the surface chemical composition of member stars of\nthe old open cluster M67 as a possible consequence of atomic diffusion effects\ntaking place during the main-sequence phase. The abundances used are obtained\nfrom high-resolution UVES/FLAMES spectra within the framework of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey. We find that the surface abundances of stars on the main sequence\ndecrease with increasing mass reaching a minimum at the turn-off. After\ndeepening of the convective envelope in sub-giant branch stars, the initial\nsurface abundances are restored. We found the measured abundances to be\nconsistent with the predictions of stellar evolutionary models for a cluster\nwith the age and metallicity of M67.

This paper describes the\nvalidation and properties of the median radial velocities published in GDR2.\nQuality tests and filters are applied to select, from the 9.8 million radial\nvelocities, those with the quality to be published in GDR2. The accuracy of the\nselected sample is assessed with respect to ground-based catalogues. Its\nprecision is estimated using both ground-based catalogues and the distribution\nof the Gaia radial velocity uncertainties. GDR2 contains median radial\nvelocities for 7 224 631 stars, with Teff in the range [3550, 6900] K, which\npassed succesfully the quality tests. The published median radial velocities\nprovide a full sky-coverage and have a completness with respect to the\nastrometric data of 77.2\\% (for $G \\leq 12.5$ mag). The median radial velocity\nresiduals with respect to the ground-based surveys vary from one catalogue to\nanother, but do not exceed a few 100s m/s. In addition, the Gaia radial\nvelocities show a positive trend as a function of magnitude, which starts\naround Grvs $\\sim 9$ mag and reaches about $+500$ m/s at Grvs $= 11.75$ mag.\nThe overall precision, estimated from the median of the Gaia radial velocity\nuncertainties, is 1.05 km/s. The radial velocity precision is function of many\nparameters, in particular the magnitude and effective temperature.

Environmental\n  effects on core formation Abstract: Based on the 850 $\\mu$m dust continuum data from SCUBA-2 at James Clerk\nMaxwell Telescope (JCMT), we compare overall properties of Planck Galactic Cold\nClumps (PGCCs) in the $\\lambda$ Orionis cloud to those of PGCCs in the Orion A\nand B clouds. The Orion A and B clouds are well known active star-forming\nregions, while the $\\lambda$ Orionis cloud has a different environment as a\nconsequence of the interaction with a prominent OB association and a giant Hii\nregion. PGCCs in the $\\lambda$ Orionis cloud have higher dust temperatures\n($Td=16.13\\pm0.15$ K) and lower values of dust emissivity spectral index ($\n\\beta=1.65\\pm0.02$) than PGCCs in the Orion A (Td=13.79$\\pm 0.21$K,\n$\\beta=2.07\\pm0.03$) and Orion B ($Td=13.82\\pm0.19$K, $\\beta=1.96\\pm0.02$)\nclouds.

Of total 119 cores, 15 cores are discovered in the $\\lambda$\nOrionis cloud, while 74 and 30 cores are found in the Orion A and B clouds,\nrespectively.

Precise parallaxes have revealed unprecedented substructure in the white\ndwarf (WD) cooling sequence on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Some of this\nsubstructure stems from the diversity of WD atmospheric compositions, but the\nCMD remains bimodal even when only spectroscopically-confirmed DA WDs are\nconsidered. We develop a generative model to predict the CMD for DA WDs as a\nfunction of the initial mass function (IMF), stellar age distribution, and a\nflexibly parameterized IFMR.

We compiled a list of 85 mid-IR transients of uncertain\nnature detected by the Spitzer Infrared Intensive Transients Survey and\nsearched for their associations with X-ray, optical, and UV sources.

One way to map such chemical\nvariations using high-precision photometry is to employ a suitable combination\nof stellar magnitudes in the F275W, F336W, F438W, and F814W filters (the so\ncalled \"chromosome map\"), to maximise the separation between the different\nmultiple populations. For each individual cluster its chromosome map separates\nthe so-called first population -with metal abundance patterns typical of field\nhalo stars- from the second population, that displays distinctive abundance\nvariations among a specific group of light-elements. Surprisingly, the\ndistribution of first population stars in chromosome maps of several -but not\nall- clusters has been found to be more extended than expected from purely\nobservational errors, suggesting a chemically inhomogeneous origin. We consider\nhere three clusters with similar metallicity ([Fe/H]~-1.3) and different\nchromosome maps, namely NGC 288, M 3 and NGC 2808, and argue that the first\npopulation extended distribution (as observed in two of these clusters) is due\nto spreads of the initial helium abundance and possibly a small range of\nnitrogen abundances as well. The presence of a range of initial He and N\nabundances amongst stars traditionally thought to have homogeneous composition,\nplus the fact that these spreads appear only in some clusters, challenge the\nscenarios put forward so far to explain the multiple population phenomenon. \n\n"}

Methods: We performed\nspectrographic observations of V902 Mon in 2016 with the 2.2m Calar Alto\ntelescope, and X-ray photometry and spectroscopy with XMM-Newton in October\n2017. This data was supplemented by several years of AAVSO visual photometry.\nResults: We have confirmed V902 Mon as an IP based on detecting the spin\nperiod, with a value of 2,208s, at multiple epochs. Spectroscopy of the donor\nstar and Gaia parallax yield a distance of 3.5+1.3-0.9, kpc, suggesting an\nX-ray luminosity one or two orders of magnitude lower than the 10^33 erg/s\ntypical of previously known IPs. The X-ray to optical flux ratio is also very\nlow. The inclination of the system is more than 79deg, with a most likely value\nof around 82deg. We have refined the eclipse ephemeris, stable over 14,000\ncycles. The Halpha line is present throughout the orbital cycle and is clearly\npresent during eclipse, suggesting an origin distant from the white dwarf, and\nshows radial velocity variations at the orbital period. The amplitude and\noverall recessional velocity seem inconsistent with an origin in the disc. The\n\\emph{XMM-Newton} observation reveals a partially absorbed plasma model typical\nof magnetic CVs, with a fluorescent iron line at 6.4keV showing a large\nequivalent width of 1.4keV. Conclusions: V902 Mon is an IP, and probably a\nmember of the hypothesized X-ray underluminous class of IPs. It is likely to be\na disc accretor, though the radial velocity behaviour of the Halpha line\nremains puzzling. The large equivalent width of the fluorescent iron line, the\nsmall FX/Fopt ratio, and the only marginal detection of X-ray eclipses suggests\nthat the X-ray emission arises from scattering. \n\n"}

Here we investigate SU Lyncis, a recently\ndiscovered example of a purely accretion-powered symbiotic star, using the\nfirst reliable X-ray spectroscopy, obtained with NuSTAR, and UV photometry\nobtained with Swift. SU Lyn has hard, thermal, X-ray emission that is strongly\naffected by a variable local absorber - that has little impact on the UV\nemission. Its X-ray spectrum is described well using a plasma cooling from $k$T\n$\\approx$ 21 keV, with a 3 to 30 keV luminosity of approximately\n4.9$\\times$10$^{32}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.

Possible ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE)\nor dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are\nextreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound from the Galaxy. Powerful\nacceleration mechanisms such as the tidal disruption of a binary system by a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) are required to produce them. Therefore, HVSs\nare believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC), the only place known to\nhost an SMBH. The second Gaia data release (DR2) offers the opportunity of\nstudying HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit some of the most\ninteresting high-velocity stars, that is, 15 stars for which proper motions\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel\ntheir origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses based on revised\nspectrophotometric distances and proper motions from Gaia DR2, kinematic\nproperties were obtained that help constrain the spatial origins of these\nstars. Stars that were previously considered (un)bound remain (un)bound in\nGalactic potentials favored by Gaia DR2 astrometry. For nine stars (five\ncandidate HVSs plus all four radial velocity outliers), the GC can be ruled out\nas spatial origin at least at $2\\sigma$ confidence level, suggesting that a\nlarge portion of the known HVSs are disk runaway stars launched close to or\nbeyond Galactic escape velocities. The fastest star in the sample, HVS3, is\nconfirmed to originate in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Because the ejection\nvelocities of five of our non-GC stars are close to or above the upper limits\npredicted for BSE and DE, another powerful dynamical ejection mechanism (e.g.,\ninvolving massive perturbers such as intermediate-mass black holes) is likely\nto operate in addition to the three classical scenarios mentioned above. \n\n"}

Furthermore,\nstellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and\nevolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters,\nranging from ages of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations\ncan be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers,\ncertain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening.

We show that there are at least two YSOs\nhere, and that the outflow is most likely to be from a deeply embedded source\ndetected in our infrared imaging. Using multi-wavelength observations, we study\nthe outflow and the embedded source and derive their properties. We conclude\nthat IRAS~18144 hosts an isolated cloud, in which at least two massive YSOs are\nbeing born. From our sub-mm observations, we derive the mass of the cloud and\nthe core hosting the YSOs. \n\n"}

Even\nthough Gaia DR2 photometry is very precise, there are currently three\nalternative definitions of the sensitivity curves that show significative\ndifferences. AIMS: The aim of this paper is to improve the quality of the input\ncalibration data to produce new compatible definitions of the three bands and\nto identify the reasons for the discrepancies between previous definitions.\nMETHODS: We have searched the HST archive for STIS spectra with G430L+G750L\ndata obtained with wide apertures and combined them with the CALSPEC library to\nproduce a high quality SED library of 122 stars with a broad range of colors,\nincluding three very red stars. We have used it to compute new sensitivity\ncurves for G, BP, and RP using a functional analytical formalism. RESULTS: The\nnew curves are significantly better than the two previous attempts, REV and\nWEI. For G we confirm the existence of a systematic bias in magnitude and\ncorrect a color term present in REV. For BP we confirm the need to define two\nmagnitude ranges with different sensitivity curves and measure the cut between\nthem at G = 10.87 with a significant increase in precision. The new curves also\nfit the data better than either REV or WEI. For RP we obtain a sensitivity\ncurve that better fits the STIS spectra and we find that the differences with\nprevious attempts reside in a systematic effect between ground-based and HST\nspectral libraries. Additional evidence from color-color diagrams indicate that\nthe new sensitivity curve is more accurate. Nevertheless, there is still room\nfor improvement in the accuracy of the sensitivity curves because of the\ncurrent dearth of good-quality red calibrators: adding more to the sample\nshould be a priority before Gaia data release 3 takes place. \n\n"}

This\ndrop in wind velocity is much steeper than would be expected from the drop in\nescape speed for cooler stars. The results may be particularly relevant for\nslow winds inferred for some High-Mass X-ray binaries. Second, the strength of\nthe mass-loss bi-stability jump is found to be significantly larger than\npreviously assumed. Not only could this make bi-stability braking more\nefficient in massive star evolution, but a rotationally-induced version of the\nbi-stability mechanism may now be capable of producing the correct density of\noutflowing disks around B[e] supergiants, although multi-dimensional modelling\nincluding the disk velocity structure is still needed.

In SPB stars, the period spacing periodically varies with periods.\nIt has regarded as a signature of the chemical composition gradient beyond the\nconvective core.

Abstract: A large fraction of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BHLMXBs) are in short\nperiod orbits, which require strong orbital angular momentum loss during the\nprevious evolutionary stage. Ivanova (2006) put forward the possibility that\nsome of the BHLMXBs may harbour pre-main-sequence (MS) donor stars, in order to\nexplain the Li-overabundances in three BHLMXBs. In this work we investigate the\nevolution of low-mass pre-MS stars in binaries with a BH companion. We\ncalculate the evolution of the spin and orbital periods, the stellar radius and\nthe Roche-lobe radius during the pre-MS stage with the stellar evolution code\nMESA. We find that, because of the relatively slow rotation of the pre-MS star\nafter the common envelope evolution and the long turnover time in the pre-MS\nstars, tidal torque is not always able to synchronize the pre-MS star, so the\nspin periods are generally longer than the orbital periods. Mass transfer can\noccur only for stars with mass larger than $\\sim 1.2M_\\odot$, which experience\nexpansion due to nuclear reaction after the Hayashi contraction phase. The\neffective temperatures and orbital periods of these systems do not match the\nobservations of BHLMXBs.

We conducted a 58-hour, ultra-wideband survey for coherent radio\nbursts on 5 active M dwarfs. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)\nto observe simultaneously in three frequency bands covering a subset of 224-482\nMHz and 1-6 GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any\nobservations of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts across 13 epochs,\nproviding the first large sample of wideband dynamic spectra of stellar\ncoherent radio bursts. The observed bursts have diverse morphology, with\ndurations ranging from seconds to hours, but all share strong (40-100%)\ncircular polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often\nassociated with CMEs), but we cannot rule out the occurrence of radio-quiet\nstellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all polarized in the sense of the\nx-mode of the star's large-scale magnetic field, suggesting they are cyclotron\nmaser emission from electrons accelerated in the large-scale field, analogous\nto auroral processes on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous coherent\nbursts peaks at 25% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining at lower and higher frequencies,\nindicating source regions in the low corona.

We aim to\ncharacterize the presence of physical companions in orbit around nearby stars.\nOrbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion (PM) of their parent star\nthrough their gravitational reflex motion. Using the Hipparcos catalog and\nGaia's second data release (GDR2), we determined the long-term PM of the stars\ncommon to these two catalogs. We then searched for a PM anomaly (PMa) between\nthe long-term PM vector and the GDR2 (or Hipparcos) measurements, indicative of\nthe presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the\n6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the\nPMa for >99% of the Hipparcos catalog (>117000 stars). 30% of the stars studied\npresent a PMa greater than 3 sigmas. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting\ncompanions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few\napplications to interesting targets. We set upper limits of 0.1-0.3 M_Jup to\npotential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (P_orb=3 to 100 years).\nWe confirm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to alpha Cen.

For example, combining a 30-minute ALMA observation (at 310 GHz\nwith an angular resolution of 0.03$^{\\prime\\prime}$) for MATISSE observations\nin the L and M bands (with visibility accuracies of about $3\\,\\%$) allows the\nradial density slope and the dust surface density profile to be constrained to\nwithin $\\Delta \\alpha=0.3$ and $\\Delta (\\alpha-\\beta)=0.15$, respectively. For\nan accuracy of ${\\sim 1\\%}$ even the disc flaring can be constrained to within\n$\\Delta \\beta=0.1$. To constrain the scale height to within $5\\,$au, M band\naccuracies of $0.8\\,\\%$ are required. While ALMA is sensitive to the number of\nlarge dust grains settled to the disc midplane we find that the impact of the\nsurface density distribution of the large grains on the observed quantities is\nsmall. \n\n"}

For the binary and higher order multiple\nsystems observed, we detect $\\lambda = 1.3$ mm continuum emission from one or\nmore stars in all of our target systems.

While millimeter\nflux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies, we\nfind that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations\nof 30 to 4200 AU have lower values of millimeter flux as a function of stellar\nmass than single stars.

KISS15s shows long-duration optical continuum and\nemission line light curves, indicating that KISS15s is powered by a continuous\ninteraction between the expanding ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM).\nThe H$\\alpha$ emission line profile can be decomposed into four Gaussians of\nnarrow, intermediate, blue-shifted intermediate, and broad velocity width\ncomponents, with a full width at half maximum of $\\lesssim 100$, $\\sim 2,000$,\nand $\\sim 14,000$ km s${}^{-1}$ for the narrow, intermediate, and broad\ncomponents, respectively. The presence of the blue-shifted intermediate\ncomponent, of which the line-of-sight velocity relative to the systemic\nvelocity is about $-5,000$ km s${}^{-1}$, suggests that the ejecta-CSM\ninteraction region has an inhomogeneous morphology and anisotropic expansion\nvelocity.

Using the data we characterize the frequency and properties of such\nbinaries. We find an ultra-wide multiplicity fraction of $4.4\\pm0.5$ per cent,\nto our completeness limit (up to $\\approx 17$~mag; down to G-stars at distances\nof 0.3-2~kpc, excluding stars in clusters). The secondary mass-function is\ngenerally consistent with a Kroupa initial stellar function; if extrapolated to\nlower mass companion stars we then might expect a wide-binary fraction of $\\sim\n27\\pm5\\%$. In addition we use these data as a verification sample to test the\nexistence of ultra-wide binaries among neutron stars (NSs) and black holes\n(BHs). We propose that the discovery of such binary can provide unique\nconstraints on the weakest natal kicks possible for NSs/BHs. If a compact\nobject is formed in an ultra-wide binary and receives a very-low natal kick,\nsuch a binary should survive as a common proper motion pair.
