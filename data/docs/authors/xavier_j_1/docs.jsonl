The secrecy level is measured\nby equivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general\n(non-degraded) broadcast channel with confidential messages. We present an\ninner bound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. The inner bound\ncoding scheme is based on a combination of random binning and the\nGelfand-Pinsker bining. This scheme matches the Marton's inner bound on the\nbroadcast channel without confidentiality constraint. We further study the\nsituation where the channels are degraded. For the degraded broadcast channel\nwith confidential messages, we present the secrecy capacity region. Our\nachievable coding scheme is based on Cover's superposition scheme and random\nbinning.

Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for\nboth dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first\nintroduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing\nprotocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an\ninfrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their\nachievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against\ntwo conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and\nhierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput\nscaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In\ncontrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network\nconditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks.\nThe gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols.\nFirst, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in\nthe MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough.\nSecond, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nreceived signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better\nthroughput scaling under extended networks.

The method is based on band-limited windowing,\nfollowed by trigonometric approximation in consecutive time intervals. The key\npoint is that the trigonometric approximation \"inherits\" the multiband\nproperty, that is, its coefficients are formed by bursts of non-zero elements\ncorresponding to the multiband components. It is shown that this method can be\nwell combined with the recently proposed synchronous multi-rate sampling (SMRS)\nscheme, given that the resulting linear system is sparse and formed by ones and\nzeroes. The proposed method allows one to trade sampling efficiency for noise\nsensitivity, and is specially well suited for bounded signals with unbounded\nenergy like those in communications, navigation, audio systems, etc. Besides,\nit is also applicable to finite energy signals and periodic band-limited\nsignals (trigonometric polynomials).

A novel paradigm, called\ncompressed neighbor discovery is proposed, which enables all nodes to\nsimultaneously discover their respective neighborhoods with a single frame of\ntransmission, which is typically of a few thousand symbol epochs. The key\ntechnique is to assign each node a unique on-off signature and let all nodes\nsimultaneously transmit their signatures. Despite that the radios are\nhalf-duplex, each node observes a superposition of its neighbors' signatures\n(partially) through its own off-slots. To identify its neighbors out of a large\nnetwork address space, each node solves a compressed sensing (or sparse\nrecovery) problem.\n  Two practical schemes are studied. The first employs random on-off\nsignatures, and each node discovers its neighbors using a noncoherent detection\nalgorithm based on group testing. The second scheme uses on-off signatures\nbased on a deterministic second-order Reed-Muller code, and applies a chirp\ndecoding algorithm. The second scheme needs much lower signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) to achieve the same error performance. The complexity of the chirp\ndecoding algorithm is sub-linear, so that it is in principle scalable to\nnetworks with billions of nodes with 48-bit IEEE 802.11 MAC addresses.

A major\nlimitation of such models to date in the context of HCNs is the neglect of\nnetwork traffic and load: all base stations (BSs) have typically been assumed\nto always be transmitting. Small cells in particular will have a lighter load\nthan macrocells, and so their contribution to the network interference may be\nsignificantly overstated in a fully loaded model. This paper incorporates a\nflexible notion of BS load by introducing a new idea of conditionally thinning\nthe interference field. For a K-tier HCN where BSs across tiers differ in terms\nof transmit power, supported data rate, deployment density, and now load, we\nderive the coverage probability for a typical mobile, which connects to the\nstrongest BS signal. Conditioned on this connection, the interfering BSs of the\n$i^{th}$ tier are assumed to transmit independently with probability $p_i$,\nwhich models the load.

The generation of a spin current is discussed by\ncalculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin\nconservation law for conduction electrons and operates the coherent magnon\nstate. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between conduction electrons and\nmagnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent\nnon-magnetic metal. The pumped spin current is proportional to the temperature\ndifference. When the effective temperature of magnons is lower than that of\nconduction electrons, localized spins lose spin angular momentum by emitting\nmagnons and conduction electrons flip from down to up by absorbing all the\nemitted momentum, and vice versa.

We show that the ortho-III\nCDW order in the chains is distinct from the CDW order in the planes.

At the Hartree-Fock level, topological phases\noriginate from an interaction-generated effective spin-orbit coupling that\nopens a gap in the band structure. For the unstrained system, there is a\nquadratic band touching at the $\\Gamma$ point at the Fermi energy for\nunpolarized electrons and Dirac points at K, K$'$ at the Fermi energy for fully\npolarized electrons. Using density functional theory we show that the quadratic\nband touching and Dirac points are remarkably stable to internal strain-induced\nout-of-plane distortions and rotations of the oxygen octahedra, which we\ncompute. The lack of a gap opening from internal strain implies a robustness to\nthe mean-field predicted topological phases for both the polarized and\nunpolarized systems.

They suffer, however, from an\ninter-carrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal processing\ntasks such as channel estimation. Most of the methods reported thus far rely on\nthe assumption of (almost) flat subchannels to more easily tackle this problem,\naddressing it in a way similar to OFDM. However, this assumption may be often\nquite inaccurate, due to the high freq. selectivity of the channel and/or the\nsmall number of subcarriers employed to cope with frequency dispersion in fast\nfading. In such cases, severe error floors are exhibited at medium to high SNR\nvalues, which cancel the advantage of FBMC over OFDM. Moreover, the existing\nmethods provide estimates of the subchannel responses, most commonly in the\nfrequency domain. The goal of this paper is to revisit this problem through an\nalternative formulation that focuses on the estimation of the channel impulse\nresponse itself and makes no assumption on the degree of frequency selectivity\nof the subchannels. The possible gains in estimation performance offered by\nsuch an approach are investigated through the design of optimal (in the MSE\nsense) preambles, of both the full and sparse types, and of the smallest\npossible duration of only one pilot FBMC symbol. Existing designs for flat\nsubchannels are then shown to result as special cases. Longer preambles,\nconsisting of two consecutive pilot FBMC symbols, are also analyzed. The\nsimulation results demonstrate significant improvements from the proposed\napproach for both mildly and highly frequency selective channels. Most notably,\nno error floors appear anymore over a quite wide range of SNR values. \n\n"}

Polar coding is based on the so-called channel polarization\nphenomenon induced by a transform over the underlying binary-input channel.

The results in the paper establish a fundamental scaling law for the\nsteady-state probabilities of miss-detection and false-alarm in the slow\nadaptation regime, when the agents interact with each other according to\ndistributed strategies that employ small constant step-sizes. The latter are\ncritical to enable continuous adaptation and learning. The work establishes\nthree key results.

In this paper, we\ndescribe an active set estimate (i.e. an estimate of the indices of the zero\nvariables in the optimal solution) for the considered problem that tries to\nquickly identify as many active variables as possible at a given point, while\nguaranteeing that some approximate optimality conditions are satisfied. A\nrelevant feature of the estimate is that it gives a significant reduction of\nthe objective function when setting to zero all those variables estimated\nactive. This enables to easily embed it into a given globally converging\nalgorithmic framework.

However,\nobtaining this information is costly in terms of bandwidth, time, and power,\nand could result in large overhead. Therefore, a critical question is how to\noptimally manage network resources in the absence of such information. To that\nend, we develop a cross-layer solution for downlink cellular systems with\nimperfect (and possibly no) CSI at the transmitter. We use rateless codes to\nresolve channel uncertainty. To keep the decoding complexity low, we explicitly\nincorporate time-average block-size constraints, and aim to maximize the system\nutility. The block-size of a rateless code is determined by both the network\ncontrol decisions and the unknown CSI of many time slots. Therefore, unlike\nstandard utility maximization problems, this problem can be viewed as a\nconstrained partial observed Markov decision problem (CPOMDP), which is known\nto be hard due to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" However, by using a modified\nLyapunov drift method, we develop a dynamic network control scheme, which\nyields a total network utility within O(1/Lav) of utility-optimal point\nachieved by infinite block-size channel codes, where Lav is the enforced value\nof the time-average block-size of rateless codes.

Each relay needs to split its received signal from sources into two\nstreams: one for information forwarding and the other for energy harvesting. We\ndevelop a distributed power splitting framework using game theory to derive a\nprofile of power splitting ratios for all relays that can achieve a good\nnetwork-wide performance. Specifically, non-cooperative games are respectively\nformulated for pure amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)\nnetworks, in which each link is modeled as a strategic player who aims to\nmaximize its own achievable rate.

Time is\nslotted and multiple users transmit packets (one packet each) simultaneously in\neach timeslot. A sink node aims to decode the messages of all the users from\nthe sequence of receptions over successive timeslots. For each timeslot, the\nNCMA receiver recovers multiple linear combinations of the packets transmitted\nin that timeslot, forming a system of linear equations. Different systems of\nlinear equations are recovered in different timeslots. A message decoder then\nrecovers the original messages of all the users by jointly solving multiple\nsystems of linear equations obtained over different timeslots. We propose a\nlow-complexity digital fountain approach for this coding problem, where each\nsource node encodes its message into a sequence of packets using a fountain\ncode. The aforementioned systems of linear equations recovered by the NCMA\nreceiver effectively couple these fountain codes together.

We show\nthat WD of $q$-ary SC-LDPC codes provides significant threshold gains compared\nto corresponding (uncoupled) $q$-ary LDPC block code (LDPC-BC) ensembles when\nthe window size $W$ is large enough and that these gains increase as the finite\nfield size $q=2^m$ increases. Moreover, we demonstrate that the new design\nrules provide WD thresholds that are close to capacity, even when both $m$ and\n$W$ are relatively small (thereby reducing decoding complexity and latency).\nThe analysis further shows that, compared to standard flooding-schedule\ndecoding, WD of $q$-ary SC-LDPC code ensembles results in significant\nreductions in both decoding complexity and decoding latency, and that these\nreductions increase as $m$ increases. For applications with a near-threshold\nperformance requirement and a constraint on decoding latency, we show that\nusing $q$-ary SC-LDPC code ensembles, with moderate $q>2$, instead of their\nbinary counterparts results in reduced decoding complexity. \n\n"}

If such a prediction is possible, we\ncorrespondingly propose a prediction in this study that the thermal radiation\nappears in the inertial frame from an electron heated by the Unruh effect in\nthe accelerating frame. The point in our prediction is, although the Unruh\neffect is only in the accelerating frame, if the appearance of the Brownian\nmotion rooted in the Unruh effect in the inertial frame can be predicted, the\nheat that the particle gets in its body by the Unruh effect in the accelerating\nframe could survive in the inertial frame.

It is proved that the inference\nperformance is a nondecreasing function of the coalition size.

To reduce the\nreliance on unsustainable energy sources, one can adopt self-powered SBSs that\nrely solely on energy harvesting.

For the\noriginal problem, we show an algorithm can solve the problem in the\nillustrative case. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, an\napproximation is proposed. To solve the approximated problem, a novel approach\nbased on the ski rental framework, a powerful online optimization tool, is\nproposed. Using this approach, each SBS can effectively decide on its ON/OFF\nschedule autonomously, without any prior information on future energy arrivals.\nBy using competitive analysis, a deterministic online algorithm (DOA) and a\nrandomized online algorithm (ROA) are developed.

Each receiver will ask for one of the $N$ files in the\nlibrary, which needs to be delivered. The objective is to design the cache\nplacement (without prior knowledge of receivers' future requests) and the\ncommunication scheme to maximize the throughput of the delivery. In this\nsetting, we show that the sum degrees-of-freedom (sum-DoF) of\n$\\min\\left\\{\\frac{K_T M_T+K_R M_R}{N},K_R\\right\\}$ is achievable, and this is\nwithin a factor of 2 of the optimum, under one-shot linear schemes. This result\nshows that (i) the one-shot sum-DoF scales linearly with the aggregate cache\nsize in the network (i.e., the cumulative memory available at all nodes), (ii)\nthe transmitters' and receivers' caches contribute equally in the one-shot\nsum-DoF, and (iii) caching can offer a throughput gain that scales linearly\nwith the size of the network.\n  To prove the result, we propose an achievable scheme that exploits the\nredundancy of the content at transmitters' caches to cooperatively zero-force\nsome outgoing interference and availability of the unintended content at\nreceivers' caches to cancel (subtract) some of the incoming interference. We\ndevelop a particular pattern for cache placement that maximizes the overall\ngains of cache-aided transmit and receive interference cancellations.

With rate-limited bi-directional\nbackhaul, transmitters have the opportunity to exchange few CSI-related bits to\nestablish global channel state information at transmitter (CSIT).

Conventionally, such design problem is studied\nunder the assumption that the packet transmission rate can be characterized by\nthe classical Shannon capacity formula, which, however, may provide inaccurate\nenergy consumption estimation, especially when the code blocklength is finite.\nIn this paper, we formulate a new energy-efficient packet scheduling problem by\nadopting a recently developed channel capacity formula for finite blocklength\ncodes.

On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel\ncauses information loss, as it makes the state information available at the\ncontroller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition\nbehavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given\nevent-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing\ninformation carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can\nbe stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical\nthreshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization\nand the required rate grows.

Due to the large\nbandwidth and inefficient amplifiers available in CMOS for mmWave, the analog\nfront-end of the receiver with a large number of antennas becomes especially\npower hungry. Two main solutions exist to reduce the power consumption: Hybrid\nBeamForming (HBF) and Digital BeamForming (DBF) with low resolution ADC. Hybrid\nbeamforming can also be combined with low resolution ADCs. This paper compares\nthe spectral and energy efficiency based on the chosen RF-frontend\nconfiguration.

Thus, a suitable channel model for Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication is\nthe Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC). Employing multiple antennas on a vehicle\nor sending over multiple frequencies to make use of diversity are promising\napproaches to combat interference. In this setup, an important question about\ndiversity is how many antennas or orthogonal carrier frequencies are necessary\nin order to avoid system breakdown due to unknown interference in AVCs. For\nBinary Symmetric AVCs (AVBSC) and a physically meaningful identical\nstate-constrained jammer, the deployment of a third, uncorrelated receiving\nantenna or the parallel transmission over three different orthogonal\nfrequencies avoids symmetrizability and thus ensures positivity of the capacity\nof the overall communication channel.

This is a \"continuous\", often called off-the-grid, extension of\nthe compressed sensing problem, where the $\\ell^1$ norm is replaced by the\ntotal variation of measures. This extension is appealing from a numerical\nperspective because it avoids to discretize the the space by some grid.

On a\nmethodological level, our contribution is to propose the Fisher geodesic\ndistance on this parameter space as the canonical metric to analyze\nsuper-resolution in a way which is invariant to reparameterization of this\nspace. Switching to the Fisher metric allows us to take into account\nmeasurement operators which are not translation invariant, which is crucial for\napplications such as Laplace inversion in imaging, Gaussian mixtures estimation\nand training of multilayer perceptrons with one hidden layer.

Our recovery approach is based on a simple convex program which\nuses the hinge loss function as data fidelity term. While such a risk\nminimization strategy is very natural to learn binary output models, such as in\nclassification, its capacity to estimate a specific signal vector is largely\nunexplored. A major difficulty is that the hinge loss is just piecewise linear,\nso that its \"curvature energy\" is concentrated in a single point. This is\nsubstantially different from other popular loss functions considered in signal\nestimation, e.g., the square or logistic loss, which are at least locally\nstrongly convex.

For decades it has been a dream to study these intricate strongly\ncoupled theories nonperturbatively using symmetries and other consistency\nconditions. This idea, called the conformal bootstrap, saw some successes in\ntwo dimensions but it is only in the last ten years that it has been fully\nrealized in three, four, and other dimensions of interest.

The\ndynamics of this emergent phase, which has no single-particle analog and exists\nonly for strong disorder and finite interaction, is determined by the many-body\nconfiguration of the initial state. Remarkably, this phase features the\n$\\textit{coexistence}$ of localized and extended many-body states at fixed\nenergy density and thus does not exhibit a many-body mobility edge, nor does it\nreduce to a model with a single-particle mobility edge in the noninteracting\nlimit. We show that eigenstates in this phase can be described in terms of\ninteracting emergent Ising spin degrees of freedom (\"singlons\") suspended in a\nmixture with inert charge degrees of freedom (\"doublons\" and \"holons\"), and\nthus dub it a $\\textit{mobility emulsion}$ (ME).

The inferential capability of the adversary is, in turn, quantified by a\nclass of adversarial loss functions that we introduce as $\\alpha$-loss,\n$\\alpha\\in[1,\\infty]$. The choice of $\\alpha$ determines the specific\nadversarial action and ranges from refining a belief (about any function of the\ndata) for $\\alpha=1$ to guessing the most likely value for $\\alpha=\\infty$\nwhile refining the $\\alpha^{th}$ moment of the belief for $\\alpha$ in between.\nMaximal alpha-leakage then quantifies the adversarial gain under $\\alpha$-loss\nover all possible functions of the data. In particular, for the extremal values\nof $\\alpha=1$ and $\\alpha=\\infty$, maximal alpha-leakage simplifies to mutual\ninformation and maximal leakage, respectively. For $\\alpha\\in(1,\\infty)$ this\nmeasure is shown to be the Arimoto channel capacity of order $\\alpha$.

The transmitters have non-causal knowledge of the\nstate process, and need to communicate independent data streams in addition to\nfacilitating state estimation at the receiver. We first provide a complete\ncharacterization of the optimal trade-off between mean squared error distortion\nperformance in estimating the state and the data rates for the message streams\nfrom two transmitting nodes.

When represented in Fock space, the Hamiltonian of such a\nsystem looks like that of a single particle hopping on a Fock lattice in the\npresence of a random disordered potential. The coordination number of the Fock\nlattice increases linearly with the system size L in 1D. Thus in the\nthermodynamic limit, the disordered interacting problem in 1D maps on to an\nAnderson model with infinite coordination number.

Recent studies have attempted\nto find features of that spreading which could distinguish between chaotic and\nintegrable dynamics. The operator entanglement - the entanglement entropy in\noperator space - is a natural candidate to provide such a distinction.

This\ntradeoff is precisely known in the case of i.i.d. Rayleigh-fading, for T>=\nn_t+n_r-1 where T is the number of time slots over which coding takes place and\nn_t,n_r are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively. For T <\nn_t+n_r-1, only upper and lower bounds on the D-MG tradeoff are available.\n  In this paper, we present a complete solution to the problem of explicitly\nconstructing D-MG optimal ST codes, i.e., codes that achieve the D-MG tradeoff\nfor any number of receive antennas. We do this by showing that for the square\nminimum-delay case when T=n_t=n, cyclic-division-algebra (CDA) based ST codes\nhaving the non-vanishing determinant property are D-MG optimal.

Besides improving the\nprevious constraints on the parameters of the CKM matrix, these new\nmeasurements, combined with the recent determinations of the angles alpha, beta\nand gamma from non-leptonic decays, allow, in the Standard Model, a quite\naccurate extraction of the values of the hadronic matrix elements relevant for\nK-Kbar and B_{s,d}-B_{s,d}bar mixing and of the leptonic decay constant f_B.\nThese values, obtained ``experimentally'', can then be compared with the\ntheoretical predictions, mainly from lattice QCD. In this paper we upgrade the\nUT fit, we determine from the data the kaon B-parameter B_Khat, the B^0 mixing\namplitude parameters f_Bs B^{1/2}_Bs and xi, the decay constant f_B, and make a\ncomparison of the obtained values with lattice predictions.

Abstract: Long baseline oscillation experiments may well emerge as test beds for\nneutrino interactions as are present in R-parity violating supersymmetry. We\nshow that flavour diagonal (FDNC) and flavour changing (FCNC) neutral currents\narising therefrom prominently impact a neutrino $\\beta$-beam experiment with\nthe source at CERN and the detector at the proposed India-based Neutrino\nObservatory. These interactions may preclude any improvement of the present\nlimit on $\\theta_{13}$ and cloud the hierarchy determination unless the upper\nbounds on ${\\not R}$ couplings, particularly $\\lambda^{\\prime}$, become\nsignificantly tighter. If ${\\not R}$ interactions are independently established\nthen from the event rate a lower bound on $\\theta_{13}$ may be set. We show\nthat there is scope to see a clear signal of non-standard FCNC and FDNC\ninteractions, particularly in the inverted hierarchy scenario and also\nsometimes for the normal hierarchy. In favourable cases, it may be possible to\nset lower and upper bounds on $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ couplings. FCNC and FDNC\ninteractions due to $\\lambda$ type ${\\not R}$ couplings are unimportant. \n\n"}

The three events may be interpreted as a new narrow-width\nCP-odd scalar $a$ with the mass $214.3 \\pm 0.5$ MeV. Here $a$ decays dominantly\ninto di-muon ($\\mu^+\\mu^-$). As the consequence of tiny mass difference between\n$m_a$ and 2$m_\\mu$ ($2 m_{\\mu} \\approx$ 211.3 MeV), di-muon will be boosted to\nalmost the same direction at colliders. Such kind of di-muon events have been\noverlooked in the past experiments.
