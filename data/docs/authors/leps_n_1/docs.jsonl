The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket.

Ladders are also nice prototype systems\nallowing to demonstrate the truncation of the Fermi surface and the emergence\nof a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) state with preformed pairs in the vicinity\nof the Mott state. In two dimensions, a similar scenario emerges from\nrenormalization group arguments. We also discuss theoretical predictions for\nthe d-wave superconducting phase as well as the pseudogap phase, and address\nthe crossover to the overdoped regime. Finally, cold atomic systems with\ntunable parameters also provide a complementary insight into this outstanding\nproblem. \n\n"}

We consider in particular the response of a doubly\nquantized vortex with a homogeneous core in the time-reversed phase. The\nexternal frequencies are assumed to be comparable in magnitude to the\nsuperconducting gap frequency, such that the vortex motion is non-stationary\nbut can be treated by linear response theory. We include broadening of the\nvortex core bound states due to impurity scattering and consider the\nintermediate clean regime, with a broadening comparable to or larger than the\nquantized energy level spacing. The response of the order parameter, impurity\nself energy, induced fields and currents are obtained by a self-consistent\ncalculation of the distribution functions and the excitation spectrum.

While the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) obtained with the\nlocal density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it\nhas been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from\nthe strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals. For this reason, a\nthree-orbital Hamiltonian obtained with the Slater-Koster formalism by\nconsidering the hybridization of the As p orbitals with the Fe d_xz,d_yz, and\nd_xy orbitals is discussed here.

However, there is no definitive proof that\nthe Hubbard model truly possesses a superconducting ground state or, if it\ndoes, of how it depends on model parameters. To answer these longstanding\nquestions, we study an extension of the Hubbard model including an\ninfinite-range d-wave pair field term, which precipitates a superconducting\nstate in the d-wave channel. Using exact diagonalization on 16-site square\nclusters, we study the evolution of the ground state as a function of the\nstrength of the pairing term. This is achieved by monitoring the fidelity\nmetric of the ground state, as well as determining the ratio between the two\nlargest eigenvalues of the d-wave pair/spin/charge-density matrices.

Our result is achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which\ncombines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling\nbetween the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous\nfeedback techniques have recently been used for qubit reset and the\nstabilization of a single qubit state, as well as for creating and stabilizing\nstates of multipartite quantum systems.

In the absence of disorder such\npairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal\nquasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point\nnodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the\n$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry\ncurvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the\n$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr\neffect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)\nsurfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in\nthe momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev\nbound states on the (0,0,1) surface.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings.

This is in contrast with the common belief that Mott physics and\nphonon-driven s-wave superconductivity are incompatible, raising a fundamental\nquestion on the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. This article\nreviews recent ab initio calculations, which have succeeded in reproducing\ncomprehensively the experimental phase diagram with high accuracy and\nelucidated an unusual cooperation between the electron-phonon coupling and the\nelectron-electron interactions leading to Mott localization to realize an\nunconventional s-wave superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides. A\ndriving force behind the exotic physics is unusual intramolecular interactions,\ncharacterized by the coexistence of a strongly repulsive Coulomb interaction\nand a small effectively negative exchange interaction. This is realized by a\nsubtle energy balance between the coupling with the Jahn-Teller phonons and\nHund's coupling within the C60 molecule. The unusual form of the interaction\nleads to a formation of pairs of up- and down-spin electrons on the molecules,\nwhich enables the s-wave pairing. The emergent superconductivity crucially\nrelies on the presence of the Jahn-Teller phonons, but surprisingly benefits\nfrom the strong correlations because the correlations suppress the kinetic\nenergy of the electrons and help the formation of the electron pairs, in\nagreement with previous model calculations.

We performed angle-resolved photoemission experiments in\nthin films of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_y$ while running high-density current\nthrough the samples. Clear evidence was found for non-uniform flux flow,\nleaving most of the sample volume free of mobile vortices and dissipation. The\nsuper-current changes the electronic spectrum, creating quasiparticle and\nquasihole pockets. The size of these pockets as a function of the current is\nfound to be doping dependent; it depends both on the superfluid stiffness and\non the strength of interactions. \n\n"}

When fluctuations are included,\nthe calculation satisfies the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the mean-field gap and\ntransition temperature are replaced by pseudogap and onset temperature. The\nmodel is in excellent agreement with experiments on the doping dependence of\nboth photoemission dispersion and magnetic properties.

It is also\ndemonstrated that there exists the boomerang behavior, that is, both Tc and the\nsuperfluid weight increase with hole doping concentration x in the underdoped\nregion, reaches a saturation(maximum) at a hole doping above optimal doping and\ndecreases beyond the saturation point in the overdoped region in agreement with\nmu-SR measurements.

It is thought that the conducting channels, with diameters less\nthan or of the order of a micrometre, are composed of smaller nanofilaments,\nwith diameters of the order of a nanometre. In the present paper a possible\nexplanation is given of measurements which show that the average resistance of\nnon-superconducting channels through films increases with film thickness more\nslowly than linearly. This result is interpreted in terms of how the Bose\ncondensation temperatures of bosons in arrays of nanofilaments depend on the\nlength and numbers of filaments, and examples are given of parameters of the\narrays which could explain the data. The dispersion for the bosons is assumed\nto consist of a sum of linear and quadratic terms, which is an approximate type\nof dispersion reported for Cooper pairs. In order to fit the data with the\nmodel used, it is necessary to suppose that values of superconducting Tc for\nchannels composed of large numbers of filaments are only slightly above room\ntemperature. It is argued that larger Tc's reported in 1989 when currents of\n0.5 A are passed through channels may arise because (a) currents concentrate in\na subchannel of smaller width than the original channel, and (b)\ncurrent-current interactions draw the filaments of the subchannel sufficiently\nclose together to increase the transverse bandwidth and Tc in the model by the\nrequired amount. \n\n"}

Phonon-induced Van Hove nesting leads to a phase separation between a\nhole-doped domain and a (magnetic) domain near half filling, with long-range\nCoulomb forces limiting the separation to a nanoscopic scale.
