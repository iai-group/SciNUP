This occurs at many conventional fixed points of NLSMs which are\nperturbatively accessible within the usual epsilon-expansion in d=2+\\epsilon\ndimensions. Since such operators are not prohibited from occurring in the\naction, they appear to threaten the very existence of such fixed points. At the\nsame time, for NLSMs describing metal-insulator transitions of Anderson\nlocalization in electronic conductors, the strong RG-relevance of these\noperators has been previously related to statistical properties of the\nconductance of samples of large finite size (\"conductance fluctuations\"). In\nthis paper, we analyze this question, not for perturbative RG treatments of\nNLSMs, but for 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models at level k, perturbatively in\nthe current-current interaction of the Noether current. WZW models are special\n(\"Principal Chiral\") NLSMs on a Lie Group G with a WZW term at level k.

For the Lie Supergroup G=GL(2N|2N) and k=1, this corresponds to\ntime-reversal invariant problems of Anderson localization in the so-called\nchiral symmetry classes, and the strength of the current-current interaction, a\nmeasure of the strength of disorder, is known to be completely marginal (for\nany k).

If the\nconsidered solutions have the form of sums of delta-functions, then the\nequation is reversible. If the considered solutions belong to the class of\ncontinuously differentiable functions, then the equation is irreversible. Also,\nwe construct the so called approximate microscopic solutions. These solutions\nare continuously differentiable and they are reversible on bounded time\nintervals. This analysis suggests a way to reconcile the time-irreversible\nkinetic equations with the time-reversible particle dynamics. Usually one tries\nto derive the kinetic equations from the particle dynamics. On the contrary, we\npostulate the Boltzmann-Enskog equation or another kinetic equation and treat\ntheir microscopic solutions as the particle dynamics. So, instead of the\nderivation of the kinetic equations from the microdynamics we suggest a kind of\nderivation of the microdynamics from the kinetic equations. \n\n"}

While there are empirical\nsuggestions of particular increasing length scales that accompany such\ntransitions, this identification is not universal. To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the\nabsence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible\nlattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point \"quantum dynamical\nheterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially\nnon-uniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not\nexhibit a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale\nof the dynamical heterogeneities can increase dramatically.

We compute the Hall viscosity of the Chern insulator using a careful\nregularization scheme, and find that although the Hall viscosity is generally\ndivergent, the difference in Hall viscosities of distinct topological phases is\nwell-defined and determined by the mass gap. Furthermore, on a 1+1-dimensional\nedge between topological phases, the jump in the Hall viscosity across the\ninterface is encoded, through familiar anomaly inflow mechanisms, in the\nstructure of anomalies. In particular, we find new torsional contributions to\nthe covariant diffeomorphism anomaly in 1+1 dimensions. Including parity-even\ncontributions, we find that the renormalized generating functionals of the two\ntopological phases differ by a chiral gravity action with a negative\ncosmological constant. This (non-dynamical) chiral gravity action and the\ncorresponding physics of the interface theory is reminiscent of well-known\nproperties of dynamical holographic gravitational systems. Finally, we consider\nsome properties of spectral flow of the edge theory driven by torsional\ndislocations. \n\n"}

We\nfocus on the glassy effects caused by the kinetic constraint as $q\\downarrow\n0$, where $q$ is the equilibrium density of the 0's. In the physical literature\nthis limit is equivalent to the zero temperature limit. We first prove that,\nfor any given $L=O(1/q)$, the divergence as $q\\downarrow 0$ of three basic\ncharacteristic time scales of the East process of length $L$ is the same. Then\nwe examine the problem of dynamic heterogeneity, i.e. non-trivial\nspatio-temporal fluctuations of the local relaxation to equilibrium, one of the\ncentral aspects of glassy dynamics. For any mesoscopic length scale\n$L=O(q^{-\\gamma})$, $\\gamma<1$, we show that the characteristic time scale of\ntwo East processes of length $L$ and $\\lambda L$ respectively are indeed\nseparated by a factor $q^{-a}$, $a=a(\\gamma)>0$, provided that $\\lambda \\geq 2$\nis large enough (independent of $q$, $\\lambda=2$ for $\\gamma<1/2$).

Occurance of defect tunneling\ndespite their coupling to phonons is viewed as a hallmark of weak defect-phonon\ncoupling. This is since strong coupling to phonons results in significant\nphonon dressing and suppresses tunneling in two-level tunneling defects\neffectively. Here we determine the dynamics of a crystalline tunnelling defect\nstrongly coupled to phonons incorporating the full 3D geometry in our\ndescription. We find that inversion symmetric tunnelling is not dressed by\nphonons whereas other tunnelling pathways are dressed by phonons and, thus, are\nsuppressed by strong defect-phonon coupling. We provide the linear acoustic and\ndielectric response functions for a crystalline tunnelling defect for strong\ndefect-phonon coupling. This allows direct experimental determination of the\ndefect-phonon coupling. The singling out of inversion-symmetric tunneling\nstates in single tunneling defects is complementary to their dominance of the\nlow energy excitations in strongly disordered solids as a result of\ninter-defect interactions for large defect concentrations. This suggests that\ninversion symmetric two-level systems play a unique role in the low energy\nproperties of disordered solids. \n\n"}

In this thesis, the steady state under an appropriate scaling\nand and the freezing ($\\beta\\to\\infty$) regime of the interacting Brownian\nmotions and Bessel processes are studied, and it is proved that the scaled\nsteady-state distributions of these processes converge in finite time to the\neigenvalue distributions of the $\\beta$-Hermite and $\\beta$-Laguerre ensembles\nof random matrices. It is also shown that the scaled final positions of the\nparticles in these processes are fixed at the zeroes of the Hermite and\nLaguerre polynomials in the freezing limit. These results are obtained as the\nconsequence of two more general results proved in this thesis. The first is\nthat Dunkl processes in general converge in finite time to a scaled\nsteady-state distribution that only depends on the type of Dunkl process\nconsidered. The second is that in the freezing limit, their scaled final\nposition is fixed to a set of points called the peak set, which is the set of\npoints which maximizes their steady-state distribution. \n\n"}

Using renormalization\ngroup techniques, we find that while interaction driven quantum critical points\nare \\emph{Gaussian} (mean-field) in nature, describing quantum phase\ntransitions into various broken symmetry phases, the ones controlled by\ndisorder are \\emph{non-Gaussian}, capturing the transition to a metallic phase.\nWe classify such diffusive quantum critical points based on the transformation\nof disorder vertices under a \\emph{continuous} chiral rotation. Our wek\ncoupling renormalization group analysis suggests that two distinct quantum\ncritical points are stable in an interacting dirty Dirac semimetal (with chiral\nsymmetric randomness), and a multicritical point (at finite interaction and\ndisorder) results from their interplay.

Both the irreducible\nrepresentations of the Clifford algebra are considered. On the ring edges the\nbag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.\nThis leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial\ncurrent vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the\nboundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are\nodd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux\nquantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and\ncurrent densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on\nthe ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the\nouter edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked\nnear the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite\ndifferent features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford\nalgebra. We show that, unlike the VEVs in the boundary-free geometry, the\nvacuum charge and the current in the ring are continuous functions of the\nmagnetic flux and vanish for half-odd integer values of the flux in units of\nthe flux quantum. Combining the results for two irreducible representations, we\nalso investigate the induced charge and current in parity and time-reversal\nsymmetric models.

We show that these are unstable to interactions, which\ncan generate a spontaneous surface thermal quantum Hall effect (TQHE). By\ncontrast, nonmagnetic quenched disorder induces a surface conformal field\ntheory (CFT) that is stable against weak interactions: topological protection\nis enhanced by disorder. Gapless surface states of higher-spin TSCs could\ntherefore be robustly realized in solid state systems, where disorder is\ninevitable. The surface CFT is characterized by universal signatures that\ndepend only on the bulk topological winding number, and include power-law\nscaling of the density of states, a universal multifractal spectrum of local\ndensity of states fluctuations, and a quantized ratio of the longitudinal\nthermal conductivity $\\kappa_{xx}$ divided by temperature $T$. By contrast,\n$\\kappa_{xx}/T$ for the clean surface without TQHE order would diverge as $T\n\\rightarrow 0$. Since disorder stabilizes the conducting Majorana surface fluid\nand quantizes thermal transport, our results suggest a close analogy between\nbulk TSCs and the integer quantum Hall effect. \n\n"}

Here we show dramatic effects of spin\ntransport through an amorphous magnetic insulator, which is both magnetically\nand structurally disordered. We generate and detect spin flow though amorphous\nyttrium-iron-garnet ($a$-YIG) thin films in a non-local geometry by use of the\nspin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects in platinum strips separated by 10 or\nmore microns. By comparing non-local spin transport in $a$-YIG on suspended\nmicromachined thermal isolation platforms to the same experiment performed on a\nbulk substrate, we show strong effects of in-plane thermal gradients on spin\ntransport in the disordered magnetic insulator. The resulting non-local voltage\nsignals are orders of magnitude larger than those seen in crystalline magnetic\ninsulators, with easily measurable spin signals seen even at distances in\nexcess of $100$ microns. In analogy to heat transport, where disordered\nmaterials support a range of vibrational excitations that can allow large\nthermal conductivities, we suggest that efficient spin transport in disordered\nmagnetic systems can occur via a similar spectrum of excitations that relies on\nstrong local exchange interactions and does not require long-range order.

The latter can be formally interpreted\nin terms of a magnetic flux treading the compact dimensions. In the compact\nsubspace, the field operator obeys quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary\nphases. The VEV of the charge density is zero and the current density has\nnonzero components along the compact dimensions only. They are periodic\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum and\ntend to zero on the AdS boundary. Near the horizon, the effect of the\nbackground gravitational field is small and the leading term in the\ncorresponding asymptotic expansion coincides with the VEV for a massless field\nin the locally Minkowski bulk. Unlike the Minkowskian case, in the system\nconsisting an equal number of fermionic and scalar degrees of freedom, with\nsame masses, charges and phases in the periodicity conditions, the total\ncurrent density does not vanish. In these systems, the leading divergences in\nthe scalar and fermionic contributions on the horizon are canceled and, as a\nconsequence of that, the charge flux, integrated over the coordinate\nperpendicular to the AdS boundary, becomes finite.

It is\nfirst shown that Berry's phase (and its generalization) for the Weyl model $H\n=v_{F} \\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot \\vec{p}(t)$ assumes a monopole form at the exact\nadiabatic limit but deviates from it off the adiabatic limit and vanishes in\nthe high frequency limit of the Fourier transform of $\\vec{p}(t)$ for bounded\n$|\\vec{p}(t)|$. An effective action, which is consistent with the non-adiabatic\nlimit of Berry's phase, combined with the Bjorken-Johnson-Low prescription\ngives normal equal-time space-time commutators and no chiral anomaly. In\ncontrast, an effective action with a monopole at the origin of the momentum\nspace, which describes Berry's phase in the precise adiabatic limit but fails\noff the adiabatic limit, gives anomalous space-time commutators and a covariant\nanomaly to the gauge current. We regard this anomaly as an artifact of the\npostulated monopole and not a consequence of Berry's phase.

We present two representations of the\nalgebra: the first one is the spin representation, and the other is in the\nvector space of states of the A_k generalized model. A state of the model is a\nnatural generalization of a link pattern. We propose a new graphical way of\ndealing with the Yang-Baxter equation and $q$-symmetrizers by the use of the\nrhombus tiling.

We review the formulation of\nthermodynamics and geometrical optics in terms of contact geometry.

The quantum contact algebra is associative, but the constant\nfunctions are not represented by multiples of the identity: a reflection of the\nclassical fact that Lagrange brackets satisfy the Jacobi identity but not the\nLeibnitz identity for derivations. We verify that this `quantization' describes\ncorrectly the passage from geometrical to wave optics as well.

As an application\nof this bound, we prove that the total third component of the spin in a large\ninterval of even length centered on the interface does not fluctuate, i.e., has\nzero variance.
