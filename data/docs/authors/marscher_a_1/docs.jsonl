Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of the ISM and the formation of molecular\nhydrogen through numerical simulations of spiral galaxies. The model follows\nthe chemical, thermal and dynamical response of the disc to an external spiral\npotential. Self-gravity and magnetic fields are not included. The calculations\ndemonstrate that gas can cool rapidly when subject to a spiral shock. Molecular\nclouds in the spiral arms arise through a combination of compression of the ISM\nby the spiral shock and orbit crowding. These results highlight that local\nself-gravity is not required to form molecular clouds. Self-shielding provides\na sharp transition density, below which gas is essentially atomic, and above\nwhich the molecular gas fraction is >0.001. The timescale for gas to move\nbetween these regimes is very rapid (<~1 Myr). From this stage, the majority of\ngas generally takes between 10 to 20 Myr to obtain high H$_{2}$ fractions (>50\n%). Although our calculations are unable to resolve turbulent motions on scales\nsmaller than the spiral arm and do not include self-gravity. True cloud\nformation timescales are therefore expected to be even shorter.\n  The mass budget of the disc is dominated by cold gas residing in the spiral\narms. Between 50 and 75 % of this gas is in the atomic phase. When this gas\nleaves the spiral arm and drops below the self-shielding limit it is heated by\nthe galactic radiation field. Consequently, most of the volume in the interarm\nregions is filled with warm atomic gas.

The structure of the jet is similar to the previous study: a\npoynting flux jet is surrounded by a funnel-wall jet.

The sources in our sample have z < 2.8 and 10^6 <\nM_BH < 10^10. We model the light curves as a continuous time stochastic\nprocess, providing a natural means of estimating the characteristic time scale\nand amplitude of quasar variations. We employ a Bayesian approach to estimate\nthe characteristic time scale and amplitude of flux variations; our approach is\nnot affected by biases introduced from discrete sampling effects. We find that\nthe characteristic time scales strongly correlate with black hole mass and\nluminosity, and are consistent with disk orbital or thermal time scales. In\naddition, the amplitude of short time scale variations is significantly\nanti-correlated with black hole mass and luminosity. We interpret the optical\nflux fluctuations as resulting from thermal fluctuations that are driven by an\nunderlying stochastic process, such as a turbulent magnetic field. In addition,\nthe intranight variations in optical flux implied by our empirical model are <\n0.02 mag, consistent with current microvariability observations of radio-quiet\nquasars.

But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of\nmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is\nmore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been\naltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate a\nmoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of\nmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.\nInstead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initial\nfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of the\nluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this\nmechanism could be efficient.

The galaxy system consists of\ntwo 0.25 L* disk galaxies and a 0.05 L* galaxy all within \\Delta v < 300 km/s\nand rho< 200 h^{-1} physical kpc of the absorber.

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties. This result\ndemonstrates that the LAE statistics of GRB hosts may give us useful\ninformation in the future. \n\n"}

We investigate the total MF and the\ncontribution of ETGs and LTGs, defined by different criteria (SED, morphology\nor star formation).

We find that the MF\nevolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM<10.6) is mostly explained\nby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation\nactivities. The low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger per\ngalaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major).

In this paper, key predictions of DSA at\nrelativistic shocks that are salient to the issue of cosmic ray ion and\nelectron production are outlined. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation of such\ndiffusive acceleration in test-particle, relativistic, oblique, MHD shocks are\npresented.

Between directional sweeps, the\nthree-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always\nperformed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.\nHence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation\nequations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel\nparallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI\nfor cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory.

The\npresence of baryons produces the concentration of the DM halo with respect to\nits corresponding dissipationless run, but we found that this response does not\nonly depend on the amount of baryons gathered in the central region but also on\nthe way they have been assembled. DM and baryons affect each other in a complex\nway so the formation history of a galaxy plays an important role on its final\ntotal mass distribution. Supernova (SN) feedback regulates the star formation\nand triggers galactic outflows not only in the central galaxy but also in its\nsatellites.

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration.

However, the intrinsic emission should be more complex than\na (color-corrected) sum of blackbodies as it should also contain photo-electric\nabsorption edges from the partially ionised disk photosphere.

However,\nsome studies indicate that the formation of pulsars from the accretion-induced\ncollapse (AIC) of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) cannot be excluded. In this\nwork, we use a population synthesis code to examine if the AIC channel can\nproduce eccentric binary millisecond pulsars (BMSPs) in the Galaxy. Our\nsimulated results indicate that, only when the natal MSPs receive a relatively\nstrong kick ($\\ga100\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$), can the AIC channel produce $\\sim 10-180$\neccentric ($e>0.1$) BMSPs in the Galaxy, most of which are accompanied by a\nHelium star.

We found that the expansion velocities of Si, S,\nand Ar ejecta of 4700+/-100 km/s are distinctly higher than that obtained from\nFe K_alpha emission, 4000+/-300 km/s, which is consistent with segregation of\nthe Fe in the inner ejecta.

We investigate the total MF and find it evolves\nnoticeably with redshift. The shape at M*>10^11 M' does not evolve, but below\nM*~10^10.8 M' the MF at high redshift is flat, while in the Local Universe it\nflattens out at lower masses. The population of M* = 10^10.2 - 10^10.8 M'\ngalaxies must have grown significantly between z=0.8 and z=0. We analyze the MF\nof different morphological types (ellipticals, S0s and late-types), and find\nthat also each of them evolves with redshift. All types have proportionally\nmore massive galaxies at high- than at low-z, and the strongest evolution\noccurs among S0 galaxies. Examining the morphology-mass relation (the way the\nproportion of galaxies of different morphological types changes with galaxy\nmass), we find it strongly depends on redshift. At both redshifts, ~40% of the\nstellar mass is in elliptical galaxies. Another ~43% of the mass is in S0\ngalaxies in local clusters, while it is in spirals in distant clusters. To\nexplain the observed trends, we discuss the importance of those mechanisms that\ncould shape the MF.

However, comparing with high-z\nfield samples, we do not find conclusive evidence for such an environmental\nmass segregation.

Using the\n3D SPH code GADGET-3, we perform simulations of gas accretion onto a central\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass 10^8 M_sun within the radial range of\n0.1 - 200 pc. We carry out simulations without and with radiative heating by a\ncentral X-ray corona and radiative cooling. For an adiabatic case, the radial\nprofiles of hydrodynamical properties match the Bondi solution, except near the\ninner and outer radius of the computational domain. We find that adiabatic\nBondi accretion can be reproduced for durations of a few dynamical times at the\nBondi radius, and for longer times if the outer radius is increased. With\nradiative heating and cooling included, the spherically accreting gas takes a\nlonger time to reach a steady-state than the adiabatic Bondi accretion runs,\nand in some cases does not reach a steady-state even within several hundred\ndynamical times. We find that artificial viscosity in the GADGET code causes\nexcessive heating near the inner radius, making the thermal properties of the\ngas inconsistent with a physical solution. This overheating occurs typically\nonly in the supersonic part of the flow, so that it does not affect the mass\naccretion rate. We see that increasing the X-ray luminosity produces a lower\ncentral mass inflow rate, implying that feedback due to radiative heating is\noperational in our simulations. With a sufficiently high X-ray luminosity, the\ninflowing gas is radiatively heated up, and an outflow develops. We conclude\nthat the SPH simulations can capture the gas dynamics needed to study radiative\nfeedback provided artificial viscosity alters only highly supersonic part of\nthe inflow. \n\n"}

Abstract: To gain new insights into the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy reported for\nactive galactic nuclei, we examine radio loudness as a function of Eddington\nratio for a previously published sample of 199 AGN from five different\npopulations. After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries. We conclude that if the\nmass-corrected core radio luminosity is a good measure of jet power, then black\nhole spin may have considerably less impact on jet power than previously\nreported, or that our sample does not include the extremes of spin. If the\nspread in jet power is small then we suggest that characteristics of the\nambient environment and/or the radio source age could be equally as important\nin producing a radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy seen in total radio luminosity. \n\n"}

In galaxies\nwith sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for\nthe gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower\nthan this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow\nstatus; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for\ninfall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be\ndominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest\ngalaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower\nthan in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by\nSNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value\nat the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce\ntemperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized.

Multiwavelength\nobservations from radio bands to X-rays (mainly GASP-WEBT and Swift) of\npossible counterparts (3C 345, NRAO 512, B3 1640+396) were combined with 20\nmonths of Fermi-LAT monitoring data (August 2008 - April 2010) to associate and\nidentify the dominating gamma-ray emitting counterpart of 1FGL J1642.5+3947.\nThe source 3C 345 is identified as the main contributor for this gamma-ray\nemitting region.

The values of Gamma_0 are broadly distributed between few\ntens and several hundreds with average values ~138 and ~66 for the homogeneous\nand wind density profile, respectively. We find that the isotropic energy and\nluminosity correlate in a similar way with Gamma_0, i.e. Eiso Gamma_0^2 and\nLiso Gamma_0^2, while the peak energy Epeak Gamma_0. These correlations are\nless scattered in the wind density profile than in the homogeneous case.

The distribution of Liso' is very narrow with a\ndispersion of less than a decade in the wind case, clustering around\nLiso'=5x10^48 erg/s. Peak photon energies cluster around Epeak'=6 keV.

From an analysis\nof the WASP lightcurve together with V-band and I_C-band photometry of the\neclipse and a spectroscopic orbit for the A-type star we estimate that the\ncompanion star has a mass of (0.23+-0.03)Msun and a radius of (0.33+-0.01)Rsun,\nassuming that the A-type star is a main-sequence star with the metalicity\nappropriate for a thick-disk star.

{"id": "1108.4036", "contents": "Title: The Long-Term Evolution of Double White Dwarf Mergers Abstract: In this paper, we present a model for the long-term evolution of the merger\nof two unequal mass C/O white dwarfs (WDs). After the dynamical phase of the\nmerger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading to\nnearly solid-body rotation on a viscous timescale of 1e-4 to 1 yr, long before\nsignificant cooling can occur. Due to heating during the dynamical and viscous\nphases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, and\nradially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.\n  Following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near the\nenvelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convective\ncarbon-burning. If not, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the inner region of the\nenvelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of the\nenvelope, again yielding off-center burning. As a result, the long-term\nevolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous\ncalculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventually\nyielding a high-mass O/Ne WD or a collapse to a neutron star. During the\ncooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near the\nEddington limit. Given the double WD merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, tens of\nthese ~1e38 erg/s sources should exist in a Milky Way-type galaxy.\n  While the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physical\npicture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previous\nwork. Furthermore, remaining uncertainties related to the convective structure\nnear the photosphere and mass loss during the thermal evolution may\nsignificantly affect our conclusions. Thus, future work within the context of\nthe physical model presented here is required to better address the eventual\nfate of double WD mergers, including those for which one or both of the\ncomponents is a He WD. \n\n"}

This scheme combines\ntools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which\nprovides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and\ncurrent octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since\nwe are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for\nthe computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH\nperturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of\nself-adjusting Kerr geodesics.

In this paper, a\nconnection between the gamma-ray and optical variability of 3C345 and\nproperties of its parsec-scale radio emission is investigated. Methods: The\nFermi-LAT data of 3C345, covering an energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, were combined\nwith 32 Very Long Baseline Array observations of the object made at 43.2 GHz in\nthe period of January 2008 - March 2010. Results: The VLBA data reveal\nmorphology and kinematics of the flow on scales of up to ~5 milliarcseconds\n(mas; deprojected linear distances of 380 parsecs). The brightness temperature,\nT_b(r), measured along the jet first decreases with distance proportional to\nr^-(0.95 +/-0.69) and later exhibits a break at ~0.3 mas, with T_b(r)\nproportional to r^-(4.11 +/-0.85) at larger separations. Variations of the\ngamma-ray, optical and parsec-scale radio emission show a similar long-term\ntrend persistent during the entire VLBA monitoring period. The gamma-ray and\noptical variations on shorter time scales are related to structural changes in\nthe jet on scales of ~0.3 mas (~23 parsecs, deprojected), with the gamma-ray\nand optical flares possibly related to the evolution of four distinct\nsuperluminal components identified in the flow. Conclusions: The observations\nindicate that both the quiescent and flaring components of the gamma-ray\nemission are produced in a region of the jet of ~23 pc in extent.

These calculations are done numerically using high-resolution\nrelativistic hydrodynamical afterglow blast wave simulations which include the\ntwo-dimensional dynamical features of expanding and decelerating afterglow\nblast waves. Any light curve can then be generated by applying scaling\nrelations to the baseline calculations.\n  As a result, it is now possible to fully fit for the shape of the jet break,\ne.g. at early time X-ray and optical frequencies. In addition, late-time radio\ncalorimetry can be improved since the general shape of the transition into the\nSedov-Taylor regime is now known for arbitrary explosion parameters so the\nexact moment when the Sedov-Taylor asymptote is reached in the light curve is\nno longer relevant.\n  When calculating the baselines, we find that the synchrotron critical\nfrequency and the cooling break frequency are strongly affected by the jet\nbreak.

Whilst it has been established that GRBs are related to the death\nthroes of massive stars, the identification of their progenitors has proved\nchallenging. Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\nloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we\ntake recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the\nsix line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae.

The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other.

We find that X-ray timing\nsignatures are the best diagnostic of the jet ejection event in this outburst,\nwhich occurred as the X-ray variability began to decrease and the Type C\nquasi-periodic oscillations disappeared from the X-ray power density spectrum.\nHowever, this sequence of events does not appear to be replicated in all black\nhole X-ray binary outbursts, even within an individual source. In our\nobservations of H1743-322, the ejection was contemporaneous with a quenching of\nthe radio emission, prior to the start of the major radio flare. This\ncontradicts previous assumptions that the onset of the radio flare marks the\nmoment of ejection. The jet speed appears to vary between outbursts, with a\npossible positive correlation with outburst luminosity. The compact core radio\njet reactivated on transition to the hard intermediate state at the end of the\noutburst, and not when the source reached the low hard spectral state.\nComparison with the known near-infrared behaviour of the compact jets suggests\na gradual evolution of the compact jet power over a few days near the beginning\nand end of an outburst. \n\n"}

In this work, we use VLBI data of the radio-jet in the quasar S5\n0836+710 and hypothesize that the ridge-line of helical jets like this\ncorresponds to a pressure maximum in the jet and assume that the helically\ntwisted pressure maximum is the result of a helical wave pattern. For our\nstudy, we use observations of the jet in S5 0836+710 at different frequencies\nand epochs. The results show that the structures observed are physical and not\ngenerated artificially by the observing arrays. Our hypothesis that the\nobserved intensity ridge-line can correspond to a helically twisted pressure\nmaximum is confirmed by our observational tests. This interpretation allows us\nto explain jet misalignment between parsec and kiloparsec scales when the\nviewing angle is small, and also brings us to the conclusion that\nhigh-frequency observations may show only a small region of the jet flow\nconcentrated around the maximum pressure ridge-line observed at low\nfrequencies.

However, the quasar H II region is found to be more spherical.\nWe next investigate the prospects of detecting such H II regions in the\nredshifted 21cm data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) by means of a matched\nfilter technique.

In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is\nimportant since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies\na very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated\nnon-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by\nthe correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Fermi energy of the system. We study the equations of state of\nthese one-level, two-level and three-level systems and compare them by taking\nthree different maximum Fermi energies.

The UFOs are much more massive than the jet,\nbut their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower, at least\nfor the observations considered here.

The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

This hyperaccretion disk is optically thin to\nneutrinos in the radial direction, therefore the neutrinos produced at one\nradius can travel for a long distance in the disk. Those neutrinos can thus be\nabsorbed with certain probability by the disk matter at the other radius and\nheat the disk there. The effect of this \"global neutrino heating\" has been\nignored in previous works and is the focus of this paper. We find that around\nthe \"ignition\" radius r_{ign}, the global neutrino heating rate could be\ncomparable to or even larger than the local viscous heating rate thus must be\nan important process. Two possible consequences are in order if the \"global\nneutrino heating\" is taken into account: i) the temperature of the disk is\nslightly raised and the \"ignition\" radius r_{ign} slightly shifts to a larger\nradius, both lead to the increasing of the total neutrino flux; ii) what is\nmore interesting is that, the temperature of the ADAF just beyond r_{ign} may\nbe raised above the virial temperature thus the accretion will be suppressed.\nIn this case, the activity of the black hole is expected to oscillate between\nan active and inactive phases.

The characteristic\namplitude of density perturbations is linearly related to the strength of\nturbulence, i.e. the 3D Mach number, as A(k)_max = 0.25 M. The slope of A(k) in\nturn reflects the level of conduction. In a non-conductive medium, subsonic\nstirring motions advect density with a similar nearly Kolmogorov cascade.\nIncreasing conduction (via magnetic suppression f = 0.001-1) progressively\nsteepens the spectrum towards the Burgers-like regime. The turbulent Prandtl\nnumber defines the dynamic similarity of the flow; at scales where Pt < 100,\nthe spectrum develops a significant decay. The transition is gentle for highly\nsuppressed conduction, f < 0.001, while sharp in the opposite regime. For\nstrong conductivity (f > 0.1), Pt ~ 100 occurs on spatial scales larger than\nthe injection scale. The velocity spectrum is instead not much affected by\nconduction.

Detection of a new, fading X-ray source by Swift\nand a radio counterpart by CARMA and the VLA confirmed the association between\niPTF13bxl and GRB 130702A. Spectroscopy with the Magellan and Palomar 200-inch\ntelescopes showed the afterglow to be at a redshift of z=0.145, placing GRB\n130702A among the lowest redshift GRBs detected to date. The prompt gamma-ray\nenergy release and afterglow luminosity are intermediate between typical\ncosmological GRBs and nearby sub-luminous events such as GRB 980425 and GRB\n060218. The bright afterglow and emerging supernova offer an opportunity for\nextensive panchromatic follow-up. Our discovery of iPTF13bxl demonstrates the\nfirst observational proof-of-principle for ~10 Fermi-iPTF localizations\nannually. Furthermore, it represents an important step towards overcoming the\nchallenges inherent in uncovering faint optical counterparts to comparably\nlocalized gravitational wave events in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo era. \n\n"}

Based on the low eccentricity and the position within\nthe galactic plane, Piran & Shaviv (2004, 2005) argued that pulsar B had a\nnon-standard formation scenario with little or no mass ejection. They have also\npredicted that the system would have a very slow proper motion. Pulsar timing\nmeasurements (Kramer et al. 2006; Deller et al. 2009) confirmed this\nprediction. The recent observations of the alignment between the spin of pulsar\nA and the binary orbit is also in agreement with this scenario. Detailed\nsimulations of the formation process of pulsar B enable us to show that its\nprogenitor, just before the collapse, was a massive O-Ne-Mg white dwarf\nsurrounded by a tenuous, 0.1-0.16 M_sun, envelope. This envelope was ejected\nwhen the white dwarf collapsed to form a neutron star.

Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai\nresonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,\ntypically another BH, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary\neccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision N-body simulations of the\nlong term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions\nthat lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an\nobservable source of GW radiation. We find that the secular orbit average\ntreatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamics\nof these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined\norbit at a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai\ncycle the torque due to the outer BH can drive the binary to extremely large\neccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. This occurs before\nrelativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW\nsignal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities. We show\nthat ~50 % of coalescing BH binaries driven by the Kozai mechanism in GCs will\nhave eccentricities larger than 0.1, with 10 % of them being extremely\neccentric, (1-e)<~10^-5, when they first chirp in the frequency band of ground\nbased laser interferometers. This implies that a large fraction of such GW\nsources could be missed if conventional quasi-circular templates are used for\nanalysis of GW detectors data.

In order to better constrain\ntheoretical models, it is especially important to get information from the\nregion close to the physical base of the jet, where the plasma acceleration\ntakes place. In this paper, we report multi-epoch and multi-frequency continuum\nobservations of the z=2.5 blazar PKS1830-211 with ALMA, serendipitously\ncoincident with a strong $\\gamma$-ray flare reported by Fermi-LAT. The blazar\nis lensed by a foreground z=0.89 galaxy, with two bright images of the compact\ncore separated by 1\". Our ALMA observations individually resolve these two\nimages (although not any of their substructures), and we study the change of\ntheir relative flux ratio with time (four epochs spread over nearly three times\nthe time delay between the two lensed images) and frequency (between 350 and\n1050 GHz, rest-frame of the blazar), during the $\\gamma$-ray flare.

Simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence\nreproduce observed slopes in linewidth-size and mass-size relations.

The shock compresses the plasma and\naccelerates electrons to energies up to gamma(max) > 1E4 times their rest-mass\nenergy, with the value of gamma(max) determined by the direction of the\nmagnetic field relative to the shock front. The turbulence is approximated in a\ncomputer code as many cells, each with a uniform magnetic field whose direction\nis selected randomly. The density of high-energy electrons in the plasma\nchanges randomly with time in a manner consistent with the power spectral\ndensity of flux variations derived from observations of blazars. The variations\nin flux and polarization are therefore caused by continuous noise processes\nrather than by singular events such as explosive injection of energy at the\nbase of the jet. Sample simulations illustrate the behavior of flux and linear\npolarization versus time that such a model produces. The variations in\ngamma-ray flux generated by the code are often, but not always, correlated with\nthose at lower frequencies, and many of the flares are sharply peaked.

The dynamics of such plasmas\nis dramatically different from a conventional MHD fluid. The plasma is expected\nto stay locally in a marginal state with respect to the instabilities, but how\nit does this is an open question. Two models of magnetic-field evolution are\ninvestigated. In the first, marginality is achieved via suppression of the rate\nof change of the field. In the second, the instabilities give rise to anomalous\ncollisionality, reducing pressure anisotropy to marginal - at the same time\ndecreasing viscosity and so increasing the turbulent rate of strain.\nImplications of these models are studied in a simplified 0D setting. In the\nfirst model, the field grows explosively but on a time scale that scales with\ninitial beta, while in the second, dynamical field strength can be reached in\none large-scale turbulence turn-over time regardless of the initial seed.

A potential kilonova imprint of the delay until black hole\n  formation following a neutron star merger Abstract: Mergers of binary neutron stars (NSs) usually result in the formation of a\nhypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Whether- and when this remnant collapses to a\nblack hole (BH) depends primarily on the equation of state and on angular\nmomentum transport processes, both of which are uncertain. Here we show that\nthe lifetime of the merger remnant may be directly imprinted in the\nradioactively powered kilonova emission following the merger. We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta. When BH formation is relatively\nprompt (~ 100 ms), outflows from the disk are sufficiently neutron rich to form\nheavy r-process elements, resulting in ~ week-long emission with a spectral\npeak in the near-infrared (NIR), similar to that produced by the dynamical\nejecta. In contrast, delayed BH formation allows neutrinos from the HMNS to\nraise the electron fraction in the polar direction to values such that\npotentially Lanthanide-free outflows are generated. The lower opacity would\nproduce a brighter, bluer, and shorter-lived ~ day-long emission (a `blue\nbump') prior to the late NIR peak from the dynamical ejecta and equatorial\nwind. This new diagnostic of BH formation should be useful for events with a\nsignal to noise lower than that required for direct detection of gravitational\nwaveform signatures. \n\n"}

Taken at a resolution of 1/8192 of the 34-ms\npulse period (i.e., $4.1~\\mu{\\rm s}$), the 1.38-GHz linear-polarization\nmeasurements are in general agreement with previous lower-time-resolution\n1.4-GHz measurements of linear polarization in the main pulse (MP), in the\ninterpulse (IP), and in the low-frequency component (LFC). We find the MP and\nIP to be linearly polarized at about $24\\%$ and $21\\%$, with no discernible\ndifference in polarization position angle. However, and contrary to theoretical\nexpectations and measurements in the visible, we find no evidence for\nsignificant variation (sweep) in polarization position angle over the MP, the\nIP, or the LFC. Although, the main pulse exhibits a small but statistically\nsignificant quadratic variation in the degree of linear polarization.

At very low luminosities the\nspectrum is very soft, becoming rapidly harder as the luminosity increases and\nthen, above a particular luminosity, softening again. At a given flux level,\nthe scatter in hardness ratio is not very large, meaning that the spectral\nshape is largely determined by the luminosity. The spectra were therefore\nsummed in luminosity bins and fitted with a variety of models. The best fitting\nmodel consists of two power laws, one unabsorbed and another, more luminous,\nwhich is absorbed.

On\naccount of this fact, the remainder of the paper is devoted to study cosmology\nin the framework of VT. Initial conditions, at high redshift, are used to solve\nthe evolution equations of all the VT scalar modes. In particular, a certain\nscalar mode characteristic of VT -which does not appear in general relativity\n(GR)- is chosen in such a way that it evolves separately.

The resulting compendium agrees with past\nempirical results, i.e. type-1 AGN show low polarization degrees (P < 1%)\npredominantly associated with a polarization position angle parallel to the\nprojected radio axis of the system, while type-2 objects show stronger\npolarization percentages (P > 7%) with perpendicular polarization angles. The\ntransition between type-1 and type-2 inclination occurs between 45 and 60\ndegrees without noticeable impact on P. The compendium is further used as a\ntest to investigate the relevance of four AGN models. While an AGN model with\nfragmented regions matches observations better than uniform models, a structure\nwith a failed dusty wind along the equator and disc-born, ionized, polar\noutflows is by far closer to observations. However, although the models\ncorrectly reproduce the observed dichotomy between parallel and perpendicular\npolarization, as well as correct polarization percentages at type-2\ninclinations, further work is needed to account for some highly polarized\ntype-1 AGN \n\n"}

Even more importantly it leads to a strongly\nself-interacting plasma of sterile neutrinos and pseudoscalars at late times\nand provides an excellent fit to CMB data.

Time series spectroscopy from a few days after\nmaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,\nwith spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly\nover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light\ncurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input\nby magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque\ncircumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our\nsample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the\npossible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to\nbeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading\nsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse\nbehaviour at this phase.

Secular dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital\ncommensurability having negligible effect. Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD.

This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data.

However, recently, it has been claimed that nonlinear Landau damping\nrenders it physically irrelevant by reducing the effective damping rate to a\nlow level. Here, we show with numerical calculations that the effective damping\nrate is $8\\times 10^{-4}$ of the growth rate of the linear instability, which\nis sufficient for the \"oblique\" instability to be the dominant cooling\nmechanism of these pair beams.

As a first step to compute the tidal Love\nnumbers of a spinning compact star, here we extend powerful perturbative\ntechniques to compute the exterior geometry of a spinning object distorted by\nan axisymmetric tidal field to second order in the angular momentum. The spin\nof the object introduces couplings between electric and magnetic deformations\nand new classes of induced Love numbers emerge.

We find a clear connection between the\ngamma-ray and radio emission, such that every period of gamma-ray activity is\naccompanied by the flaring of the mm-VLBI core and subsequent ejection of a new\nsuperluminal component. However, not all ejections of components are associated\nwith gamma-ray events detectable by Fermi. Clear gamma-ray detections are\nobtained only when components are moving in a direction closer to our line of\nsight.This suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission depends not only on\nthe interaction of moving components with the mm-VLBI core, but also on their\norientation with respect to the observer. Timing of the gamma-ray detections\nand ejection of superluminal components locate the gamma-ray production to\nwithin almost 0.13 pc from the mm-VLBI core, which was previously estimated to\nlie about 0.24 pc from the central black hole. This corresponds to about twice\nthe estimated extension of the broad line region, limiting the external photon\nfield and therefore suggesting synchrotron self Compton as the most probable\nmechanism for the production of the gamma-ray emission.

The clumps should give the main contribution into the\nsignal of dark matter annihilation, provided that they have survived until the\npresent time.

Abstract: Mass is one of the most fundamental parameters characterizing the dynamics of\na coronal mass ejection (CME). It has been found that CME apparent mass\nmeasured from the brightness enhancement in coronagraph images shows an\nincreasing trend during its evolution in the corona. However, the physics\nbehind it is not clear. Does the apparent mass gain come from the mass outflow\nfrom the dimming regions in the low corona, or from the pileup of the solar\nwind plasma around the CME when it propagates outwards from the Sun? We\nanalyzed the mass evolution of six CME events. Their mass can increase by a\nfactor of 1.6 to 3.2 from 4 to 15 Rs in the field of view (FOV) of the\ncoronagraph on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Over\nthe distance about 7 to 15 Rs, where the coronagraph occulting effect can be\nnegligible, the mass can increase by a factor of 1.3 to 1.7. We adopted the\n`snow-plough' model to calculate the mass contribution of the piled-up solar\nwind in the height range from about 7 to 15 Rs. For 2/3 of the events, the\nsolar wind pileup is not sufficient to explain the measured mass increase. In\nthe height range from about 7 to 15 Rs, the ratio of the modeled to the\nmeasured mass increase is roughly larger than 0.55. Although the ratios are\nbelieved to be overestimated, the result gives evidence that the solar wind\npileup probably makes a non-negligible contribution to the mass increase. It is\nnot clear yet whether the solar wind pileup is a major contributor to the final\nmass derived from coronagraph observations. However, our study suggests that\nthe solar wind pileup plays increasingly important role in the mass increase as\na CME moves further away from the Sun. \n\n"}

These exceptions however are\nconsistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparable\nbrightness & redshift. This is surprising: even among a preselected sample of\nhigh metallicity LGRBs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for these\nobjects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typical\nmetallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift.

Radiation constraints, which are relevant for high-energy neutrino\nproduction are considered as well. Efficient shock acceleration of cosmic rays\nis possible for sufficiently low-power jets and/or jets buried in a dense,\nextended wind or outer envelope. Such conditions also favor GRB jets to become\nstalled, and the necessary conditions for stalling are explicitly derived. Such\nchoked jets may explain transrelativistic supernovae (SNe) and low-luminosity\n(LL) GRBs, giving a unified picture of GRBs and GRB-SNe. Focusing on this\nunified scenario for GRBs, we calculate the resulting neutrino spectra from\nchoked jets including the relevant microphysical processes such as multipion\nproduction in pp and pgamma interactions, as well as the energy losses of\nmesons and muons. We obtain diffuse neutrino spectra using the latest results\nfor the luminosity function of LL GRBs. Although uncertainties are large, we\nconfirm that LL GRBs can potentially give a significant contribution to the\ndiffuse neutrino flux. Our results are consistent with the present IceCube data\nand do not violate the stacking limits on classical high-luminosity GRBs. We\nfind that high-energy neutrino production in choked jets is dominated by pgamma\ninteractions. These sources are dark in GeV-TeV gamma-rays, and do not\ncontribute significantly to the Fermi diffuse gamma-ray background. Assuming\nstalled jets can launch a quasi-spherical shock in the dense medium, precursor\nTeV neutrinos emerging prior to the shock breakout gamma-ray emission can be\nused as smoking gun evidence for a choked jet model for LL GRBs. Our results\nstrengthen the relevance of wide field-of-view sky monitors. \n\n"}

However, the\nULX may still be explained by super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-remnant\nblack hole. We present simultaneous NuSTAR, Chandra and Swift/XRT observations\nduring the peak of a flaring episode with the aim of modeling the emission of\nM82 X-1 and yielding insights into its nature. We find that thin-accretion disk\nmodels all require accretion rates at or above the Eddington limit in order to\nreproduce the spectral shape, given a range of black hole masses and spins.\nSince at these high Eddington ratios the thin-disk model breaks down due to\nradial advection in the disk, we discard the results of the thin-disk models as\nunphysical. We find that the temperature profile as a function of disk radius\n($T(r)\\propto r^{-p}$) is significantly flatter ($p=0.55^{+ 0.07}_{- 0.04}$)\nthan expected for a standard thin disk ($p=0.75$).

Alternatively, the\nradio emission could arise from a weak initially-relativistic but decelerated\njet with an energy of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{50}$ erg, or (for an extreme disruption\ngeometry) from the unbound debris. The radio data for XMMSL1 J0740$-$85\ncontinues to support the previous suggestion of a bimodal distribution of\ncommon non-relativistic isotropic outflows and rare relativistic jets in TDEs\n(in analogy with the relation between Type Ib/c supernovae and long-duration\ngamma-ray bursts). The radio data also provide a new measurement of the\ncircumnuclear density on a sub-parsec scale around an extragalactic\nsupermassive black hole. \n\n"}

The two spectra are found to\nprogressively harden at rigidity $R = pc/Z >\\,$200 GV, while the p/He ratio is\nfound to fall off steadily as $p/He\\sim\\,R^{-0.08}$. The p/He decrease is often\ninterpreted in terms of particle-dependent acceleration, which is in contrast\nwith the universal nature of DSA mechanisms. A different explanation is that\nthe p-He anomaly reflects a flux transition between two components: a sub-TeV\nflux component (L) provided by hydrogen-rich supernova remnants with soft\nacceleration spectra, and a multi-TeV component (G) injected by younger sources\nwith amplified magnetic fields and hard spectra. In this scenario the\nuniversality of particle acceleration is not violated because both sources\nprovide composition-blind injection spectra. The present work is aimed at\ntesting this model using the low-energy CR flux which is expected to be\nL-dominated. However, at $E\\sim\\,$0.5-10 GeV, the fluxes are affected by energy\nlosses and solar modulation for which a proper modeling is required. To set the\nproperties of the L-source, I have used the Voyager-1 data collected in the\ninterstellar space. To compare my calculations with the AMS data, I have\nperformed a determination of the force-field modulation parameter using neutron\nmonitor measurements. I will show that the recent $p-He$ data reported by AMS\nand Voyager-1 are in good agreement with the predictions of such a scenario,\nsupporting the hypothesis that CRs are injected in the Galaxy by universal,\ncomposition-blind accelerators. At energies below $\\sim\\,$0.5 GeV/n, however,\nthe model is found to underpredict the data collected by PAMELA from 2006 to\n2010.

The reason for the\ndiscrepancy between the present result and some previous works is that their\nsamples contain not only quiescent sources but also \"normal\" ones (i.e.,\n$L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd} > 10^{-6}$). In this case, the quiescent sources will\nmix up with those normal ones in $L_{\\rm R}$ and $L_{\\rm X}$. The value of\n$\\xi_{\\rm X}$ will then be between $0.6$ and $\\sim1.3$, with the exact value\nbeing determined by the sample composition, i.e., the fraction of the quiescent\nand normal sources. Based on this result, we propose that a more physical way\nto study the Fundamental Plane is to replace $L_{\\rm R}$ and $L_{\\rm X}$ with\n$L_{\\rm R}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd}$, respectively. \n\n"}

They manage to\npropagate over distances up to a billion of initial jet radii. Yet this may not\nbe an indication of some exotic physics but mainly a reflection of the specific\nenvironment these jets propagate through. The key property of this environment\nis a rapid decline of density and pressure along the jet, which promotes its\nrapid expansion. Such an expansion can suppress global instabilities, which\nrequire communication across the jet, and hence ensure its survival over huge\ndistances. At kpc scales, some AGN jets do show signs of strong instabilities\nand even turn into plumes. This could be a result of the flattening of the\nexternal pressure distribution in their host galaxies or inside the radio\nlobes. In this regard, we discuss the possible connection between the stability\nissue and the Fanaroff-Riley classification of extragalactic radio sources.

One of them is the\n\"Line\" component, which directly annihilates into electron--positron pair.\nAnother one is the \"Continuum\" component, which consists of secondarily\nproduced electrons and positrons via some decay modes. Before reaching Earth,\ndirections of electrons and positrons are randomized by the Galactic magnetic\nfield, and their energies are reduced by energy loss mechanisms.

Because of the proximity, spatially resolved, multi-wavelength\nobservations offer excellent opportunities to learn about the physical origin\nof the bubbles. One of the unique features of the observed bubbles is that\ntheir gamma-ray spectrum, including a high-energy cutoff at ~110 GeV and the\noverall shape of the spectrum, is nearly spatially uniform. The high-energy\nspectral cutoff is suggestive of a leptonic origin as it could be a signature\nof synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) cooling of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons;\nhowever, even for a leptonic model, it is not obvious why the spectrum should\nbe spatially uniform. In this work, we investigate the formation of the Fermi\nbubble in the leptonic jet scenario using a newly implemented CRSPEC module in\nFLASH that allows us to track the evolution of CR spectrum on-the-fly during\nthe simulations. We show that the high-energy cutoff is caused by fast\nsynchrotron and IC cooling near the GC when the jets were first launched. After\nthe jets propagate away from the GC, the dynamical timescale of the jets become\nthe shortest among all relevant timescales, and therefore the spectrum is\nessentially advected with only mild cooling losses. This could explain why the\nbubble spectrum is nearly spatially uniform: the CRs from different parts of\nthe bubbles as seen today all share the same origin near the GC at early stage\nof the bubble expansion. We find that the CR spatial and spectral distribution\npredicted by the leptonic jet model can simultaneously match the normalization,\nspectral shape, and high-energy cutoff of the observed gamma-ray spectrum and\ntheir spatial uniformity, suggesting that past AGN jet activity is a likely\nmechanism for the formation of the Fermi bubbles. \n\n"}

If the disk luminosity temporary\nincreases by, e.g., limit-cycle oscillations, leading to a powerful radiatively\ndriven wind, strong shock waves propagate in the BLR. Because the dense clouds\nin the AGN BLRs typically have similar densities to those found in Type IIn\nsupernovae, strong radiative shocks emerge and efficiently convert the ejecta\nkinetic energy to radiation. As a result, transients similar to Type IIn\nsupernovae can be observed at AGN central regions. Since a typical black-hole\ndisk wind velocity is ~ 0.1c where c is the speed of light, the ejecta kinetic\nenergy is expected to be ~ 1e52 erg when ~ 1 Msun is ejected.

The basic idea is that primary\nparticles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant\nshocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally\ninteracting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce\nsecondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically\n$\\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of\nthe main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\\delta}$, where $E_{k}$\nis the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and\n$\\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The\nsame shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the\nfirst place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided\nbeing above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by\nspallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get\naccelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of\ndebate. We compute the spectrum of secondary elements such as boron and lithium\ntaking into account shock reacceleration and compare our predictions with the\nrecent observations of the B/C ratio and preliminary measurements of the boron\nand lithium flux.

The inconsistency suggests that the free escape boundary adopted\nin the escaping model is not a good approximation, which challenges our\nunderstanding of cosmic ray (CR) escaping in SNRs. In addition, we show that\nambient CRs is potentially important for the $\\gamma$-ray emission of\nilluminated MCs external to W28 and W44.

Our method involves applying\na complex frequency correction to the time-domain light curve, allowing for the\naperiodic modulation of the pulse amplitude to be robustly extracted in the\nfrequency domain. We discuss the statistical properties of the resulting\nmodulation spectrum and show how it can be correlated with the non-pulsed\nemission to determine if the periodic and aperiodic variability are coupled\nprocesses.

We find that there is a lack of correlation between\n$\\mathcal{M}_X$ and $\\mathcal{M}_R$; this result is an indication that the\nspectral index of the relic is likely not due to the acceleration of particles\noperated by the shock but it is related to the properties of a fossil electrons\npopulation.

Usually, CR diffusion is assumed to be uniform and isotropic all across\nthe Galaxy. However, this picture is clearly inaccurate: Several data-driven\nand theoretical arguments, as well as dedicated numerical simulations, show\nthat diffusion exhibits highly anisotropic properties with respect to the\ndirection of a background (ordered) magnetic field (i.e., parallel or\nperpendicular to it). In this paper we focus on a recently discovered anomaly\nin the hadronic CR spectrum inferred by the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data at\ndifferent positions in the Galaxy, i.e. the progressive hardening of the proton\nslope at low Galactocentric radii. We propose the idea that this feature can be\ninterpreted as a signature of anisotropic diffusion in the complex Galactic\nmagnetic field: In particular, the harder slope in the inner Galaxy is due, in\nour scenario, to the parallel diffusive escape along the poloidal component of\nthe large-scale, regular, magnetic field. We implement this idea in a numerical\nframework, based on the DRAGON code, and perform detailed numerical tests on\nthe accuracy of our setup. We discuss how the effect proposed depends on the\nrelevant free parameters involved.

Young neutron stars are\ninvolved in many of the possible scenarios for the origin of FRBs, and it has\nbeen suggested that the high dispersion measures observed in FRBs might be\nproduced by the ionized material in the ejecta of associated supernovae. Using\nVLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact\ncomponent not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the\nfirst time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr\nold) supernova.

By the time the ejecta have expanded so that\na 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN\nejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion\nmeasures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to\npropagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at\ndistances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc.

The ejected mass is a decreasing function of the\nsurface gravity of the star, ranging from several $M_\\odot$ for red supergiants\nto $\\sim 0.1M_\\odot$ for blue supergiants and $\\sim 10^{-3} M_\\odot $ for\nWolf-Rayet stars.

In particular,\nwe predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass outflow rate ($\\dot{M} \\propto\nL^{1/2}$) and a super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\\dot{E}_k \\propto\nL^{3/2}$), in agreement with the observational scaling relations reported in\nthe most recent compilation of AGN outflow data. We conclude that AGN radiative\nfeedback can account for the global outflow energetics, at least equally well\nas the wind energy-driving mechanism, and therefore both physical models should\nbe considered in the interpretation of future AGN outflow observations. \n\n"}

Results show that the SED, in the frequency range 2.3-33 GHz, is\ncompatible with a power law with beta_s=-3.22\\pm0.08. Combining S-PASS\npolarization maps with those coming from WMAP and Planck we derived a map of\nthe synchrotron spectral index at angular resolution of 2{\\deg} on about 30% of\nthe sky.

It has been also reported that unconstrained astrophysical processes\nmay address the issues. In response to this situation, we revisit the decaying\ndark matter solution to the issues, discussing possible signatures to\ndiscriminate decaying dark matter from astrophysical processes as a solution to\nsmall-scale issues. We consider an axinolike particle (ALPino) decaying into an\naxionlike particle (ALP) and gravitino with the lifetime around the age of the\nUniverse. The ALPino mass is sub-PeV and slightly ($\\Delta m/m\\sim 10^{-4}$)\nlarger than the gravitino mass, and thus the dark matter abundance does not\nalter virtually after the ALPino decays. On the other hand, the gravitino\nproduced from the ALPino decay obtains a kick velocity of $\\sim 30 \\,{\\rm km /\ns}$, which is sufficiently larger than a circular velocity of dwarf galaxies to\nimpact their dark matter distributions. The Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest constraints\nare relieved since only a small fraction ($\\sim10$%) of dark matter experiences\nthe decay at that time. Decaying dark matter is thus promoted to a viable\nsolution to small-scale issues. The ALPino relic abundance is determined\npredominantly by the decay of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle.\nThe monochromatic ALP emission from the ALPino decay is converted to $\\sim 50\n\\,{\\rm GeV}$ photon under the Galactic magnetic field. The morphology of the\ngamma-ray flux shows a distinctive feature of the model when compared to\ndecaying dark matter that directly decays into photons. Once detected, such\ndistinctive signals discriminate the decaying dark matter solution to\nsmall-scale issues from unconstrained astrophysical processes. \n\n"}

In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation\nof relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray\nemission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late\nafterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission\nalone can explain late afterglows. We find that collision between a mildly\nrelativistic outflow from the merger with a Lorentz factor of $\\sim 1.2-3$ and\nthe ISM/circumburst material can explain observations, if the synchrotron\nself-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are\ntaken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary\nto explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here\nand can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its\nencounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly\nmagnetized. The origin for optical extinction could be a dust rich old faint\nstar cluster surrounding the BNS, which had also helped its formation and\nmerger. Such environment evades present observational constraints and is\nconsistent with our conclusions about properties and evolution of the\nprogenitor neutron stars obtained from the prompt gamma-ray. If the synchrotron\nemission was produced by collision between density shells, the extinction might\nhave occurred inside the outflow itself rather than externally.

In this paper, we address both these issues by invoking a beyond SM\ninterpretation of the EeV events as due to the decay of a long-lived bino in\nthe R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry. In particular, a TeV-scale\nslepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV\nneutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,\nlong-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before\ndecaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air\nshowers in the atmosphere near ANITA.

LIGO/Virgo estimated that local cosmic NS-NS merger rate is 110-3840\nGpc^-3 yr^-1. Only some extreme evolutionary models can generate NS-NS merger\nrates in old host galaxies consistent with the LIGO/Virgo estimate.

Typically,\ncurrent evolutionary models produce NS-NS merger rates that are consistent with\nthe Milky Way empirical rates. However, these models generate local cosmic\nNS-NS merger rate in old host galaxies that are below the LIGO/Virgo estimate.\nThe reason behind this tension is the predicted delay time distribution between\nstar formation and NS-NS mergers that favors short delays. Evolutionary models\nproduce a generic steep power-law NS-NS delay time distribution. This limits\nNS-NS merger rates in old host galaxies. However, we show that such\ndistribution is consistent with observations of Galactic NS-NS binaries; 50% of\nwhich show very long merger times (much longer than Hubble time).

By\npopulating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD\nmodels, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to\nproperties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different\naspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of\nxi(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a\nstrong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical\nand semi-analytic models in reproducing this form is entirely non-trivial.\nOther clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the\nbispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion,\nand the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of\nHOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias.

Due to the virtual non-compressibility of nuclear matter, and the\npolarization of the spin in the plane transverse to the input momentum of the\nprojectile nucleus such an ellipsoid has a reduced mean interaction\ncross-section compared with a non-spinning fragment which has a spherical\nshape. Purely geometrical arguments dictate that such an ellipsoidal nucleus\nshould have additional fluctuations of cross-section even at a fixed impact\nparameter dependent on the orientation angle between the axis of the ellipsoid\nand the vector connecting the centers of projectile and target nucleus. The\nnumber of 'wounded nucleons' in the projectile nucleus participating in the\ninteraction correlates strongly with the interaction cross-section.

In\nsome elliptical galaxies faint X-ray ``ghost'' cavities appear without\ncorresponding radio lobes. It has been suggested that ghost cavities are caused\nby short-lived activity with a timescale of $\\sim 10^3-10^4$ years, but this is\ndifficult to understand within the popular paradigm of active galactic nuclei.\nWe suggest an episode model for ghost cavities, invoking captures of red giant\nstars by the black hole located at the center of the elliptical galaxies at a\ntypical rate of $10^{-5}$yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. The accretion of tidally\ndisrupted red giant stars onto the black hole powers activity in a timescale of\na few years. The total energy channeled into the jet/outflow during the cooling\ntime of the hot gas is $\\sim 10^{56}$ erg, which is the typical work required\nto form the observed cavities. In this scenario, the faint cavities are\nproduced by the feedback following accretion of the debris of the captured red\ngiant stars onto the black holes. We apply the present model to several\nelliptical galaxies and find that it can explain the formation of the ghost\ncavities. This model can be tested in the future by comparisons between radio\nand X-ray observations. \n\n"}

Cluster members were selected from\nHST ACS images, combined with ground--based near--IR imaging and optical\nspectroscopy. The observed early--type color--magnitude relation (CMR) in\n(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-\n0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and S0s, respectively. From\nthe scatter about the CMR, a mean luminosity--weighted age t > 3.3 Gyr (z > 3)\nis derived for the elliptical galaxies.\n  Strikingly, the S0 galaxies in RDCS J0910+5422 are systematically bluer in\n(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. The\nellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on S0s\nin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. Thus, if\nanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and S0 populations may be\neven more significant.\n  The color offset between S0 and E corresponds to an age difference of ~1 Gyr,\nfor a single-burst solar metallicity model. A solar metallicity model with an\nexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5\nGyr, i.e. the S0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.\n  The early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming.

Taking\ninto account the luminosity evolution of galaxies which depends on their\nmorphological type through different history of star formation, we obtain\n<V/Vmax> \\sim 0.5 in the range of 0.3<z<0.8, where reliable redshifts were\nsecured by spectroscopy of either absorption or emission lines for the CFRS\nsample. This indicates that a picture of mild evolution of field galaxies\nwithout significant mergers is consistent with the CFRS data.

We show that the mechanism of instant preheating in NO models is much\nmore efficient than the usual mechanism of gravitational particle production\neven if the coupling constant $g^2$ is extremely small, $10^{-14} \\ll g^2 \\ll\n1$. \n\n"}

Surprisingly, in common with these two\nmethods, the matter on the brane cannot be the source of the gravity on the\nbrane at leading order. In this paper we will propose the low energy effective\naction on the D-brane coupled with gravity which derives the same results. \n\n"}

Progress in this arena has been limited by the\nexclusive use of hadronic probes that are hindered by large and controversial\nuncertainties in the reaction mechanism. The Parity Radius Experiment at the\nJefferson Laboratory offers an attractive electro-weak alternative to the\nhadronic program and promises to measure the neutron radius of 208Pb accurately\nand model independently via parity-violating electron scattering. In this\ncontribution we examine the far-reaching implications that such a determination\nwill have in areas as diverse as nuclear structure, atomic parity violation,\nand astrophysics. \n\n"}
