Recent research has shed new light on the structure\n(algebraic, combinatorial and geometric) of tropical idempotents, and in this\npaper we explore the consequences of this for the metric geometry of tropical\npolytopes. We prove, for example, that every n-point metric space is realised\nby the Hilbert projective metric on the vertices of a pure n-dimensional\ntropical polytope in tropical n-space. More generally, every n-point asymmetric\ndistance function is realised by a residuation operator on the vertices of such\na polytope. In the symmetric case, we show that the maximal group of tropical\nmatrices containing the idempotent associated to a metric space is a direct\nproduct of the real numbers with the isometry group of the space; it follows\nthat every direct product of a finite group with the real numbers arises as a\nmaximal subgroup of a sufficiently large finitary full tropical matrix\nsemigroup.

Using the worldsheet CFT description previously found and by suitably\nregularising the infinite target space volume divergence, we show that\nthreshold corrections to the various gauge factors are governed by the\nnon-holomorphic completion of the Appell-Lerch sum.

This manuscript represents an\nadvance in the theory of opers that takes the subject beyond the work of\nMochizuki, Joshi, and Pauly. In particular, we provide general unified\nformulations and the basics of principal bundles and connections defined on\nfamilies of pointed stable curves. The notion of an oper is accordingly\nintroduced in the context of logarithmic algebraic geometry. Some of the\nresults can be regarded as generalizations of results obtained in the\nfundamental work on the geometric Langlands program developed by A. Beilinson\nand V. Drinfeld. We also describe various properties and assertions about\n(dormant) opers, such as duality, comparison with differential operators, and\ncompactification of the moduli space. Our goal is to give an explicit formula,\nconjectured by Joshi, for the generic number of dormant\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_n$-opers. We do so by obtaining a detailed understanding of the\nmoduli space of dormant opers and computing the Gromov-Witten invariants for\nQuot-schemes in characteristic zero. This formula reveals an interaction\nbetween studies in $p$-adic Teichm\\\"{u}ller theory and certain areas of\nmathematics, including Gromov-Witten theory. \n\n"}

The conjecture proposes\nan automorphic category associated to a compact Riemann surface X and complex\nreductive group G is equivalent to a spectral category associated to the\nunderlying topological surface S and Langlands dual group G^. The automorphic\ncategory consists of suitable C-sheaves on the moduli stack Bun_G(X) of\nG-bundles on X, while the spectral category consists of suitable O-modules on\nthe character stack Loc_G^(S) of G^-local systems on S. The conjecture is\ncompatible with and constrained by the natural symmetries of both sides coming\nfrom modifications of bundles and local systems.

The \"Beyond Endoscopy\"\nproposal predicts that this transfer will be realized as a comparison between\nthe (relative) trace formulas of these spaces.\n  In this paper we establish the local transfer for the identity map between\nL-groups, for spherical affine homogeneous spaces X=H\\G whose dual group is\nSL(2) or PGL(2) (with G and H split). More precisely, we construct a transfer\noperator between orbital integrals for the (X x X)/G-relative trace formula,\nand orbital integrals for the Kuznetsov formula of PGL(2) or SL(2).

The transfer operator is given explicitly in\nterms of Fourier convolutions, making it suitable for a global comparison of\ntrace formulas by the Poisson summation formula, hence for a uniform proof, in\nrank one, of the relations between periods of automorphic forms and special\nvalues of L-functions. \n\n"}

Our study began\nwith the observation that Freudenthal's magic chart could be derived from Zak's\ntheorem on Severi varieties and standard geometric constructions. Our attempt\nto understand this observation led us to discover further connections between\nprojective geometry and representation theory.\n  Among other things, we calculate the variety of tangent directions to lines\non $X$ through a point and determine unirulings of $X$. We show this variety is\na Hermitian symmetric space if and only if $P$ does not correspond to a short\nroot. We describe the spaces corresponding to the exceptional short roots and\ntheir unirulings using the octonions. Further calculations, in the case $X$ is\na Hermitian symmetric space, give rise to a strict prolongation property and\nthe appearance of secant varieties at the infinitesimal level. Our work\ncomplements and advances that of Freudenthal and Tits, who studied homogeneous\nvarieties in an abstract/axiomatic setting. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/9904014", "contents": "Title: Nilpotent pairs, dual pairs, and sheets Abstract: Recently, V.Ginzburg introduced the notion of a principal nilpotent pair (=\npn-pair) in a semisimple Lie algebra {\\frak g}. It is a double counterpart of\nthe notion of a regular nilpotent element. A pair (e_1,e_2) of commuting\nnilpotent elements is called a pn-pair, if the dimension of their simultaneous\ncentralizer is equal to the rank of {\\frak g} and some bi-homogeneity condition\nis satisfied. Ginzburg proved that many familiar results of the `ordinary'\ntheory have analogues for pn-pairs. The aim of this article is to develop the\ntheory of nilpotent pairs a bit further and to present some applications of it\nto dual pairs and sheets. It is shown that a large portion of Ginzburg's theory\ncan be extended to the pairs whose simultaneous centraliser is of dimension\nrk{\\frak g}+1. Such pairs are called almost pn-pairs. It is worth noting that\nthe very existence of almost pn-pairs is a purely \"double\" phenomenon, because\nthe dimension of \"ordinary\" orbits is always even. We prove that to any\nprincipal or almost nilpotent pair one naturally associates a dual pair.\nMoreover, this dual pair is reductive if and only if e_1 and e_2 can be\nincluded in commuting sl_2-triples. We also study sheets containing members of\npn-pairs. Some cases are described, where these sheets are smooth and admit a\nsection. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/9911050", "contents": "Title: Perverse Sheaves on affine Grassmannians and Langlands Duality Abstract: This is an expanded version of the text ``Perverse Sheaves on Loop\nGrassmannians and Langlands Duality'', AG/9703010. The main new result is a\ntopological realization of algebraic representations of reductive groups over\narbitrary rings.\n  We outline a proof of a geometric version of the Satake isomorphism. Given a\nconnected, complex algebraic reductive group G we show that the tensor category\nof representations of the Langlands dual group is naturally equivalent to a\ncertain category of perverse sheaves on the loop Grassmannian of G. The above\nresult has been announced by Ginsburg in and some of the arguments are borrowed\nfrom his approach. However, we use a more \"natural\" commutativity constraint\nfor the convolution product, due to Drinfeld. Secondly, we give a direct proof\nthat the global cohomology functor is exact and decompose this cohomology\nfunctor into a direct sum of weights. The geometry underlying our arguments\nleads to a construction of a canonical basis of Weyl modules given by algebraic\ncycles and an explicit construction of the group algebra of the dual group in\nterms of the affine Grassmannian. We completely avoid the use of the\ndecomposition theorem which makes our techniques applicable to perverse sheaves\nwith coefficients over an arbitrary commutative ring. We deduce the classical\nSatake isomorphism using the affine Grassmannian defined over a finite field.\nThis note contains indications of proofs of some of the results. The details\nwill appear elsewhere. \n\n"}
