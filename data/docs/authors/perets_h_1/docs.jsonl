Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

This prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonic\nphysics or cosmological parameters. In particular, if the fstar-M500 relation\nis fixed and does not evolve with redshift, CDM models predict the logarithmic\nslope of this relation to be b>-0.3. This constraint can be weakened if the\nfstar-M500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must be\nformed in situ in groups at low redshift. Conservatively requiring that at\nleast half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint from\nevolution models is b>-0.35. Since the most massive clusters (M500=1E15 Msun)\nare observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with M500=5E13 Msun\nmust have fstar<0.03. Recent observations by Gonzalez et al.

We perform a careful analysis of\nthese and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties in\ntheir measurements.

The effect is responsible for a wealth of non-equilibrium\nphenomena, and has been exploited to transmit quantum information through spin\nchains. It is a commonly expressed belief that for local Hamiltonians, any such\npropagation happens at a finite \"speed of sound\". Indeed, the Lieb-Robinson\ntheorem states that in spin models, all effects caused by a perturbation are\nlimited to a causal cone defined by a constant speed, up to exponentially small\ncorrections. In this work we show that for translationally invariant bosonic\nmodels with nearest-neighbor interactions, this belief is incorrect: We prove\nthat one can encounter excitations which accelerate under the natural dynamics\nof the lattice and allow for reliable transmission of information faster than\nany finite speed of sound. The effect is only limited by the model's range of\nvalidity (eventually by relativity). It also implies that in non-equilibrium\ndynamics of strongly correlated bosonic models far-away regions may become\nquickly entangled, suggesting that their simulation may be much harder than\nthat of spin chains even in the low energy sector. \n\n"}

The transients were optically faint (-13 < M_V < -15)\ncompared to normal core-collapse supernovae (SNe), and their spectra exhibited\nnarrow emission lines. These events are unique among transient-progenitor pairs\nand hence constitute a new class. Whether they are true SNe or bright\nmassive-star eruptions, we argue that their rate is ~20% of the SN rate. This\nfact is remarkable in light of the observation that a very small fraction of\nall massive stars have the MIR colors of the SN 2008S and NGC300 progenitors,\nas we show using MIR and optical luminosity, color, and variability properties\nof massive stars in M33. We find that the fraction of massive stars with colors\nconsistent with these progenitors is 1/10000. In fact, only < 10 similar\nobjects exist in M33 - all of which lie at the luminous red extremum of the AGB\nsequence. That these transients are relatively common with respect to SNe,\nwhile their progenitors are rare compared to the massive star population,\nimplies that the dust-enshrouded phase is a short-lived phase in the lives of\nmany massive stars. This shrouded epoch can occur only in the last ~10^4 yr\nbefore explosion, be it death or merely eruption.

We also\nshow that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal\nstar cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory\nof the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

One method employs a direct fit to a modified\nblackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical\nprediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature\nand dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and\ndensity) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the\nspectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the\nspectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature\nestimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or \"column temperature,\"\nof the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature -\nspectral index correlation naturally results from SED fitting, due to the\ninaccurate isothermal assumption, as well as noise uncertainties. We show that\nabove some \"threshold\" temperature, the temperatures estimated through the flux\nratio method can be highly inaccurate. In general, observations with widely\nseparated wavelengths, and including shorter wavelengths, result in higher\nthreshold temperatures; such observations thus allow for more accurate\ntemperature estimates of sources with temperatures less than the threshold\ntemperature.

We systematically compare the indices and\nderived parameters for the BCGs with those of large samples of ordinary\nelliptical galaxies in the same mass range. We find no significant differences\nbetween the index-velocity dispersion relations of the BCG data and those of\nnormal ellipticals, but we do find subtle differences between the derived\nSSP-parameters. The BCGs show, on average, higher metallicity ([Z/H]) and\nalpha-abundance ([E/Fe]) values. We analyse possible correlations between the\nderived parameters and the internal properties of the galaxies (velocity\ndispersion, rotation, luminosity) and those of the host clusters (density,\nmass, distance from BCG to X-ray peak, presence of cooling flows), with the aim\nof dissentangling if the BCG properties are more influenced by their internal\nor host cluster properties. The SSP-parameters show very little dependence on\nthe mass or luminosity of the galaxies, or the mass or density of the host\nclusters. Of this sample, 26 per cent show luminosity-weighted ages younger\nthan 6 Gyr, probably a consequence of recent - if small - episodes of star\nformation.

Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion.

These are thought to\nappear as as type Ib/c and II SNe, and are associated with young stellar\npopulations. A type Ia SN is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonation\nof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose mass\napproaches the Chandrasekhar limit. Such SNe are observed in both young and old\nstellar environments. Here we report our discovery of the faint type Ib SN\n2005E in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, NGC 1032.\n  The lack of any trace of recent star formation near the SN location (Fig. 1),\nand the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 M_sun), argue strongly against a\ncore-collapse origin for this event. Spectroscopic observations and the derived\nnucleosynthetic output show that the SN ejecta have high velocities and are\ndominated by helium-burning products, indicating that SN 2005E was neither a\nsubluminous nor a regular SN Ia (Fig. 2). We have therefore found a new type of\nstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likely\ninvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. The\nSN ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of SN and likely\nadditional large amounts of radioactive 44Ti. Such SNe may thus help resolve\nfundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitive\nsolar system and that of the oldest stars, to the Galactic production of\npositrons. \n\n"}

Photodissociation by UV light is an important destruction mechanism for\nCO in many astrophysical environments, ranging from interstellar clouds to\nprotoplanetary disks. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of\nthe depth dependence and isotope-selective nature of this process.\n  Methods. We present a photodissociation model based on recent spectroscopic\ndata from the literature, which allows us to compute depth-dependent and\nisotope-selective photodissociation rates at higher accuracy than in previous\nwork. The model includes self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by\natomic and molecular hydrogen, and it is the first such model to include the\nrare isotopologues C17O and 13C17O. We couple it to a simple chemical network\nto analyse CO abundances in diffuse and translucent clouds, photon-dominated\nregions, and circumstellar disks.\n  Results. The photodissociation rate in the unattenuated interstellar\nradiation field is 2.6e-10 s^-1, 30% higher than currently adopted values.\nIncreasing the excitation temperature or the Doppler width can reduce the\nphotodissociation rates and the isotopic selectivity by as much as a factor of\nthree for temperatures above 100 K. The model reproduces column densities\nobserved towards diffuse clouds and PDRs, and it offers an explanation for both\nthe enhanced and the reduced N(12CO)/N(13CO) ratios seen in diffuse clouds. The\nphotodissociation of C17O and 13C17O shows almost exactly the same depth\ndependence as that of C18O and 13C18O, respectively, so 17O and 18O are equally\nfractionated with respect to 16O.

Detailed knowledge\nof the physical mechanisms that govern stellar birth is a prerequisite for\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of our galactic home, the Milky Way.\nA theory of star formation is an essential part of any model for the origin of\nour solar system and of planets around other stars. Despite this pivotal\nimportance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of the\nprocesses that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.\n  Stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. Star\nformation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between the\ngravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magnetic\nfields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. The competition\nbetween these processes determines both the locations at which young stars form\nand how much mass they ultimately accrete. It plays out over many orders of\nmagnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. In\naddition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare and\nhard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and the\nresulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of a\nstar-forming cloud.\n  As a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control star\nformation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.\nThese can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they must\nbe used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations.

We\ninvestigate the 5-35 um Spitzer IRS spectra of a sample of 13 group I sources\nand 20 group II sources. We focus on the continuum emission to study the\nunderlying disk geometry. We have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7]\ncontinuum flux ratios. The 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellar\nphotosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-IR emission\nproduced by the inner disk. We have compared our data to self-consistent\npassive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We\nconfirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between\ngroup I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small\ndust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and\n[13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources. Moreover, the [30/13.5] flux\nratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample.

In this\nreview we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric\ncomposition.

The end result is a comprehensive\nand homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly\nnoteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen,\noxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. The new\nsolar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal\nconsistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with\nvalues obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristine\nmeteorites.

In this\nwork, we consider the interesting, yet relatively unexplored, dynamical\nformulation of CS modified gravity, where the CS coupling field is treated as a\ndynamical field, endowed with its own stress-energy tensor and evolution\nequation.

In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes.

A residual off-set in the spin direction relative\nto the orbital angular momentum remains, at the level of <10 degrees for the\ncase of a cold disc, and <30 degrees for a warmer disc.

A Critical Look at Variations Abstract: Few topics in astronomy initiate such vigorous discussion as whether or not\nthe initial mass function (IMF) of stars is universal, or instead sensitive to\nthe initial conditions of star formation. The distinction is of critical\nimportance: the IMF influences most of the observable properties of stellar\npopulations and galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide\ndeep insights into the process by which stars form. In this review, we take a\ncritical look at the case for IMF variations, with a view towards whether other\nexplanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, local\nyoung clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the\nvast majority were drawn from a \"universal\" IMF: a power-law of Salpeter index\n($\\Gamma=1.35$) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower\npower-law ($\\Gamma \\sim 0-0.25$) between a few tenths and a few solar masses\n(ignoring the effects of unresolved binaries). The shape and universality of\nthe IMF at the stellar-substellar boundary is still under investigation and\nuncertainties remain large, but most observations are consistent with a IMF\nthat declines ($\\Gamma < -0.5$) well below the hydrogen burning limit.\nObservations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of\nmost galaxies are also consistent with a \"universal IMF\", suggesting no gross\nvariations in the IMF over much of cosmic time. There are indications of\n\"non-standard\" IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments, which\nclearly warrant further study. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence that the\nIMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions\nafter the first few generations of stars. \n\n"}

This power law is inconsistent with standard\ndispersal mechanisms such as cluster evaporation and cloud collisions. In the\nconventional interpretation, it requires the unlikely situation where diverse\nmechanisms stitch together over time in a way that is independent of\nenvironment or M. Here we consider another model in which the large scale\ndistribution of gas in each star-forming region plays an important role. We\nnote that star clusters form with positional and temporal correlations in giant\ncloud complexes, and suggest that these complexes dominate the tidal force and\ncollisional influence on a cluster during its first several hundred million\nyears. Because the cloud complex density decreases regularly with position from\nthe cluster birth site, the harassment and collision rates between the cluster\nand the cloud pieces decrease regularly with age as the cluster drifts.

The failure to identify the\ntypes of binaries which produce SNeIa is the \"progenitor problem\". Its solution\nis required if we are to utilize the full potential of SNeIa to elucidate basic\ncosmological and physical principles. In single-degenerate models, a WD\naccretes and burns matter at high rates. Nuclear-burning WDs (NBWDs) with mass\nclose to M_C are hot and luminous, potentially detectable as supersoft x-ray\nsources (SSSs). In previous work we showed that > 90-99% of the required number\nof progenitors do not appear as SSSs during most of the crucial phase of mass\nincrease. The obvious implication is that double-degenerate (DD) binaries form\nthe main class of progenitors. We show in this paper, however, that many\nbinaries that later become DDs must pass through a long-lived NBWD phase during\nwhich they are potentially detectable as SSSs. The paucity of SSSs is therefore\nnot a strong argument in favor of DD models. Those NBWDs that are the\nprogenitors of DD binaries are likely to appear as symbiotic binaries for\nintervals > 10^6 years. In fact, symbiotic pre-DDs should be common, whether or\nnot the WDs eventually produce SNeIa. The key to solving the progenitor problem\nlies in understanding the appearance of NBWDs. Most do not appear as SSSs most\nof the time. We therefore consider the evolution of NBWDs to address the\nquestion of what their appearance may be and how we can hope to detect them. \n\n"}

In this scenario,\nsurvival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to\nbe more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of\ncollapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a\nresult of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture\nplanetesimals and form heavy-element cores.

Despite this, the 0.3 - 10 keV\nflux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a SGRB by the Swift X-ray\nTelescope (XRT).

We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K.

The RV signal imprinted by a few Earth-mass planet\naround a cool star is at the limit of the typical single measurement\nuncertainty obtained using state-of-the-art spectrographs. This requires\nrelying on statistics in order to unearth signals buried below noise. Artifacts\nintroduced by observing cadences can produce spurious signals or mask genuine\nplanets that should be easily detected otherwise. Here we discuss a\nparticularly confusing statistical degeneracy resulting from the yearly\naliasing of the first eccentric harmonic of an already-detected planet. This\nproblem came sharply into focus after the recent announcement of the detection\nof a 3.1 Earth mass planet candidate in the habitable zone of the nearby low\nmass star GJ 581. The orbital period of the new candidate planet (GJ 581g)\ncorresponds to an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of a previously\nreported planet, GJ 581d. Although the star is stable, the combination of the\nobserving cadence and the presence of multiple planets can cause period\nmisinterpretations.

In addition, we show that the state of matter\nand the geometrical shape of the celestial object could significantly affect\nthe precessional value. For example, a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) Dwarf Novae\n(DN) non-magnetic system that shows negative superhumps in its light curve can\nbe described by a retrogradely precessing, differentially rotating, tilted\ndisc. Because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the\ntilted disc and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli, coupled to the\ndisc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the\ninnermost annuli of the disc. However, numerical simulations by Bisikalo et al.\n(2003, 2004) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be\ngenerated instead of an inner ring. Therefore, we show that retrograde\nprecession in non-magnetic, spinning, tilted CV DN systems can equally be\ndescribed by a retrogradely precessing and differentially rotating disc with an\nattached retrogradely precessing inner spiral density wave so long as the wave\nappears at the same radius as the ring and within the plane of the tilted disc.\nWe find that the theoretical results generated in this work agree well with the\ntheoretical results presented in Montgomery (2009a) and thus with the numerical\nsimulations and select CV DN systems in Montgomery (2009b) that may have a main\nsequence secondary.

This work investigates the origin of\nthe observed temperatures, by examining the relationship between them and the\ngalaxy structure, the gas heating due to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa's) and the\ngravitational potential, and the dynamical status of the gas flow. In galaxies\nwith sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for\nthe gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower\nthan this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow\nstatus; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for\ninfall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be\ndominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest\ngalaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower\nthan in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by\nSNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value\nat the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce\ntemperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The\nvalues of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is\nrelatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial\ntemperature. For 200<sigma_c(km/s)<250, lower L_X values tend to correspond to\nlower T's, which deserves further investigation. \n\n"}

The clustering\nstatistics depend on the Stokes number, $St$, defined as the ratio of the\nparticle friction timescale, $\\tau_{\\rm p} $, to the Kolmogorov timescale in\nthe flow. In the dissipation range, the clustering intensity strongly peaks at\n$St \\simeq 1$, and the RDF for $St \\sim 1$ shows a fast power-law increase\ntoward small scales, suggesting that turbulent clustering may considerably\nenhance the particle collision rate. Clustering at inertial-range scales is of\nparticular interest to the problem of planetesimal formation. At these scales,\nthe strongest clustering is from particles with $\\tau_{\\rm p}$ in the inertial\nrange.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being\nof order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits. The results may also be applied to the problem of tidal capture of\nstars in young stellar clusters. \n\n"}

At the same time,\nthe average g-r color of solar-type stars that host small-radius ECs is\nindistinguishable from the average color of the stars in the control sample.

Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details\nof the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly\nturbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core.

Based on three years of Fermi LAT gamma-ray data, we analyze the flux\ncoming from eight nearby clusters individually as well as in a combined\nlikelihood analysis. Concentrating mostly on signals from dark matter decay, we\ntake into account uncertainties of the cluster masses as determined by X-ray\nobservations and model the cluster emission as extended sources. Searching for\ndifferent hadronic and leptonic decay and annihilation spectra, we do not find\nsignificant emission from any of the considered clusters and present limits on\nthe dark matter lifetime and annihilation cross-section. We compare our\nlifetime limits derived from cluster observations with the limits that can be\nobtained from the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGBG), and find that in\ncase of hadronic decay the cluster limits become competitive at dark matter\nmasses below a few hundred GeV. In case of leptonic decay, however, galaxy\ncluster limits are stronger than the limits from the EGBG over the full\nconsidered mass range.

Abstract: The radio pulsar models based on the existence of an inner accelerating gap\nlocated above the polar cap rely on the existence of a small scale, strong\nsurface magnetic field $B_s$. This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars. While the former are too weak to create $B_s \\gtrsim 5\\times\n10^{13}$G$\\;\\gg B_d$, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than\n$10^6$ years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a\ntoroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where\nthe ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created\nby various processes acting early in a neutron star's life. The Hall drift is a\nnon-linear mechanism that, due to the coupling between different components and\nscales, may be able to create the demanded strong, small scale, magnetic spots.\nTaking into account both realistic crustal microphysics and a minimal cooling\nscenario, we show that, in axial symmetry, these field structures are created\non a Hall time scale of $10^3$-$10^4$ years. These magnetic spots can be\nlong-lived, thereby fulfilling the pre-conditions for the appearance of the\nradio pulsar activity.

This paper focus on a minimal microRNA-mediated regulatory\ncircuit, in which a protein-coding gene (host gene) is targeted by a microRNA\nlocated inside one of its introns. Results: Autoregulation via intronic\nmicroRNAs is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our\nbioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its\nsimple topology. Our analysis, based on analytical calculations and\nsimulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene\nexpression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and Weber's\nlaw, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network\nto the host gene. A fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of\nthese functions.

With an approach based on\nlinear perturbation theory we describe the evolution of the mode amplitude and\nfollow the trajectory of a newborn neutron star through its instability window.\nThe influence on the f-mode instability of the magnetic field and the presence\nof an unstable r-mode is also considered. Two different configurations are\nstudied in more detail; an N = 1 polytrope with a typical mass and radius and a\nmore massive polytropic N = 0.62 model with gravitational mass M = 1.98 Msun.\nWe study several evolutions with different initial rotation rates and\ntemperature and determine the gravitational waves radiated during the\ninstability. In more massive models, an unstable f-mode with a saturation\nenergy of about 1e-6 Msun c^2 may generate a gravitational-wave signal which\ncan be detected by the Advanced LIGO/Virgo detector from the Virgo cluster.

Such a perturber is sufficiently distant to\nallow the triple system to remain intact for millions of orbits while\nefficiently exchanging angular momentum with the WD-WD binary. In ~ 5% of the\ninitial orientations, the inner orbit efficiently scans the (equal energy)\nphase space in the region of zero angular momentum. In these systems, the\nbinary experiences increasingly closer, stochastic, pericenter approaches r_p ~\na/2N with the increasing number (N) of orbits elapsed. Within N~10^5(a/30AU)\norbits, a collision is likely to occur. This is shown by performing \\simten\nthousand 3-body integrations and is explained by simple analytic arguments. The\ncollisions are conservatively restricted to \"clean\" collisions in which all\npassages prior to the collision are greater than 4R_WD=4x10^9cm. In particular,\nwithin the last single orbit, the pericenter changes from r_p>4R_WD to a\ncollision value of r_p<2R_WD. The effects of tidal deformations and General\nRelativistic (GR) corrections are negligible in these scenarios. The WDs\napproach each other with a high velocity >3000 km/s and the collision is likely\nto detonate the WDs leading to a type Ia SNe.

To investigate this\nproposal, we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs, broad-lined Type Ic\n(Ic-bl) supernovae (SNe), and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity\ndistribution of star-forming galaxies using the SDSS to represent galaxies in\nthe local universe and the TKRS for galaxies at intermediate redshifts.\n  The differing metallicity distributions of the LGRB hosts and the star\nformation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity\npreference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between\nstar-formation and metallicity, but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the\nastrophysics of the LGRBs themselves. Three quarters of our LGRB sample are\nfound at metallicities below 12+log(O/H) < 8.6, while less than a tenth of\nlocal star-formation is at similarly low metallicities. However, our SN samples\nare statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the general\ngalaxy population. Using the TKRS population of galaxies, we are able to\nexclude the possibility that the LGRB host metallicity aversion is caused by\nthe decrease in galaxy metallicity with redshift. The presence of the strong\nmetallicity difference between LGRBs and Ic-bl SNe largely eliminates the\npossibility that the observed LGRB metallicity bias is a byproduct of a\ndifference in the initial mass functions of the galaxy populations. Rather,\nmetallicity below half-solar must be a fundamental component of the\nevolutionary process that separates LGRBs from the vast majority of Ic-bl SNe\nand from the bulk of local star-formation. \n\n"}

Terrestrial microlens parallax can\nbe measured whenever a microlensing event differs substantially as observed\nfrom two or more well-separated sites.

But straightforward forms of the most favored model, in which\nX-rays arise from instability-generated shocks embedded in the stellar wind,\npredict a steeper scaling, either with mass loss rate Lx ~ Mdot ~ Lbol^{1.7} if\nthe shocks are radiative, or with Lx ~ Mdot^{2} ~ Lbol^{3.4} if they are\nadiabatic. This paper presents a generalized formalism that bridges these\nradiative vs. adiabatic limits in terms of the ratio of the shock cooling\nlength to the local radius. Noting that the thin-shell instability of radiative\nshocks should lead to extensive mixing of hot and cool material, we propose\nthat the associated softening and weakening of the X-ray emission can be\nparametrized as scaling with the cooling length ratio raised to a power m$, the\n\"mixing exponent\". For physically reasonable values m ~= 0.4, this leads to an\nX-ray luminosity Lx ~ Mdot^{0.6} ~ Lbol that matches the empirical scaling. To\nfit observed X-ray line profiles, we find such radiative-shock-mixing models\nrequire the number of shocks to drop sharply above the initial shock onset\nradius. This in turn implies that the X-ray luminosity should saturate and even\ndecrease for optically thick winds with very high mass-loss rates. In the\nopposite limit of adiabatic shocks in low-density winds (e.g., from B-stars),\nthe X-ray luminosity should drop steeply with Mdot^2.

At current precision, there is no significant tension\nbetween the locally measured Hubble constant and age of the Universe (with\nerrors of 3% and 5% respectively) and the corresponding parameters derived from\nthe CMB.

The use\nof integral field spectroscopy enables us to obtain both spatial and spectral\ninformation of the explosion site, allowing the identification of the parent\nstellar population of the supernova progenitor star. The spectrum of the parent\npopulation provides metallicity determination via strong-line method and age\nestimation obtained via comparison with simple stellar population (SSP) models.\nWe adopt this information as the metallicity and age of the supernova\nprogenitor, under the assumption that it was coeval with the parent stellar\npopulation. The age of the star corresponds to its lifetime, which in turn\ngives the estimate of its initial mass. With this method we were able to\ndetermine both the metallicity and initial (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor stars\nof the type Ib and Ic supernovae. We found that on average SN Ic explosion\nsites are more metal-rich and younger than SN Ib sites. The initial mass of the\nprogenitors derived from parent stellar population age suggests that SN Ic have\nmore massive progenitors than SN Ib.

Rather than\nbeing confined within the circularizing radius, the disk can spread to larger\nradii to conserve angular momentum. A spreading disk is a source of matter for\nre-accretion at rates which can exceed the later stellar fallback rate,\nalthough a disk wind can suppress its contribution to the central black hole\naccretion rate. A spreading disk is detectible through a break in the central\naccretion rate history, or, at longer wavelengths, by its own emission. We\nmodel the evolution of TDE disk size and accretion rate, by accounting for the\ntime-dependent fallback rate, for the influence of wind losses in the early,\nadvective stage, and for the possibility of thermal instability for accretion\nrates intermediate between the advection-dominated and gas-pressure dominated\nstates. The model provides a dynamic basis for modeling TDE light curves. All\nor part of a young TDE disk will precess as a solid body due to Lense-Thirring\neffect, and precession may manifest itself as quasi-periodic modulation of\nlight curve.

For instance\nsuch inaccuracies can affect the precise derivation of the planet's radius. In\nthis paper, we present the results of a quantitative study on the effects of\nstellar spots on high precision transit light curves. We show that spot\nanomalies can lead to the estimate of a planet radius that is 4% smaller than\nthe real value. The effects on the transit duration can also be of the order of\n4%, longer or shorter.

In order to compare with\nobservations, we model the effects of dynamical friction and dynamical\nevolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal stripping of stars, and tidal\ndisruption of clusters by the growing galactic nucleus.

Numerical calculations with a detailed\nstellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre-\nand post-AIC evolution of close binaries. We investigated the mass transfer\nonto a massive WD in 240 systems with three different types of non-degenerate\ndonor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars. When the WD is\nable to accrete sufficient mass (depending on the mass-transfer rate and the\nduration of the accretion phase) we assumed it collapses to form a NS and we\nstudied the dynamical effects of this implosion on the binary orbit.\nSubsequently, we followed the mass-transfer epoch which resumes once the donor\nstar refills its Roche lobe and calculated the continued LMXB evolution until\nthe end.

This set is\ninfinite in most cases making the CME practically unsolvable. In many\napplications, it is important to determine if the solution of a CME has a\nglobally attracting fixed point. This property is called ergodicity and its\npresence leads to several important insights about the underlying dynamics. The\ngoal of this paper is to present a simple procedure to verify ergodicity in\nstochastic reaction networks. We provide a set of simple linear-algebraic\nconditions which are sufficient for the network to be ergodic. In particular,\nour main condition can be cast as a Linear Feasibility Problem (LFP) which is\nessentially the problem of determining the existence of a vector satisfying\ncertain linear constraints. The inherent scalability of LFPs make our approach\nefficient, even for very large networks. We illustrate our procedure through an\nexample from systems biology. \n\n"}

In this paper,\nwe investigate the structure and gravitational stability of the protostellar\ndisks in the full metallicity range between zero and the solar value. Using the\nmass-accretion rates evaluated from the thermal evolution in the preceding\ncollapse phase of the pre-stellar cores, we calculate disk structures and their\nevolution in the framework of the standard steady disks. Overall, with higher\nmetallicity, more efficient cooling results in the lower accretion rate and\nlower temperature inside the disk: at zero metallicity, the accretion rate is ~\n1e-3Msun/yr and the disk temperature is ~ 1000 K, while at solar metallicity, ~\n1e-6Msun/yr and 10 K.

We investigate the grain opacity k_gr in the atmosphere of\nprotoplanets. This is important for the planetary mass-radius relation since\nk_gr affects the H/He envelope mass of low-mass planets and the critical core\nmass of giant planets. Aims. The goal of this study is to derive an analytical\nmodel for k_gr. Methods. Our model is based on the comparison of the timescales\nof microphysical processes like grain settling in the Stokes and Epstein\nregime, growth by Brownian motion coagulation and differential settling, grain\nevaporation, and grain advection due to envelope contraction. With these\ntimescales we derive the grain size, abundance, and opacity. Results. We find\nthat the main growth process is differential settling. In this regime, k_gr has\na simple functional form and is given as 27 Q/8 H rho in the Epstein regime and\nas 2 Q/H rho for Stokes drag. Grain dynamics lead to a typical radial structure\nof k_gr with high ISM-like values in the top layers but a strong decrease in\nthe deeper parts where the grain-free molecular opacities take over.\nConclusions. In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically\nmuch lower than in the ISM. The equations also show that a higher dust input in\nthe top layer does not strongly increase k_gr with two important implications.\nFirst, for a formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the\nissue that pebbles increase the grain input high in the atmosphere due to\nablation. This could potentially increase k_gr hindering giant planet\nformation. Our study shows that this adverse effect should not occur. Second,\nit means that a higher stellar [Fe/H] which presumably leads to a higher\nsurface density of planetesimals only favors giant planet formation without\nbeing detrimental to it due to an increased k_gr. This corroborates the result\nthat core accretion explains the increase of the giant planet frequency with\n[Fe/H]. \n\n"}

Using different variants of the\ntest-field method, we determine the quenching of the turbulent transport\ncoefficients for the forced Roberts flow, isotropically forced non-helical\nturbulence, and rotating thermal convection.

However, when the magnetic field is\nexpressed in terms of the equipartition value of the unquenched flows these\nquenching exponents become about 4, 1.5, and 2.3, respectively. For the\n$\\alpha$ effect, the exponent is about 1.3 for the Roberts flow and 2 for\nconvection in the first case, but 4 and 3, respectively, in the second.

The simulations are analyzed with a\nLarge Velocity Gradient (LVG) model to compute the local emission in various\nmolecular lines in each resolution element, radiation transfer and opacity\neffects, and the intensity emerging from galaxies, to generate synthetic\nspectra for various transitions of the CO molecule. This model reproduces the\nknown properties of CO spectra and CO-to-H2 conversion factors in nearby\nspirals and starbursting major mergers. The high excitation of CO lines in\nmergers is dominated by an excess of high-density gas, and the high turbulent\nvelocities and compression that create this dense gas excess result in broad\nlinewidths and low CO intensity-to-H2 mass ratios. When applied to\nhigh-redshift gas-rich disks galaxies, the same model predicts that their\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor is almost as high as in nearby spirals, and much\nhigher than in starbursting mergers. High-redshift disk galaxies contain giant\nstar-forming clumps that host a high-excitation component associated to gas\nwarmed by the spatially-concentrated stellar feedback sources, although CO(1-0)\nto CO(3-2) emission is overall dominated by low-excitation gas around the\ndensest clumps. These results overall highlight a strong dependence of CO\nexcitation and the CO-to-H2 conversion factor on galaxy type, even at similar\nstar formation rates or densities. The underlying processes are driven by the\ninterstellar medium structure and turbulence and its response to stellar\nfeedback, which depend on global galaxy structure and in turn impact the CO\nemission properties. \n\n"}

We perform 2D gas\nhydrodynamical simulations of disks with one and two giant planets which may\nopen deep or partial gaps. A gas ring forms in between two planets such that\nthe surface mass density is higher than on either side of it. This ring is a\nregion of pressure maximum where we expect large grains, which are marginally\ncoupled to the gas and would otherwise be subject to radial drift, to collect.\nSuch a pressure maximum also occurs at the outermost gap edge in a disk with\none or more planets. We infer the dust evolution in these regions as the gas\ndisk evolves, to understand the longer term behavior of the resulting dust\nrings.

Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts\n(GIs). Here we test the viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres\naccreted by isolation masses are small ($10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and\nthat atmospheric mass-loss during GIs is significant, with typical post-GI\natmospheres that are $8 \\times 10^{-4}$ the core mass.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case.

A statistical study indicates for this\nparameter values between z_0.5=1.5 and z_0.5=3. We assume as fiducial value\nz_0.5~2, and show that this assumption allows us to describe accourately the\nredshift distributions and the source counts. By assuming z_0.5 ~ 2 at the\nfar-IR flux limit of the PEP-COSMOS survey, the PEP-selected sources observed\nat z>2 can be explained as progenitors of local spheroids caught during their\nformation. We also test the effects of mass downsizing by dividing the\nspheroids into three populations of different present-day stellar masses. The\nresults obtained in this case confirm the validity of our approach, i.e. that\nthe bulk of proto-spheroids can be modelled by means of a single model which\ndescribes the evolution of galaxies at the break of the present-day early type\nK-band LF. \n\n"}

A record\nof the early geodynamo is preserved in ancient silicate crystals containing\nminute magnetic inclusions. These data indicate the presence of a geodynamo\nduring the Paleoarchean, between 3.4 and 3.45 billion years ago. While the\nmagnetic field sheltered Earth's atmosphere from erosion at this time, standoff\nof the solar wind was greatly reduced, and similar to that during modern\nextreme solar storms. These conditions suggest that intense radiation from the\nyoung Sun may have modified the atmosphere of the young Earth by promoting loss\nof volatiles, including water. Such effects would have been more pronounced if\nthe field were absent or very weak prior to 3.45 billion years ago, as\nsuggested by some models of lower mantle evolution.

Analytical perturbation theory predicts the\nexistence of nested circumbinary orbits that are generalizations of circular\npaths around a single star. These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star. Here,\nwe review the theory and confirm its predictions with a suite of representative\nsimulations. We then consider the circumbinary planets discovered with NASA's\nKepler satellite. These Neptune- and Jupiter-size planets, or their\nplanetesimal precursors, may have migrated inward to reach their observed\norbits, since their current positions are outside of unstable zones caused by\noverlapping resonances. In situ formation without migration seems less likely,\nonly because the surface density of the protoplanetary disks must be\nimplausibly high.

The composition of CRs coming to the solar system can be\nmeasured directly and has been used to infer the details of CR propagation that\nare extrapolated to the whole Galaxy. In contrast, indirect methods, such as\nobservations of gamma-ray emission from CR interactions with interstellar gas,\nhave been employed to directly probe the CR densities in distant locations\nthroughout the Galactic plane. In this article we use 73 months of data from\nthe Fermi Large Area Telescope in the energy range between 300 MeV and 10 GeV\nto search for gamma-ray emission produced by CR interactions in several high-\nand intermediate-velocity clouds located at up to ~ 7 kpc above the Galactic\nplane. We achieve the first detection of intermediate-velocity clouds in gamma\nrays and set upper limits on the emission from the remaining targets, thereby\ntracing the distribution of CR nuclei in the halo for the first time. We find\nthat the gamma-ray emissivity per H atom decreases with increasing distance\nfrom the plane at 97.5% confidence level. This corroborates the notion that CRs\nat the relevant energies originate in the Galactic disk. The emissivity of the\nupper intermediate-velocity Arch hints at a 50% decline of CR densities within\n2 kpc from the plane. We compare our results to predictions of CR propagation\nmodels. \n\n"}

In triple systems,\nsecular Kozai-Lidov cycles and tidal friction (KLCTF) have been shown to reduce\nthe inner orbital period from $\\sim 10^4$ to a few days.

We find the following outcomes. (1) Sufficiently massive\nplanets in tight and/or coplanar orbits around the inner binary can quench the\nKL evolution because they induce precession in the inner binary. The KLCTF\nprocess does not take place, preventing the formation of a short-period binary.\n(2) Secular evolution is not quenched and it drives the planetary orbit into a\nhigh eccentricity, giving rise to an unstable configuration, in which the\nplanet is most likely ejected from the system. (3) Secular evolution is not\nquenched but the planet survives the KLCTF evolution. Its orbit is likely to be\nmuch wider than the currently observed inner binary orbit, and is likely to be\neccentric and inclined with respect to the inner binary. These outcomes lead to\ntwo main conclusions: (1) it is unlikely to find a massive planet on a tight\nand coplanar orbit around a short-period binary, and (2) the properties of\ncircumbinary planets in short-period binaries are constrained by secular\nevolution. \n\n"}

{"id": "1506.07534", "contents": "Title: Tides or dark matter sub-halos: Which ones are more attractive? Abstract: Young tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) are observed in the tidal debris of\ngas-rich interacting galaxies. In contrast to what is generally assumed to be\nthe case for isolated dwarf galaxies, TDGs are not embedded in their own dark\nmatter (DM) sub-halo. Hence, they are more sensitive to stellar feedback and\ncould be disrupted on a short time-scale. Detailed numerical and observational\nstudies demonstrate that isolated DM-dominated dwarf galaxies can have\nlifetimes of more than 10 Gyr. For TDGs that evolve in a tidal field with\ncompressing accelerations equal to the gravitational acceleration within a DM\nsub-halo typical of an isolated dwarf galaxy, a similar survival time is\nexpected. The tidal acceleration profile depends on the virial mass of the host\ngalaxy and the distance between the TDG and its host. We analytically compare\nthe tidal compression to the gravitational acceleration due to either cuspy or\ncored DM sub-halos of various virial masses. For example, the tidal field at a\ndistance of 100 kpc to a host halo of 10^13 Msol can be as stabilizing as a\n10^9 Msol DM sub-halo. By linking the tidal field to the equivalent\ngravitational field of a DM sub-halo, we can use existing models of isolated\ndwarfs to estimate the survivability of TDGs. We show that part of the\nunexpectedly high dynamical masses inferred from observations of some TDGs can\nbe explained by tidal compression and hence TDGs require to contain less\nunobservable matter to understand their rotation curves. \n\n"}

In some cases the\nburning ashes may rise from the burning depths up to the NS photosphere by\nconvection, leading to the appearance of the metal absorption edges in the\nspectra, which then force the emergent X-ray burst spectra to shift toward\nlower energies.

They\nrepresent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are\ndetectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on\nthe equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of\nthe postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant\ncan be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be\ndescribed by concepts of asteroseismology. The understanding of the different\nmechanisms shaping the gravitational-wave signal yields a physically motivated\nanalytic model of the gravitational-wave emission, which may form the basis for\ntemplate-based gravitational-wave data analysis. We explore the observational\nconsequences of a scenario of two families of compact stars including hadronic\nand quark stars. We find that this scenario leaves a distinctive imprint on the\npostmerger gravitational-wave signal. In particular, a strong discontinuity in\nthe dominant postmerger frequency as function of the total mass will be a\nstrong indication for two families of compact stars. (abridged) \n\n"}

Abstract: Protoplanetary discs are now routinely observed and exoplanets, after the\nnumerous indirect discoveries, are starting to be directly imaged. To better\nunderstand the planet formation process, the next step is the detection of\nforming planets or of signposts of young planets still in their disc, such as\ngaps. A spectacular example is the ALMA science verification image of HL Tau\nshowing numerous gaps and rings in its disc. To study the observability of\nplanet gaps, we ran 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a gas and dust disc\ncontaining a 5 M J gap-opening planet and characterised the spatial\ndistribution of migrating, growing and fragmenting dust grains. We then\ncomputed the corresponding synthetic images for ALMA. For a value of the dust\nfragmentation threshold of 15 m s --1 for the collisional velocity, we identify\nfor the first time a self-induced dust pile up in simulations taking\nfragmentation into account. This feature, in addition to the easily detected\nplanet gap, causes a second apparent gap that could be mistaken for the\nsignature of a second planet. It is therefore essential to be cautious in the\ninterpretation of gap detections. \n\n"}

We present here a new code, DAMOCLES, that models the effects of dust\non the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine the\nmasses of newly formed dust. As noted by Lucy et al.

A variety of evidence points to the presence of clumping and we\nfind that our clumped dust models require significantly higher dust masses than\nsmoothly distributed dust models.

The observations of SR21 show a clear shift in the\nvisibility nulls, indicating radial variations of the inner edge of the cavity\nat the two wavelengths. Notable radial variations of the spectral index are\nalso detected for SR21 with values of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}3.8-4.2$ in the\ninner region ($r<35$ AU) and $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}2.6-3.0$ outside. An\naxisymmetric ring (which we call the ring model) or a ring with the addition of\nan azimuthal Gaussian profile, for mimicking a vortex structure (which we call\nthe vortex model), is assumed for fitting the disk morphology. For SR21, the\nring model better fits the emission at 336GHz, conversely the vortex model\nbetter fits the 689GHz emission. For HD135344B, neither a significant shift in\nthe null of the visibilities nor radial variations of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}$ are\ndetected.

We also visually identify mergers.\nAdditionally, we provide a quantitative measure of the degree of disturbance\nfor each galaxy (\"roughness\"). The majority of elliptical and lenticular\ngalaxies have relaxed structure, showing no signs of ongoing star formation.\nStructurally-disturbed galaxies, which tend to avoid the lowest-density\nregions, have higher star-formation activity and younger stellar populations\nthan undisturbed systems. Cluster spirals with reduced/quenched star formation\nhave somewhat less disturbed morphologies than spirals with \"normal\"\nstar-formation activity, suggesting that these \"passive\" spirals have started\ntheir morphological transformation into S0s. Visually identified mergers and\ngalaxies not identified as mergers but with similar roughness have similar\nspecific star formation rates and stellar ages. The degree of enhanced star\nformation is thus linked to the degree of structural disturbance, regardless of\nwhether it is caused by major mergers or not. This suggests that merging\ngalaxies are not special in terms of their higher-than-normal star-formation\nactivity. Any physical process that produces \"roughness\", or regions of\nenhanced luminosity density, will increase the star-formation activity in a\ngalaxy with similar efficiency. An alternative explanation is that star\nformation episodes increase the galaxies' roughness similarly, regardless of\nwhether they are merger-induced or not. \n\n"}

Using numerical simulations, we examine the\nsegregation of twelve different subhalo properties with respect to both orbital\nenergy and halo-centric radius (in real space as well as in projection).\nSubhaloes are strongly segregated by accretion redshift, which is an outcome of\nthe inside-out assembly of their host haloes. Since subhaloes that were\naccreted earlier have experienced more tidal stripping, subhaloes that have\nlost a larger fraction of their mass at infall are on more bound orbits.\nSubhaloes are also strongly segregated in their masses and maximum circular\nvelocities at accretion. We demonstrate that part of this segregation is\nalready imprinted in the infall conditions. For massive subhaloes it is\nsubsequently boosted by dynamical friction, but only during their first radial\norbit. The impact of these two effects is counterbalanced, though, by the fact\nthat subhaloes with larger accretion masses are accreted later. Because of\ntidal stripping, subhaloes reveal little to no segregation by present-day mass\nor maximum circular velocity, while the corresponding torques cause subhaloes\non more bound orbits to have smaller spin. There is a weak tendency for\nsubhaloes that formed earlier to be segregated towards the center of their host\nhalo, which is an indirect consequence of the fact that (sub)halo formation\ntime is correlated with other, strongly segregated properties.

We apply this\nmethod to data from the K2 mission fields 0-4, finding 154 ab-type RR Lyraes\n(10 newly discovered), 377 Delta Scuti pulsators, 133 Gamma Doradus pulsators,\n183 detached eclipsing binaries, 290 semi-detached or contact eclipsing\nbinaries and 9399 other periodic (mostly spot-modulated) sources, once class\nsignificance cuts are taken into account. We present lightcurve features for\nall K2 stellar targets, including their three strongest detected frequencies,\nwhich can be used to study stellar rotation periods where the observed\nvariability arises from spot modulation. The resulting catalogue of variable\nstars, classes, and associated data features are made available online. We\npublish our SOM code in Python as part of the open source PyMVPA package, which\nin combination with already available RF modules can be easily used to recreate\nthe method. \n\n"}

A bow\nshock invariably forms ahead of the magnetosphere, but the pre-shock gas is\nonly mildly supersonic (with typical Mach numbers of $\\simeq$1.6-1.8) so the\nshock is weak. This results in a characteristic signature in the ultraviolet\nlight curve: a broad absorption feature that leads the optical transit by\n10-20% in orbital phase.

The model takes into account (and is based\non) non-local energy and momentum transport across the shock front via emission\nand absorption of high-energy photons. This leads to a pre-acceleration of the\nfluid and pre-amplificaiton of the magnetic fields in the upstream region. Both\nhave drastic implications on the shock structure. The model explains the\npersistence of the shock generated magnetic field at large distances from the\nshock front. The dissipation of this magnetic field results in a continuous\nparticle acceleration within the downstream region. The model suggests two\nnon-uniform emission zones (the downstream and the upstream), that give rise to\nthree emission components with different spectral and temporal properties. A\nunique feature of the model is the existence of an \"attractor\", toward which\nany shock will evolve.

The depth of\nthe data is sufficient to derive the mass function for the cluster as a\nfunction of radius down to 0.15 M$_\\odot$ in the outer parts of the cluster. We\nidentify for the first time a flattening in the mass function (in logarithmic\nunits) at a mass range that is consistent with that of the field and nearby\nembedded clusters. Through log-normal functional fits to the mass functions we\nfind the nominal peak mass to be comparable to that of the field and nearby\nembedded star clusters. The width of a log-normal fit appears slightly narrow\ncompared to the width of the field IMF, closer to the values found for globular\nclusters. The subsolar content within the cluster does not appear to be mass\nsegregated in contrast to the findings for the supersolar content.

Such an event can be used to observationally\ntest the predictions of the theory of colliding stellar winds over a broad\nrange of wavelengths. We have conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign\nof 9 Sgr around the 2013 periastron. In this paper, we focus on X-ray\nobservations and optical spectroscopy. The optical spectra allow us to revisit\nthe orbital solution of 9 Sgr and to refine its orbital period to 9.1 years.\nThe X-ray flux is maximum at periastron over all energy bands, but with clear\ndifferences as a function of energy. The largest variations are observed at\nenergies above 2 keV, whilst the spectrum in the soft band (0.5 - 1.0 keV)\nremains mostly unchanged indicating that it arises far from the collision\nregion, in the inner winds of the individual components. The level of the hard\nemission at periastron clearly deviates from the 1/r relation expected for an\nadiabatic wind interaction zone, whilst this relation seems to hold at the\nother phases covered by our observations.

We study\nthe formation of a gaseous proto-cluster inside a molecular cloud by performing\nhigh resolution MHD simulations and associate its internal properties to those\nof the parent cloud by varying the level of the initial turbulence of the\ncloud, with a view to better characterize the subsequent stellar cluster\nformation.

We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random\nbursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle.\nFormulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are\nderived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and\nstochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions\nfrom bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules\nbetween daughter cells. These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off:\ncell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty\nexpression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We\ninvestigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell\ncycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a\nzero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring\njust before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed\nmean protein level. In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of\npartitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division. We provide\nexamples of regulatory proteins that are expressed only towards the end of cell\ncycle, and argue that such strategies enhance robustness of cell-cycle\ndecisions to the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression. \n\n"}

Our simulations\nreproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity\ngradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative\nmetallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all\nrotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed\ngalaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic\nproperties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary\nsignificantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes.\nFeedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and\nflatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a\nsingle galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample,\nindicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies\nreflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and\ngrowth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of\nmetallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR).\nLow-mass galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR tend to have flat gradients,\nlikely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies.

Recent observations of radioactive $^{44}$Ti with high-energy\nsatellite telescopes (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array [NuSTAR], INTEGRAL)\nhave measured gamma-ray line details, which provide direct evidence of\nlarge-scale explosion asymmetries in SN 1987A and in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) even\nby mapping of the spatial brightness distribution (NuSTAR).

Both exhibit\nintriguing resemblance to the observed morphology of the Cas A remnant,\nalthough neither the progenitor nor the explosion was fine-tuned for a perfect\nmatch.

However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic\nmagnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood.

In this follow-up paper to Martin & Triaud (2015), the\ntime-dependence is probed deeper by analytically calculating when and for how\nlong the binary and planet orbits overlap, allowing for transits to occur.

To\ncompute the synthesis of fourteen species of grains we integrate a\nnon-equilibrium network of nucleating and related chemical reactions and follow\nthe growth of the nuclei into grains via accretion and coagulation. The effects\nof the radioactive cobalt, titanium, and sodium on the thermodynamics and\nchemistry of the ejecta are taken into account. The grain temperature, which we\nallow to differ from the gas temperature, affects the surface-tension-corrected\nevaporation rate.

As a first step we assume instantaneous star cluster formation\nand gas expulsion. We draw our initial conditions from observed properties of\nstarless clumps.

We therefore address the general behavior of\nhydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly-irradiated\nExtrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test\nbecause copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence\nrequires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences ($I_{\\mathrm{xuv}}$) using\nproxies and power laws.

While not up to the standard afforded by\ndata available for analysis in the nearby Universe, these data are valuable in\nconstraining cosmological evolution of either DM scenarios, or -- as I discuss\nhere -- $z$-dependence of MOND. Indeed, these results, if taken at face value,\nteach us useful lessons in connection with MOND. a. The dynamical accelerations\nat the half-light radii, found by Genzel et al., are rather high compared with\nthe MOND acceleration constant, as measured in the nearby Universe:\n$g(R_{1/2})= (3-11)a_0$. MOND then predicts fractions of `phantom matter' at\n$R_{1/2}$ of at most a few tens of percents, which, galaxy by galaxy, agree\nwell with what Genzel et al. find. b. The asymptotic rotational speeds\npredicted by MOND from the baryonic-mass estimates of Genzel et al. are\nsubstantially lower ($0.55-0.75$) than the maximal speeds of the RCs. MOND thus\npredicts a substantial decline of the RCs beyond the maximum. This too is in\nline with what Genzel et al. find. c. Arguably, the most important lesson is\nthat the findings of Genzel et al. cast very meaningful constraints on possible\nvariation of $a_0$ with cosmic time.

For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial\nand vertical structure from Kama et al. 2016b the observations constrain the\ngas mass to $6\\cdot10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ < M$_{\\rm disk} < 9\\cdot10^{-3}$\nM$_\\odot$. Future observations require a 5$\\sigma$ sensitivity of\n$1.8\\cdot10^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$ ($2.5\\cdot10^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$) and a spectral\nresolving power R > 300 (1000) to detect HD 1-0 (HD 2-1) for all disk masses\nabove $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ with a line-to-continuum ratio > 0.01.

In order to understand the origin of\nsuch abundance spreads, we numerically investigate GC formation from massive\nmolecular clouds (MCs) with fractal structures using our new hydrodynamical\nsimulations with star formation and feedback effects of supernovae (SNe) and\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We particularly investigate star formation\nfrom gas chemically contaminated by SNe and AGB stars within MCs with different\ninitial conditions and environments. The principal results are as follows. GCs\nwith multiple generation of stars can be formed from merging of hierarchical\nstar cluster complexes that are developed from high-density regions of fractal\nMCs. Feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars can control the formation\nefficiencies of stars formed from original gas of MCs and from gas ejected from\nAGB stars. The simulated GCs have radial gradients of helium abundances within\nthe central 3 pc. The original MC masses need to be as large as 10^7 Msun for a\ncanonical initial stellar mass function (IMF) so that the final masses of stars\nformed from AGB ejecta can be 10^5 Msun. Since star formation from AGB ejecta\nis rather prolonged (10^8 yr), their formation can be strongly suppressed by\nSNe of the stars themselves. This result implies that the so-called mass budget\nproblem is much more severe than ever thought in the self-enrichment scenario\nof GC formation. and thus that IMF for the second generation of stars should be\n`top-light'. \n\n"}

We develop a turbulence model for neutrino-driven convection, and\nshow that this turbulence model reduces the condition for explosions by about\n30%, in concordance with multi-dimensional simulations. In addition, we\nidentify which turbulent terms enable explosions. Contrary to prior\nsuggestions, turbulent ram pressure is not the dominant factor in reducing the\ncondition for explosion. Instead, there are many contributing factors, ram\npressure being only one of them, but the dominant factor is turbulent\ndissipation (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra heating, adding significant\nthermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion. The source of this\nTD power is turbulent kinetic energy, which ultimately derives its energy from\nthe higher potential of an unstable convective profile. Investigating a\nturbulence model in conjunction with an explosion condition enables insight\nthat is difficult to glean from merely analyzing complex multi-dimensional\nsimulations. An explosion condition presents a clear diagnostic to explain why\nstars explode, and the turbulence model allows us to explore how turbulence\nenables explosion.

These processes could be responsible for the disruption of lunar\nsystems, the collision of moons with planets or could provide a mechanism for\nthe formation of exorings. Several models have been developed to determine the\nfate of exomoons when subject to the tidal effects of their host planet.

We have found that planetary evolution significantly affects not\nonly the time-scale of exomoon migration but also its final fate. Thus, if any\nchange in planetary radius, internal mass distribution and rotation occurs in\ntime-scales lower or comparable to orbital evolution, exomoon may only migrate\noutwards and prevent tidal disruption or a collision with the planet.

About two dozen of these stellar tidal\ndisruption flares (TDFs) may have been detected in optical transient surveys.\nHowever, explaining the observed properties of these events within the tidal\ndisruption paradigm is not yet possible. This theoretical ambiguity has led\nsome authors to suggest that optical TDFs are due to a different process, such\nas a nuclear supernova or accretion disk instabilities. Here we present a test\nof a fundamental prediction of the tidal disruption event scenario: a\nsuppression of the flare rate due to the direct capture of stars by the black\nhole. Using a recently compiled sample of candidate TDFs with black hole mass\nmeasurements, plus a careful treatment of selection effects in this\nflux-limited sample, we confirm that the dearth of observed TDFs from high-mass\nblack holes is statistically significant. All the TDF impostor models we\nconsider fail to explain the observed mass function; the only scenario that\nfits the data is a suppression of the rate due to direct captures. We find that\nthis suppression can explain the low volumetric rate of the luminous TDF\ncandidate ASASSN-15lh, thus supporting the hypothesis that this flare belongs\nto the TDF family.

This historical\nevent confirms the origin of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and in\nparticular, identifies the theoretically-predicted kilonova phenomenon that is\npowered by radioactive decays of $r$-process heavy elements.

While the early emission of AT2017gfo is still powered\nradioactively as usually suggested, its late emission is primarily caused by\ndelayed energy injection from the remnant NS.

Moment of inertia, on the\nother hand, depends on the mass and spin of the neutron star as well as the\nequation of state of the matter. If at least one member of the double neutron\nstar binary (better the faster one) is a radio pulsar, then accurate timing\nanalysis might lead to the estimation of the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance, which will lead to the measurement of the\nmoment of inertia of the pulsar. Combination of the knowledge on the values of\nthe moment of inertia, the mass, and the spin of the pulsar, will give a new\nconstraint on the equation of state. Pulsars in double neutron star binaries\nare the best for this purpose as short orbits and moderately high\neccentricities make the Lense-Thirring effect substantial, whereas tidal\neffects are negligible (unlike pulsars with main sequence or white-dwarf\nbinaries). The most promising pulsars are PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854.\nThe spin-precession of pulsars due to the misalignment between the spin and the\norbital angular momentum vectors affect the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance. This effect has been explored for both PSR\nJ0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854, and as the misalignment angles for both of\nthese pulsars are small, the variation in the Lense-Thirring term is not much.\nHowever, to extract the Lense-Thirring effect from the observed rate of the\nperiastron advance, more accurate timing solutions including precise proper\nmotion and distance measurements are essential. \n\n"}

VLBA Observations of Ten\n  Sources at 43 and 86~GHz Abstract: Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), hosting powerful relativistic jet\noutflows, provide an excellent laboratory for studying jet physics. Very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-resolution imaging on\nmilli-arcsecond (mas) and sub-mas scales, making it a powerful tool to explore\nthe inner jet structure, shedding light on the formation, acceleration and\ncollimation of AGN jets.

In this paper, we critically\nreview those constraints and find several caveats on the analysis. First of\nall, the constraints on the fraction $\\alpha$ of PBH in matter seem to be\ndriven by a very restrictive choice of priors on the cosmological parameters.\nIn particular, the degeneracy between $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$ and $\\alpha$ is ignored\nand thus, by fixing $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, transferred the constraining power of SN\nmagnitudes to $\\alpha$. Furthermore, by considering more realistic physical\nsizes for the type-Ia supernovae, we find an effect on the SN lensing\nmagnification distribution that leads to significantly looser constraints.\nMoreover, considering a wide mass spectrum of PBH, such as a lognormal\ndistribution, further softens the constraints from SN lensing.

Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising\nsources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger\nresults because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this\nwork, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the\nsources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear\ncomposition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the\nnuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the\nmass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the\nconnection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider\nthe hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR\nnuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is\neasier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically\npropagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models\nand compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results\nshow that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the\nAuger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in\nfitting the spectrum. We argue that our model is consistent with the newly\nreported cross correlation between the UHECRs and starburst galaxies, since\nboth LL GRBs and hypernovae are expected to be tracers of the star-formation\nactivity.

Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a\nmeasurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest\nspectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but\nare manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen.

In all models the galactic disk is\nexponential and the halos are rigid or live Plummer spheres. More specifically,\nwhen there is no dark matter halo, we modify the gravitational force between\npoint particles. To do so we use the weak field limit of an alternative theory\nof dark matter known as MOG in the literature. The galaxy model in MOG has the\nsame initial conditions as in galaxy models with dark matter halo. On the other\nhand, the initial random velocities and the Toomre's local stability parameter\nare the same for all the models. We show that the evolution and growth of the\nbar in MOG is substantially different from the standard cases including dark\nmatter halo. More importantly, we find that the bar growth rate and its final\nmagnitude is smaller in MOG. On the other hand, the maximum value of the bar in\nMOG is smaller than the Newtonian models. It is shown that although the live\ndark matter halo may support the bar instability, MOG has stabilizing effects.\nFurthermore, we show that MOG supports fast pattern speeds, and unlike in the\ndark matter halo models pattern speed does not decrease with time. Theses\ndifferences, combined with the relevant observations, may help to distinguish\nbetween dark matter an modified gravity in galactic scales. \n\n"}

Especially, the observation of GW170104\nsuggests dynamically assembled binaries favoring a distribution of misaligned\nspins. It has been argued that mergers of unassociated BHs can be engendered\nthrough a \"chance meeting\" in a multiple BH system under gas-rich environments.\nIn this paper, we consider the merger of unassociated BHs, concordant with the\nmassive BH merger events. To that end, we simulate a multiple BH system with a\npost-Newtonian $N$-body code incorporating gas accretion and general\nrelativistic effects. As a result, we find that gas dynamical friction\neffectively promotes three-body interaction of BHs in dense gas of\n$n_\\mathrm{gas}\\gtrsim 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, so that BH mergers can take\nplace within $30$ Myr.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

We show how this equation nonetheless\nfollows from a more general, causal theory of heat propagation in which the\nentropy plays the role of a fluid. In deriving this result, however, we see\nthat it is necessary to make some assumptions which are not universally valid:\nthe dynamical timescales of the process must be long compared with the\nexplicitly causal physics of the theory, the heat flow must be sufficiently\nsteady, and the spacetime static. Generalising the heat equation (e.g.\nrestoring causality) would thus entail retaining some of the terms we\nneglected. As a first extension, we derive the heat equation for the spacetime\nassociated with a slowly-rotating star or black hole, showing that it only\ndiffers from the static result by an additional advection term due to the\nrotation, and as a consequence demonstrate that a hotspot on a neutron star\nwill be seen to be modulated at the rotation frequency by a distant observer. \n\n"}

However, the expected properties and distribution of such events is\nnot well understood. Here we characterize the rates of such events, their delay\ntime distribution, their progenitors and the distribution of their properties.\nWe use binary populations synthesis models and consider a wide range of initial\nconditions and physical processes.

We\nfind that the majority of NS-WD mergers are born in systems in which\nmass-transfer played an important role, and the WD formed before the NS. For\nthe majority of the mergers the WDs have a carbon-oxygen composition (60-80%)\nand most of the rest are with oxygen-neon WDs. The rates of NS-WD mergers are\nin the range of 3-15% of the type Ia supernovae (SNe) rate. Their delay time\ndistribution is very similar to that of type Ia SNe, but slightly biased\ntowards earlier times.

In contrast with previous\nstudies, we find that such exo-Milankovitch cycles tend to impair habitability\nby inducing snowball states within the habitable zone.

This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU).

We adopt a novel approach to resolve the two-stage formation of GCs\nin hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies.In the new simulations, new gas\nparticles that are much less massive than their parent star particle are\ngenerated around each new star particle when the new star enters into the\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Furthermore, much finer maximum time step\nwidth (<10^5 yr) and smaller softening length (<2 pc) are adopted for such AGB\ngas particles to properly resolve the ejection of gas from AGB stars and AGB\nfeedback effects. Therefore, secondary star formation from AGB ejecta can be\nproperly investigated in galaxy-scale simulations. An FG stellar system can\nfirst form from a massive gas clump developing due to gravitational instability\nwithin its host gas-rich dwarf galaxy. Initially the FG stellar system is not a\nsingle massive cluster, but instead is composed of several irregular stellar\nclumps (or filaments) with a total mass larger than 10^6 Msun. While the FG\nsystem is dynamically relaxing, gaseous ejecta from AGB stars can be\ngravitationally trapped by the FG system and subsequently converted into new\nstars to form a compact SG stellar system within the FG system. Interestingly,\nabout 40% of AGB ejecta is from stars that do not belong to the FG system\n(`external gas accretion'). The mass-density relation for SG stellar systems\ncan be approximated as rho_SG ~ M_SG^1.5. \n\n"}

One could test each theory against observed data one at a\ntime, though a more efficient approach would be to first probe gravity in a\ntheory-agnostic way and map such information to that on specific theories\nafterward.

Moreover, we derive gravitational\nwaveforms in theories with varying gravitational constant. We extend the\nprevious work by introducing two gravitational constants (the conservative one\nentering in the binding energy and the dissipative one entering in the\ngravitational wave luminosity) and allowing masses of binary constituents to\nvary with time. We also correct some errors in previous literature. Our results\ncan be used to improve current analyses of testing general relativity as well\nas to achieve new projected constraints on many modified theories of gravity. \n\n"}

These features, most clearly seen in the late-time spectra\nof the bright, recent type Ia supernovae ASASSN-14lp and SN 2017bzc, appear as\nnarrow absorptions at ~4840 A, ~5000 A, and as a sharp inflection at ~4760 A on\nthe red side of the prominent late-time 4700 A feature.

The protoplanetary disk at that time was already truncated around the\nKuiper-cliff (at $45$ au) by encounters with another cluster members before it\nwas enriched by the wind of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star. The supernova explosion\nof a nearby star, possibly but not necessarily the exploding Wolf-Rayet star,\nheated the disk to $\\apgt 1500$K, melting small dust grains and causing the\nencapsulation and preservation of $^{26}$Al into vitreous droplets. This\nsupernova, and possibly several others, caused a further abrasion of the disk\nand led to its observed tilt of $5.6\\pm1.2^\\circ$ with respect to the Sun's\nequatorial plane.

Compared to previous empirical libraries, the\nMaStar library will have a higher number of stars and a more comprehensive\nstellar-parameter coverage, especially of cool dwarfs, low-metallicity stars,\nand stars with different [alpha/Fe], achieved by a sophisticated target\nselection strategy that takes advantage of stellar-parameter catalogs from the\nliterature. This empirical library will provide a new basis for stellar\npopulation synthesis, and is particularly well-suited for stellar-population\nanalysis of MaNGA galaxies.

The favored mechanism at their origin is a\nsustained power injection from a magnetar. This study presents non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of\nvarious single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars\nof diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after\nexplosion. Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition\nprofile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main\ninfluence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta\non week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,\nshifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted\nsolar metallicity), creating blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and\nmagnetar properties introduces various stretches and shifts to the light curve\n(rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum, all\nmodels show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely\nOIII and CIII lines. Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the\nhigh-brightness phase. After maximum, higher energy explosions are hotter and\nmore ionized, and produce spectra that are optically bluer. Clumping is a\nsource of spectral diversity after maximum. Clumping is essential to trigger\nejecta recombination and yield the presence of OI, CaII, and FeII lines from a\nfew weeks after maximum until nebular times. The UV and optical spectrum of\nGaia16apd at maximum or the nebular spectrum of LSQ14an at +410d are compatible\nwith some models that assume no clumping.

The millimeter continuum\ndata confirm that the 2 cm flux from the supernebula is optically thick; the\nLyman continuum rate derived from the 1.3 mm continuum is N$_{Lyc} \\sim\n6x10^{52} s^{-1}$ for the central ~20''. CO may underestimate the true\nmolecular column density, as expected for a low metallicity system, although\nthere are regions along the dust lane that appear to have near-Galactic\nconversion factors. We estimate a total molecular gas mass of $M_{H_{2}}\\lsim\n10^{7} M_{\\odot}$. The molecular gas in the dust lane is falling into the\ngalaxy, supporting an accretion hypothesis. The dust lane gas cannot therefore\nbe causally associated with the current burst of star formation. A relatively\nsmall amount, $M_{H_{2}}\\lsim 5x10^{5} M_{\\odot}$, of molecular gas is\nassociated with the current starburst. We estimate a star formation efficiency\nof at least 25 % and more likely ~75 %, consistent with the formation of a\nbound cluster. Despite the extreme youth of the starburst, the specific trigger\nof the starburst remains elusive, although the infall of gas in the dust lane\nsuggests that there is more star formation to come in NGC 5253. \n\n"}

Using the standard isobaric cooling\nflow model, we study the ability of such metallicity variations to\npreferentially suppress low-temperature line emission in cooling flow spectra.\nWe then use simple numerical simulations to investigate the temporal and\nspatial evolution of the ICM when the metals are distributed in such a fashion.\nSimulated observations are used to study the constraints real data can place on\nconditions in the ICM. The difficulty of ruling out abundance variations on\nsmall spatial scales with current observational limits is emphasized. We find\nthat a bimodal distribution of metals may give rise to interesting effects in\nthe observed abundance profile, in that apparent abundance gradients with\ncentral abundance drops and off-centre peaks, similar to those seen recently in\nsome clusters, are produced. Different elements behave in different fashion as\ngoverned by the temperature dependence of their equivalent widths. Our overall\nconclusion is that, whilst this process alone seems unlikely to be able to\naccount for the sharp reduction in low temperature emission lines seen in\ncurrent spectral data, a contribution at some level is possible and difficult\nto rule out. The possibility of small-scale metallicity variations should be\nconsidered when analysing high resolution cluster X-ray spectra. \n\n"}

Realistic MC calculations for\nthe heating rate and shear stress tensor should give an answer to the\nperplexing problem for the missing viscosity in accretion disks and reveal why\nthe quasars are the most powerful sources of light in the universe. The planned\nMC calculations can be incorporated in global models for accretion disks and\nalso in all other physical conditions where there is a shear flow in a\nmagnetized turbulent plasma. It is supposed that the heating mechanism by\nAlfven waves absorption is common for many kinds of space plasmas from solar\ncorona to active galactic nuclei and the solution of these longstanding puzzles\ndeserves active interdisciplinary research. The work is illustrated by\nnumerical calculations and by exact solutions for the time dependence of the\nmagnetic field given by the Heun function. \n\n"}

In this paper, we systematically analyze the\npossible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X-ray\nafterglow lightcurves, and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest\nthat the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the\nprompt gamma-ray bursts and/or of the X-ray flares. This provides clear\nevidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are two distinct\ncomponents, supporting the internal origin of the GRB prompt emission. The\nshallow decay segment observed in a group of GRBs suggests that the forward\nshock keeps being refreshed for some time. This might be caused either by a\nlong-lived central engine, or by a power law distribution of the shell Lorentz\nfactors, or else by the deceleration of a Poynting flux dominated flow. X-ray\nflares suggest that the GRB central engine is still active after the prompt\ngamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times. In some\ncases, the central engine activity even extends days after the burst trigger.\nAnalyses of early X-ray afterglow data reveal that GRBs are indeed highly\nrelativistic events.

We focus on the\nevolution of systems expected in a LCDM universe.\n  Our goal is to examine which structural properties of disk galaxies may\nresult from secular evolution rather than from direct hierarchical assembly. In\nthe vertical direction, we find that various mechanisms can lead to heating.\nThe strongest heating occurs during the vertical buckling instability of a bar.\nAmong the consequences of this instability is the formation of peanut-shaped\nbulges which produce clear kinematic signatures when observed face-on. We find\nthat bars are robust structures that are not destroyed by buckling. They can be\ndestroyed instead by a central mass concentration but we find that this mass\nneeds to be a large fraction of the total mass of the disk.

Opinion over the last few years has coalesced around the\nview that the short-hard bursts arise from the merger of pairs of neutron\nstars, or a neutron star merging with a stellar-mass black hole. The natural\ntimescales associated with these processes, however, essentially preclude an\nX-ray flare lasting ~100 s. Here we show that an interaction between the GRB\noutflow and a non-compact stellar companion at a distance of ~a light-minute\nprovides a natural explanation for the flares. In the model, the burst is\ntriggered by the collapse of a neutron star after accreting matter from the\ncompanion. This is reminiscent of type Ia supernovae, where there is a wide\ndistribution of delay times between formation and explosion, leading to an\nassociation with both star-forming galaxies and old ellipticals. \n\n"}

Interpreting the Radio/UV correlations in\n  quasars Abstract: We investigate the correlation between the accretion disk (UV) luminosity and\nthe radio core emission of a quasar sample. In a radio/$L_{\\rm disk}$ plot we\nfind the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars\n(CDQ), lobe dominated quasars (LDQ), radio-intermediate quasars (RIQ) and radio\nweak quasars. In general the radio core emission scales with the disk\nluminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. This shows that radio and UV\nemission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loud\nand radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. We investigate the\npossibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission in\nradio loud and radio weak quasars. Comparing our data with a simple jet\nemission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation in\na coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry a\ntotal power $Q_{\\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity\n$L_{\\rm disk}$. For the electron population one is forced to postulate an\nefficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electrons\nwith a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 MeV -- secondary pair\nproduction in hadronic cascades could be such a process. The bulk Lorentz\nfactor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\\la\\gamma_{\\rm j}\\la10$)).\nThe radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the same\nparameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, as\nsuggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. There is evidence that RIQ are the\nrelativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. We can estimate\nthe hidden disk luminosity of FR II galaxies and find that this is consistent\nwith FRII being misdirected quasars. \n\n"}

This uncertainty is mainly due to the degeneracy of the\nlens parameters in the measured Einstein timescales. The degeneracy can be\nlifted in a general fashion if the angular Einstein ring radius $\\theta_{\\rm\nE}$, and thus the MACHO proper motion, can be measured by conducting accurate\nastrometric measurements of centroid displacement in the source star image.\n  In this paper, we analyze the influence of bright lenses on the astrometric\nmeasurements of the centroid displacement and investigate this effect on the\ndetermination of $\\theta_{\\rm E}$. We find that if an event is caused by a\nbright lens, the centroid displacement is distorted by the flux of the lens and\nresulting astrometric ellipse becomes rounder and smaller with increasing lens\nbrightness, causing an incorrect determination of the angular Einstein ring\nradius. A lens-blended event cannot be distinguished from a dark lens event\nfrom the trajectory of the measured centroid displacements alone because both\nevents have elliptical trajectories: the degeneracy between dark and bright\nlens events.

We\nassume that the initial and final stages of the background cosmological model\nare given by de Sitter and Minkowski phases, respectively, and they are\nconnected smoothly by a radiation-dominated phase. This setup allows us to\ndiscuss the quantum-mechanical generation of the perturbations and to see the\nfinal amplitude of the well-defined zero mode. Using the Wronskian formulation,\nwe numerically compute the power spectrum of gravitational waves, and find that\nthe effect of initial vacuum fluctuations in the Kaluza-Klein modes is\nsubdominant, contributing not more than 10% of the total power spectrum. Thus\nit is confirmed that the damping due to the Kaluza-Klein mode generation and\nthe enhancement due to the modification of the background Friedmann equation\nare the two dominant effects, but they cancel each other, leading to the same\nspectral tilt as the standard four-dimensional result. Kaluza-Klein gravitons\nthat escape from the brane contribute to the energy density of the dark\nradiation at late times. We show that a tiny amount of the dark radiation is\ngenerated due to this process. \n\n"}

With these search procedures,\nexploration is difficult in \"rugged\" fitness landscapes, where small mutations\ncan drastically change functionalities in an organism. Random Boolean networks\n(RBNs), being general models, can be used to explore theories of how evolution\ncan take place in rugged landscapes; or even change the landscapes.\n  In this paper, we study the effect that redundant nodes have on the\nrobustness of RBNs. Using computer simulations, we have found that the addition\nof redundant nodes to RBNs increases their robustness. We conjecture that\nredundancy is a way of \"smoothening\" fitness landscapes. Therefore, redundancy\ncan facilitate evolutionary searches. However, too much redundancy could reduce\nthe rate of adaptation of an evolutionary process.

In\nparticular, biological networks can display a quadratic growth in regulator\nnumber with genome size even while remaining sparsely connected. These features\nare mutually incompatible in standard treatments of network theory which\ntypically require that every new network node possesses at least one\nconnection. To model sparsely connected networks, we generalize existing\napproaches and add each new node with a probabilistic number of links to\ngenerate either accelerating, hyper-accelerating, or even decelerating network\nstatistics in different regimes. Under preferential attachment for example,\nslowly accelerating networks display stationary scale-free statistics\nrelatively independent of network size while more rapidly accelerating networks\ndisplay a transition from scale-free to exponential statistics with network\ngrowth. Such transitions explain, for instance, the evolutionary record of\nsingle-celled organisms which display strict size and complexity limits. \n\n"}

By posing the problem\nin terms of information theory, we may do this without specifying the function\nperformed by the network. Specifically, we study the maximum mutual information\nbetween the input (chemical) signal and the output (genetic) response\nattainable by the network in the context of an analytic model of particle\nnumber fluctuations. We perform this analysis for all biochemical circuits,\nincluding various feedback loops, that can be built out of 3 chemical species,\neach under the control of one regulator. We find that a generic network,\nconstrained to low molecule numbers and reasonable response times, can\ntransduce more information than a simple binary switch and, in fact, manages to\nachieve close to the optimal information transmission fidelity. These\nhigh-information solutions are robust to tenfold changes in most of the\nnetworks' biochemical parameters; moreover they are easier to achieve in\nnetworks containing cycles with an odd number of negative regulators (overall\nnegative feedback) due to their decreased molecular noise (a result which we\nderive analytically). Finally, we demonstrate that a single circuit can support\nmultiple high-information solutions. These findings suggest a potential\nresolution of the \"cross-talk\" dilemma as well as the previously unexplained\nobservation that transcription factors which undergo proteolysis are more\nlikely to be auto-repressive. \n\n"}
