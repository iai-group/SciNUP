In this paper we advance\nlow-regularity Riemannian geometry by investigating general length structures\non manifolds that are equipped with Riemannian metrics of low regularity. We\ngeneralize the length structure by proving that the class of absolutely\ncontinuous curves induces the standard metric space structure. The main result\nstates that the arc-length of absolutely continuous curves is the same as the\nlength induced by the metric. For the proof we use techniques from the analysis\nof metric spaces and employ specific smooth approximations of continuous\nRiemannian metrics. We thus show that when dealing with lengths of curves, the\nmetric approach for low-regularity Riemannnian manifolds is still compatible\nwith standard definitions and can successfully fill in for lack of\ndifferentiability. \n\n"}

While the upward\nrobustness (referring to the increase of $N$) of smooth, homogeneous convex\nsolids is known to be zero, little is known about their downward robustness.\nThe difficulty of the latter problem is related to the coupling (via integrals)\nbetween the geometry of the hull $\\bd K$ and the location of the center of\ngravity $G$. Here we first investigate two simpler, decoupled problems by\nexamining truncations of $\\bd K$ with $G$ fixed, and displacements of $G$ with\n$\\bd K$ fixed, leading to the concept of external \\rm and internal \\rm\nrobustness, respectively. In dimension 2, we find that for any fixed number\n$N=2S$, the convex solids with both maximal external and maximal internal\nrobustness are regular $S$-gons. Based on this result we conjecture that\nregular polygons have maximal downward robustness also in the original, coupled\nproblem. We also show that in the decoupled problems, 3-dimensional regular\npolyhedra have maximal internal robustness, however, only under additional\nconstraints.

For a\nstationary Boolean model with convex grains we consider a recently developed\ncollection of shape descriptors, the so called Minkowski tensors. By combining\nspatial and probabilistic averaging we define Minkowski tensor densities of a\nBoolean model. These densities are global characteristics of the union set\nwhich can be estimated from observations. In contrast local characteristics\nlike the mean Minkowski tensor of a single random particle cannot be observed\ndirectly, since the particles overlap. We relate the global to the local\nproperties by density formulas for the Minkowski tensors. These density\nformulas generalize the well known formulas for intrinsic volume densities and\nare obtained by applying results from translative integral geometry. For an\nisotropic Boolean model we observe that the Minkowski tensor densities are\nproportional to the intrinsic volume densities, whereas for a non-isotropic\nBoolean model this is usually not the case. Our results support the idea that\nthe degree of anisotropy of a Boolean model may be expressed in terms of the\nMinkowski tensor densities. Furthermore we observe that for smooth grains the\nmean curvature radius function of a particle can be reconstructed from the\nMinkowski tensor densities. In a simulation study we determine numerically\nMinkowski tensor densities for non-isotropic Boolean models based on ellipses\nand on rectangles in two dimensions and find excellent agreement with the\nderived analytic density formulas. The tensor densities can be used to\ncharacterize the orientational distribution of the grains and to estimate model\nparameters for non-isotropic distributions. \n\n"}

The purpose of our study is to lay\ngeometric foundations for statistical analysis of SPD matrices, in situations\nin which eigenstructure is of fundamental importance, for example\ndiffusion-tensor imaging (DTI).

More specifically,\nthe main question addressed is the uniformization of planar Sierpinski carpets\nby square Sierpinski carpets, using methods of potential theory on carpets.\n  We first develop a potential theory and study harmonic functions on planar\nSierpinski carpets. We introduce a discrete notion of Sobolev spaces on\nSierpinski carpets and use this to define harmonic functions. Our approach\ndiffers from the classical approach of potential theory in metric spaces\nbecause it takes the ambient space that contains the carpet into account. We\nprove basic properties such as the existence and uniqueness of the solution to\nthe Dirichlet problem, Liouville's theorem, Harnack's inequality, strong\nmaximum principle, and equicontinuity of harmonic functions.\n  Then we utilize this notion of harmonic functions to prove a uniformization\nresult for Sierpinski carpets. Namely, it is proved that every planar\nSierpinski carpet whose peripheral disks are uniformly fat, uniform quasiballs\ncan be mapped to a square Sierpinski carpet with a map that preserves carpet\nmodulus. If the assumptions on the peripheral circles are strengthened to\nuniformly relatively separated, uniform quasicircles, then the map is a\nquasisymmetry. The real part of the uniformizing map is the solution of a\ncertain Dirichlet-type problem. Then a harmonic conjugate of that map is\nconstructed using the methods developed by Rajala arXiv:1412.3348. \n\n"}

Some basic properties of the general dual\nvolume and of the dual Orlicz curvature measure, such as the continuous\ndependence on the underlying set, are provided. These are required to study a\nMinkowski-type problem for the dual Orlicz curvature measure. We mainly focus\non the case when $G$ and $\\psi$ are both increasing, thus complementing our\nprevious work.\n  The Minkowski problem asks to characterize Borel measures $\\mu$ on $\\sphere$\nfor which there is a convex body $K$ in $\\R^n$ containing the origin such that\n$\\mu$ equals $\\deV(K, \\cdot)$, up to a constant.

For\nalgebras defined by quivers (i.e. directed graphs) with relations the\ncomputation of the entries of the Cartan matrix amounts to counting nonzero\npaths in the quivers, leading naturally to a combinatorial setting. In this\npaper we study a refined version, so-called q-Cartan matrices, where each\nnonzero path is weighted by a power of an indeterminant q according to its\nlength. Specializing q=1 gives the classical Cartan matrix. Our main motivation\nare derived module categories and their invariants: the invariant factors, and\nhence the determinant, of the Cartan matrix are preserved by derived\nequivalences. The paper deals with the important class of (skewed-) gentle\nalgebras which occur naturally in representation theory, especially in the\ncontext of derived categories. These algebras are defined in purely\ncombinatorial terms. We determine normal forms for the Cartan matrices of\n(skewed-) gentle algebras.
