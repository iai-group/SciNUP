Two-Time Physics has shown\nthat the Standard Model of Particles and Forces is successfully reproduced by a\ntwo-time field theory in 4 space and 2 time dimensions projected as a\nholographic image on an emergent spacetime in 3+1 dimensions. Among the\nsuccesses of this approach is the resolution of the strong CP problem of QCD as\nan outcome of the restrictions imposed by the higher symmetry structures in 4+2\ndimensions. In this paper we launch a program to construct the duals of the\nStandard Model as other holographic images of the same 4+2 dimensional theory\non a variety of emergent spacetimes in 3+1 dimensions. These dual field\ntheories are obtained as a family of gauge choices in the master 4+2 field\ntheory. In the present paper we deal with some of the simpler gauge choices\nwhich lead to interacting Klein-Gordon field theories for the conformal scalar\nwith a predicted SO(d,2) symmetry in a variety of interesting curved spacetimes\nin (d-1)+1 dimensions. More challenging and more interesting gauge choices\n(including some that relate to mass) which are left to future work are also\noutlined. Through this approach we discover a new realm of previously\nunexplored dualities and hidden symmetries that exist both in the macroscopic\nand microscopic worlds, at the classical and quantum levels. Such phenomena\npredicted by 2T-physics can in principle be confirmed both by theory and\nexperiment. 1T-physics can be used to analyze the predictions but in most\ninstances gives no clue that the predicted phenomena exist in the first place.\nThis point of view suggests a new paradigm for the construction of a\nfundamental theory that is likely to impact on the quest for unification. \n\n"}

Its effects include the erasing of memory\nwith respect to the initial condition, a partial attenuation of geometrically\noriginated instabilities, and the restoring of universality in some special\ncases in which the critical exponents depend on the parameters of the equation\nof motion. In this sense, dilution rends the dynamics more similar to the usual\none of planar systems.

A crucial step in our associative algebraic\napproach to bulk logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) is then the analysis\nof the spin chain as a bimodule over U_q^{odd} sl(2) and JTL. While our\nultimate goal is to use this bimodule to deduce properties of the LCFT in the\ncontinuum limit, its derivation is sufficiently involved to be the sole subject\nof this paper. We describe representation theory of the centralizer and then\nuse it to find a decomposition of the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain over JTL for\nany even number N of tensorands and ultimately a corresponding bimodule\nstructure. Applications of our results to the analysis of the bulk LCFT will\nthen be discussed in the third part of this series. \n\n"}

Starting with a cylinder, the\ncommuting periodic single-row transfer matrices are built from the periodic\nTemperley-Lieb algebra extended by the shift operators Omega and Omega^{-1}. In\nthis enlarged algebra, the non-contractible loop fugacity is alpha and the\ncontractible loop fugacity is beta. The torus is formed by gluing the top and\nbottom of the cylinder. This gives rise to a variety of non-contractible loops\nwinding around the torus. Because of their nonlocal nature, the standard matrix\ntrace does not produce the proper geometric torus. Instead, we introduce a\nmodified matrix trace for this purpose. This is achieved by using a\nrepresentation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra with a parameter\nv that keeps track of the winding of defects on the cylinder.

The first\nmechanism is related to an induced Einstein-Hilbert term on warped brane\nworldvolumes, which leads to a shift in the classical volume of the\ncompactification manifold. The resulting corrections are generic and can appear\nat one-loop order on branes and O-planes of various dimensions and for\nconfigurations with or without intersections.

The coefficients of the\nscale-fixed couplings are identical to the corresponding conformal series with\nzero $\\beta$-function.

For the Ricci tensor it is shown that a localized zero mode\nexists while that is not possible for the Einstein tensor.

Using this twistorial representation we\nstudy the action of the conformal group SU(2,2) on the classical phase space of\nloop quantum gravity, described by twisted geometry.

The interaction thus obtained is in general\nnon-local, but has the key feature that it is expressed solely in terms of the\nalgebra for the open spin chain - the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebra and its\nblob algebra generalization. This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin\nchains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic\nTL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are\nknown to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid\ntranslation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the\nopen model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip. This\nstatement has a precise mathematical formulation, which is a pull-back map\nbetween irreducible modules of, respectively, the blob algebra and the affine\nTL algebra. We then turn to the same kind of analysis for two models whose\ncontinuum limits are Logarithmic CFTs - the alternating gl(1|1) and sl(2|1)\nspin chains. We find that the result for minimal models does not hold any\nlonger: braid translation of the relevant TL modules does not give rise to the\nmodules known to be present in the periodic chains. In the gl(1|1) case, the\ncontent in terms of the irreducibles is the same, as well as the spectrum, but\nthe detailed structure (like logarithmic coupling) is profoundly different.\nThis carries over to the continuum limit. \n\n"}

We show that the same\nformalism can also be used to derive the Brown-York mass and the Bondi mass for\nstationary space times, in particular the Brown-York mass has a natural\ninterpretation in terms of differential forms on the space of solutions of the\ntheory. \n\n"}

The conditions derived from this principle include a version of the\nLeibniz rule (or ``action Ward identity'') and a condition on time-ordered\nproducts that contain a factor of the free field $\\phi$ or the free\nstress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$.

In\nthis paper we investigate whether ANEC holds for solutions to this equation, by\nstudying a free, massless scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling in\nperturbation theory to second order about the flat spacetime/vacuum solution.\nWe \"reduce the order\" of the perturbation equations to eliminate spurious\nsolutions, and consider the limit in which the lengthscales determined by the\nincoming state are much larger than the Planck length.

For such a braneworld cosmology, the difficulty of\njustifying some preferred initial conditions inevitably arises. The various\nproposals for inflation restricted to the brane only partially explain the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the resulting braneworld universe because the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the bulk must be assumed.
