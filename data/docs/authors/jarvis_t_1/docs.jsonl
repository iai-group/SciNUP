The branch curve is usually\nsingular, but is classically known to have only cusps and nodes as\nsingularities for a generic projection.\n  Several questions arise.

Previously we have found all rational solutions of the\n2-dimensional projective translation equation, or PrTE,\n(1-z)f(X)=f(f(Xz)(1-z)/z); here f(X)=(u(x,y),v(x,y)) is a pair of two (real or\ncomplex) functions. Solutions of this functional equation are called projective\nflows. A vector field of a rational flow is a pair of 2-homogenic rational\nfunctions. On the other hand, only special pairs of 2-homogenic rational\nfunctions give rise to rational flows. In this paper we are interested in all\nnon-singular (satisfying the boundary condition) and unramified (without\nbranching points, i.e. single-valued functions in C^2\\{union of curves})\nprojective flows whose vector field is still rational. We prove that, up to\nconjugation with 1-homogenic birational plane transformation, these are of 6\ntypes: 1) the identity flow; 2) one flow for each non-negative integer N -\nthese flows are rational of level N; 3) the level 1 exponential flow, which is\nalso conjugate to the level 1 tangent flow; 4) the level 3 flow expressable in\nterms of Dixonian (equianharmonic) elliptic functions; 5) the level 4 flow\nexpressable in terms of lemniscatic elliptic functions; 6) the level 6 flow\nexpressable in terms of Dixonian elliptic functions again.

By virtue of contributions from a long\nlist of mathematicians, notably Weyl (1912), Horn (1962), Klyachko (1998) and\nKnutson-Tao (1999), the problem is finally settled. The solution asserts that\nthe eigenvalues of A+B are given in terms of certain system of linear\ninequalities in the eigenvalues of A and B. These inequalities are given\nexplicitly in terms of certain triples of Schubert classes in the singular\ncohomology of Grassmannians and the standard cup product.

The Hermitian\neigenvalue problem has been extended by Berenstein-Sjamaar (2000) and\nKapovich-Leeb-Millson (2005) for any semisimple complex algebraic group G.\nTheir solution is again in terms of a system of linear inequalities obtained\nfrom certain triples of Schubert classes in the singular cohomology of the\npartial flag varieties G/P (P being a maximal parabolic subgroup) and the\nstandard cup product.

It specializes to the Euler characteristic of the original\nvariety but also contains information on the variation of Hodge structure\nassociated to the degeneration which is encoded as a limit mixed Hodge\nstructure. However, this invariant is difficult to compute in practice. Using\nthe techniques of tropical geometry we present a new formula for the motivic\nnearby fiber. Moreover, since there is a range of available software\nimplementing the main algorithms in tropical geometry, our formula can be\ncomputed in practice. We specialize to the case of families of sch\\\"{o}n\ncomplex hypersurfaces of tori where we provide explicit formulas describing the\naction of the unipotent part of monodromy on the graded pieces (with respect to\nthe Deligne weight filtration) of the cohomology with compact supports.

Recently, however, evidence has been amassing that simply increasing\ndepth may not be the best way to increase performance, particularly given other\nlimitations. Investigations into deep residual networks have also suggested\nthat they may not in fact be operating as a single deep network, but rather as\nan ensemble of many relatively shallow networks. We examine these issues, and\nin doing so arrive at a new interpretation of the unravelled view of deep\nresidual networks which explains some of the behaviours that have been observed\nexperimentally. As a result, we are able to derive a new, shallower,\narchitecture of residual networks which significantly outperforms much deeper\nmodels such as ResNet-200 on the ImageNet classification dataset. We also show\nthat this performance is transferable to other problem domains by developing a\nsemantic segmentation approach which outperforms the state-of-the-art by a\nremarkable margin on datasets including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and\nCityscapes.

It is also natural to\nconsider quiver representations in a richer category, namely that of vector\nbundles on some complex variety equipped with a fixed sheaf that twists the\nmorphisms. Representations of A-type quivers in this twisted category --- known\nin the literature as \"holomorphic chains\" --- have practical use in questions\nconcerning the topology of the moduli space of Higgs bundles. In that problem,\nthe variety is a Riemann surface of genus at least 2, and the twist is its\ncanonical line bundle. We extend the treatment of twisted A-type quiver\nrepresentations to any genus using the Hitchin stability condition induced by\nHiggs bundles and computing their deformation theory. We then focus in\nparticular on so-called \"argyle quivers\", where the rank labelling alternates\nbetween 1 and integers $r_i\\geq1$.

The pushing forward after pulling back that has been\nused to give a global stringy extension of the functors K_0,K^{top},A^*,H^*\n[CR, FG, AGV, JKK2], and the pulling back after having pushed forward, which we\nhave previously used in our (re)-construction program for G-Frobenius algebras,\nnotably in considerations of singularities with symmetries and for symmetric\nproducts. A similar approach was also used by [CH] in their considerations of\nthe Chen-Ruan product in a deRham setting for Abelian orbifolds.\n  We show that the pull-push formalism has a solution by the push-pull\nequations in two situations. The first is a deRham formalism with Thom\npush-forward maps and the second is the setting of cyclic twisted sectors,\nwhich was at the heart of the (re)-construction program.\n  We go on to do formal calculations using fractional Euler classes which\nallows us to formally treat all the stringy multiplications mentioned above in\nthe general setting. The upshot is the formal trivialization of the co-cycles\nof the reconstruction program using the presentation of the obstruction bundle\nof [JKK2]. \n\n"}

Fix any positive real number c, and consider the multiplier ideal J\nof the sum a_1+...+a_r with weighting coefficient c. We construct an exact\nsequence resolving J by sheaves over X that are direct sums of multiplier\nideals for products a_1^{v_1}...a_r^{v_r} for various real vectors v such that\nv_1+...+v_r = c. The resolution is cellular, in the sense that its boundary\nmaps are encoded by the algebraic chain complex of a regular CW-complex. The\nCW-complex is naturally expressed as a triangulation T of the simplex of\nnonnegative real vectors summing to c. The acyclicity of our resolution reduces\nto that of a cellular free resolution, supported on T, of a related monomial\nideal. This acyclicity rests on a comparison between the homology of certain\nhomology-manifolds-with-boundary and the homology of the simplicial complexes\nobtained by deleting collections of boundary faces from them. Our resolution\nimplies the multiplier ideal sum formula J((a_1+...+a_r)^c) = \\sum_{|v|=c}\nJ(a_1^{v_1}...a_r^{v_r}), which implicitly follows from Takagi's proof of the\ntwo-summand formula (math.AG/0410612).

{"id": "math/9812060", "contents": "Title: Donaldson invariants and wall-crossing formulas. I: Continuity of gluing\n  maps Abstract: The present article is the first in a series whose ultimate goal is to prove\nthe Kotschick-Morgan conjecture concerning the wall-crossing formula for the\nDonaldson invariants of a four-manifold with b^+ = 1. The conjecture asserts\nthat the wall-crossing terms due to changes in the metric depend at most on the\nhomotopy type of the four-manifold and the degree of the invariant. Our\nprincipal interest in this conjecture is due to the fact that its proof is\nexpected to resemble that of an important intermediate step towards a proof of\nWitten's conjecture concerning the relation between Donaldson and\nSeiberg-Witten invariants (hep-th/9411102, hep-th/9709193), using PU(2)\nmonopoles as described in (dg-ga/9709022, dg-ga/9712005). Moreover, it affords\nus another venue in which to address some of the technical difficulties arising\nin our work on Witten's conjecture.
