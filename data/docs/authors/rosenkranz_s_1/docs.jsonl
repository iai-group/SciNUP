Furthermore, exploiting the strong changes\nin photoionisation cross section between the Fe and As states across the wide\nphoton energy range employed, it is shown that the degree of energetic overlap\nbetween the iron 3d and arsenic 4p valence bands is particularly small at the\nFermi level, which can only mean a very low degree of hybridization between the\nFe 3d and As 4p states near and at E$_F$. Consequently, the itinerancy of the\ncharge carriers in this group of materials involves mainly the Fe 3d - Fe 3d\noverlap integrals with at best a minor role for the Fe 3d - As 4p hopping\nparameters, and that the states which support superconductivity upon doping are\nessentially of Fe 3d character. \n\n"}

The\nderived phase diagram shows that charge stripe order (CO) coexists with bulk\nsuperconductivity in a broad range of doping around x=1/8, although the CO\norder parameter falls off quickly for x<>1/8. Except for x=0.155, the onset of\nCO always coincides with the transition between the orthorhombic and the\ntetragonal low temperature structures. The CO transition evolves from a sharp\ndrop at low x to a more gradual transition at higher x, eventually falling\nbelow the structural phase boundary for optimum doping. With respect to the\ninterlayer CO correlations, we find no qualitative change of the stripe\nstacking order as a function of doping, and in-plane and out-of-plane\ncorrelations disappear simultaneously at the transition. Similarly to the CO,\nthe spin stripe order (SO) is also most pronounced at x=1/8. Truly static SO\nsets in below the CO and coincides with the first appearance of in-plane\nsuperconducting correlations at temperatures significantly above the bulk\ntransition to superconductivity (SC). Indications that bulk SC causes a\nreduction of the spin or charge stripe order could not be identified.

First, we\nexamine the phase diagrams of two-band systems with a passive band in which the\nintraband pairing interaction is absent and superconductivity is induced by a\nCooper pair tunneling from an active band. It is demonstrated that the\ntemperature of the Lifshitz point at which three second-order transition lines\nmeet is independent of the Cooper pair tunneling strength. The BCS-FFLO\ncritical field becomes lower than the Lifshitz point with increasing the\ninterband tunneling strength, and the resultant phase diagram is qualitatively\ndifferent from that in a single-band superconductor. We also study the\nthermodynamics of Pauli-limiting two-band superconductors with comparable\nintraband pairing interactions.

In the absence of disorder such\npairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal\nquasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point\nnodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the\n$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry\ncurvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the\n$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr\neffect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)\nsurfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in\nthe momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev\nbound states on the (0,0,1) surface.

By contrast, evidence suggests that electrons\ncontributing to the pseudogap are predominantly coupled by fractal spin waves\n(fractons) induced by the fractal arrangement of dopants.\n  On another level, the theory offers new insights into the emergence of a\nmacroscopic quantum potential generated by a fractal distribution of dopants.\nThis, in turn, leads to the emergence of coherent, macroscopic spin waves and a\nsecond associated macroscopic quantum potential, possibly supported by charge\norder. These quantum potentials play two key roles.

Classical\nphase-space is thus comprised of highly non-local (hidden) variables\nrepresenting these bilinears, and the cost of the method is that it scales\nquadratic rather than linear with system size. We demonstrate the strength of\nthe method by comparing the results to the exact quantum dynamics of fermion\nexpansion in the Hubbard model and quantum thermalization in the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for small systems, where the semiclassics nearly\nperfectly reproduces correct results. We furthermore analyze fermion expansion\nin a larger, intractable by exact methods, 2D Hubbard model, which is directly\nrelevant to recent cold atom experiments. \n\n"}

For all three cases we show rigorously that the topological ground\nstates can be represented by short-range neural networks in an \\textit{exact}\nand \\textit{efficient} fashion---the required number of hidden neurons is as\nsmall as the number of physical spins and the number of parameters scales only\n\\textit{linearly} with the system size. For the 2D toric-code model, we find\nthat the proposed short-range neural networks can describe the excited states\nwith abelain anyons and their nontrivial mutual statistics as well. In\naddition, by using reinforcement learning we show that neural networks are\ncapable of finding the topological ground states of non-integrable Hamiltonians\nwith strong interactions and studying their topological phase transitions. Our\nresults demonstrate explicitly the exceptional power of neural networks in\ndescribing topological quantum states, and at the same time provide valuable\nguidance to machine learning of topological phases in generic lattice models. \n\n"}

The SO(5) group employed by Zhang is embedded in\nthis SU(4) as a subgroup, suggesting a connection between our SU(4) model and\nthe Zhang SO(5) model. In order to understand the relationship between the the\ntwo models, we have used generalized coherent states to analyze the nature of\nthe SO(5) subgroup. By constructing coherent-state energy surfaces, we\ndemonstrate explicitly that the SU(4) supset SO(5) symmetry can be interpreted\nas a critical dynamical symmetry interpolating between superconducting and\nantiferromagnetic phases, and that this critical dynamical symmetry has many\nsimilarities to critical dynamical symmetries identified previously in other\nfields of physics. More generally, we demonstrate with this example that the\nmathematical techniques associated with generalized coherent states may have\npowerful applications in condensed matter physics because they provide a clear\nconnection between microscopic many-body theories and their broken-symmetry\napproximate solutions. In addition, these methods may be interpreted as\ndefining the most general Bogoliubov transformation subject to a Lie group\nsymmetry constraint, thus providing a mathematical connection between algebraic\nformulations and the language of quasiparticle theory. Finally, we suggest that\nthe identification of the SO(5) symmetry as a critical dynamical symmetry\nimplies deep algebraic connections between high-temperature superconductors and\nseemingly unrelated phenomena in other field of physics. \n\n"}

One likely implication of this universal spectrum is\nthat stripes of a dynamic form are present in the superconducting samples. On\ncooling through the superconducting transition temperature, a gap opens in the\nmagnetic spectrum, and the weight lost at low energy piles up above the gap;\nthe transition temperature is correlated with the size of the spin gap.\nDepending on the magnitude of the spin gap with respect to the magnetic\nspectrum, the enhanced magnetic scattering at low temperature can be either\ncommensurate or incommensurate. Connections between stripe correlations and\nsuperconductivity are discussed. \n\n"}

While this analysis\nrequires us to posit a form for the frequency-dependent quasiparticle\nconductivity, we clearly demonstrate that the extraction of the relaxation rate\nis quite insensitive to the assumed shape of the quasiparticle spectrum. The\nrobustness of the analysis is rooted in the oscillator-strength sum rule and\nthe fact that we simultaneously measure the real and imaginary parts of the\nconductivity. In both Bi2212 and Tl2201 we infer a linear temperature\ndependence of the transport relaxation rate 1/tau and a small but finite\nzero-temperature intercept. The linear temperature dependence of 1/tau is in\naccord with expectations for weak elastic scattering in an unconventional\nsuperconductor with line nodes and a small residual density of states.
