Convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova\n  core Abstract: By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and\nneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial\nhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion\nphase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is\ndriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time\nvariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development\nof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the\npostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of\nsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked\nflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth\nof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock\ninstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger\nconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the\naverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the\nneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in\nsupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and\nmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the\naccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the\nSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a\nvariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the\nadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the\naccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an\namplifying global feedback loop.

Here, we improve previous analyses on computing the\nneutrino yields from WIMP annihilations in several respects. We include\nneutrino oscillations in a full three-flavor framework as well as all effects\nfrom neutrino interactions on the way through the Sun (absorption, energy loss,\nand regeneration from tau decays). In addition, we study the effects of\nnon-zero values of the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ as well as the normal and\ninverted neutrino mass hierarchies.

It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the\nmodification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly\nreduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the\npeak position to lower pion energies. The angular distribution profiles are not\nmuch affected by nuclear effects. Nucleon motion increases the cross section by\n15% at neutrino energies of 650 MeV, while Coulomb effects on charged pions are\nestimated to be small.

Prior to positron annihilation, an\nelectron-positron pair may form an orthopositronium (o-Ps) state, with a mean\nlife of a few ns. Even if the o-Ps decay is speeded up by spin flip or pick off\neffects, it may introduce distortions in the photon emission time distribution,\ncrucial for position reconstruction and pulse shape discrimination algorithms\nin anti-neutrino experiments. Reversing the problem, the o-Ps induced time\ndistortion represents a new signature for tagging anti-neutrinos in liquid\nscintillator.\n  In this paper, we report the results of measurements of the o-Ps formation\nprobability and lifetime, for the most used solvents for organic liquid\nscintillators in neutrino physics (pseudocumene, linear alkyl benzene,\nphenylxylylethane, and dodecane).

In our \"early model\" (0.5 s post bounce), the\nnu_e-nu_s MSW effect driven by Delta m^2=2.35 eV^2 is dominated by ordinary\nmatter and leads to a complete nu_e-nu_s swap with little or no trace of\ncollective flavor oscillations. In our \"intermediate\" (2.9 s p.b.) and \"late\nmodels\" (6.5 s p.b.), neutrinos themselves significantly modify the nu_e-nu_s\nmatter effect, and, in particular in the late model, nu-nu refraction strongly\nreduces the matter effect, largely suppressing the overall nu_e-nu_s MSW\nconversion.

We solve numerically this equation both for DM\nfermions decoupling at equilibrium and DM sterile neutrinos decoupling out of\nequilibrium. We give the exact analytic solution for the density fluctuations\nand gravitational potential at zero wavenumber.

The density contrast depends on k and a mainly through\nthe product k a exhibiting a self-similar behavior. Our numerical density\ncontrast for small k gently approaches our analytic solution for k = 0. For\nfixed k < 1/(60 kpc), the density contrast generically grows with a while for k\n> 1/(60 kpc) it exhibits oscillations since the RD era which become stronger as\nk grows.

While\nthe coupling to valence quarks enhances the condensate, the interaction with\nsea quarks suppresses it in the transition region. The latter `sea effect' acts\nby ordering the Polyakov loop and, thereby, reduces the number of small Dirac\neigenmodes and the condensate. It is most effective around the transition\ntemperature, where the Polyakov loop effective potential is flat and a small\ncorrection to it by the magnetic field can have a significant effect.

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring.

If a\nsquark is the LSP, it will have a short displaced vertex. If any other particle\nis the LSP, the displaced vertex is naturally expected to be quite long,\npossibly even outside the detectors.

This arises because this operator\nefficiently washes-out the baryon asymmetry in the early universe, unless the\nsquarks are heavy and the coupling is small.

We employ an approximation scheme where \"one-loop\" diagrams are\ncomputed using fully dressed gluon and ghost propagators, and tree-level\nvertices. When a suitable kinematical configuration depending on a single\nmomentum scale $p$ is chosen, only two structures emerge: the tree-level\nfour-gluon vertex, and a tensor orthogonal to it. A detailed numerical analysis\nreveals that the form factor associated with this latter tensor displays a\nchange of sign (zero-crossing) in the deep infrared, and finally diverges\nlogarithmically. The origin of this characteristic behavior is proven to be\nentirely due to the masslessness of the ghost propagators forming the\ncorresponding ghost-loop diagram, in close analogy to a similar effect\nestablished for the three-gluon vertex. However, in the case at hand, and under\nthe approximations employed, this particular divergence does not affect the\nform factor proportional to the tree-level tensor, which remains finite in the\nentire range of momenta, and deviates moderately from its naive tree-level\nvalue. It turns out that the kinematic configuration chosen is ideal for\ncarrying out lattice simulations, because it eliminates from the connected\nGreen's function all one-particle reducible contributions, projecting out the\ngenuine one-particle irreducible vertex. Motivated by this possibility, we\ndiscuss in detail how a hypothetical lattice measurement of this quantity would\ncompare to the results presented here, and the potential interference from an\nadditional tensorial structure, allowed by Bose symmetry, but not encountered\nwithin our scheme. \n\n"}

One way to protect, for example, the Higgs from a large\nsupersymmetric mass term is if it is the Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) of a\nnonlinear sigma model. However, it is well known that nonlinear sigma models\n(NLSMs) with nontrivial K\\\"ahler transformations are problematic to couple to\nsupergravity. An additional field is necessary to make the K\\\"ahler potential\nof the NLSM invariant in supergravity. This field must have a shift symmetry\n--- making it a candidate for the inflaton (or axion). We give an explicit\nexample of such a model for the coset space $SU(3)/SU(2) \\times U(1)$, with the\nHiggs as the NGB, including breaking the inflaton's shift symmetry and\nproducing a chaotic inflation potential. This construction can also be applied\nto other models, such as one based on $E_7/SO(10) \\times U(1) \\times U(1)$\nwhich incorporates the first two generations of (light) quarks as the\nNambu-Goldstone multiplets, and has an axion in addition to the inflaton. Along\nthe way we clarify and connect previous work on understanding NLSMs in\nsupergravity and the origin of the extra field (which is the inflaton here),\nincluding a connection to Witten-Bagger quantization. This framework has wide\napplications to model building; a light particle from a NLSM requires, in\nsupergravity, exactly the structure for chaotic inflaton or an axion. \n\n"}

This slows down the training by requiring lower\nlearning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously\nhard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this\nphenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing\nlayer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of\nthe model architecture and performing the normalization for each training\nmini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and\nbe less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some\ncases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image\nclassification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14\ntimes fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant\nmargin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the\nbest published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5\nvalidation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters. \n\n"}

Within experimental uncertainties,\nthe hard component contributing to the particle production has been found not\nto show any clear collision energy dependence from RHIC to LHC. The effect of\ncentrality and collision energy in particle production seem to factor out with\nsome degree of dependency on the collision species. The collision of\nUranium-like deformed nuclei opens up new challenges in understanding the\nenergy-centrality factorization, which is evident from the centrality\ndependence of transverse energy density, when compared to collision of\nsymmetric nuclei. \n\n"}

For the transport of electron flavor neutrinos, we use the\ninteraction rates defined by Bruenn (1985) and the isotropic diffusion source\napproximation (IDSA) scheme, which decomposes the transported particles into\ntrapped particle and streaming particle components. Heavy neutrinos are\ndescribed by a leakage scheme. Unlike the \"ray-by-ray\" approach in some other\nmulti-dimensional supernova models, we use cylindrical coordinates and solve\nthe trapped particle component in multiple dimensions, improving the\nproto-neutron star resolution and the neutrino transport in angular and\ntemporal directions. We provide an IDSA verification by performing 1D and 2D\nsimulations with 15 and 20 $M_\\odot$ progenitors from Woosley et al.~(2007) and\ndiscuss the difference of our IDSA results with those existing in the\nliterature.

From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity. The implications\nof these results for the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon are discussed. \n\n"}

To this end, we use a long-term\nnumerical simulation of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) of a 17 solar-mass\nred supergiant progenitor to self-consistently model the multi-messenger\nsignals expected in GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic messengers. This\nsupernova model takes into account the formation and evolution of a\nprotoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction, and neutrino transport, all\nwithin a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation.

First, we highlight convolution with\nupsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense\nprediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the\nresolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional\nNeural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of\nfilters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of\nparameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial\npyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP\nprobes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple\nsampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as\nimage context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object\nboundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models.\nThe commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs\nachieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this\nby combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected\nConditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and\nquantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed \"DeepLab\"\nsystem sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image\nsegmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the\nresults on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and\nCityscapes.

Alternatively it may be the minimisation of the cost\nof generation, or the maximisation of consumer surplus or social welfare. In\nall cases there is calculated for each successive time-step the cost function\nmeasuring the total impact of whatever action is taken by the storage. The\nsuccession of such cost functions provides the information for the storage to\ndetermine how to behave over time, forming the basis of the appropriate\noptimisation problem. Further, optimal decision making, even over a very long\nor indefinite time period, usually depends on a knowledge of costs over a\nrelatively short running time horizon -- for storage of electrical energy\ntypically of the order of a day or so.\n  We study particularly competition between multiple stores, where the\nobjective of each store is to maximise its own income given the activities of\nthe remainder.

Such an extreme state of strongly-interacting QCD\n(Quantum Chromo-Dynamics) matter is produced in the laboratory with high-energy\ncollisions of heavy nuclei, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is\nobserved [2-6].

Rather than constructing noise simulations, we eliminate the GWB\nspatial correlations in the true datasets to assess detection significance with\nall real data features intact. In our first method, we perform random phase\nshifts in the signal-model basis functions.

The multi-stage (-time-frame) optimization aims to achieve a\ngradual distribution of new resources in space and time. Constraints on the\ninvestment budget, or equivalently constraint on building capacity, is\nintroduced at each time frame. Our approach adjusts operationally not only\nnewly installed FACTS devices but also other already existing flexible degrees\nof freedom.

The main goal of this paper is to explore\nthe emergence, evolution, and origin of low energy monopole strength along the\neven-even calcium isotopes: from 40Ca to 60Ca. The distribution of isoscalar\nmonopole strength is computed in a relativistic random phase approximation\n(RPA) using three effective interactions that have been calibrated to the\nproperties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. A non-spectral approach is\nadopted that allows for an exact treatment of the continuum without any\nreliance on discretization. For the stable calcium isotopes, no evidence of\nlow-energy monopole strength is observed, even as the 1f7/2 neutron orbital is\nbeing filled and the neutron-skin thickness progressively grows. Further, in\ncontrast to experimental findings, a mild softening of the monopole response\nwith increasing mass number is predicted. Beyond 48Ca, a significant amount of\nlow-energy monopole strength emerges as soon as the weak-binding neutron\norbitals (2p and 1f5/2) become populated. The emergence and evolution of\nlow-energy strength is identified with transitions from these weakly-bound\nstates into the continuum.

Abstract: Several long-standing anomalies from short-baseline neutrino oscillation\nexperiments -- most recently corroborated by new data from MiniBooNE -- have\nled to the hypothesis that extra, 'sterile', neutrino species might exist.\nModels of this type face severe cosmological constraints, and several ideas\nhave been proposed to avoid these constraints. Among the most widely discussed\nones are models with so-called 'secret interactions' in the neutrino sector. In\nthese models, sterile neutrinos are hypothesized to couple to a new\ninteraction, which dynamically suppresses their production in the early\nUniverse through finite-temperature effects. Recently, it has been argued that\nthe original calculations demonstrating the viability of this scenario need to\nbe refined. Here, we update our earlier results from arXiv:1310.6337 [JCAP 1510\n(2015) no.10, 011] accordingly. We confirm that much of the previously open\nparameter space for secret interactions is in fact ruled out by cosmological\nconstraints on the sum of neutrino masses and on free-streaming of active\nneutrinos.

The extraction of the neutrino mass\nordering is a data-driven field expected to evolve very rapidly in the next\ndecade. In this review, we both analyze the present status and describe the\nphysics of subsequent prospects. Firstly, the different current available tools\nto measure the neutrino mass ordering are described. Namely, reactor,\nlong-baseline (accelerator and atmospheric) neutrino beams, laboratory searches\nfor beta and neutrinoless double beta decays and observations of the cosmic\nbackground radiation and the large scale structure of the universe are\ncarefully reviewed. Secondly, the results from an up-to-date comprehensive\nglobal fit are reported: the Bayesian analysis to the 2018 publicly available\noscillation and cosmological data sets provides \\emph{strong} evidence for the\nnormal neutrino mass ordering versus the inverted scenario, with a significance\nof 3.5 standard deviations. This preference for the normal neutrino mass\nordering is mostly due to neutrino oscillation measurements. Finally, we shall\nalso emphasize the future perspectives for unveiling the neutrino mass\nordering. In this regard, apart from describing the expectations from the\naforementioned probes, we also focus on those arising from alternative and\nnovel methods, as 21~cm cosmology, core-collapse supernova neutrinos and the\ndirect detection of relic neutrinos. \n\n"}

Our recent computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD\ncontributions to single jet inclusive observables uncovered large corrections\nin certain kinematical regions, which also resulted in a sizeable ambiguity on\nthe appropriate choice of renormalization and factorization scales.

The two grouped variables are updated in a {\\it Gauss-Seidel} scheme,\nwhile the variables within each group are updated in a {\\it Jacobi} scheme,\nwhich would make it very attractive for a big data setting. By adding proper\nproximal terms to the subproblems, we specify the domain of the stepsizes to\nguarantee that GS-ADMM is globally convergent with a worst-case $O(1/t)$\nergodic convergence rate.

The method is particularly useful, since it\ncan accommodate settings where access to local data is allowed. Further, as\nestablished theoretically in this work, it can outperform centralized adaptive\nalgorithms, for certain classes of loss functions used in applications. We\nanalyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and provide a\ndynamic regret bound on the convergence rate of adaptive moment estimation\nmethods in both stochastic and deterministic settings. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that \\textsc{Dadam} works also well in practice and compares\nfavorably to competing online optimization methods. \n\n"}

Preheating is the exponentially rapid transfer of energy from the\nnearly homogeneous inflaton field to fluctuations of other fields and/or the\ninflaton itself. This rapid transfer leaves these fields in a highly nonthermal\nstate with energy concentrated in infrared modes. We have performed lattice\nsimulations of the evolution of interacting scalar fields during and after\npreheating for a variety of inflationary models. We have formulated a set of\ngeneric rules that govern the thermalization process in all of these models.\nNotably, we see that once one of the fields is amplified through parametric\nresonance or other mechanisms it rapidly excites other coupled fields to\nexponentially large occupation numbers. These fields quickly acquire nearly\nthermal spectra in the infrared, which gradually propagates into higher\nmomenta.

The length l_U ~ Lambda_{cU}^{-1} characterizies the size of gauge\nnon- singlet particles yielding a picture dual to the Dual Standard model of\nVachaspati. This Asymptotic Slavery (AS) fixed point is driven by realistic\nFermion Mass(FM) Higgs content which implies AS.

The calculation is performed in the {\\it low density} approximation,\nwhere the in-medium self energy $\\Sigma_{med}$ is completely determined by the\nvacuum $\\rho N$ forward scattering amplitude. This amplitude is derived from a\nrelativistic resonance model. In comparison to previous non-relativistic\ncalculations we find a much weaker momentum dependence of $\\Sigma_{med}$,\nespecially in the transverse channel. Special attention is paid to\nuncertainties in the model. Thus, we compare the impact of different coupling\nschemes for the $RN\\rho$ interaction on the results and discuss various\nresonance parameter sets. \n\n"}

Medium\neffects in the production mechanism and the distortion of the pion wave\nfunction, obtained solving the Klein Gordon equation with a microscopic optical\npotential, are included in the calculation. We find a strong reduction of the\ncross section due to these effects and also substantial modifications of the\nenergy distributions of the final lepton and pion. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/9812063", "contents": "Title: Survey of heavy-meson observables Abstract: We employ a Dyson-Schwinger equation model to effect a unified and uniformly\naccurate description of light- and heavy-meson observables, which we\ncharacterise by heavy-meson leptonic decays, semileptonic heavy-to-heavy and\nheavy-to-light transitions - B -> D*, D, rho, pi; D -> K*, K, pi, radiative and\nstrong decays - B(s)* -> B(s) gamma; D(s)* -> D(s) gamma, D pi, and the rare\nB-> K* gamma flavour-changing neutral-current process. We elucidate the\nheavy-quark limit of these processes and, using a model-independent mass\nformula valid for all nonsinglet pseudoscalar mesons, demonstrate that their\nmass rises linearly with the mass of their heaviest constituent. In our\nnumerical calculations we eschew a heavy-quark expansion and rely instead on\nthe observation that the dressed c,b-quark mass functions are well approximated\nby a constant, interpreted as their constituent-mass: we find M_c=1.32 GeV and\nM_b=4.65 GeV. The calculated heavy-meson leptonic decay constants and\ntransition form factors are a necessary element in the experimental\ndetermination of CKM matrix elements. The results also show that this\nframework, as employed hitherto, is well able to describe vector meson\npolarisation observables. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0512082", "contents": "Title: The Measurement of AM noise of Oscillators Abstract: The close-in AM noise is often neglected, under the assumption that it is a\nminor problem as compared to phase noise. With the progress of technology and\nof experimental science, this assumption is no longer true. Yet, information in\nthe literature is scarce or absent. This report describes the measurement of\nthe AM noise of rf/microwave sources in terms of Salpha(f), i.e., the power\nspectrum density of the fractional amplitude fluctuation alpha. The proposed\nschemes make use of commercial power detectors based on Schottky and tunnel\ndiodes, in single-channel and correlation configuration. There follow the\nanalysis of the front-end amplifier at the detector output, the analysis of the\nmethods for the measurement of the power-detector noise, and a digression about\nthe calibration procedures. The measurement methods are extended to the\nrelative intensity noise (RIN) of optical beams, and to the AM noise of the\nrf/microwave modulation in photonic systems. Some rf/microwave synthesizers and\noscillators have been measured, using correlation and moderate averaging. As an\nexample, the flicker noise of a low-noise quartz oscillator (Wenzel 501-04623E)\nis Salpha = 1.15E-13/f, which is equivalent to an Allan deviation of\nsigma_alpha = 4E-7. The measurement systems described exhibit the world-record\nlowest background noise. \n\n"}
