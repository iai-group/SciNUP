We show that $PT$ symmetry of a time-independent\nHamiltonian, or equivalently, reality of the secular equation that determines\nits eigenvalues, is both necessary and sufficient for unitary time evolution.\nFor any $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonian $H$ there always exists an operator $V$ that\nrelates $H$ to its Hermitian adjoint according to $VHV^{-1}=H^{\\dagger}$. When\nthe energy spectrum of $H$ is complete, Hilbert space norms $<\\psi_1|V|\\psi_2>$\nconstructed with this $V$ are always preserved in time.

These criteria insure that there is a regime where the dilatation\noperator is modified perturbatively. Global AdS is the natural framework for\nperturbations of the dilatation operator respecting conformal invariance, much\nas Minkowski space naturally describes Lorentz invariant perturbations of the\nHamiltonian. Assuming that the lowest-dimension single-trace operator is a\nscalar, O, we consider the anomalous dimensions, gamma(n,l), of the\ndouble-trace operators of the form O (del^2)^n (del)^l O. Purely from the CFT\nwe find that perturbative unitarity places a bound on these dimensions of\n|gamma(n,l)|<4.

The logarithmic negativity\nE= log||rho_A^{T_2}|| is then the continuation to n->1 of the traces of the\neven powers. For pure states, this procedure reproduces the known results. We\nthen apply this method to conformally invariant field theories in several\ndifferent physical situations for infinite and finite systems and without or\nwith boundaries.

The purpose of this article is to highlight the\ndistinction between a field redefinition and a perturbation projection. We\nprovide a detailed derivation of the evolution of the isocurvature perturbation\nto show that no assumption of an adiabatic or isocurvature field is needed.

Our result for a_s reproduces the expression found recently in\narXiv:1306.5242 by an indirect method implied by AdS/CFT (which relates the\npartition function of a CHS field on S^4 to a ratio of known partition\nfunctions of massless higher spin field in AdS_5 with alternate boundary\nconditions). We also obtain similar results for the fermionic CHS fields. In\nthis half-integer spin s case the CHS partition function on (A)dS background is\ngiven by a product of squares of \"partially massless\" spin s partition\nfunctions and one extra factor corresponding to a special massive conformally\ninvariant spin s field. It was noticed in arXiv:1306.5242 that the sum of the\nbosonic a_s coefficients over all spins s is zero when computed using the\nzeta-function regularization, and we observe that the same property is true\nalso in the fermionic case, suggesting that the corresponding conformal higher\nspin theory may be consistent at the quantum level. \n\n"}

An important loophole in the arguments of Luty-Polchinski-Rattazzi\nand Dymarsky-Komargodski-Schwimmer-Theisen is that trace of the energy-momentum\ntensor $T$ could be a generalized free field. In this paper we rule out this\npossibility. The key ingredient is the observation that a unitary theory with\nscale but not conformal invariance necessarily has a non-vanishing anomaly for\nglobal scale transformations. We show that this anomaly cannot be reproduced if\n$T$ is a generalized free field unless the theory also contains a dimension-2\nscalar operator.

One promising avenue is to modify general\nrelativity and obtain a new description of the gravitational force. Because\ngravitation dominates the other forces mostly on large scales, cosmological\nprobes provide an ideal testing ground for theories of gravity. In this thesis,\nwe describe two complementary approaches to the problem of testing gravity\nusing cosmology.\n  In the first part, we discuss the cosmological solutions of massive gravity\nand its generalisation to a bimetric theory. These theories describe a graviton\nwith a small mass, and can potentially explain the late-time acceleration in a\ntechnically-natural way. We describe these self-accelerating solutions and\ninvestigate the cosmological perturbations in depth, beginning with an\ninvestigation of their linear stability, followed by the construction of a\nmethod for solving these perturbations in the quasistatic limit. This allows\nthe predictions of stable bimetric models to be compared to observations of\nstructure formation. Next, we discuss prospects for theories in which matter\n\"doubly couples\" to both metrics, and examine the cosmological expansion\nhistory in both massive gravity and bigravity with a specific double coupling\nwhich is ghost-free at low energies.\n  In the second and final part, we study the consequences of Lorentz violation\nduring inflation.

This is not an easy task if\ncombined with cosmological constraints, since the mechanism of moduli\nstabilization fixes both the scale of supersymmetric particles and the scale of\nmoduli, which tend to be of the same order. However, if on the one hand\nsupersymmetric particles with TeV mass are desired in order to address the\nhierarchy problem, on the other hand the cosmological moduli problem requires\nthe moduli to be heavier than 100 TeV. The specific setup of sequestered\ncompactifications makes this hierarchy achievable, at least in principle: as in\nthese models the visible sector is located on a stack of D3-branes at\nsingularities, a physical separation between the visible degrees of freedom and\nthe SUSY-breaking sources takes place. Such decoupling translates into a\nhierarchy between the scale of SUSY-breaking and the spectrum of supersymmetric\nparticles. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that moduli are the\nfour-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions, and then\ntheir presence is a common feature of all string compactifications. Since they\nare gravitationally coupled, they could decay late in the history of the\nuniverse, affecting in a significant way its cosmological evolution. Possible\ndeviations of the cosmological observables from the values predicted by the\nstandard Hot Big Bang Theory constitute an interesting alternative for the\ndiscovery of BSM physics, which is complementary to the particle physics\nsearch. For this reason in addition to SUSY-breaking in sequestered models, I\nalso studied several cosmological scenarios arising from them, such as\nproduction of non-thermal dark matter and dark radiation, reheating from moduli\ndecay and inflation. \n\n"}

The spatial\nfundamental domain is an N dimensional hyper-rhombohedron, and the temporal\ndirection describes transitions from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary\ntarget state. We first consider a complex Klein-Gordon field theory and argue\nthat it can only be used to study the shortest quantum circuits which do not\ninvolve generators composed of tensor products of multiple Pauli Z matrices.\nSince such situation is not generic we call it the Z-problem.

These features of the EH action include: (a) the\nexistence of second derivatives of dynamical variables; (b) a non trivial\nrelation between the surface term and the bulk term; (c) the fact that surface\nterm is non analytic in the coupling constant, when gravity is treated as a\nspin-2 perturbation around flat spacetime and (d) the form of the variation of\nthe surface term under infinitesimal coordinate transformations. The surface\nterm can be derived directly from very general considerations and using (d) one\ncan obtain Einstein's equations {\\it just from the surface term of the action}.\nFurther one can relate the bulk term to the surface term and derive the full EH\naction based on purely thermodynamic considerations.

The more usual method consists in performing an expansion around an\ninstantaneous approximation of the product of the free propagators\n(propagator-approximated reduction). The second method starts with an\ninstantaneous approximation of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel (kernel-approximated\nreduction). In both reductions the final 3D potential can be obtained by\nfollowing simple modified Feynman rules. The kernel-approximated reduction,\nhowever, does not give the correct scattering amplitudes, and must thus be\nlimited to the computation of bound states. Our 3D reduction of the\nthree-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation is inspired by these results. We expand\nthis equation around positive-energy instantaneous approximations of the three\ntwo-body kernels, but these starting approximations are given by\npropagator-approximated reductions at the two-body level. The three-fermion\nBethe-Salpeter equation is first transformed into a set of three coupled\nequations for three wave functions depending each on one two-fermion total\nenergy, then into a set of three 3D equations and finally into a single 3D\nequation.

{"id": "hep-th/9908149", "contents": "Title: Casimir Effect: The Classical Limit Abstract: We analyze the high temperature (or classical) limit of the Casimir effect. A\nuseful quantity which arises naturally in our discussion is the ``relative\nCasimir energy\", which we define for a configuration of disjoint conducting\nboundaries of arbitrary shapes, as the difference of Casimir energies between\nthe given configuration and a configuration with the same boundaries infinitely\nfar apart. Using path integration techniques, we show that the relative Casimir\nenergy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. This is consistent with a\nsimple physical argument based on Kirchhoff's law. As a result the ``relative\nCasimir entropy\", which we define in an obviously analogous manner, tends, in\nthe classical limit, to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the\ngeometry of the boundaries. Thus the Casimir force between disjoint pieces of\nthe boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a\ndimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Contributions\nto the Casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected\ncomponent of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from\nthe behavior just described. These logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to\nour difficulty to separate the Casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical\nquantities) from the ``electromagnetic'' self-energy of each of the connected\ncomponents of the boundary in a well defined manner. Our approach to the\nCasimir effect is not to impose sharp boundary conditions on the fluctuating\nfield, but rather take into consideration its interaction with the plasma of\n``charge carriers'' in the boundary, with the plasma frequency playing the role\nof a physical UV cutoff.
