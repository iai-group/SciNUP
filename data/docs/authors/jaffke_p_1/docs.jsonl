We find\noptimal baselines of about 2500 km to 5000 km for the CP violation measurement,\nwhere now values of E_mu as low as about 12 GeV may be possible. However, for\nlarge theta_{13}, we demonstrate that the lower threshold and the backgrounds\nreconstructed at lower energies allow in fact for muon energies as low as 5 GeV\nat considerably shorter baselines, such as FNAL-Homestake.

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also\nfind that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of\nleptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs\nrepresentations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a\nphenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive\nsizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels. Large Yukawa couplings\nof the quadruplet can induce observable effects for lepton flavor violating\nprocesses $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ and $\\mu - e$ conversion.

The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and\nelectron-ion scattering in a $(Q^2, 1/x)$ range extended by four orders of\nmagnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel\ninvestigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of\nQuark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The\nLHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics\nand beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical\ndesign considerations on the interaction region, magnets and further\ncomponents, together with a design study for a high acceptance detector. Civil\nengineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the\ndetector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the\nLHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It thus represents a major opportunity\nfor progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC. \n\n"}

In addition, one of the critical uncertainties in\nthe nucleon-nucleon interaction, the nuclear symmetry energy, is not fully\nexplored by the currently available equations of state. In this article, we\nconstruct two new equations of state which match recent neutron star\nobservations and provide more flexibility in studying the dependence on nuclear\nmatter properties.

The sensitivity to the ISR gives rise to significantly different\nstructures in the corresponding factorization theorems---for example,\ndependence on either the ordinary or the generalized kperp-dependent beam\nfunction. Despite the differences among 1-jettiness definitions, we show that\nthe leading nonperturbative correction that shifts the tail region of their\ndistributions is given by a single universal nonperturbative parameter Omega1,\neven accounting for hadron mass effects. Finally, we give numerical results for\nQ^2 and x values explored at the HERA collider, emphasizing that the target of\nour factorization-based analyses is to open the door for higher-precision jet\nphenomenology in DIS. \n\n"}

One of the major goals of the proposed\nupgrade is to extend the physics reach for rare probes at low transverse\nmomentum. The reconstruction of the rare probes requires a precise\ndetermination of the primary and secondary vertices that is performed in ALICE\nby the Inner Tracking System (ITS). The present ITS made of 6 layers of three\ntechnologies of silicon devices allows, for example, to reconstruct D mesons\nwith the transverse momentum down to ~2 GeV/c.\n  Further extension of this range towards lower pT requires the installation of\nthe new ITS consisting of 7 layers of silicon detectors with significantly\nbetter single point resolution and reduced material budget. It is expected that\nthe new system will allow to improve the impact parameter resolution by a\nfactor of ~3. Moreover, the data rate capability of the upgraded ITS should be\nsignificantly improved in order to exploit the full expected LHC lead-lead\ninteraction rate of 50 kHz, almost two orders of magnitude above the present\nreadout rate.\n  The present contribution describes first the ITS upgrade requirements\nfollowed by the conceptual design of the new system and its expected\nperformance.

Our\ncalculations consider an extended nuclear network, including spontaneous,\n$\\beta$- and neutron-induced fission and adopting fission yield distributions\nfrom the ABLA code. We have studied the sensitivity of the r-process abundances\nto nuclear masses by using different models. Most of the trajectories,\ncorresponding to 90% of the ejected mass, follow a relatively slow expansion\nallowing for all neutrons to be captured. The resulting abundances are very\nsimilar to each other and reproduce the general features of the observed\nr-process abundance (the second and third peaks, the rare-earth peak and the\nlead peak) for all mass models as they are mainly determined by the fission\nyields. We find distinct differences in the abundance yields at and just above\nthe third peak, which can be traced back to different predictions of neutron\nseparation energies for r-process nuclei around neutron number $N=130$. The\nremaining trajectories, which contribute 10% by mass to the total integrated\nabundances, follow such a fast expansion that the r process does not use all\nthe neutrons. This also leads to a larger variation of abundances among\ntrajectories as fission does not dominate the r-process dynamics. The total\nintegrated abundances are dominated by contributions from the slow abundances\nand hence reproduce the general features of the observed r-process abundances.\nWe find that at timescales of weeks relevant for kilonova light curve\ncalculations, the abundance of actinides is larger than the one of lanthanides.\nHence actinides can be even more important than lanthanides to determine the\nphoton opacities under kilonova conditions.

The recent measurement of the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ in the\nstandard mixing oscillation scenario encourages us to pursue the still missing\nresults on leptonic CP violation and absolute neutrino masses. However,\npuzzling measurements exist that deserve an exhaustive evaluation.\n  The NESSiE Collaboration has been setup to undertake conclusive experiments\nto clarify the muon-neutrino disappearance measurements at small $L/E$, which\nwill be able to put severe constraints to models with more than the\nthree-standard neutrinos, or even to robustly measure the presence of a new\nkind of neutrino oscillation for the first time. To this aim the use of the\ncurrent FNAL-Booster neutrino beam for a Short-Baseline experiment has been\ncarefully evaluated.

Using these\nsymmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that\nhalf of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.\nSince this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,\nwe advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the\ntree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why\nmost previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above\nconsideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary\nto the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should\nbe proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$. \n\n"}

The effects of resolution broadening from multiple scattering\ndiminish with increasing muon momentum. As the momentum of the muon increases,\nthe contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in\nthe muon spectrometer to resolve the image. The variance of the measured muon\nmomentum reaches a minimum and then increases with increasing muon momentum.\nThe impact of the increase in variance is to require a higher integrated muon\nflux to reduce fluctuations.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates.

Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

Based on this\nbackground model, TREX-DM could be competitive in the search for low-mass\nWIMPs. In particular it could be sensitive, e.g., to the low-mass WIMP\ninterpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA and other hints in a conservative scenario. \n\n"}

We have observed the four brightest\nred giants in Ret 2 at high spectral resolution using the Michigan/Magellan\nFiber System. We present detailed abundances for as many as 20 elements per\nstar, including 12 elements heavier than the Fe group. We confirm previous\ndetection of high levels of r-process material in Ret 2 (mean\n[Eu/Fe]=+1.69+/-0.05) found in three of these stars (mean [Fe/H]=-2.88+/-0.10).\nThe abundances closely match the r-process pattern found in the well-studied\nmetal-poor halo star CS22892-052. Such r-process-enhanced stars have not been\nfound in any other ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, though their existence has been\npredicted by at least one model. The fourth star in Ret 2 ([Fe/H]=-3.42+/-0.20)\ncontains only trace amounts of Sr ([Sr/Fe]=-1.73+/-0.43) and no detectable\nheavier elements. One r-process enhanced star is also enhanced in C (natal\n[C/Fe]=+1.1). This is only the third such star known, which suggests that the\nnucleosynthesis sites leading to C and r-process enhancements are decoupled.\nThe r-process-deficient star is enhanced in Mg ([Mg/Fe]=+0.81+/-0.14), and the\nother three stars show normal levels of alpha-enhancement (mean\n[Mg/Fe]=+0.34+/-0.03). The abundances of other alpha and Fe-group elements\nclosely resemble those in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and metal-poor halo stars,\nsuggesting that the nucleosynthesis that led to the large r-process\nenhancements either produced no light elements or produced light-element\nabundance signatures indistinguishable from normal supernovae. \n\n"}

Key uncertainties in modeling kilonovae\ninclude the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products---non-thermal\nbeta- and alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays---and the\nefficiency with which they deposit their energy in the ejecta. The total\nradioactive energy and the efficiency of its thermalization sets the luminosity\nbudget and is therefore necessary for predicting kilonova light curves. We\noutline the uncertainties in r-process decay, describe the physical processes\nby which the energy of the decay products is absorbed in the ejecta, and\npresent time-dependent thermalization efficiencies for each particle type. We\ndetermine the net heating efficiency and explore its dependence on r-process\nyields---in particular, the production of translead nuclei that undergo\nalpha-decay---and on the ejecta's mass, velocity, composition, and magnetic\nfield configuration. We incorporate our results into new time-dependent,\nmulti-wavelength radiation transport simulations, and calculate updated\npredictions of kilonova light curves.

[Purpose] Confront our\ncalculations of charged-current quasielastic cross section with the\nmeasurements of MiniBooNE and T2K, and to quantitatively investigate the role\nof nuclear-structure effects, in particular, low-energy nuclear excitations in\nforward muon scattering.

Long-range nuclear correlations are taken\ninto account by means of the continuum random-phase approximation (CRPA)\nframework.

As this QCD\ninterference does not depend on the strong coupling constant, it is part of the\nno-interaction baseline that needs to be controlled prior to searching for\nother manifestations of collective dynamics. Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

These findings indicate that the no-interaction baseline\nincluding QCD interference effects can make a sizeable if not dominant\ncontribution to the measured $v_n$ coefficients in pp collisions.

Current neutrino detectors have so far failed to detect\nsuch a signal, however, and bounds from direct and indirect dark matter\nsearches may significantly restrict the possibility of observing it in future\nexperiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande or IceCube-Gen2. In this work, we assess\nin the light of current data and of expected experimental sensitivities, the\nprospects for the detection of a neutrino signal from dark matter annihilations\nin the Sun. To be as general as possible, equilibrium between the capture and\nthe annihilation rates in the Sun is not assumed in our analysis; instead, the\ndark matter scattering and annihilation cross sections are taken as free and\nindependent parameters. We consider capture via both spin-dependent and\nspin-independent interactions, and annihilations into three representative\nfinal states: $b\\bar b$, $W^+W^-$, and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$. We find that when the\ncapture in the Sun is dominated by spin-independent interactions, current\ndirect detection bounds already preclude the observation of a neutrino signal\nin future experiments.

Here we discuss\nthe role of neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the light of the first direct\ndetection of such an event in both gravitational (GW) and electromagnetic (EM)\nwaves. We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double\nneutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based\nmacronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the\nradioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.3$ (but not\nlarger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the\nelectromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular \"nickel winds\" as major\nsource of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted\neither with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta. Our limits on the ejecta mass\ntogether with estimated rates directly confirm earlier purely theoretical or\nindirect observational conclusions that double neutron star mergers are indeed\na major site of cosmic nucleosynthesis. If the ejecta mass was {\\em typical},\nNSMs can easily produce {\\em all} of the estimated Galactic r-process matter,\nand --depending on the real rate-- potentially even more. This could be a hint\nthat the event ejected a particularly large amount of mass, maybe due to a\nsubstantial difference between the component masses. This would be compatible\nwith the mass limits obtained from the GW-observation.

However,\nit is still unclear which astrophysical site between core-collapse supernovae\nand neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process\nelements in the universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test\nthese scenarios by quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce\nthe amount of europium (Eu) observed in galaxies. Although NS-NS mergers have\nbecome popular candidates, their required frequency (or rate) needs to be\nconsistent with that obtained from gravitational wave measurements. Here we\naddress the first NS-NS merger detected by LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its\nassociated Gamma-ray burst and analyze their implication on the origin of\nr-process elements. The range of NS-NS merger rate densities of 320-4740\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ provided by LIGO/Virgo is remarkably consistent with the\nrange required by GCE to explain the Eu abundances in the Milky Way with NS-NS\nmergers, assuming the solar r-process abundance pattern for the ejecta. Under\nthe same assumption, this event has produced about 1-5 Earth masses of Eu, and\n3-13 Earth masses of gold.

Abstract: Above a critical dark matter-nucleus scattering cross section any terrestrial\ndirect detection experiment loses sensitivity to dark matter, since the Earth\ncrust, atmosphere, and potential shielding layers start to block off the dark\nmatter particles. This critical cross section is commonly determined by\ndescribing the average energy loss of the dark matter particles analytically.\nHowever, this treatment overestimates the stopping power of the Earth crust.\nTherefore the obtained bounds should be considered as conservative.

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment. A similar coherent enhancement mechanism can work\nfor relativistic particles in the dark sector, but not for the conventionally\nconsidered non-relativistic dark matter. \n\n"}

We present an exhaustive study of the charged-current and\nneutral-current neutrino and antineutrino pion production off nucleons, paying\na special attention to the angular distributions of the outgoing pion. We show,\nusing general arguments, that parity violation and time-reversal odd\ncorrelations in the weak differential cross sections are generated from the\ninterference between different contributions to the hadronic current that are\nnot relatively real. Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of\nthe art, microscopic models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and\nwe also confront their predictions with polarized electron data, as a test of\nthe vector content of these models.

The late-time transition in the spectral energy\ndistribution to near-infrared wavelengths was interpreted as indicating the\nproduction of lanthanide nuclei, with atomic mass number A>140. However,\ncompelling evidence for the presence of heavier third-peak r-process elements\n(e.g., gold, platinum) or translead nuclei remains elusive. At early times\n(~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble\nof beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense,\ngenerating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single\npower-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input\ncan possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays, 223Ra\n(half-life t_{1/2}=11.43d), 225Ac (t_{1/2}=10.0d, following the beta-decay of\n225Ra with t_{1/2}=14.9d), and the fissioning isotope 254Cf (t_{1/2}=60.5d),\nwhich liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency\nthan beta-decay products.

This is a very reasonable assumption and there are no\nuncontrolled approximations in our treatment of the reflection phenomenon. The\nsurface roughness effects are also included by using a simple model. We apply\nour formalism to the radiation produced by the balloon-borne HiCal\nradio-frequency (RF) transmitter. Our final results for the reflected power are\nfound to be in good agreement with data for all elevation angles. We also study\nthe properties of reflected radio pulses in order to study their phase\nrelationship with direct pulses. We find that for some roughness models the\npulse shape can be somewhat distorted and may be misidentified as a direct\npulse.

Such new states could be produced in\nhigh-intensity facilities, the so-called beam dump experiments, either directly\nin the hard interaction or as a decay product of heavier mesons.

The charges of $SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_R$ are assigned to\nthe mirror fields in the same way as in the SM, but the chiralities of the\nmirror fermions are opposite to respect the parity symmetry. The strong CP\nproblem is resolved, since the mirror quarks are also charged under the\n$SU(3)_c$ in the SM. In the minimal setup, the mirror gauge symmetry leads to\nstable colored particles which would be inconsistent with the observed data, so\nthat we introduce two scalars in order to deplete the stable colored particles.\nInterestingly, one of the scalars becomes stable because of the gauge symmetry\nand therefore can be a good dark matter candidate.

The results are based on data taken in the\nMINOS cavern at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. We focus on data\nobtained with two distinct readout strategies. For the first strategy, we read\nout the Skipper-CCD continuously, accumulating an exposure of 0.177 gram-days.\nWhile we observe no events containing three or more electrons, we find a large\none- and two-electron background event rate, which we attribute to spurious\nevents induced by the amplifier in the Skipper-CCD readout stage. For the\nsecond strategy, we take five sets of data in which we switch off all\namplifiers while exposing the Skipper-CCD for 120k seconds, and then read out\nthe data through the best prototype amplifier. We find a one-electron event\nrate of (3.51 +- 0.10) x 10^(-3) events/pixel/day, which is almost two orders\nof magnitude lower than the one-electron event rate observed in the\ncontinuous-readout data, and a two-electron event rate of (3.18 +0.86 -0.55) x\n10^(-5) events/pixel/day.

While the energy spectrum of KamLAND\nevents allows the determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters, the\ntime spectrum can be used to monitor known and unknown neutrino sources.
