This expository article features\nseveral instances of localization that occur at the crossroads of symplectic\nand algebraic geometry on the one hand, and combinatorics and representation\ntheory on the other. The examples come largely from the symplectic category,\nwith particular attention to toric varieties. In the spirit of the 2006\nInternational Conference on Toric Topology at Osaka City University, the main\ngoal of this exposition is to exhibit toric techniques that arise in symplectic\ngeometry. \n\n"}

The line profile can be well fit by an elliptical\nrelativistic Keplerian disk model.

More generally, that inequality holds if, rather than\nassuming k algebraically closed, we assume that R/J(R) is a direct product of\nfull matrix algebras over k, and exclude the case where k has small finite\ncardinality.

General \"representation theorems\" identify all reasonable linear\nfunctors between categories of perfect complexes (or their \"large\" version,\nquasi-coherent sheaves) on schemes and stacks over some fixed base with\nintegral kernels in the form of sheaves (of the same nature) on the fiber\nproduct. However, for many applications in mirror symmetry and geometric\nrepresentation theory one is interested instead in the bounded derived category\nof coherent sheaves (or its \"large\" version, ind-coherent sheaves), which\ndiffers from perfect complexes (and quasi-coherent sheaves) once the underlying\nvariety is singular. In this paper, we give general representation theorems for\nlinear functors between categories of coherent sheaves over a base in terms of\nintegral kernels on the fiber product. Namely, we identify coherent kernels\nwith functors taking perfect complexes to coherent sheaves, and kernels which\nare coherent relative to the source with functors taking all coherent sheaves\nto coherent sheaves. The proofs rely on key aspects of the \"functional\nanalysis\" of derived categories, namely the distinction between small and large\ncategories and its measurement using $t$-structures. These are used in\nparticular to correct the failure of integral transforms on Ind-coherent\nsheaves to correspond to such sheaves on a fiber product.

We conduct Gemini\nIntegral Field Unit spectroscopy of a sample of luminous unobscured (type 1)\nquasars, to determine the morphology and kinematics of ionized gas around these\nobjects, predominantly via observations of the [O III]5007 emission line. We\nfind that ionized gas nebulae extend out to ~13 kpc from the quasar, that they\nare smooth and round, and that their kinematics are inconsistent with gas in\ndynamical equilibrium with the host galaxy. The observed morphological and\nkinematic properties are strikingly similar to those of ionized gas around\nobscured (type 2) quasars with matched [O III] luminosity, with marginal\nevidence that nebulae around unobscured quasars are slightly more compact.\nTherefore in samples of obscured and unobscured quasars carefully matched in [O\nIII] luminosity we find support for the standard geometry-based unification\nmodel of active galactic nuclei, in that the intrinsic properties of quasars,\nof their hosts and of their ionized gas appear to be very similar.

In a recent\nwork of Berenstein and the author, analogous extensions of Feigin homomorphisms\nfrom the dual Hall-Ringel algebra of a valued quiver to quantum polynomial\nalgebras were defined. To relate these constructions, we establish a\nhomomorphism, dubbed the quantum shuffle character, from the dual Hall-Ringel\nalgebra to the quantum shuffle algebra which relates the generalized Feigin\nhomomorphisms.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents.

Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring.

Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations\nindicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently\nflexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect\nand produce accurate time delays. \n\n"}

We show\nthat in the hierarchical (in separation) three-body problem, one of the BHs and\na dark matter particle form an inner binary. Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger. We show that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar\ndisk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient in exciting the eccentricity of dark\nmatter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely high values where\nthey are accreted by the IMBH. We show that this mechanism is even more\neffective if the central BH grows in mass, where we have assumed adiabatic\ngrowth. Since near-polar configurations are disrupted, a torus-like shape is\nformed. We also show that this behavior is also likely to be relevant for\nSupermassive BH binaries. We suggest that if the BHs are spinning, the accreted\ndark matter particles may linger in the ergosphere and thereby may generate\nself-annihilations and produce an indirect signature of potential interest. \n\n"}

The AKARI performed an all sky\nsurvey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160$\\mu$m) with 3-10 times better\nsensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak\nof the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can\nmeasure the total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies much\nmore precisely, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density of the local\nUniverse. In the AKARI NEP deep field, we construct restframe 8$\\mu$m,\n12$\\mu$m, and total infrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2\nusing 4128 infrared sources.

We\nshow that the quantum groups arising from Lusztig algebras and Schur algebras\nvia stabilization procedures are (idempotented) coideal subalgebras of quantum\ngroups of affine $\\mathfrak{sl}$ and $\\mathfrak{gl}$ types, respectively. In\nthis way, we provide geometric realizations of eight quantum symmetric pairs of\naffine types. We construct monomial and canonical bases of all these quantum\n(Schur, Lusztig, and coideal) algebras. For the idempotented coideal algebras\nof affine $\\mathfrak{sl}$ type, we establish the positivity properties of the\ncanonical basis with respect to multiplication, comultiplication and a bilinear\npairing. In particular, we obtain a new and geometric construction of the\nidempotented quantum affine $\\mathfrak{gl}$ and its canonical basis. \n\n"}

The search for fainter AGN, in deep X-ray surveys, has proven less\nsuccessful, with few candidates to date. An extrapolation of the relationship\nbetween black hole (BH) and bulge mass would predict that the sample of z>6\ngalaxies host relatively massive BHs (>1e6 Msun), if one assumes that total\nstellar mass is a good proxy for bulge mass. At least a few of these BHs should\nbe luminous enough to be detectable in the 4Ms CDFS. The relation between BH\nand stellar mass defined by local moderate-luminosity AGN in low-mass galaxies,\nhowever, has a normalization that is lower by approximately an order of\nmagnitude compared to the BH-bulge mass relation. We explore how this scaling\nchanges the interpretation of AGN in the high-z Universe. Despite large\nuncertainties, driven by those in the stellar mass function, and in the\nextrapolation of local relations, one can explain the current non-detection of\nmoderate-luminosity AGN in Lyman Break Galaxies if galaxies below 1e11 Msun are\ncharacterized by the low-normalization scaling, and, even more so, if their\nEddington ratio is also typical of moderate-luminosity AGN rather than luminous\nquasars.

In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii.

Our objective is to identify the heating mechanisms in one\nsuch galaxy, IZw18, and assess the diagnostic value of fine-structure cooling\nlines.

Building on a previous photoionization model within a multi-sector\ntopology, we provide additional constraints from the [CII] and [OI] lines and\nthe dust mass recently measured with Herschel. The heating of the HI region\nappears to be mainly due to photoionization by radiation from a bright X-ray\nbinary source, while photoelectric effect (PE) is negligible. The [CII] and\n[OI] lines imply an average X-ray luminosity of $4\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nwhile the [NeV] upper limits bring strong constraints to the soft X-ray flux\narising from the binary.

There have been recent reassessments of the expected DM\ngamma-ray signals in case of long-range interactions, commonly known as\nSommerfeld enhancement. Since details of the underlying DM phase-space\ndistribution function become critical, there are potentially large\nuncertainties in the final result. We provide here a first attempt towards a\ncomprehensive investigation of these systematics, addressing the impact on the\nexpected DM flux from Milky Way dwarfs via Bayesian inference on the available\nstellar kinematic datasets. After reconsidering the study case of ergodic\nsystems, we investigate for the first time scenarios where DM particle orbits\nmay have a radial or tangential bias. We consider both cuspy and cored\nparametric DM density profiles, together with the case of a non-parametric halo\nmodelling directly connected to line-of-sight observable quantities. The main\nfindings of our work highlight the relevance of the assumed phase-space\ndistribution: Referring to a generalized J-factor, namely the line-of-sight\nconvolution of the spatial part in case of velocity-dependent annihilation\nrate, an enhancement (suppression) with respect to the limit of isotropic\nphase-space distributions is obtained for the case of tangentially (radially)\nbiased DM particle orbits. We provide new estimates for J-factors for the eight\nbrightest Milky Way dwarfs also in the limit of velocity-independent DM\nannihilation, in good agreement with previous results in literature, and derive\ndata-driven lower-bounds based on the non-parametric modelling of the halo\ndensity. The outcome of our broad study stands out as a representative of the\nstate-of-the-art in the field, and falls within the interest of current and\nfuture experimental collaborations involved in DM indirect detection programs. \n\n"}

SNe that are randomly\ndistributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because\nmost supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of\nthe disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These\nenergetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject\nsubstantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star\nformation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by\nthe SNe, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the\nsurroundings.

In\naddition, we compile 64 low-$z$ Seyfert-1 nuclei with negligible mid-IR star\nformation contamination and satisfactorily fit the individual IR SEDs as well\nas the composite UV to mid-IR composite SEDs.

The SEDs of high-$z$ peculiar AGNs, including the extremely red quasars,\nmid-IR warm-excess AGNs, and hot dust-obscured galaxies, can be also reproduced\nby our model. These results indicate that the IR SEDs of most AGNs, regardless\nof redshift or luminosity, arise from similar circumnuclear torus properties\nbut differ mainly due to the optical depths of extended obscuring dust\ncomponents. \n\n"}
