We discuss the nature of the MSX sources (mostly AGB\nstars), their luminosities, the interstellar extinction, the mass-loss rate\ndistribution and the total mass-loss rate in the bulge. The MIR data of MSX\npoint sources have been combined with the NIR (J, H and Ks) data of 2MASS\nsurvey. The cross-identification was restricted to Ks-band detected sources\nwith Ks <= 11 mag. However, for those bright MSX D-band sources ([D] < 4.0\nmag), which do not satisfy this criteria, we have set no Ks-band magnitude cut\noff. The relation between Mdot and (Ks-[15])0 was used to derive the mass-loss\nrate of each MSX source in the bulge fields. Except for very few post-AGB\nstars, PNe and OH/IR stars, a large fraction of the detected sources at 15\nmicron (MSX D-band) are AGB stars well above the RGB tip.

These changes in shell structure also have\nimportant implications for the synthesis of heavy elements in stars and stellar\nexplosions. In this review a brief overview of the basics of the nuclear shell\nmodel will be given together with a summary of recent theoretical and\nexperimental activities investigating these changes in the nuclear shell\nstructure. \n\n"}

In order to reproduce the abundances of the solar system and of the\nold halo stars, at least two components are required: the heavy r-process\nnuclei (A>130) and the weak r-process which correspond to the lighter heavy\nnuclei (A<130). In this work, we present nucleosynthesis studies based on\ntrajectories of hydrodynamical simulations for core-collapse supernovae and\ntheir subsequent neutrino-driven winds. We show that the weak r-process\nelements can be produced in neutrino-driven winds and we relate their\nabundances to the neutrino emission from the nascent neutron star. Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds. However, by artificially increasing\nthe wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can be made. In this way one can mimic\nthe general behavior of an ejecta where the r-process occurs. We use this to\nstudy the impact of the nuclear physics input (nuclear masses, neutron capture\ncross sections, and beta-delayed neutron emission) and of the long-time\ndynamical evolution on the final abundances. \n\n"}

We show that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) suppresses the\naxial-charge of a dressed-quark, g_A^q, at infrared momenta. Since this effect\ndisappears as chiral symmetry is restored, one may argue that g_A vanishes with\nthe restoration of chiral symmetry because no nucleon bound-state survives the\nassociated transition. The suppression of g_A^q is shown to be part of an\nexplanation for a 25% reduction of g_A from its nonrelativistic quark-model\nvalue. Critical too, however, is the presence of dressed-quark angular momentum\nwithin the nucleon. The value of g_A^q depends on the kernels of the gap and\nBethe-Salpeter equations. We find that incorporation of essentially\nnonperturbative effects associated with DCSB into these kernels inflates the\nvalue relative to that obtained at leading-order in a widely used truncation of\nQCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations. Such corrections also affect the nucleon's\naxial radius.

Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time.

First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay.

Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm\nproduction in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these\nconstraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the\nreaction rates involved. The production ratio depends almost exclusively on the\n(gamma,n)/(gamma,alpha) branching at 148Gd. A measurement of\n144Sm(alpha,gamma)148Gd at low energy had discovered considerable discrepancies\nbetween cross section predictions and the data. Although this reaction cross\nsection mainly depends on the optical alpha+nucleus potential, no global\noptical potential has yet been found which can consistently describe the\nresults of this and similar alpha-induced reactions at the low energies\nencountered in astrophysical environments. The untypically large deviation in\n144Sm(alpha,gamma) and the unusual energy dependence can be explained, however,\nby low-energy Coulomb excitation which is competing with compound nucleus\nformation at very low energies. Considering this additional reaction channel,\nthe cross sections can be described with the usual optical potential\nvariations, compatible with findings for (n,alpha) reactions in this mass\nrange. Low-energy (alpha,gamma) and (alpha,n) data on other nuclei can also be\nconsistently explained in this way. Since Coulomb excitation does not affect\nalpha-emission, the 148Gd(gamma,alpha) rate is much higher than previously\nassumed. This leads to small 146Sm/144Sm stellar production ratios, in even\nmore pronounced conflict with the meteorite data. \n\n"}

Heavy quarks are considered\neffective probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a short\ntime scale, with respect to that of the QGP, and subsequently interact with it.\nMoreover, for a proper assessment of the characteristics of the matter produced\nin heavy-ion collisions, it is important to disentangle the final state effects\ndue to the formation of a QGP from the initial state effects due to the fact\nthat nuclei are present in the colliding system. Both initial and final state\neffects may lead to qualitatively similar phenomena in the observables of\ninterest. The measurement of charmed meson production in proton-nucleus\ncollisions allows to assess initial state effects present in nuclear\ncollisions, under the assumption that an extended deconfined medium is not\ncreated in this kind of interactions.

In this work, we vary the extragalactic ultraviolet\nbackground for a high-resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-like\ngalaxy and examine the effect on the absorption and emission properties of\nmetals in the CGM. We find that a reduced quasar background brings the column\ndensity predictions into better agreement with recent data. Similarly, when the\nobservationally derived physical properties of the gas are compared to the\nsimulation, we find that the simulation gas is always at temperatures\napproximately 0.5 dex higher. Thus, similar column densities can be produced\nfrom fundamentally different gas. However, emission maps can provide\ncomplementary information to the line-of-sight column densities to better\nderive gas properties. From the simulations, we find that the brightest\nemission is less sensitive to the extragalactic background and that it closely\nfollows the fundamental filamentary structure of the halo. This becomes\nincreasingly true as the galaxy evolves from z=1 to z=0 and the majority of the\ngas transitions to a hotter, more diffuse phase. For the brightest ions (CIII,\nCIV, OVI), detectable emission can extend as far as 120 kpc at z=0. Finally,\nresolution is a limiting factor for the conclusions we can draw from emission\nobservations but with moderate resolution and reasonable detection limits,\nupcoming instrumentation should place constraints on the physical properties of\nthe CGM. \n\n"}

In fact, the presence of a finite\ntriangular flow as well as cumulants of the flow harmonic distribution that\ndiffer from the mean are only possible when these event-by-event fluctuations\nare considered.

We show that,\nbecause of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when\n$K\\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state\nare narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After freezeout this wake\nbecomes soft particles with a broad angular distribution but with net momentum\nin the jet direction. We show that the particles coming from the response of\nthe medium to the momentum and energy deposited in it leads to a correlation\nbetween the momentum of soft particles well separated from the jet in angle\nwith the direction of the jet momentum, and find qualitative but not\nquantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed to\nextract such a correlation. By confronting the results that we obtain upon\nintroducing transverse momentum broadening and the response of the medium to\nthe jet with available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes\nfor understanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets. \n\n"}

In these measurements pseudorapidity ($\\Delta\\eta$) and\nazimuthal ($\\Delta\\varphi$) differences are used to extract the shape of the\nnear-side peak formed by particles associated to a higher $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\ntrigger particle ($1 < p_{\\mathrm{T, trig}} <$ 8 GeV/c).

A significant broadening of the peak in\nthe $\\Delta\\eta$ direction at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is found from peripheral to\ncentral collisions, which vanishes above 4 GeV/c, while in the $\\Delta\\varphi$\ndirection the peak is almost independent of centrality.

The contributions of\nmissing non-elastic channels were estimated from statistical model\ncalculations.\n  Results: The total reaction cross sections from elastic scattering and from\nthe sum of the cross sections over all open non-elastic channels agree well\nwithin the uncertainties. This finding confirms the consistency of the\nexperimental data. At the higher energy of 16.1 MeV, the predicted significant\ncontribution of compound-inelastic scattering to the total reaction cross\nsection is confirmed experimentally.

The present\nstudy proves experimentally that the total cross section from elastic\nscattering is identical to the sum of non-elastic reaction cross sections.\nThus, the statistical model can reliably be used to distribute the total\nreaction cross section among the different open channels. \n\n"}

A comparison between lattice simulations and the Hadron\nResonance Gas (HRG) model suggested the existence of missing strange\nresonances. To clarify this issue we calculate the partial pressures of mesons\nand baryons with different strangeness quantum numbers using lattice\nsimulations in the confined phase of QCD. In order to make this calculation\nfeasible, we perform simulations at imaginary strangeness chemical potentials.\nWe systematically study the effect of different hadronic spectra on\nthermodynamic observables in the HRG model and compare to lattice QCD results.\nWe show that, for each hadronic sector, the well established states are not\nenough in order to have agreement with the lattice results. Additional states,\neither listed in the Particle Data Group booklet (PDG) but not well\nestablished, or predicted by the Quark Model (QM), are necessary in order to\nreproduce the lattice data. For mesons, it appears that the PDG and the quark\nmodel do not list enough strange mesons, or that, in this sector, interactions\nbeyond those included in the HRG model are needed to reproduce the lattice QCD\nresults. \n\n"}

Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet is disrupted\nand fast reconnection can occur.

As it is known, in this scenario, the gravitational interaction is\namplified in short distances.

The reason is\nconnected to the fact that, when the ion is in a Rydberg state with high\nangular momentum, the gravitational potential energy is not computable in\nzero-width brane approximation due to the gravitational influence of the\nelectrovacuum in which the lepton is moving.

In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for\n3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that\nunifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage,\nend-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud\ninto equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each\nvoxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel\nfeature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a\ndescriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to\ngenerate detections.

It is also\ndemonstrated that there exist input-agnostic perturbations, called universal\nadversarial perturbations, which can change the inference of target model on\nmost of the data samples. However, existing methods to craft universal\nperturbations are (i) task specific, (ii) require samples from the training\ndata distribution, and (iii) perform complex optimizations. Additionally,\nbecause of the data dependence, fooling ability of the crafted perturbations is\nproportional to the available training data. In this paper, we present a novel,\ngeneralizable and data-free approaches for crafting universal adversarial\nperturbations. Independent of the underlying task, our objective achieves\nfooling via corrupting the extracted features at multiple layers. Therefore,\nthe proposed objective is generalizable to craft image-agnostic perturbations\nacross multiple vision tasks such as object recognition, semantic segmentation,\nand depth estimation. In the practical setting of black-box attack scenario\n(when the attacker does not have access to the target model and it's training\ndata), we show that our objective outperforms the data dependent objectives to\nfool the learned models. Further, via exploiting simple priors related to the\ndata distribution, our objective remarkably boosts the fooling ability of the\ncrafted perturbations. Significant fooling rates achieved by our objective\nemphasize that the current deep learning models are now at an increased risk,\nsince our objective generalizes across multiple tasks without the requirement\nof training data for crafting the perturbations.

This rapid mixing underlies Landau damping of these\nfluctuations in a quiescent plasma-one of the most fundamental physical\nphenomena that make plasma different from a conventional fluid. Nevertheless,\nbroad power-law spectra of compressive fluctuations are observed in turbulent\nastrophysical plasmas (most vividly, in the solar wind) under conditions\nconducive to strong Landau damping. Elsewhere in nature, such spectra are\nnormally associated with fluid turbulence, where energy cannot be dissipated in\nthe inertial scale range and is therefore cascaded from large scales to small.\nBy direct numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, it is shown here\nthat turbulence of compressive fluctuations in collisionless plasmas strongly\nresembles one in a collisional fluid and does have broad power-law spectra.\nThis \"fluidization\" of collisionless plasmas occurs because phase mixing is\nstrongly suppressed on average by \"stochastic echoes\", arising due to nonlinear\nadvection of the particle distribution by turbulent motions. Besides resolving\nthe long-standing puzzle of observed compressive fluctuations in the solar\nwind, our results suggest a conceptual shift for understanding kinetic plasma\nturbulence generally: rather than being a system where Landau damping plays the\nrole of dissipation, a collisionless plasma is effectively dissipationless\nexcept at very small scales. The universality of \"fluid\" turbulence physics is\nthus reaffirmed even for a kinetic, collisionless system. \n\n"}

Hubble Space Telescope observations suggest that this wavelength\nregion is relevant for distinguishing between hazy/cloudy and clear\natmospheres.\n  Methods: We observed one transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with\nCARMENES. Telluric and stellar absorption lines were removed using Sysrem,\nwhich performs a principal component analysis including proper error\npropagation. The residual spectra were analysed for water absorption with\ncross-correlation techniques using synthetic atmospheric absorption models.\n  Results: We report a cross-correlation peak at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nof 6.6, revealing the presence of water in the transmission spectrum of HD\n189733 b.

The\nmodel predicts two states with nucleon quantum numbers which have tentatively\nbeen identified with the N*(1440) and the N*(1710). This paper examines the\nviability of this model by focusing on the decay width of the nucleon members\nof the multiplet. An inequality relating the partial widths of these nucleon\nstates in the N+nucleon channel to the width of the theta+ is derived for this\nmodel under the assuming ideal mixing and that the only significant exact SU(3)\nsymmetry violations are the result of ideal mixing, threshold effects and the\nmasses of pseudo-Goldstone bosons. This inequality is badly violated if the\nstates in the multiplet are the N*(1440) and the N*(1710) and if the recent\nbounds extracted for the theta+ width are reliable.

The data are well-reproduced by perfect fluid dynamics. A\ncalculation of the dimensionless ratio of shear viscosity $\\eta$ to entropy\ndensity $s$ by Kovtun, Son and Starinets within anti-de Sitter space/conformal\nfield theory yields $\\eta/s = \\hbar/4\\pi k_B$ which has been conjectured to be\na lower bound for any physical system. Motivated by these results, we show that\nthe transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons has behavior similar to\nhelium, nitrogen, and water at and near their phase transitions in the ratio\n$\\eta/s$.

Also\nthe multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent\nyears. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to\nfurther gain in performance.

With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression\nof a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user\ninterfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling\nallowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods.

Employing a recently developed method of constructing\nthe Hilbert space and observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we then obtain the\nprobability current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ for the localization of a\nKlein-Gordon field in space. We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both\n$J_a^\\mu$ and ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the\nlocalization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike\n$J_a^\\mu$ the current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ is neither covariant nor\nconserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either\nof these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the\ntotal probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of\n$J_a^\\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge\nsymmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if\nthe parameter $a$ is rational. It is the multiplicative group of positive real\nnumbers if $a$ is irrational. We also discuss an extension of our results to\nKlein-Gordon fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field. \n\n"}
