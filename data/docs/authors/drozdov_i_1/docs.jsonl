Therefore,\nin this paper, we argue that not only D9-brane but also Dp-brane for p less\nthan 9 has a 9-volume. This idea is new, as the present view states that such a\nDp-brane has p-volume but no 9 volume.

To represent this\nability, a mathematical operation called postcorrection is introduced, which\ncorrects the present state to guarantee certain characteristics of the future\nstate. Evolution of living matter is thus determined by goals (first of all by\nthe goal of survival) as well as by causes.

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory.

Abstract: The time-tested BCS theory of superconductivity is generally accepted to be\nthe correct theory of conventional superconductivity by physicists and, by\nextension, by the world at large. In a different realm of human activity, until\nvery recently Bernard Madoff's time-tested investment operation was generally\naccepted as true and legitimate in the financial world. Madoff's Ponzi scheme,\nwhere old investors were being paid off by funds contributed by new investors,\nwas fundamentally flawed, yet was able to thrive for decades because of many\nvested interests. `Red flags' suggesting its illegitimacy were ignored. Here I\nsuggest that the same is true of BCS theory. There are an increasing number of\n`red flags' that strongly suggest the possibility that BCS theory may be\nfundamentally flawed. For example, an ever-growing number of superconductors\nare being classified as `unconventional', not described by the conventional BCS\ntheory and each requiring a different physical mechanism. In addition, I argue\nthat BCS theory is unable to explain the Meissner effect, $the$ most\nfundamental property of superconductors.

From one day to\nthe next, Madoff's edifice came crashing down and a staggering 50 billion\ndollars evaporated, and I suggest that this may also be the fate of BCS theory.\nI outline an alternative theory to conventional BCS theory proposed to apply to\nall superconductors, `conventional' as well as `unconventional', that offers an\nexplanation for the Meissner effect as well as for other puzzles and provides\nclear guidelines in the search for new high temperature superconductors. \n\n"}

Abstract: Wrong Monte-Carlo computations are used to study the propagation of light in\nlow pressure gas of nebulae.\n  We recall that the incoherent interactions required for Monte Carlo\ncalculations and hindering coherent interactions are due to collisions that\ndisappear at low pressure. Incoherent interactions blur the images while\ncoherent do not. We introduce coherent optical effects or substitute them for\nMonte Carlo calculations in published papers, improving the results and\navoiding the introduction of \"new physics\".\n  The spectral radiance of novae has the magnitude of the radiance of lasers,\nand large column densities are available in the nebulae. Several types of\ncoherent interactions (superradiance, multiphoton effects, etc..), well studied\nusing lasers, work in nebulae as in laboratories.\n  The relatively thin shell of plasma containing atoms around a Str\\^omgren\nsphere is superradiant, so that the limb of the sphere is seen as a circle\nwhich may be dotted into an even number of \"pearls\".

In Loop Quantum Gravity only two algebras have been\nintroduced until now. In the project about 'Algebras of Quantum Variables (AQV)\nfor LQG' the known holonomy-flux *-algebra and the Weyl C*-algebra will be\nmodified and a set of new algebras will be proposed and studied. The idea of\nthe construction of these algebras is to establish a finite set of operators,\nwhich generates (in the sense of Woronowicz, Schm\\\"udgen and Inoue) the\ndifferent O*- or C*-algebras of quantum gravity and to use inductive limits of\nthese algebras. In the Loop Quantum Gravity approach usually the basic\nclassical variables are connections and fluxes. Studying the three constraints\nappearing in the canonical quantisation of classical general relativity in the\nADM-formalism some other variables like curvature appear. Consequently the main\ndifficulty of a quantisation of gravity is to find a suitable replacement of\nthe set of elementary classical variables and constraints.

Because the result has an enormous\nimpact on science, it might be worth double-checking the time definitions with\nrespect to the non-inertial system in which the neutrino travel time was\nmeasured.

The context I am using is that of massive relativistic quantum\nfield theory, which is the framework for describing the region near quantum\ncritical points in any universality class with translation invariance and with\ndynamical exponent z equal to 1. I show, in this completely general setup, that\na particular steady-state density matrix occurs naturally from the physically\nmotivated Keldysh formulation of the steady state. In this formulation the\nsteady state occurs as a result of a large-time evolution from an initial state\nwhere two halves of the system are separately thermalized. I also show how this\nsuggests a particular dependence (a \"factorization\") of the average current on\nthe left and right temperatures. The idea of this density matrix was proposed\nalready in a recent publication with my collaborator Denis Bernard, where we\nstudied it in the context of conformal field theory. \n\n"}

In this class\nof models the apparent power loss at large scales is caused by the background\ndynamics which involves a sharp transition from a fast-roll power law phase to\na period of Starobinsky-like slow-roll inflation. An interesting feature of\nthis class of string inflationary models is that the number of e-foldings of\ninflation is inversely proportional to the string coupling to a positive power.\nTherefore once the string coupling is tuned to small values in order to trust\nstring perturbation theory, enough e-foldings of inflation are automatically\nobtained without the need of extra tuning.

In our setting, the\nshift symmetry comes from a partial large complex structure limit of the\nunderlying type IIB orientifold or F-theory fourfold. The coefficient of the\ninflaton term in the superpotential has to be tuned small to avoid conflict\nwith Kahler moduli stabilisation. To allow such a tuning, this coefficient\nnecessarily depends on further complex structure moduli. At large values of the\ninflaton field, these moduli are then in danger of backreacting too strongly.\nTo avoid this, further tunings are necessary. In weakly coupled type IIB theory\nat the orientifold point, implementing these tunings appears to be difficult if\nnot impossible. However, fourfolds or models with mobile D7-branes provide\nenough structural freedom. We calculate the resulting inflaton potential and\nstudy the feasibility of the overall tuning given the limited freedom of the\nflux landscape. Our preliminary investigations suggest that, even imposing all\ntuning conditions, the remaining choice of flux vacua can still be large enough\nfor such models to provide a promising path to large-field inflation in string\ntheory. \n\n"}

It is shown that there are\nimportant differences between relativistic and non-relativistic scattering\nconcerning long-range. In particular, it is proved that the electric potential\ncan be recovered without assuming the knowledge of the long-range part of the\nmagnetic potential, which has to be supposed in the non-relativistic case. The\nelectric potential and the magnetic field are recovered from the high momenta\nlimit of the scattering operator, as well as fluxes modulo $2 \\pi $ around\nhandles of the obstacle.

Quantum systems scan all possible available states and switch randomly\nand very rapidly among them. The longer they remain in a given state, the\nlarger the probability of the system to be found in that state during a\nmeasurement. A crucial property that we postulate is quantum inertia, that\nincreases whenever a constituent is added, or the system is perturbed with all\nkinds of interactions. Once the quantum inertia $I_q$ reaches a critical value\n$I_{cr}$ for an observable, the switching among the different eigenvalues of\nthat observable stops and the corresponding superposition comes to an end.\nConsequently, increasing the mass, temperature, gravitational force, etc. of a\nquantum system increases its quantum inertia until the superposition of states\ndisappears for all the observables and the system transmutes into a classical\none. The process could be reversible: decreasing the size, temperature,\ngravitational force, etc. of a classical system one could revert the situation.\nEntanglement can only occur between quantum systems, not between a quantum\nsystem and a classical one, because an exact synchronization between the\nswitchings of the systems involved must be established in the first place and\nclassical systems do not have any switchings to start with.

We focus on scalar and tensor glueballs, and derive an effective\ntheory for the Pomeron by analytic continuation along the leading trajectory\nfrom the tensor glueball.

The mechanism for this is that the\nlinearized Yang-Mills equations in the background of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\n(RN) black holes possess a normalizable zero mode, resulting in non-Abelian\n(nA) magnetic clouds near the horizon. In this work we show that the same\npattern may occur also for asymptotically flat RN black holes. Different from\nthe anti-de Sitter case, in the Minkowskian background the prerequisite for the\nexistence of the nA clouds is $i)$ a large enough gauge group and $ii)$ the\npresence of some extra interaction terms in the matter Lagrangian. To\nillustrate this mechanism we present two specific examples, one in four and the\nother in five dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. In the first case, we\naugment the usual $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills Lagrangian with higher order (quartic)\ncurvature term, while for the second one we add the Chern-Simons density to the\n$SO(6)$ Yang-Mills system.

We therefore explore\nconservation of the quasi-local Misner-Sharp energy within the causal horizon,\nwhich, as we argue, is necessarily an apparent horizon.

Its conservation, however,\nyields \"empty\" de Sitter (open, flat, closed) as single cosmological solution,\nwhere Misner-Sharp total energy acts as cosmological constant and where the\nsource of curvature energy is unidentified. It is argued that de Sitter is only\napparently empty of matter.

In\nquantum-mechanical crystalline insulators, higher multipole bulk moments\nmanifest themselves by the presence of boundary-localized moments of lower\ndimension, in exact correspondence with the electromagnetic theory of classical\ncontinuous dielectrics. In the presence of certain symmetries, these moments\nare quantized, and their boundary signatures are fractionalized. These\nmultipole moments then correspond to new SPT phases. The topological structure\nof these phases is described by \"nested\" Wilson loops, which reflect the\nbulk-boundary correspondence in a way that makes evident a hierarchical\nclassification of the multipole moments.

Uncertain states on\n$I_U$ are described using complex Hilbert states, but only if their squared\namplitudes are rational and corresponding complex phase angles are rational\nmultiples of $2 \\pi$.

The key ingredient of the mechanism is a linear coupling\nof the field, responsible for generation of dark matter or baryon (lepton)\ncharge, to a function of the inflaton. During inflation this induces almost\nconstant force dragging the corresponding field to the non-zero value. This\nforce explicitly breaks quantum numbers associated with dark matter/baryon\nabundance at later stages. As a particular realization of the mechanism we\nintroduce a super-heavy complex scalar field with the mass larger than the\nHubble rate during the last e-folds of inflation. The global U(1)-symmetry is\nviolated due to the linear coupling of the phase of the complex scalar to the\ninflaton. The symmetry breaking leads to the generation of a non-zero Noether\ncharge.

Yet, the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the\ncritical point remained elusive, and only fragments of a quantitative\nanalytical understanding existed up to now.

It is thus indispensable\nto study the non-linear, late-time evolution of cosmic structures to try and\ndisentangle their fundamental properties caused by the cosmological model or\ngravity theory itself. Conventionally, non-linear cosmic structure formation is\nstudied by means of computationally expensive numerical simulations. Since\nthese inevitably suffer from shot noise and are too time consuming to\nsystematically scrutinize large parameter spaces of cosmological models or\nfundamental theories, analytical methods are needed to overcome the limitations\nof numerical simulations.\n  Recently, a new analytic approach to non-linear cosmic structure formation\nhas been proposed based on kinetic field theory for classical particle\nensembles.

Lattice simulations of fully nonlinear preheating dynamics show\nspecific features of this intermediate stage: occupation numbers of the scalar\nparticles are peaked, scalar fields become significantly non-gaussian and the\nfield dynamics become chaotic and irreversible. Visualization of the field\ndynamics in configuration space reveals that nonlinear interactions generate\nnon-gaussian inflaton inhomogeneities with very fast growing amplitudes. The\npeaks of the inflaton inhomogeneities coincide with the peaks of the scalar\nfield(s) produced by parametric resonance.

This implies that the mass of the axion\ncan be adjusted independently of its couplings to ordinary matter, thereby\nproviding a new method of rendering the axion invisible. Second, we discuss the\nnew phenomenon of laboratory axion oscillations (analogous to neutrino\noscillations), and show that these oscillations cause laboratory axions to\n``decohere'' extremely rapidly as a result of Kaluza-Klein mixing. This\ndecoherence may also be a contributing factor to axion invisibility. Third, we\ndiscuss the role of Kaluza-Klein axions in axion-mediated processes and decays,\nand propose several experimental tests of the higher-dimensional nature of the\naxion. Finally, we show that under certain circumstances, the presence of an\ninfinite tower of Kaluza-Klein axion modes can significantly accelerate the\ndissipation of the energy associated with cosmological relic axion\noscillations, thereby enabling the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to\nexceed the usual four-dimensional relic oscillation bounds.

Both\napproaches yield that the high-mass states are governed by m sim HN (N,`large\ninteger'), where m is the string mass and H is the Hubble constant.

More precisely, we find a first order phase\ntransition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology;\nthe intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black\nhole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between\nMinkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a\nnaked singularity.\n  For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation\nanalogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the\nparameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions.\nWe find that $Mass\\propto|\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_*|^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma\\approx\n0.66$.

Then we discuss supertasks and bifurcated supertasks. The concept of\nlocalization leads us to Newton and Wigner and to interesting phenomenon of\nquantum revivals. At last we note that the paradoxical idea of timeless\nuniverse, defended by Zeno and Parmenides at ancient times, is still alive in\nquantum gravity. The list of references that follows is necessarily incomplete\nbut we hope it will assist interested reader to fill in details. \n\n"}

In this\nZPF-inertia theory, mass is postulated to be not an intrinsic property of\nmatter but rather a kind of electromagnetic drag force that proves to be\nacceleration dependent by virtue of the spectral characteristics of the ZPF.\nThe theory proposes that interactions between the ZPF and matter take place at\nthe level of quarks and electrons, hence would account for the mass of a\ncomposite neutral particle such as the neutron. An effort to generalize the\nexploratory study of Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff (1994) into a proper\nrelativistic formulation has been successful. Moreover the principle of\nequivalence implies that in this view gravitation would also be electromagnetic\nin origin along the lines proposed by Sakharov (1968).

It is demonstrated that\nfrom a empiric-physical point of view these assumptions are not given in the\ncase of inertial systems separated by very large distances. Analogous to the\nimpossibility to measure motion relative to absolute space, it turns out to be\nphysically non feasible to extend the coordinate system of any reference frame\nconsidered at rest relative to a distantly moving system for a direct\ncomparision of the coordinates, and vice versa.
