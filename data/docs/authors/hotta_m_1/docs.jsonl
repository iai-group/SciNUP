We recast this as an ordinary\nfunctional integral by changing direct integration over subpaths constrained to\nall have the same two endpoints into an equivalent integration over those\nsubpaths' unconstrained second derivatives. Function expansion with generalized\nLegendre polynomials of time then enables the functional integral to be\nunambiguously evaluated through first order in the elapsed time, yielding the\nSchroedinger equation with a unique quantization of the classical Hamiltonian.\nWidespread disbelief in that uniqueness stemmed from the mistaken notion that\nno subpath can have its two endpoints arbitrarily far separated when its\nnonzero elapsed time is made arbitrarily short.

For the calculation, a mode-summation method\nis used, supplemented with a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula.\nThis allows to explicitly extract the contributions to the expectation values\nwhich come from each single boundary, and to expand the second-plate-induced\npart in terms of exponentially convergent integrals. Several limiting cases of\ninterest are then studied. Moreover, the Casimir forces acting on the plates\nare evaluated, and it is shown that the curvature of the background spacetime\ndecisively influences the behavior of these forces at separations larger than\nthe curvature scale of de Sitter spacetime. In terms of the curvature coupling\nparameter and the mass of the field, two very different regimes are realized,\nwhich exhibit monotonic and oscillatory behavior of the vacuum expectation\nvalues, respectively.

The Tempo2 software was used to time-stamp events observed on\nthe geoid with respect to the SSB inertial observer time. Neutrino results from\nOPERA might carry the fingerprint of non-inertial effects. The CERN-Gran Sasso\nclock synchronization is accomplished by applying corrections that depend on\nspecial and general relativistic time dilation effects at the clocks, depending\non the position of the clocks in the solar system gravitational well. As a\nconsequence, TOF distributions are centered on values shorter by tens of ns\nthan expected, integrating over a period from April to December, longer if\notherwise. It is worth remarking that the OPERA runs have always been carried\nout from April/May to November. If the analysis by Tempo2 holds for the OPERA\nexperiment, the excellent measurement by the OPERA collaboration will turn into\na proof of the General Relativity theory in a weak field approximation.

We first investigate the effects of different kinds of weak ties on\nthe variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and\nfind that the bridgeness with small degree can enhance the predictability of\nepidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, compared with the variability\nof arrival time, the variability of prevalence displays a diametrically opposed\nchanging trend with both the distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness and\nthe degree of the initial seed. More specifically, the further distance and the\nlarger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of\narrival time and the worse predictability of prevalence.

In Ca_2-xNa_xCuO2Cl2, having one CuO2 plane per unit\ncell, superconductivity emerges when laterally confined Coulomb oscillators\nstart connecting along 6 x 6 superlattice domains (in units of planar lattice\nconstants) and it peaks at 4 x 4 domains when, at doping x = 1/8, the\nsuperlattice is completed. With further doping a new, off-set superlattice\ngrows. Its frustrating effect gradually reduces superconductivity to cessation.\nThe same mechanism holds for La_2-xAe_xCuO4 which has two, staggered CuO2\nplanes per unit cell. The staggering causes superconducting frustration or\nboost between adjacent layer sandwiches.

It is revealed that a Gaussian\nwave-packet describing a heavy hole diffuses asymmetrically along the circular\norbit while performing cyclotron motion. The wave packet splits into two peaks\nwith unequal amplitudes after a certain time depending on spin-orbit coupling\nconstant.

The latter approach shows that this decomposition is\nnot tied to a specific perturbative formulation for the solution of the\nEinstein equations. Rather, it can be defined at the level of the\nnon-perturbative coordinate change from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian\ndescription.

In the first approach,\nthe wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the $N$-particle sector of an extended\n\"catalytic state\". Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can\norganize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$. Requiring the\nterms of order ${N}^{1/2}$ to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation.\nGoing to the next order, $N^0$, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov\napproximation. Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture\nand to apply many techniques from quantum optics. Moreover, it is easier to\ntrack different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the\nmulti-component case. In the second approach, I consider a state of $N =l\\times\nn$ bosons that is derived by symmetrizing the $n$-fold tensor product of an\narbitrary $l$-boson state. Particularly, we are interested in the pure state\ncase for $l=2$, which we call the Pair-Correlated State (PCS). I show that PCS\nreproduces the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation; moreover, it also\nworks in the strong interaction regime where the Bogoliubov approximation\nfails. For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error\n(measured by the trace distance of the two-particle reduced density matrices)\nof PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making\nPCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases. Amazingly, the\nerror of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system\nevolves for longer times.

The\nconjecture specifies a measure for the degree of contextuality and a criterion\n(necessary and sufficient condition) for contextuality in a broad class of\nquantum systems.

This theorem\nfamously states that the maximum efficiency depends only on the temperature of\nthe heat baths used by the engine, but not on the specific structure of baths.\nHere, we show that when the heat baths are finite in size, and when the engine\noperates in the quantum nanoregime, a revision to this statement is required.\nWe show that one may still achieve the Carnot efficiency, when certain\nconditions on the bath structure are satisfied; however if that is not the\ncase, then the maximum achievable efficiency can reduce to a value which is\nstrictly less than Carnot. We derive the maximum efficiency for the case when\none of the baths is composed of qubits.

This is due\nto the fact that their action evaluated on a classical solution is not finite\nand its first variation does not vanish for all consistent boundary conditions.\nThese problems can be dealt with by adding a counterterm to the classical\naction, which is a solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation.\n  In this work we study the effects of polymer quantization on a mechanical\nmodel presenting the aforementioned difficulties and contrast it with the above\ncounterterm method. This type of quantization for mechanical models is\nmotivated by the loop quantization of gravity which is known to play a role in\nthe thermodynamics of black hole systems.\n  The model we consider is a nonrelativistic particle in an inverse square\npotential, and analyze two polarizations of the polymer quantization in which\neither the position or the momentum is discrete.

The place to collapse is depends on the\nprobability calculated from the square of absolute value of the wave function.\nThe recent new discovery tell us that the light is not just wave, it is a\ncombination of waves, retarded potential and advanced potential. These two\npotentials together produce the mutual energy current or referred as M-current.\nAnother light energy current is P-current related to Poynting vector. We found\nP-current doesn't carry any energy for light. The contribution of P-current to\nenergy transfer can be omitted. The light energy is transferred only by\nM-current. The beam of M-current doesn't like the beam of P-current which is\ndiverged from the source, instead, the M-current beam first diverges from a\nsource and then converged to a sink. Since the M-current at the place to be\nreceived is localized at one electron, the concept of wave function collapse is\nneedless.

A more general, operational\ndefinition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens, which we will term\n\"probabilistic contextuality\", drops the assumption of determinism and allows\nfor operations other than measurements to be considered contextual.\nProbabilistic noncontextuality represents the postulate that elements of an\noperational theory that cannot be distinguished from each other based on the\nstatistics of arbitrarily many repeated experiments are ontologically\nidentical.

They have\nin this process, also earned a dreadsome reputation in some corners of\ntheoretical physics. The most serious charge on the black holes is that they\neat up information, never to release and subsequently erase it. This goes\nabsolutely against the sacred principles of all other branches of fundamental\nsciences. This realization has shaken the very base of foundational concepts,\nboth in quantum theory and gravity, which we always took for granted. Attempts\nto exorcise black holes of this charge, have led us to crossroads with\nconcepts, hold dearly in quantum theory. The sphere of black hole's tussle with\nquantum theory has readily and steadily grown, from the advent of the Hawking\nradiation some four decades back, into domain of quantum information theory in\nmodern times, most aptly, recently put in the form of the firewall puzzle. Do\nblack holes really indicate something sinister about their existence or do they\nreally take the lid off our comfort with ignoring the fundamental issues, our\nmodern theories are seemingly plagued with? In this review, we focus on issues\npertaining to black hole evaporation, the development of the information loss\nparadox, its recent formulation, the leading debates and promising directions\nin the community. \n\n"}

We have considered this process using canonical examples\nof two different classes of ions: a simple alkali-halide pair, Na$^+$I$^-$, or\nclassical ions, and the products of water autoionization, H$_3$O$^+$OH$^-$, or\nwater ions. We find that for both ion classes, the microscopic mechanism of\ncharge separation, including water's collective role in the process, is\nconserved between the bulk liquid and the electrode interface. Despite this,\nthe thermodynamic and kinetic details of the process differ between these two\nenvironments in a way that depends on ion type. In the case of the classical\nion pairs, a higher free energy barrier to charge separation and a smaller flux\nover that barrier at the interface, results in a rate of dissociation that is\n40x slower relative to the bulk. For water ions, a slightly higher free energy\nbarrier is offset by a higher flux over the barrier from longer lived hydrogen\nbonding patters at the interface, resulting in a rate of association that is\nsimilar both at and away from the interface.

Here, we\nbreak this limitation via frequency multiplexing in which the switching losses\nremain fixed irrespective of the number of modes. We use the third-order\nnonlinear process of Bragg scattering four-wave mixing as an efficient\nultra-low noise frequency switch and demonstrate multiplexing of three\nfrequency modes. We achieve a record generation rate of $4.6\\times10^4$\nmultiplexed photons per second with an ultra-low $g^{2}(0)$ = 0.07, indicating\nhigh single-photon purity. Our scalable, all-fiber multiplexing system has a\ntotal loss of just 1.3 dB independent of the number of multiplexed modes, such\nthat the 4.8 dB enhancement from multiplexing three frequency modes markedly\novercomes switching loss. Our approach offers a highly promising path to\ncreating a deterministic photon source that can be integrated on a chip-based\nplatform. \n\n"}

We argue that a notion of classical\nsimulation, which we call epsilon-simulation, captures the essence of\npossessing \"equivalent computational power\" as the quantum system it simulates:\nIt is statistically impossible to distinguish an agent with access to an\nepsilon-simulator from one possessing the simulated quantum system.

Above the mean field transition temperature $T_0$, the\nfluctuation of the superconducting order parameter gives the additional\nconductivity, i.e., paraconductivity.

For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating\ncores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of\nthe proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion.

Only one such\nmap is required for the special case of no initial correlations. The same maps\ndescribe the dynamics of any system-environment state obtained from the initial\nstate by a local operation on the system. The reduction of the system dynamics\nto a set of completely positive maps allows known numerical and analytic tools\nfor uncorrelated initial states to be applied to the general case of initially\ncorrelated states, which we exemplify by solving the qubit dephasing model for\nsuch states, and provides a natural approach to quantum Markovianity for this\ncase.

This memory has slowly-decaying power-law tails.\nSuch a long-range character of the memory complicates the description of the\nresulting real-time dynamics on large time scales. In a numerical simulation,\nthis problem manifests itself in a `revival', a spurious reflected signal which\nappears after a finite time thus invalidating the simulation. In the present\nwork, we approach this problem and develop a numerical discretization of the\nbath without revivals. We find that a crucial role is played by the\nsingularities of the bath spectral density (e.g. edges of bands): the memory\nabout the (spectral) behaviour of the open system in the remote past is\ncompletely averaged out (forgotten), except an increasingly small vicinity of\nthese singular frequencies. Therefore, we introduce the concept of memory\nchannel, to denote such an irreversible information loss process around a\nparticular singular frequency. On a technical side, we begin the treatment by\nnoting that with respect to the memory loss, the quantum field of the bath\nshould be divided into the following two different parts: the observable and\nthe virtual quanta. Information about the former is never lost: they contribute\nto the trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The only way to avoid the\nrevival from the observable quanta is to calculate their dynamics exactly. We\ndo this by employing a stochastic sampling of the Husimi function of the bath.\nThe other part, the virtual quanta, are always annihilated after a certain\ndelay time. We construct a dedicated quantum representation for the virtual\nstates by assigning amplitudes to the delay times before annihilation.

Quantitative understanding of and\nprecise physical control over donor (e.g. Phosphorus) exchange are crucial\nelements in the physics underlying the proposed Si-based quantum computer\nhardware. An important potential problem in this context is that inter-valley\ninterference originating from the degeneracy in the Si conduction band edge\ncauses fast oscillations in donor exchange coupling, which imposes significant\nconstraints on the Si quantum computer architecture. In this paper we consider\nthe effect of external strain on Si donor exchange in the context of quantum\ncomputer hardware.

One can then suppress the thermal noise by\noptimally subtracting the recorded fiber motions from the measured motion of\nthe test mass, i.e., from the LIGO output. The proposed method is a\nmodification of an analogous but more technically difficult scheme by\nBraginsky, Levin and Vyatchanin for reducing broad-band suspension thermal\nnoise.

We adopt a method which places the\ndetector and the field on an equal footing and derive the two-point correlation\nfunctions of the detector and of the field separately with full account of\ntheir interplay. From the exact solutions, we are able to study the complete\nprocess from the initial transient to the final steady state, keeping track of\nall activities they engage in and the physical effects manifested.

It will be shown that\nthis inconsistency could emerge from the fact that the required geometrical\ninformation to calculate the probability of finding a particle in any point of\nthe respective manifold does not lie in a region with finite volume.\nAfterwards, we put forth a new Quantum Minimal Coupling Principle in terms of a\nrestricted path integral, and along the ideas of this model not only the\npropagator of a free particle is calculated but we also deduce the conditions\nunder which we recover Feynman's case for a free particle.

Subsequently, it\nhas been argued that the intergalactic plasma may interfere adversely with this\nmechanism by rendering the oscillations energy dependent. Here we show that\nthis energy dependence is extremely sensitive to the precise value of the free\nelectron density in the Universe. Decreasing the electron density by only a\nfactor of 4 is already sufficient to bring the energy dependence within the\nexperimental bounds. Models of the intergalactic medium show that for redshifts\nz<1 about 97% of the total volume of space is filled with regions of density\nsignificantly lower than the average density. From these models we estimate\nthat the average electron density in most of space is lower by at least a\nfactor of 15 compared to the estimate based on one half of all baryons being\nuniformly distributed and ionized. Therefore the energy dependence of the\nphoton-axion oscillations is consistent with experiment, and the oscillation\nmodel remains a viable alternative to the accelerating Universe for explaining\nthe supernova observations. Furthermore, the electron density does give rise to\na sufficiently large plasma frequency which cuts off the photon-axion mixing\nabove microwave frequencies, shielding the cosmic microwave photons from axion\nconversions and significantly relaxing the lower bounds on the axion mass\nimplied by the oscillation model. \n\n"}

An information theoretic perspective Abstract: Clustering provides a common means of identifying structure in complex data,\nand there is renewed interest in clustering as a tool for the analysis of large\ndata sets in many fields.

Traditional approaches to\nthis problem are based either on a framework in which clusters of a particular\nshape are assumed as a model of the system or on a two-step procedure in which\na clustering criterion determines the optimal assignments for a given number of\nclusters and a separate criterion measures the goodness of the classification\nto determine the number of clusters.

Consequently the basic statements of special\nrelativity can be established in relation to the principles of discrete\ninteraction.\n  The condition that Klein-Gordon equation was established without explicit use\nof the principle of correspondence gives a way to specify the area of\napplicability of the statement about the speed of light as the maximal speed of\npropagation of information. This would permit interpretation of superluminal\nphenomena with no contradictions to special relativity.\n  The conventional interpretation of time as a category which specifies\nsuccession and coexistence of events leads to interpreting of the Klein-Gordon\nand related equations (such as Maxwell or Dirac) as equations of the fields.\nThis would justify the procedure of second quantization, so that the states of\nthe field are identified with the sets of particles. \n\n"}

In recent\nyears environment-induced decoherence based the quantum Brownian motion (QBM)\nmodels have been applied to two level systems (2LS) interacting with an\nelectromagnetic field, leading to the general belief that 2LS are easily\ndecohered. In a recent paper C. Anastopoulos and B. L. Hu [Phys. Rev. A62,\n(2000) 033821] derived a new exact non-Markovian master equation at zero\ntemperature, from which they showed that this belief is actually misplaced. For\na two-level atom (2LA)- electromagnetic field (EMF) system the decoherence time\nis rather long, comparable to the relaxation time. Theoretically this is\nbecause the dominant interaction is the $\\hat \\sigma_{\\pm}$ type of coupling\nbetween the two levels (what constitutes the qubit) and the field, not the\n$\\hat \\sigma_z$ type, which shows the QBM behavior. Depending on the coupling\nthe field can act as a resonator (in an atom cavity) or as a bath (in QBM) and\nproduce very different decoherent behavior in the system. This is not new to\nCavity QED experimentalists: the 2LA-EMF system maintaining its coherence in\nsufficiently long duration is the reason why they can manipulate them so well\nto show interesting quantum coherence effects. \n\n"}

However, the influence of an environment can also destroy the\n$n$th-order quantum coherence in a quantum system, where this high order\ncoherence is captured.

A more detailed analysis is accomplished for the case of simplest\nmonopole field: namely, the one produced by putting the Dirac potential into\nthe non-Abelian scheme. Now a discrete operation diagonalized contains an\nadditional complex parameter A. The same parameter enters wave functions. This\nquantity can manifest itself at matrix elements. In particular, there have been\nanalyzed the N(A)-parity selection rules: those depending on the A. As shown,\nthe A-freedom is a consequence of the existence of additional symmetry of the\nrelevant Hamiltonian. The wave functions exhibit else one kind of freedom:\nB-freedom associated in turn with its own symmetry of the Hamiltonian. There\nhas been examined both A and B-transformations relating functions associated\nwith different A and B. \n\n"}

The model is\nshown to be compatible with both the CHSH and the CH Bell inequalities.\nMoreover, it bears the same rotational symmetry as spins. The reason why the\nmodel can reproduce the quantum correlation without violating the Bell theorem\nis that in the model the efficiency of the detectors depends on the local\nhidden variable. On average the detector efficiency is limited to 75%. \n\n"}
