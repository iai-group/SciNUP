In this work we give a\ncomprehensive study for the full one-loop supersymmetric effects on the Zbb\ncoupling in both the MSSM and the NMSSM by considering all current constraints\nwhich are from the precision electroweak measurements, the direct search for\nsparticles and Higgs bosons, the stability of Higgs potential, the dark matter\nrelic density, and the muon g-2 measurement. We analyze the characters of each\ntype of the corrections and search for the SUSY parameter regions where the\ncorrections could be sizable. We find that the sizable corrections may come\nfrom the Higgs sector with light m_A and large tan-beta, which can reach -2%\nand -6% for rho_b and sin^2 \\theta_{eff}^b,respectively.

It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the\nmodification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly\nreduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the\npeak position to lower pion energies.

Nucleon motion increases the cross section by\n15% at neutrino energies of 650 MeV, while Coulomb effects on charged pions are\nestimated to be small.

We compare PYTHIA, HERWIG, ALPGEN and SHERPA\nin the Z/gamma* inclusive production at LHC. PYTHIA and HERWIG are able to\ncorrect the first emission from the shower taking the Matrix Element\ncalculation for one additional parton into account. SHERPA and ALPGEN are able\nto take into account Matrix Element corrections not only for one, but rather\nfor several hard emissions from the incoming partons. This can be done at the\nprice of introducing a separation cut to distinguish a Matrix Element and a\nParton Shower populated regions. In this paper we check the effect of Matrix\nElement corrections in PYTHIA and HERWIG and we check that results from these\ntwo generators are consistent. Then we turn to SHERPA and ALPGEN, that\nimplement two different methods to match Matrix Element calculations and Parton\nShower. If we constraint them so that no more than one parton can emerge from\nthe Matrix Element calculations they should both give results similar to PYTHIA\nand HERWIG. In other words PYTHIA and HERWIG provide us with the correct\nreference to spot possible issues with the matching prescriptions implemented\nin SHERPA and ALPGEN.

We argue there is a very well motivated theoretical preexisting\nframework consistent with dark matter annihilation being observed by the PAMELA\nsatellite detector. The dark matter is (mainly) the neutral W boson\nsuperpartner, the wino with mass below 200 GeV. Using the program GALPROP we\nstudy the annihilation products and backgrounds together. Antimatter and gammas\nfrom annihilating winos contribute below this energy. We explain why PAMELA\ndata does not imply no antiproton signal was observed by PAMELA or earlier\nexperiments, and explain why the antiproton analysis was misunderstood by\nearlier papers. Wino annihilation does not describe the Fermi e+ + e- data\n(except partially below ~ 100 GeV). At higher energies we expect astrophysical\nmechanisms, and we simply parameterize them so the combination can describe all\nthe data. We emphasize several predictions for satellite data to test the wino\ninterpretation, particularly the turndown of the positron and antiproton\nspectra above 100 GeV. Most other interpretations require a large rise in the\npositron rates above 100 GeV. We focus on studying this well-motivated and long\npredicted wino interpretation, rather than comparisons with other\ninterpretations. We emphasize that interpretations also depend very strongly on\nassumptions about the cosmological history of the universe, and on propagation\nof antiprotons and positrons in the galaxy. The winos PAMELA is observing arose\nfrom some non-thermal sources such as moduli decay rather than a universe that\ncooled in thermal equilibrium after the big bang.

Abstract: We study models in which soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the MSSM\nbecome universal at some unification scale, $M_{in}$, above the GUT scale,\n$\\mgut$.

We use the\nrenormalization-group equations of the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT to\nevaluate their evolutions down to $\\mgut$, studying their dependences on the\nunknown parameters of the SU(5) superpotential. After displaying some generic\nexamples of the evolutions of the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters, we\ndiscuss the effects on physical sparticle masses in some specific examples. We\nnote, for example, that near-degeneracy between the lightest neutralino and the\nlighter stau is progressively disfavoured as $M_{in}$ increases. This has the\nconsequence, as we show in $(m_{1/2}, m_0)$ planes for several different values\nof $\\tan \\beta$, that the stau coannihilation region shrinks as $M_{in}$\nincreases, and we delineate the regions of the $(M_{in}, \\tan \\beta)$ plane\nwhere it is absent altogether.

The signals are typically characterized by a specific number of\nhard jets, leptons, or photons, while the backgrounds often have additional\njets. In such cases vetoing undesired additional jets is an effective way to\ndiscriminate signals and background. Given an inclusive event sample with N or\nmore jets, the veto to have only N energetic jets defines an \"exclusive\" N-jet\ncross section. This strongly restricts the phase space of the underlying\ninclusive N-jet cross section and causes large double logarithms in\nperturbation theory that must be summed to obtain theory predictions. Jet\nvetoes are typically implemented using jet algorithms.

The Significance Improvement Characteristic (SIC),\ndefined as the signal efficiency of a cut or multivariate discriminant divided\nby the square root of the background efficiency, is shown to be an extremely\npowerful visualization tool. SIC curves demonstrate numerical instabilities in\nthe multivariate discriminants, show convergence as the number of variables is\nincreased, and display the sensitivity to the optimal cut values. For our\napplication, we concentrate on Higgs boson production in association with a W\nor Z boson with H -> bb and compare to the irreducible standard model\nbackground, Z/W + bb. We explore thousands of experimentally motivated,\nphysically motivated, and unmotivated single variable discriminants. Along with\nthe standard kinematic variables, a number of new ones, such as twist, are\ndescribed which should have applicability to many processes. We find that some\nsingle variables, such as the pull angle, are weak discriminants, but when\ncombined with others they provide important marginal improvement. We also find\nthat multiple Higgs boson-candidate mass measures, such as from mild and\naggressively trimmed jets, when combined may provide additional discriminating\npower. Comparing the significance improvement from our variables to those used\nin recent CDF and DZero searches, we find that a 10-20% improvement in\nsignificance against Z/W + bb is possible.

The early years of this period were\nchronicled in the Quarkonium Working Group (QWG) CERN Yellow Report (YR) in\n2004, which presented a comprehensive review of the status of the field at that\ntime and provided specific recommendations for further progress. However, the\nbroad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles\ncould only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII\nprogram concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c\nflourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the\nTevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the\ndeconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,\nprecision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for\ncontinuing investigations. The plethora of newly-found quarkonium-like states\nunleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such\nas quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks. Measurements of the\nspectroscopy, decays, production, and in-medium behavior of c\\bar{c}, b\\bar{b},\nand b\\bar{c} bound states have been shown to validate some theoretical\napproaches to QCD and highlight lack of quantitative success for others.

Such\ntheories are well motivated and their gluinos typically have a O(50%) branching\nratio to charged Winos. Observing the track of a long lived charged Wino\nproduced from gluino decay could give a clear identification of a gluino event.\nCharged Wino NLSPs produced in colliders can be long-lived enough to leave a\nreconstructable high pT charged track before decaying into a soft pion (or a\nsoft lepton) and the LSP, a signature with low SM background.

This symmetry was studied in weak\ninteraction where it is fully violated, but it is poorly known in the strong\nand electromagnetic interactions.\n  To this end, in this thesis we investigated eta->pi+pi-pi0 and eta->pi0 e+e-\ndecays, which might violate charge conjugation symmetry. The violation of C\nsymmetry in eta->pi+pi-pi0 process could manifest itself as an asymmetry\nbetween energy spectra of charged pions. The eta->pi0 e+e- decay is forbidden\nby C symmetry in the first order of electromagnetic interaction, with the\nbranching ratio on a level of 10^-8. Therefore, observation of a larger\nbranching ratio could indicate a mechanism involving first order\nelectromagnetic interaction violating charge conjugation.\n  Both decays were investigated by means of the WASA-at-COSY detector operating\nat the COSY synchrotron at the Forchungszentrum Julich in Germany. The eta\nmeson was produced via pp->pp eta reaction at the proton beam momentum of\n2.14GeV/c.

This generally introduces new sources of flavour\nviolation and CP violation as well as left-handed and right-handed scalar\ncurrents. These new physics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM\nexpectations for FCNC processes that depends only on the couplings of H^0(A^0)\nto fermions and on their masses. In situations in which a single H^0 or A^0\ndominates NP contributions stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta\nF=1 observables exist. Anticipating the Flavour Precision Era ahead of us we\nillustrate this by searching for allowed oases in the landscape of a given\nmodel assuming significantly smaller uncertainties in CKM and hadronic\nparameters than presently available. To this end we analyze Delta F=2\nobservables in B^0_{s,d}-bar B^0_{s,d} and K^0-bar K^0 systems and rare B and K\ndecays with charged leptons in the final state including both left-handed and\nright-handed scalar couplings of H^0 and A^0 to quarks in various combinations.\nWe identify a number of correlations between various flavour observables that\ncould test and distinguish these different scenarios. The prominent role of the\ndecays B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- in these studies is emphasized. Imposing the\nexisting flavour constraints, a rich pattern of deviations from the SM\nexpectations in rare B_{s,d} decays emerges provided M_H< 1 TeV. NP effects in\nrare K decays are very small. Neutral SM Higgs contributions to rare B and K\ndecays turn out to be negligible once the constraints from Delta F=2 processes\nare taken into account.

Such a particle may\narise in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with average stop\nmasses of the order of the TeV scale and a sizable stop mixing parameter. In\nthis article we discuss properties of the SM-like Higgs production and decay\nrates induced by the possible presence of light staus and light stops.

However the contributions of tree-level Z exchanges to\ndecays sensitive to axial-vector couplings, like B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and B_d->K\nmu^+ mu^-, and those with neutrinos in the final state, like b->s nu bar{nu}\ntransitions, K^+->pi^+ nu bar{nu} and K_L->pi^0 nu bar{nu} cannot be generally\nneglected with size of Z contributions depending on beta, tan(bar{beta}) and\nM_Z'.

We provide a possible explanation of the excess as the isospin-triplet\ntechnivector mesons (technirhos, denoted as $\\rho_\\Pi^{\\pm,3}$) of the walking\ntechnicolor in the case of the one-family model as a benchmark. As the\neffective theory for the walking technicolor at the scales relevant to the LHC\nexperiment, we take a scale-invariant version of the hidden local symmetry\nmodel so constructed as to accommodate technipions, technivector mesons, and\nthe technidilaton in such a way that the model respects spontaneously broken\nchiral and scale symmetries of the underlying walking technicolor.

We study such exotics\nand demonstrate that they may account for the modest excess at $750$ GeV in\nrecent diphoton resonance searches performed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations. In a previous analysis of type II MSSM D-brane quivers we\nsystematically added up to five exotics for the sake of satisfying string\nconsistency conditions. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that 89780 of the\n89964 quivers have exotics, 78155 of which include singlets that may couple to\nMSSM or exotic multiplets with coupling structures governed by $U(1)$\nsymmetries that are often anomalous. We demonstrate that certain sets of\nexotics are far preferred over others and study the structure of singlet\ncouplings to heavy exotics carrying standard model charges. Typical\npossibilities include singlets that may decay to vector-like quarks and / or\nvector-like leptons and subsequently to two photons.

Despite its utility, it is not\ninfrared and collinear (IRC) safe, so perturbative calculations are limited to\nstudying the energy evolution of multiplicity moments. While IRC-safe\nobservables, like jet mass, are perturbatively calculable, their distributions\noften exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their quark/gluon discrimination power\nis limited by the ratio of quark to gluon color factors. In this paper, we\nintroduce new IRC-safe counting observables whose discrimination performance\nexceeds that of jet mass and approaches that of track multiplicity. The key\nobservation is that track multiplicity is approximately Poisson distributed,\nwith more suppressed tails than the Sudakov peak structure from jet mass. By\nusing an iterated version of the soft drop jet grooming algorithm, we can\ndefine a \"soft drop multiplicity\" which is Poisson distributed at\nleading-logarithmic accuracy. In addition, we calculate the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to this Poisson structure. If we allow\nthe soft drop groomer to proceed to the end of the jet branching history, we\ncan define a collinear-unsafe (but still infrared-safe) counting observable.\nExploiting the universality of the collinear limit, we define generalized\nfragmentation functions to study the perturbative energy evolution of\ncollinear-unsafe multiplicity. \n\n"}

Although\nthe high-$q^2$ hint may be explained by new short-ranged interactions, the\nlow-$q^2$ one cannot. We thus explore the possibility that the latter is\nexplained by a new light resonance. We find that LHCb's central value of\n$R_{K^*}$ in the low-$q^2$ bin is achievable in a restricted parameter space of\nnew-physics scenarios in which the new, light resonance decays preferentially\nto electrons and has a mass within approximately $10$ MeV of the di-muon\nthreshold. Interestingly, such an explanation can have a kinematic origin and\ndoes not require a source of lepton-flavor universality violation. A\nmodel-independent prediction is a narrow peak in the differential $B \\to K^*\ne^+e^-$ rate close to the di-muon threshold.

As a consequence,\nmultiple proton-proton collisions occur whenever two bunches cross. Interesting\nhigh-energy (hard) collisions are therefore contaminated by several soft,\nzero-bias, ones. This effect known as pileup pollutes the final state of the\ncollision. It complicates the reconstruction of the objects in this final\nstate, resulting in increased experimental uncertainties. To reduce these\nuncertainties, and improve the quality and precision of LHC measurements,\ntechniques are devised to correct for the effects of pileup. This document\nprovides a theoretical review of the main methods used during Run I and II of\nthe LHC to mitigate pileup effects. I start with an in-depth presentation of\nthe area--median used for the majority of applications, including several\nrefinements of the original idea, their practical implementation and an\nassessment of their efficiency and robustness. I then focus on several\ntheoretical calculations that can provide both quantitative and qualitative\ninformation on the area--median approach.

We review a few of the properties of radio\nemission from cosmic ray air showers and show how these properties can be\nexplained by coherent ``geosynchrotron'' emission from electron-positron pairs\nin the shower as they move through the geomagnetic field. This should allow one\nto use the radio emission as a useful diagnostic tool for cosmic ray research.\nA new generation of digital telescopes will make it possible to study this\nradio emission in greater detail. For example, the planned Low-Frequency Array\n(LOFAR), operating at 10-200 MHz, will be an instrument uniquely suited to\nstudy extensive air showers and even detect neutrino-induced showers on the\nmoon. We discuss sensitivities, count rates and possible detection algorithms\nfor LOFAR and a currently funded prototype station LOPES. This should also be\napplicable to other future digital radio telescopes such as the\nSquare-Kilometer-Array (SKA). LOFAR will be capable of detecting air-shower\nradio emission from >2*10^14 eV to ~10^20 eV. The technique could be easily\nextended to include air shower arrays consisting of particle detectors\n(KASCADE, Auger), thus providing crucial additional information for obtaining\nenergy and chemical composition of cosmic rays. It also has the potential to\nextend the cosmic ray search well beyond an energy of 10^21 eV if isotropic\nradio signatures can be found. Other issues that LOFAR can address are to\ndetermine the neutral component of the cosmic ray spectrum, possibly look for\nneutron bursts, and do actual cosmic ray astronomy. \n\n"}
