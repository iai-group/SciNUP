Three physical degrees of\nfreedom are identified and it is shown that, in the case where matter is\ndescribed by a scalar field, they generalize the Mukhanov-Sasaki variables. In\norder to show that they are canonical variables, the action for the\ncosmological perturbations at second order is derived.

Differentiating the master equation yields a new\nexpression for the tilt d(ln Omega_gw(f))/d(ln f). The relationship between r\nand Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early\nuniverse, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a\nmodel-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where\nnt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor\nspectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)\n(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon\nre-entry).

Light-front\nholography allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth dimension to be mapped\nto frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical\nspace-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons at the\namplitude level.

We\nidentify the effective operators with the largest individual corrections to the\nlightest Higgs mass and discuss whether at the microscopic level and in the\nsimplest cases, these operators are generated by \"new physics\" with a sign\nconsistent with an increase of m_h.

In any concrete implementation of PGM,\nthe SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under\nsome global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate\nfor such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with\nthe difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the\nSUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the\nrespective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level. As a\nparticularly interesting consequence, we find that the heavy Majorana neutrino\nmass scale ends up being tied to the gravitino mass, Lambda_N ~ m_3/2. Assuming\nnonthermal leptogenesis to be responsible for the generation of the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe, this connection may then explain why SUSY\nnecessarily needs to be broken at a rather high energy scale, so that m_3/2 >~\n1000 TeV in accord with the concept of PGM.

We map out the\npotential signals and current constraints on such a framework in indirect\nsearches, using a model-independent setup based on multi-step hierarchical\ncascade decays. While remaining agnostic to the details of the hidden sector\nmodel, our framework captures the generic broadening of the spectrum of\nsecondary particles (photons, neutrinos, e+e- and antiprotons) relative to the\ncase of direct annihilation to Standard Model particles. We explore how\nindirect constraints on dark matter annihilation limit the parameter space for\nsuch cascade/multi-particle decays.

The effective-energy approach relates multihadron\nproduction in different types of collisions, by combining, under the proper\ncollision energy scaling, the constituent quark picture with Landau\nrelativistic hydrodynamics.

Small couplings and small mass\nsplittings lead to slow mediator decays, leaving signatures with displaced\nvertices or disappearing tracks at colliders.

A powerful\nmethod for observing the ISW effect is through cross-correlation of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) with a tracer of the matter in the low redshift\nuniverse. In this paper, we describe the dependence of the obtained\ncross-correlation signal on the geometry and other properties of a survey of\nthe low redshift universe.

In order to achieve this level of\nsignal-to-noise, the systematic anisotropies in the survey must be below ~ 0.1\n%, on the scale of ~ 10 degrees on the sky, while the systematic error in\nredshift estimates must be less than 0.05.\n  Then, we argue that, while an ISW detection will not be a good way of\nconstraining the conventional properties of dark energy, it could be a valuable\nmeans of testing alternative theories of gravity on large physical scales. \n\n"}

The statistics of polarization\nsingularities provides a non-trivial scheme to analyze the polarization maps\nthat is distinct from the usual two-point correlation functions. Here we\ncharacterize the statistics of the singularity distribution in simulated\npolarization maps, and make predictions that can be compared with ongoing and\nupcoming observations. We use three different characterizations: the nearest\nneighbor distance between singularities, the critical exponent \\nu that\ncaptures the scaling of total charge q within a closed curve of length L (q\n\\propto L^\\nu), and the angular two point angular correlation functions for\nsingularities of similar and opposite charge.

Current supersymmetric models\nprovide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like\nthe quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor\nand/or spin response function), permit the evaluation of the event rate for\nLSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,\nvery low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation\neffect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion.\nAlso it is useful to consider the directional rate, i.e its dependence on the\ndirection of the recoiling nucleus. In this paper we study such a modulation\neffect both in non directional and directional experiments. We calculate both\nthe differential and the total rates using both isothermal, symmetric as well\nas only axially asymmetric, and non isothermal, due to caustic rings, velocity\ndistributions.

Near the lower end of this range, axions are\nall or a major component of the cold dark matter of the universe. The late\ninfall of axions, and of any other cold dark matter particles, onto our galaxy\nproduces streams and caustics in its halo. The outer caustics are topological\nspheres whereas the inner caustics are rings. The self-similar model of\ngalactic halo formation predicts that the caustic ring radii $a_n$ obey the\napproximate law $a_n \\sim 1/n$.

Grand and partially unified models which utilise this new gauge\nsymmetry SU(3)_\\ell have been proposed in the context of the quartification\ngauge group SU(3)^4.

The relevant\nHamiltonian perturbation, describing the interaction of the meson with the foam\nmedium, consists of off-diagonal stochastic metric fluctuations, connecting\ndistinct mass eigenstates (or the appropriate generalisation thereof in the\ncase of K-mesons), and it is proportional to the relevant momentum transfer\n(along the direction of motion of the meson pair).

Therefore, we predict vanishing\nnuclear shadowing at very low $x$ provided that $Q^2$ is high and fixed.
