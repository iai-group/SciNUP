Here, inspired by recent\nnumerical work, we initiate analytic calculations of the Casimir-Polder\ninteraction between an atom with anisotropic polarizability and a plate with an\naperture. In particular, for a semi-infinite plate, and, more generally, for a\nwedge, the problem is exactly solvable, and for sufficiently large anisotropy,\nCasimir-Polder repulsion is indeed possible, in agreement with the previous\nnumerical studies. In order to achieve repulsion, what is needed is a\nsufficiently sharp edge (not so very sharp, in fact) so that the directions of\npolarizability of the conductor and the atom are roughly normal to each other.\nThe machinery for carrying out the calculation with a finite aperture is\npresented. As a motivation for the quantum calculation, we carry out the\ncorresponding classical analysis for the force between a dipole and a metallic\nsheet with a circular aperture, when the dipole is on the symmetry axis and\noriented in the same direction. \n\n"}

In the bipartite case, Nielsen\nmajorization theorem gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for this\nprocess of entanglement transformation to be possible. In the multipartite\ncase, such a deterministic local transformation is possible only if both the\nstates in the same stochastic LOCC (SLOCC) class. Here we generalize Nielsen\nmajorization theorem to the multipartite case, and find necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of a local separable transformation\nbetween two multipartite states in the same SLOCC class.

For finite-dimensional\nrepresentations of A(x) and A(x,s), where A(x,s) is a truncation of order s of\nA(x) in the sense of Pegg-Barnett, a connection is established with k-fermionic\nalgebras (or quon algebras).

By using dimension arguments, we show that there exist\nseparable states which are not convex combinations of d or less pure product\nstates. For instance, such states exist in bipartite M x N systems when\n(M-1)(N-1)>1. This solves an open problem proposed in [J. Mod. Opt. 47 (2000),\n377-385]. We prove that there exist a separable state rho and a pure product\nstate, whose mixture has smaller length than that of rho. We show that any real\nrho in S, which is invariant under all partial transpose operations, is a\nconvex sum of real pure product states. In the case of the 2 x N system, the\nnumber r of product states can be taken to be r=rank(rho).

Numerical iteration suggests that under rescaling the\nsystem length, $L^{\\prime}=2L$, characteristic times rescale as\n$t^{\\prime}=2^{d_{w}}t$ with the exact walk exponent\n$d_{w}=\\log_{2}\\sqrt{5}=1.1609\\ldots$.

A special\nemphasis is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative\ntransformations. In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a\nnon-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative\ntransformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the inversion\nof the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then\nsummarize and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress\nremaining difficulties and open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel\nexamples to illustrate general principles while keeping mathematics as simple\nas possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between the\nequal-threshold and different-threshold problems.

Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits,\nthe relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration\nspace can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for\ncontinuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum\ncircuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are\ncontinuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These\ntypes of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that\nserve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the\nphase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate\nin the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space\nand to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two\ncopies of the configuration space.

These ONFs offer tight optical mode confinement (less than\nthe wavelength of light) and diffraction-free propagation. The small cross\nsection of the transverse field allows probing of linear and non-linear\nspectroscopic features of atoms with exquisitely low power. The cooperativity\n-- the figure of merit in many quantum optics and quantum information systems\n-- tends to be large even for a single atom in the mode of an ONF, as it is\nproportional to the ratio of the atomic cross section to the electromagnetic\nmode cross section.

The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability represents\noperators in quantum optics. The OTOC has been shown to equal a moment of a\nsummed quasiprobability. That quasiprobability, we argue, is an extension of\nthe KD distribution. We explore the quasiprobability's structure from\nexperimental, numerical, and theoretical perspectives. First, we simplify and\nanalyze the weak-measurement and interference protocols for measuring the OTOC\nand its quasiprobability. We decrease, exponentially in system size, the number\nof trials required to infer the OTOC from weak measurements. We also construct\na circuit for implementing the weak-measurement scheme. Next, we calculate the\nquasiprobability (after coarse-graining) numerically and analytically: We\nsimulate a transverse-field Ising model first. Then, we calculate the\nquasiprobability averaged over random circuits, which model chaotic dynamics.\nThe quasiprobability, we find, distinguishes chaotic from integrable regimes.\nWe observe nonclassical behaviors: The quasiprobability typically has negative\ncomponents. It becomes nonreal in some regimes. The onset of scrambling breaks\na symmetry that bifurcates the quasiprobability, as in classical-chaos\npitchforks. Finally, we present mathematical properties. The quasiprobability\nobeys a Bayes-type theorem, for example, that exponentially decreases the\nmemory required to calculate weak values, in certain cases.

Abstract: Recently, quantum Fourier transform interferometers have been demonstrated to\nallow a quantum metrological enhancement in phase sensitivity for a small\nnumber n of identical input single photons [1-3]. However, multiphoton\ndistinguishability at the detectors can play an important role from an\nexperimental point of view [4]. This raises a fundamental question: How is the\nphase sensitivity affected when the photons are completely distinguishable at\nthe detectors and therefore do not interfere? In other words, which role does\nmultiphoton interference play in these schemes? Here, we show that for small\nphase values the phase sensitivity achievable in the proposed schemes with\nindistinguishable photons is enhanced only by a constant factor with respect to\nthe case of completely distinguishable photons at the detectors. Interestingly,\nthis enhancement arises from the interference of only a polynomial number (in\nn) of the total n! multiphoton path amplitudes in the n-port interferometer.\nThese results are independent of the number n of single photons and of the\nphase weight factors employed at each interferometer channel. \n\n"}

One common assumption is that the\npolynomial hierarchy (PH) does not collapse, a stronger version of the\nstatement that P $\\neq$ NP, which leads to the conclusion that any classical\nsimulation of certain families of quantum circuits requires time scaling worse\nthan any polynomial in the size of the circuits. However, the asymptotic nature\nof this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these\nquantum circuits must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on\nmodern classical supercomputers. We refine these quantum computational\nsupremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing fine-grained\nversions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a\nconstant $a$ and asserts that certain specific computational problems with\ninput size $n$ require $2^{an}$ time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic\nalgorithm.

Such a construction, called the minimally bosonized SUSYQM, appeared\nin the context of integrable systems and dynamical symmetries. We show that the\nminimally bosonized SUSYQM can be obtained from Witten's SUSYQM by applying to\nit a nonlocal unitary transformation with a subsequent reduction to one of the\neigenspaces of the total reflection operator. The transformation depends on the\nparity operator, and the deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection,\nintimately related to parabosons and parafermions, emerges here in a natural\nway. It is shown that the minimally bosonized SUSYQM can also be understood as\nsupersymmetric two-fermion system. With this interpretation, the bosonization\nconstruction is generalized to the case of N=1 supersymmetry in 2 dimensions.\nThe same special unitary transformation diagonalises the Hamiltonian operator\nof the 2D massive free Dirac theory. The resulting Hamiltonian is not a square\nroot like in the Foldy-Wouthuysen case, but is linear in spatial derivative.\nSubsequent reduction to `up' or `down' field component gives rise to a linear\ndifferential equation with reflection whose `square' is the massive\nKlein-Gordon equation. In the massless limit this becomes the self-dual Weyl\nequation. The linear differential equation with reflection admits\ngeneralizations to higher dimensions and can be consistently coupled to gauge\nfields.

This leads to\nstatistically unique random variables for expressing observed information:\nComplex probability amplitudes. Predictions are also just random variables\ncomputed from observed data, and must become more accurate with more\nobservations as input.

The external conditions of a probabilistic experiment can themselves\nbe monitored at the most detailed level, resulting in observation of coicidence\nprobabilities. The invariants of any multi-coincidence experiment are the same\nas those of a one-event experiment with the same number of possible outcomes.\nAn observable probability turns out to be controllable by two independent\nexperimental conditions, naturally parametrized as a direction in a\n3-dimensional space. In summary, the probabilistic paradigm itself defines a\nunique method of forming concepts and making predictions.

The sufficient-necessary conditions for\nstable oscillations depend on the physical parameters and initial conditions\nsensitively. The first-order necessary condition indicates that the Melnikov\nfunction is equal to zero, so the stable oscillations are Melnikov chaotic. For\nthe ordinary parameters and initial conditions, the chaotic dynamics is\nsimulated with numerical calculation. If the damping is absent, with the\nincreasing of the trap asymmetry, the regular oscillations become chaotic\ngradually, the corresponding stroboscopic Poincare sections (SPS) vary from a\nsingle island to more islands, and then the chaotic sea.

In conventional theories of the QZE and AZE, effects of\nmeasurements are simply described by the projection postulate, assuming that\neach measurement is an instantaneous and ideal one. However, real measurements\nare not instantaneous and ideal. For the QZE and AZE by such general\nmeasurements, interesting and surprising features have recently been revealed,\nwhich we review in this article. The results are based on the quantum\nmeasurement theory, which is also reviewed briefly. As a typical model, we\nconsider a continuous measurement of the decay of an excited atom by a\nphotodetector that detects a photon emitted from the atom upon decay. This\nmeasurement is an indirect negative-result one, for which the curiosity of the\nQZE and AZE is emphasized.

However, drastic differences emerge in\ngeneral cases where the detector responds only to limited photon modes.

Theoretical Background Abstract: The paper deals with the projective line over the finite factor ring\n$R\\_{\\clubsuit} \\equiv$ GF(2)[$x$]/$<x^{3} - x>$. The line is endowed with 18\npoints, spanning the neighbourhoods of three pairwise distant points. As\n$R\\_{\\clubsuit}$ is not a local ring, the neighbour (or parallel) relation is\nnot an equivalence relation so that the sets of neighbour points to two distant\npoints overlap. There are nine neighbour points to any point of the line,\nforming three disjoint families under the reduction modulo either of two\nmaximal ideals of the ring. Two of the families contain four points each and\nthey swap their roles when switching from one ideal to the other; the points of\nthe one family merge with (the image of) the point in question, while the\npoints of the other family go in pairs into the remaining two points of the\nassociated ordinary projective line of order two.

Abstract: Entanglement bits or ``ebits'' have been proposed as a quantitative measure\nof a fundamental resource in quantum information processing. For such an\ninterpretation to be valid, it is important to show that the same number of\nebits in different forms or concentrations are inter-convertible in the\nasymptotic limit. Here we draw attention to a very important but hitherto\nunnoticed aspect of entanglement manipulation --- the classical communication\ncost. We construct an explicit procedure which demonstrates that for bi-partite\npure states, in the asymptotic limit, entanglement can be concentrated or\ndiluted with vanishing classical communication cost. Entanglement of bi-partite\npure states is thus established as a truly inter-convertible resource. \n\n"}

Firstly, we express the normalized\nvolume elements of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric for n = 2 and 3,\nobtaining thereby \"Bures prior probability distributions\" over the two- and\nthree-state systems. Then, as an essential first step in extending these\nresults to n > 3, we determine that the \"Hall normalization constant\" (C_{n})\nfor the marginal Bures prior probability distribution over the\n(n-1)-dimensional simplex of the n eigenvalues of the n x n density matrices\nis, for n = 4, equal to 71680/pi^2. Since we also find that C_{3} = 35/pi, it\nfollows that C_{4} is simply equal to 2^{11} C_{3}/pi. (C_{2} itself is known\nto equal 2/pi.) The constant C_{5} is also found. It too is associated with a\nremarkably simple decompositon, involving the product of the eight consecutive\nprime numbers from 2 to 23.\n  We also preliminarily investigate several cases, n > 5, with the use of\nquasi-Monte Carlo integration. We hope that the various analyses reported will\nprove useful in deriving a general formula (which evidence suggests will\ninvolve the Bernoulli numbers) for the Hall normalization constant for\narbitrary n. This would have diverse applications, including quantum inference\nand universal quantum coding. \n\n"}

We compare two schemes of continuous measurement: continuous\nmeasurement with constant fuzziness and with fuzziness changing in the course\nof the measurement. Because the sensitivity of the Rabi atom to the influence\nof the measurement depends on the state of the atom, it is possible to optimize\nthe continuous fuzzy measurement by varying its fuzziness. \n\n"}
