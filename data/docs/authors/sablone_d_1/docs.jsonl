Herein we describe the potential employment of large detectors\n(>1 kiloton) for studies of higher energy neutrinos interactions, from the\ncosmic rays and as a long baseline neutrino detector. Generally when people\nhave considered large new instruments such as Hanohano and LENA, they have\nabandoned the possibility of doing useful measurements with higher energy\nneutrino interactions since these produce enough light to illuminate every\nphotomultiplier tube, and the scintillation light is isotropic. Here we take\ninto account Fermat's principle, which tells us that indeed the first light to\nreach the PMTs will be on or near the lightcone, the \"Fermat surface\", and that\ndirectional track information is available.

{"id": "0904.1464", "contents": "Title: The Possible Impact of GRB Detector Thresholds on Cosmological Standard\n  Candles Abstract: GRB satellites are relatively inefficient detectors of dim hard bursts\nbecause they trigger on photon counts, which are number-biased against hard\nphotons. Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity\nnear the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected\nover a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or skew an apparent\ncorrelation where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright. Although\nsuch correlations may be obfuscated by a middle step where GRBs need to be\nbright enough to have their actual redshifts determined, it is found that the\nbias is generally pervasive. This result is derived here through simulations\nconvolving a wide variety of possible GRB brightnesses and spectra with the\nBATSE Large Area Detectors (LAD) detection thresholds. The presented analyses\nindicate that the rest-frame $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectrum peak energy of\nlong-duration GRBs, $\\epi$, is not a good cosmological standard candle without\nsignificant corrections for selection effects. Therefore, the appearance of\n$\\epi$ in seeming correlations such as the Amati ($E_{iso}-\\epi$), Ghirlanda\n($E_{\\gamma}-\\epi$), and $L_{iso}-\\epi$ relations is statistically real but\nstrongly influenced by so far uncalibrated GRB detector thresholds. \n\n"}

White phase noise results from adding white noise to the RF\nspectrum around the carrier. For a given amount of RF noise added, noise is\nproportional to the inverse of the carrier power. By contrast, the 1/f\ncoefficient is a constant parameter of the amplifier, in a wide range of\ncarrier power. This fact has amazing consequences on different amplifier\ntopologies. Connecting m equal amplifiers in parallel, flicker is 1/m times\nthat of one device. Cascading m equal amplifiers, flicker is m times that of\none amplifier. Recirculating the signal in an amplifier so that the gain\nincreases by a power of m (a factor of m in dB) due to positive feedback\n(regeneration), which for integer m is similar to the case of m amplifiers, we\nfind that flicker is m^2 times that of the amplifier alone.\n  Starting from the fact that near-dc flicker exists in all electronic devices,\nalthough generally not accessible from outside, the simplest model for the 1/f\nphase noise is that the near-dc 1/f noise phase-modulates the carrier through\nsome parametric effect in the semiconductor. This model predicts the behavior\nof the (simple) amplifier and of the different amplifier topologies. Numerous\nmeasurements on amplifiers from different technologies and frequencies (HF to\nmicrowaves), also including some obsolete amplifiers, validate the theory. \n\n"}

A true innovation in detector instrumentation concepts\ncame in 1968, with the development of a fully parallel readout for a large\narray of sensing elements - the Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC), which\nearned Georges Charpak a Nobel prize in physics in 1992. Since that time\nradiation detection and imaging with fast gaseous detectors, capable of\neconomically covering large detection volume with low mass budget, have been\nplaying an important role in many fields of physics. Advances in\nphoto-lithography and micro-processing techniques in the chip industry during\nthe past decade triggered a major transition in the field of gas detectors from\nwire structures to Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) concepts, revolutionizing\ncell size limitations for many gas detector applications. The high radiation\nresistance and excellent spatial and time resolution make them an invaluable\ntool to confront future detector challenges at the next generation of\ncolliders.

Very low intrinsic radiogenic\ncontamination of all detector components needs to be accompanied by the\nefficient identification of muons and of muon-induced backgrounds. Muons\nproduce unstable nuclei by spallation processes along their trajectory through\nthe detector whose decays can mimic the expected signals; for isotopes with\nhalf-lives longer than a few seconds, the dead time induced by a muon-related\nveto becomes unacceptably long, unless its application can be restricted to a\nsub-volume along the muon track.

In addition, it needs\nto be operational as soon as possible. The design described here optimizes\nenergy resolution thanks to the use of proportional electroluminescent\namplification (EL); it is compact, as the Xe gas is under high pressure; and it\nallows the measurement of the topological signature of the event to further\nreduce the background contamination. The SOFT design uses different sensors for\ntracking and calorimetry. We propose the use of SiPMs (MPPCs) coated with a\nsuitable wavelength shifter for the tracking, and the use of radiopure\nphotomultipliers for the measurement of the energy and the primary\nscintillation needed to estimate the t0. This design provides the best possible\nenergy resolution compared with other NEXT designs based on avalanche gain\ndevices. The baseline design is an Asymmetric Neutrino Gas EL apparatus\n(ANGEL), which was already outlined in the NEXT LOI. ANGEL is conceived to be\neasy to fabricate. It requires very little R&D and most of the proposed\nsolutions have already been tested in the NEXT-1 prototypes. Therefore, the\ndetector can be ready by 2013.

Recently, liquid-xenon scintillation light has been observed from\nelectronic recoils down to 2.1 keV, but without applied electric fields that\nare used in most xenon dark matter searches. Applied electric fields can reduce\nthe scintillation yield by hindering the electron-ion recombination process\nthat produces most of the scintillation photons. We present new results of\nliquid xenon's scintillation emission in response to electronic recoils as low\nas 1.5 keV, with and without an applied electric field. At zero field, a\nreduced scintillation output per unit deposited energy is observed below 10\nkeV, dropping to nearly 40% of its value at higher energies.

Several common\nradioisotopes in detector construction materials are found in long decay\nchains, notably those headed by 238U, 235U, and 232Th. Gamma radioassay using\nGe detectors identifies decay rates of a few of the radioisotopes in each\nchain, and typically assumes that the chain is in secular equilibrium. If the\nchains are out of equilibrium, detector background rates can be elevated\nsignificantly above expectation. In this work we quantify the increase in\nneutron and gamma production rates from an excess of various sub-chains of the\n238U decay chain. We find that the 226Ra sub-chain generates x10 higher neutron\nflux per decay than the 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain, in materials\nwith high (alpha,n) neutron yields. Typical gamma screening results limit\npotential 238U early sub-chain activity to x20-60 higher than 226Ra sub-chain\nactivity. Monte Carlo simulation is used to quantify the contribution of the\nsub-chains of 238U to low-energy nuclear recoil (NR) and electron recoil (ER)\nbackgrounds in simplified one tonne liquid Ar and liquid Xe detectors.

All detectors are made from material with enriched ^{76}Ge\nfraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse\nshape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected.

The proposal is to install a LHCf-like\ncalorimeter in the ZDC installation slot at one of the RHIC interaction points.\nBy installing a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter at this location we\nmeasure the spectra of photons, neutrons and pi0 at pseudo rapidity eta above\n6.\n  The new measurements at 500 GeV p-p collisions contribute to improve the\nhadronic interaction models used in the cosmic-ray air shower simulations.\nUsing a similar kinematic coverage at RHIC to that of the measurements at LHC,\nwe can test the Feynman scaling with a wide energy range and make the\nextrapolation of models into cosmic-ray energy more reliable. Combination of a\nhigh position resolution of the LHCf detector and a high energy resolution of\nthe ZDC makes it possible to determine pT of forward neutrons with the ever\nbest resolution. This enables us to study the forward neutron spin asymmetry\ndiscovered at RHIC in more detail.\n  Another new experiment expected at RHIC is world-first light-ion collisions.\nCosmic-ray interaction models have been so far tested with accelerator data,\nbut colliders have provided only p-p and heavy-ion collisions. To simulate the\ninteraction between cosmic-ray particles and atmosphere, collision of light\nions like nitrogen is a ultimate goal for the cosmic-ray physics. We propose\n200 GeV p-N collisions together with 200 GeV p-p collisions to study the\nnuclear effects in the forward particle production.\n  The experiment can be performed by using the existing LHCf detector.\nConsidering the geometry and response of one of the LHCf detectors, we propose\nsome short dedicated operations. Ideal beam conditions are summarized in this\npaper. Our basic idea is to bring one of the LHCf detectors to RHIC and then\noperate from 2016 season at RHIC. \n\n"}

The design presented here is optimized for a\nDavies-Cotton telescope with primary mirror of about 4 meters of diameter and\nfocal length of 5.6 m. The described concentrators are part of an innovative\ncamera made up of silicon-photomultipliers sensors, although a similar approach\ncan be used for other sizes of single-mirror telescopes with different camera\nsensors, including photomultipliers. The challenge of our approach is to\nachieve a cost-effective design suitable for standard industrial productions of\nboth the plastic concentrator substrate and the reflective coating. At the same\ntime we maximize the optical performance. In this paper we also describe the\noptical set-up to measure the absolute collection efficiency of the light\nguides and demonstrate our good understanding of the measured data using a\nprofessional light tracing simulation. \n\n"}

{"id": "1408.5536", "contents": "Title: Three-Dimensional Triplet Tracking for LHC and Future High Rate\n  Experiments Abstract: The hit combinatorial problem is a main challenge for track reconstruction\nand triggering at high rate experiments. At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points. With the advent of relatively cheap and\nindustrially available CMOS-sensors the construction of highly granular full\nscale pixel tracking detectors seems to be possible also for experiments at LHC\nor future high energy (hadron) colliders. In this paper tracking performance\nstudies for full-scale pixel detectors, including their optimisation for\n3D-triplet tracking, are presented.

The\ntrigger will thus be able to suppress a large fraction of the dominating\nbackground from events outside of the interaction region. The trigger uses the\ndrift time information of the hits from the Central Drift Chamber (CDC) of\nBelle II within narrow cones in polar and azimuthal angle as well as in\ntransverse momentum (sectors), and estimates the z-vertex without explicit\ntrack reconstruction. The preprocessing for the track trigger is based on the\ntrack information provided by the standard CDC trigger. It takes input from the\n2D ($r - \\varphi$) track finder, adds information from the stereo wires of the\nCDC, and finds the appropriate sectors in the CDC for each track in a given\nevent. Within each sector, the z-vertex of the associated track is estimated by\na specialized neural network, with a continuous output corresponding to the\nscaled z-vertex.

In the chameleon dark energy theory, this\ncoupling induces a screening mechanism such that the field amplitude is nonzero\nin empty space but is greatly suppressed in regions of terrestrial matter\ndensity. However measurements performed under appropriate vacuum conditions can\nenable the chameleon field to appear in the apparatus, where it can be\nsubjected to laboratory experiments. Here we report the most stringent upper\nbound on the free neutron-chameleon coupling in the strongly-coupled limit of\nthe chameleon theory using neutron interferometric techniques.

Due to the reduction of the spatial hit\nuncertainties, multiple Coulomb scattering in the detector layers becomes the\ndominant source for tracking uncertainties. In this case long distance effects\ncan be ignored for the momentum measurement, and the track fit can consequently\nbe formulated as a sum of independent fits to hit triplets. In this paper we\npresent an analytical solution for a three-dimensional triplet(s) fit in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field based on a multiple scattering model. Track fitting\nof hit triplets is performed using a linearization ansatz. The momentum\nresolution is discussed for a typical spectrometer setup. Furthermore the track\nfit is compared with other track fits for two different pixel detector\ngeometries, namely the Mu3e experiment at PSI and a typical high-energy\ncollider experiment. For a large momentum range the triplets fit provides a\nsignificantly better performance than a single helix fit.

This background becomes dominant in a kiloton-scale\nliquid-scintillator detector deep underground and is usually considered as\nirreducible due to an overlap in deposited energy with the signal.

The gas inside\nthe TPCs can be used as an active target to study the neutrino interactions in\ngreat detail. The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy\nthresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.\nprotons with kinetic energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different\nnuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low\nmomentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a\npowerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas\nmixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since\nthe beginning of the experiment in 2010. Due to the low total mass of the gas,\nneutrino argon interactions happen only rarely, compared to the surrounding\nscintillator-based detectors.

It can take several hours\nfor a detector to stabilize enough to return to its nominal state for\nscientific observations. The down time can be reduced if advance warning of\nimpending shaking is received and the impact is suppressed in the isolation\nsystem with the goal of maintaining stable operation even at the expense of\nincreased instrumental noise. Here we describe an early warning system for\nmodern gravitational-wave observatories. The system relies on near real-time\nearthquake alerts provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Hypocenter and\nmagnitude information is generally available in 5 to 20 minutes of a\nsignificant earthquake depending on its magnitude and location. The alerts are\nused to estimate arrival times and ground velocities at the gravitational-wave\ndetectors. In general, 90\\% of the predictions for ground-motion amplitude are\nwithin a factor of 5 of measured values. The error in both arrival time and\nground-motion prediction introduced by using preliminary, rather than final,\nhypocenter and magnitude information is minimal. By using a machine learning\nalgorithm, we develop a prediction model that calculates the probability that a\ngiven earthquake will prevent a detector from taking data. Our initial results\nindicate that by using detector control configuration changes, we could prevent\ninterruption of operation from 40-100 earthquake events in a 6-month\ntime-period. \n\n"}

We see no evidence for\nbubble nucleation by gamma rays at any of the thresholds studied, setting a 90%\nC.L. upper limit of $6.3\\times10^{-7}$ bubbles per gamma interaction at a\n4.2-keV thermodynamic threshold. This indicates stronger gamma discrimination\nthan in CF$_3$I bubble chambers, supporting the hypothesis that scintillation\nproduction suppresses bubble nucleation by electron recoils while nuclear\nrecoils nucleate bubbles as usual. These measurements establish the\nnoble-liquid bubble chamber as a promising new technology for the detection of\nweakly interacting massive particle dark matter and coherent elastic\nneutrino-nucleus scattering. \n\n"}

It presents numerous examples of the use of\nsimulation, from detector design and optimization, through software and\ncomputing development and testing, to cases where the use of simulation samples\nmade a difference in the precision of the physics results and publication\nturnaround, from data-taking to submission. It also presents estimates of the\ncost and economic impact of simulation in the CMS experiment.\n  Future experiments will collect orders of magnitude more data with\nincreasingly complex detectors, taxing heavily the performance of simulation\nand reconstruction software. Consequently, exploring solutions to speed up\nsimulation and reconstruction software to satisfy the growing demand of\ncomputing resources in a time of flat budgets is a matter that deserves\nimmediate attention.

Radioactive isotopes are\nproduced via cosmogenic activation in detectors and other materials and those\nisotopes constitute a background source which has to be under control. In\nparticular, tritium is specially relevant due to its decay properties (very low\nendpoint energy and long half-life) when induced in the detector medium, and\nbecause it can be generated in any material as a spallation product.\nQuantification of cosmogenic production of tritium is not straightforward,\nneither experimentally nor by calculations. In this work, a method for the\ncalculation of production rates at sea level has been developed and applied to\nsome of the materials typically used as targets in dark matter detectors\n(germanium, sodium iodide, argon and neon); it is based on a selected\ndescription of tritium production cross sections over the entire energy range\nof cosmic nucleons.

We propose a\nnew experiment, ForwArd Search ExpeRiment, or FASER, which would be placed\ndownstream of the ATLAS or CMS interaction point (IP) in the very forward\nregion and operated concurrently there. Two representative on-axis locations\nare studied: a far location, $400~\\text{m}$ from the IP and just off the beam\ntunnel, and a near location, just $150~\\text{m}$ from the IP and right behind\nthe TAN neutral particle absorber. For each location, we examine leading\nneutrino- and beam-induced backgrounds.

However Geant4 based\ndetector simulation of such a large detector is time-consuming and challenging.\nIt is necessary to take full advantages of parallel computing to speedup\nsimulation. Starting from version 10, Geant4 supports event-level parallelism.\nEven though based on pthread, it could be extended with other libraries such as\nIntel TBB. Therefore it is possible to parallelize JUNO simulation framework\nvia integrating Geant4 and SNiPER.\n  In this paper, our progress in developing parallelized simulation software\nare presented. The SNiPER framework can run in sequential mode, Intel TBB mode\nor other modes. The SNiPER task component is in charge of event loop, which is\nlike a simplified application manager. Two types of tasks are introduced in the\nsimulation framework, one is global task and another is worker task. The global\ntask will run only once to initialize detector geometry and physics processes.\nThe worker tasks will be spawned after global task is done. In each worker\ntask, a Geant4 run manager is invoked to do the real simulation. Therefore the\nsimulation framework and the underlying TBB have been decoupled.

An important accelerator were first\nindications for a modulating signal rate in the DAMA/NaI experiment reported in\n1997. Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\sigma$ confidence.\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\nfundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search\ncould confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in\nclear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter\nhalo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a\ndependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will\nconvincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as\ntarget. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel\ndetection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter\nreading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages\narise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear\nrecoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. These key\nbenefits will allow COSINUS to clarify a possible nuclear recoil origin of the\nDAMA signal with comparatively little exposure of O(100kg days) and, thereby,\nanswer a long-standing question of particle physics. Today COSINUS is in R&D\nphase; in this contribution we show results from the 2nd prototype, albeit the\nfirst one of the final foreseen detector design. The key finding of this\nmeasurement is that pure, undoped NaI is a truly excellent scintillator at low\ntemperatures: We measure 13.1% of the total deposited energy in the NaI crystal\nin the form of scintillation light (in the light detector). \n\n"}

Abstract: A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle.\nIntroduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally\nhigh-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities.\nArgon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the\npurge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses\nthrough materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact\nwith the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation. \n\n"}

This allows the interpretation of the axion induced background bound\ncharge, polarization current and background polarization and magnetization\nsatisfying the charge-current continuity equation. This representation is of\nsimilar form to photon sector odd-parity Lorentz invariance violating\nbackground fields. We show that when a DC B-field is applied an oscillating\nbackground polarization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass.\nIn contrast, when DC E-field is applied, an oscillating background\nmagnetization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. We show\nthat these terms are equivalent to impressed source terms, analogous to the way\nthat voltage and current sources are impressed into Maxwell's equations in\ncircuit and antenna theory. The impressed source terms represent the conversion\nof external energy into electromagnetic energy, and in the case of axion\nmodified electrodynamics this is due to the inverse Primakoff effect converting\nenergy from axions into photons. The axion induced oscillating polarization\nunder a DC magnetic field is analogous to a permanent polarised electret\noscillating at the axion Compton frequency, which sources an electromotive\nforce from an effective impressed magnetic current source. In particular, it is\nshown that the impressed electrical DC current that drives the solenoidal\nmagnetic DC field of an electromagnet, induces an impressed magnetic current\nparallel to the DC electrical current, oscillating at the Compton frequency of\nthe axion.

Here we\ninvestigate the precision obtainable for the $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow Z h\n\\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^- X$ inclusive cross section and the Higgs boson mass\nusing the di-muon recoil method, considering a detector that has only an inner\ntracking system within a solenoidal magnetic field, surrounded by many nuclear\ninteraction lengths of absorbing material, and an outer muon identification\nsystem. We find that the sensitivity achievable in these measurements with such\na tracking detector is only marginally reduced compared to that expected for a\ngeneral purpose detector with additional electromagnetic and hadronic\ncalorimeter systems. The difference results mainly from multi-photon\nbackgrounds that are not as easily rejected with tracking detectors. We also\ncomment on the prospects for an analogous measurement of the inclusive cross\nsection $\\sigma( e^+ e^- \\to Z h \\to e^+ e^- X)$. Finally, we study searches\nfor light scalars utilizing the di-muon recoil method, estimating the projected\nreach with a tracking and general purpose detector. \n\n"}

Absolute distance was determined by counting the\ninterference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency. A\nhigh-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer was used to determine frequency changes\nduring scanning. Two multiple-distance-measurement analysis techniques were\ndeveloped to improve distance precision and to extract the amplitude and\nfrequency of vibrations. Under laboratory conditions, measurement precision of\nabout 50 nm was achieved for absolute distances ranging from 0.1 meters to 0.7\nmeters by using the first multiple-distance-measurement technique. The second\nanalysis technique has the capability to measure vibration frequencies ranging\nfrom 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz with amplitude as small as a few nanometers, without a\npriori knowledge. A possible optical alignment system for a silicon tracker is\nalso presented. \n\n"}
