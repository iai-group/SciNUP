The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter.

We derive analytic formulas for its endpoint MT2{max}(n,p,c) as a\nfunction of the unknown test mass Mc of the final particle in the subchain and\nthe transverse momentum pT due to radiation from the initial state. We show\nthat the endpoint functions MT2{max}(n,p,c)(Mc,pT) may exhibit three different\ntypes of kinks and discuss the origin of each type. We prove that the subsystem\nMT2(n,p,c) variables by themselves already yield a sufficient number of\nmeasurements for a complete determination of the mass spectrum (including the\noverall mass scale). As an illustration, we consider the simple case of a decay\nchain with up to three heavy particles, X2 -> X1 -> X0, which is rather\nproblematic for all other mass measurement methods. We propose three different\nMT2-based methods, each of which allows a complete determination of the masses\nof particles X0, X1 and X2.

Two main schemes have been\nproposed for such a 'first' detection: measurements of ellipticity acquired by\na linearly polarized beam of light passing through a magnetic field and direct\nlight-light scattering. The study of the propagation of light through an\nexternal field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence\nof axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature\nwould cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the\npresence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of\nthe light propagating. The major achievement of reaching the project\nsensitivities in gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO an VIRGO has\nopened the possibility of using such instruments for the detection of QED\ncorrections in electrodynamics and for probing new physics at very low\nenergies. In this paper we discuss the difference between direct birefringence\nmeasurements and index of refraction measurements. We propose an almost\nparasitic implementation of an external magnetic field along the arms of the\nVIRGO interferometer and discuss the advantage of this choice in comparison to\na previously proposed configuration based on shorter prototype interferometers\nwhich we believe is inadequate.

The\nreactions under the study will be identified by a magnetless spectrometer based\non wire drift chambers with a hexagonal structure. Because the background\nsuppression in this experiment depends on the angular resolution, the amount of\nmatter in the chambers and setup is minimized to reduce multiple scattering.\nThe differential cross section of the elastic pi-p-scattering on a liquid\nhydrogen target in the region of the diffractive minimum will be measured with\nstatistical accuracy 0.5% in 1 MeV steps in terms of the invariant mass. For\nKLambda-production the total cross section will be measured with 1% statistical\naccuracy in the same steps.

However, the\nbroad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles\ncould only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII\nprogram concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c\nflourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the\nTevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the\ndeconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,\nprecision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for\ncontinuing investigations. The plethora of newly-found quarkonium-like states\nunleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such\nas quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks.

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other.

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a\ncoalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the\ngreater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of\npartons from the highly flowing midrapidity region.

Due to the rich spin structure of the final state, the decay mode B to\nD* tau nu offers a number of tests of such possible standard model deviations.\nWe investigate the most general set of lowest dimensional effective operators\nleading to helicity suppressed modifications of b to c (semi)leptonic\ntransitions. We explore such contributions to the B to D* tau nu decay\namplitudes by determining the differential decay rate, longitudinal D*\npolarization fraction, D* - tau opening angle asymmetry and the tau helicity\nasymmetry. We identify the size of possible new physics contributions\nconstrained by the present B to D(*) tau nu rate measurements and find\nsignificant modifications are still possible in all of them. In particular, the\nopening angle asymmetry can be shifted by almost 30%, relative to the standard\nmodel prediction, while the tau helicity asymmetry can still deviate by as much\nas 80%. \n\n"}

We consider several natural extensions of the SM, such as\ntwo-Higgs-doublet (2HDM), 2HDM and light scalar, and mirror dark matter models,\nthose main feature is that they allow to avoid the helicity suppression factor\nand lead to an enhanced $Br(K_L \\to invisible)$. For the decay $K_L \\to \\nu\n\\bar{\\nu}$ the smallness of the neutrino mass in the considered 2HDM model is\nexplained by the smallness of the second Higgs doublet vacuum expectation\nvalue. The small nonzero value of the second Higgs isodoublet can arise as a\nconsequence of nonzero quark condensate. We show that taking into account the\nmost stringent constraints from the $K \\to \\pi +invisible$ decay, this process\ncould be in the region of $Br(K_L \\to invisible) \\simeq 10^{-8}-10^{-6}$, which\nis experimentally accessible.

The underlying event is characterised through\nmeasurements of the average value of the sum of the transverse energy at large\npseudorapidity downstream of one of the protons, which are reported here as a\nfunction of hard-scattering kinematic variables. The hard scattering is\ncharacterised by the average transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the two\nhighest transverse momentum jets in the event.

However, the mixed-cumulant ratios\n$R_{11}^{BS}$ and $R_{31}^{BS}$ show strong increase at low energy, while the\n$R_{13}^{BS}$ snd $R_{22}^{BS}$ are similar at different energies.

We examine the azimuthal\ncorrelations between the system and one of its particles. We point out that the\nperturbative QCD computation of such azimuthal correlations and asymmetries can\nlead to divergent results at fixed perturbative orders. The fixed-order\ndivergences affect basic (and infrared safe) quantities such as the total cross\nsection at fixed (and arbitrary) values of the azimuthal-correlation angle\n$\\varphi$. Examples of processes with fixed-order divergences are heavy-quark\npair production, associated production of vector bosons and jets, dijet and\ndiboson production. A noticeable exception is the production of high-mass\nlepton pairs through the Drell--Yan mechanism of quark-antiquark annihilation.\nHowever, even in the Drell--Yan process, fixed-order divergences arise in the\ncomputation of QED radiative corrections.

We examine the final-state rescattering effects on the\nhadronic B decay rates and their impact on direct CP violation. The\ncolor-suppressed neutral modes such as $B^0\\to\nD^0\\pi^0,\\pi^0\\pi^0,\\rho^0\\pi^0,K^0\\pi^0$ can be substantially enhanced by\nlong-distance rescattering effects. The direct CP-violating partial rate\nasymmetries in charmless B decays to $\\pi\\pi/\\pi K$ and $\\rho\\pi$ are\nsignificantly affected by final-state rescattering and their signs are\ngenerally different from that predicted by the short-distance approach. For\nexample, direct CP asymmetry in $B^0\\to\\rho^0\\pi^0$ is increased to around 60%\ndue to final state rescattering effects whereas the short-distance picture\ngives about 1%.

Implications for MiniBooNE are\nnoted and an example based on maximal CP violation displays profound\nimplications for the two data sets (muon-neutrino and muon-antineutrino) of\nthat experiment. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0302093", "contents": "Title: A New Limit on Signals of Lorentz Violation in Electrodynamics Abstract: We describe the results of an experiment to test for spacetime anisotropy\nterms that might exist from Lorentz violations. The apparatus consists of a\npair of cylindrical superconducting cavity-stabilized oscillators operating in\nthe TM_{010} mode with one axis east-west and the other vertical. Spatial\nanisotropy is detected by monitoring the beat frequency at the sidereal rate\nand its first harmonic. We see no anisotropy to a part in 10^{13}. This puts a\ncomparable bound on four linear combinations of parameters in the general\nStandard Model extension, and a weaker bound of <4 x 10^{-9} on three others. \n\n"}
