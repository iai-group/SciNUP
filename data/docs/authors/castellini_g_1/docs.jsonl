Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

However, this surprising result\nwas not based on an actual calculation of a halo white dwarf population but was\nderived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population\nproperties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated\n(unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo.

The best\nfitted radius of the cavity is ~0.36 pc on the eastern side and ~0.46 pc on the\nwestern side, and the densities also show asymmetry, of ~0.015 cm$^{-3}$ on the\neast to ~0.21 cm$^{-3}$ on the west. Large scale low density region is also\nfound in another microquasar system, H 1743-322. These results are consistent\nwith previous suggestions that the environment of microquasars should be rather\nvacuous, compared to the normal Galactic environment. A generic scenario for\nmicroquasar jets is proposed, classifying the observed jets into three main\ncategories, with different jet morphologies (and sizes) corresponding to\ndifferent scales of vacuous environments surrounding them. \n\n"}

The moving substructures result in cool regions surrounded by the\nmagnetic field. These will be recognized as magnetized cold fronts in the\nobservational point of view. A relatively ordered magnetic field structure is\ngenerated just behind the moving substructure. Eddy-like field configurations\nare also formed by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. These features are similarly\nseen even in off-center mergers though the detailed structures change slightly.\nThe above-mentioned characteristic magnetic field structures are partly\nrecognized in Faraday rotation measure maps. The higher absolute values of the\nrotation measure are expected when observed along the collision axis, because\nof the elongated density distribution and relatively ordered field structure\nalong the axis. The rotation measure maps on the cosmic microwave background\nradiation, which covers clusters entirely, could be useful probes of not only\nthe magnetic field structures but also the internal dynamics of the\nintracluster medium. \n\n"}

The models where initial masses are\nderived from the luminosity and colour of unresolved multiple systems show that\neven under extreme circumstances (100% binaries or higher order multiples) the\ndifference between the power-law index of the mass function of all stars and\nthe observed mass function is small (~0.1).

GCs\nare therefore expected to host large numbers of MSPs. This is also confirmed\nobservationally. The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the\nambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles\nproduce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)\nprocesses. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR)\nframe-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation\nexpected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in\n47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period\nderivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects\nof pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small\nerrors) of particles leaving the MSPs. These spectra are next used to predict\ncumulative synchrotron and IC spectra expected from 47 Tucanae, which is a\nlower limit, as no reacceleration is assumed. We find that the IC radiation\nfrom 47 Tucanae may be visible for H.E.S.S., depending on the nebular field B\nas well as the number of MSPs N in the GC. Telescopes such as Chandra and\nHubble may find it difficult to test the SR component prediction of diffuse\nradiation if there are many unresolved sources in the field of view. These\nresults may be rescaled for other GCs where less information is available,\nassuming universal GC MSP characteristics. \n\n"}

This evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous optical\nQSOs and luminous X-ray selected AGNs. We also find evidence for an\nepoch-dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quiet\nAGNs. We interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion and\njet activity.

The self-calibration we apply removes a strong instrumental\nsignal from the fluctuations which would otherwise corrupt our results.

Various tests are\nperformed to demonstrate that the resulting power spectra of these fields are\nnot dominated by instrumental or procedural effects. These tests indicate that\nthe large scale (>~30') fluctuations that remain in the deepest fields are not\ndirectly related to the galaxies that are bright enough to be individually\ndetected. We provide the parameterization of these power spectra in terms of\nseparate instrument noise, shot noise, and power law components.

Starting from $\\sim$ 7000 active galaxies\nin SDSS DR7, we assemble a sample of 87 type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [O\nIII]5007, profiles.

Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial\ndimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion\nmodifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring\nof the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the\nouter radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We\nconjecture that torsion produced by spin prevents the formation of\nsingularities from matter composed of quarks and leptons. We expect that the\nCartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces an effective ultraviolet\ncutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS spacetime.

Between directional sweeps, the\nthree-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always\nperformed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.\nHence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation\nequations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel\nparallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI\nfor cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory.

SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of\n~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to\nreach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r\n~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x\n10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN\n1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both\nsupernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission\nprofile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a\npre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is\npowered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar\nmedium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of\nclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the\nprogenitor.

The progenitor wind speed and\nincreased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and\nperhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before\ncore collapse.

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration.

We\nconsider lepton flavor violating interactions mediated by scalar bileptons,\ni.e. heavy scalars with lepton number 2. It is shown that in case of TeV-mass\nbileptons the electron fermi gas is equilibrated with non-electron species\ninside the inner supernova core at a time-scale of order of (1-100) ms. In\nparticular, a scalar triplet which generates neutrino masses through the\nsee-saw type II mechanism is considered.

Abstract: We use multi-scale SPH simulations to follow the inflow of gas from galactic\nscales to <0.1pc, where the gas begins to resemble a traditional Keplerian\naccretion disk. The key ingredients are gas, stars, black holes (BHs),\nself-gravity, star formation, and stellar feedback. We use ~100 simulations to\nsurvey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the\nISM physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic\nnuclei (<~300pc) using galaxy scale simulations, including both major mergers\nand isolated bar-(un)stable disk galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich,\ndisk-dominated systems, a series of gravitational instabilities generates large\naccretion rates of up to 1-10 M_sun/yr onto the BH (at <<0.1pc); sufficient to\nfuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable,\ngiven fixed conditions at ~kpc. At >~10pc, our simulations resemble the 'bars\nwithin bars' model, but the gas exhibits diverse morphologies, including\nspirals, rings, clumps, and bars; their duty cycle is modest, complicating\nattempts to correlate BH accretion with nuclear morphology. At ~1-10pc, the\ngravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no\nlonger present. However, the gas becomes unstable to a standing, eccentric disk\nor a single-armed spiral mode (m=1), driving the gas to sub-pc scales.

The spectral evolution model\nof the Crab Nebula shows that the flux ratio of TeV gamma-rays to X-rays\nincreases with time, which implies that old PWNe are faint at X-rays, but not\nat TeV gamma-rays. The increase of this ratio is primarily because the magnetic\nfield decreases with time and is not because the X-ray emitting particles are\ncooled more rapidly than the TeV gamma-ray emitting particles.

By means of measures of\nchemical abundances now available for the galaxies hosting such events,thought\nto originate from the explosion of very powerful supernovae (Type Ib/c), we\nhave the opportunity to study the nature of these host galaxies. The aim of\nthis paper is to identify the hosts of Long GRBs (LGRBs) observed both at low\nand high redshift to see whether the hosts can be galaxies of the same type\nobserved at different cosmic epochs. We adopt detailed chemical evolution\nmodels for galaxies of different morphological type (ellipticals, spirals,\nirregulars) which follow the time evolution of the abundances of several\nchemical elements (H, He, $\\alpha$-elements, Fe), and compare the results with\nthe observed abundances and abundance ratios in galaxies hosting LGRBs. We find\nthat the abundances and abundance ratios predicted by models devised for\ntypical irregular galaxies can well fit the abundances in the hosts both at\nhigh and low redshift. We also find that the predicted Type Ib/c supernova rate\nfor irregulars is in good agreement with observations. Models for spirals and\nparticularly ellipticals do not fit the high-redshift hosts of LGRBs (DLA\nsystems) nor the low redshift hosts: in particular, ellipticals cannot possibly\nbe the hosts of gamma-ray-bursts at low redshift since they do not show any\nstar formation, and therefore no supernovae Ib/c. We conclude that the observed\nabundance and abundance ratios in LGRBs hosts suggest that these hosts are\nirregular galaxies both at high and low redshift thus showing that the host\ngalaxies belong to in an evolutionary sequence. \n\n"}

Consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from the\nsignal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulses\nmust be studied with care. First, noise has to be determined consistently with\nthe definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum field\nstrength of the radio pulse. Second, the average impact of noise on radio pulse\nmeasurements at individual antennas is studied for LOPES.

The jet breakout is possible even if the Pop\nIII star has a supergiant hydrogen envelope without mass loss, thanks to the\nlong-lived powerful accretion of the envelope itself. While the Pop III GRB is\nestimated to be energetic, E_{gamma,iso} ~ 10^{55} erg, the supergiant envelope\nhides the initial bright phase into the cocoon component, leading to a GRB with\na long duration ~ 1000(1+z) sec and an ordinary isotropic luminosity ~ 10^{52}\nerg s^{-1} (~ 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} at redshift z ~ 20).

For Jupiter we find a model\ncooling age 10% longer than previous work, a modest quantitative difference.\nThis may indicate that the hydrogen equation of state used here overestimates\nthe temperatures in the deep interior of the planet. For Saturn we find a model\ncooling age 20% longer than previous work. However, an additional energy\nsource, such as that due to helium phase separation, is still clearly needed.\nFor Neptune, unlike in work from the 1980s and 1990s, we match the measured\nTeff of the planet with a model that also matches the planet's current gravity\nfield. This is predominantly due to advances in the equation of state of water.\nThis may indicate that the planet possesses no barriers to efficient convection\nin its deep interior. However, for Uranus, our models exacerbate the well-known\nproblem that Uranus is far cooler than calculations predict, which could imply\nstrong barriers to interior convective cooling. \n\n"}

The initial propagation of the shock front into the\ncircumstellar region can be approximated by a self-similar solution that\ndetermines the radiative energy in a shocked shell; the eventual escape of this\nenergy gives the maximum luminosity of the supernova. If the circumstellar\ndensity is described by \\rho=Dr^{-2} out to a radius R_w, where D is a\nconstant, the properties of the shock breakout radiation depend on R_w and\nR_d\\equiv\\kappa Dv_{sh}/c, where \\kappa is the opacity and v_{sh} is the shock\nvelocity. If R_w>R_d, the rise to maximum light begins at ~ R_d/v_{sh}; the\nduration of the rise is also ~ R_d/v_{sh}; the outer parts of the opaque medium\nare extended and at low velocity at the time of peak luminosity; and a dense\nshell forms whose continued interaction with the dense mass loss gives a\ncharacteristic flatter portion of the declining light curve.

Because the discharge rate increased\nas the balloon flew at higher altitude, he concluded in 1912 that the origin\ncould not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize\nin 1936, and his experiment became legendary. At the same time, in 1911,\nPacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made a series of measurements to\ndetermine the variation in the speed of discharge of an electroscope (and thus\nthe intensity of the radiation) while the electroscope was immersed in a box in\na sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay of Livorno (the Italian Navy supported\nthe research). Pacini discovered that the discharge of the oscilloscope was\nsignificantly slower than at the surface.\n  Before his conclusive measurements, Pacini performed a series of experiments\nbetween 1907 and 1910, in particular by comparing radioactivity on ground and\non the sea surface a few kilometers off the coast.

It may operate\nin accretion flows onto thin dark matter filaments of cosmic structure\nformation. The flow compresses the ambient magnetic field to strongly increase\nand align it with the filament. Particles begin the acceleration by the ExB\ndrift with the accretion flow. The energy gain in the drift regime is limited\nby the conservation of the adiabatic invariant p_perp^2/B. Upon approaching the\nfilament, the drift turns into the gyro-motion around the filament so that the\nparticle moves parallel to the azimuthal electric field. In this 'betatron'\nregime the acceleration speeds up to rapidly reach the electrodynamic limit\n$cp_{max}=eBR$ for an accelerator with magnetic field $B$ and the orbit radius\n$R$ (Larmor radius). The periodic orbit becomes unstable and the particle\nslings out of the filament to the region of a weak (uncompressed) magnetic\nfield, which terminates the acceleration.\n  The mechanism requires pre-acceleration that is likely to occur in structure\nformation shocks upstream or nearby the filament accretion flow. Previous\nstudies identify such shocks as efficient proton accelerators to a firm upper\nlimit ~10^19.5 eV placed by the catastrophic photo-pion losses. The present\nmechanism combines explosive energy gain in its final (betatron) phase with\nprompt particle release from the region of strong magnetic field. It is this\ncombination that allows protons to overcome both the photo-pion and the\nsynchrotron-Compton losses and therefore attain energy 10^21 eV.

Abstract: First, we stress that for correct description of highly relativistic fermions\nin a gravitational field it is necessary to have an equation which in the\nlimiting transition to the classical (non-quantum) case corresponds to the\nexact Mathisson-Papapetrou equations. According to these equations the spin in\ngeneral relativity is Fermi-transported, and the parallel transport of spin is\nrealized only in some approximation. The traditional general-relativistic Dirac\nequation (1929) is based on the parallel transported spinors and does not\nensure the correspondent transition. Second, because in the range of very high\nvelocity (close to the speed of light) of a spinning particle relative to the\nSchwarzschild or Kerr sources the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations have the\nsolutions which reveal that the spin-gravity interaction acts as a strong\nantigravity force, we suppose that this fact can be useful for explanation some\nastrophysical phenomena.

In this model the accreting\nmatter subsonically settles down onto the rotating magnetosphere forming an\nextended quasi-static shell. This shell mediates the angular momentum removal\nfrom the rotating neutron star magnetosphere during spin-down episodes by\nlarge-scale convective motions. The accretion rate through the shell is\ndetermined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere. The\nsettling regime of accretion can be realized for moderate accretion rates $\\dot\nM< \\dot M_*\\simeq 4\\times 10^{16}$ g/s. At higher accretion rates a free-fall\ngap above the neutron star magnetosphere appears due to rapid Compton cooling,\nand accretion becomes highly non-stationary. From observations of the\nspin-up/spin-down rates (the angular rotation frequency derivative $\\dot\n\\omega^*$, and $\\partial\\dot\\omega^*/\\partial\\dot M$ near the torque reversal)\nof X-ray pulsars with known orbital periods, it is possible to determine the\nmain dimensionless parameters of the model, as well as to estimate the magnetic\nfield of the neutron star.

To large extent, cooling is\noffset by heating due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) via jets. The cool-core\nclusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some\ncooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is\nlocally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using\nhigh-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of\nmultiphase gas in cluster cores heated by highly-collimated bipolar AGN jets.\nOur key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only\nwhen the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall\ntimescales (t_TI/t_ff) falls below a critical threshold of \\approx 10. When\nthis happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot ICM phase and generates\ninhomogeneous and spatially extended Halpha filaments. These cold gas clumps\nand filaments `rain' down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold\nrotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently,\nthe self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a\nhigher entropy level with t_TI/t_ff > 10. Eventually the core reaches\nquasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the\nhot ICM whenever t_TI/t_ff \\lesssim 10. This occurs despite the fact that the\nenergy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion.\nThe effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the\nturbulent motions in the wake of freely-falling cold filaments. Increased AGN\nactivity can locally reverse the cold gas flow, launching cold filamentary gas\naway from the cluster center. Our criterion for the condensation of spatially\nextended cold gas is in agreement with observations and previous idealized\nsimulations. \n\n"}

{"id": "1111.6865", "contents": "Title: Scaling relations between numerical simulations and physical systems\n  they represent Abstract: The dynamical equations describing the evolution of a physical system\ngenerally have a freedom in the choice of units, where different choices\ncorrespond to different physical systems that are described by the same\nequations. Since there are three basic physical units, of mass, length and\ntime, there are up to three free parameters in such a rescaling of the units,\n$N_f \\leq 3$. In Newtonian hydrodynamics, e.g., there are indeed usually three\nfree parameters, $N_f = 3$. If, however, the dynamical equations contain a\nuniversal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or the\ngravitational constant $G$, then the requirement that its value remains the\nsame imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of free\nparameters by one, to $N_f = 2$. This is the case, for example, in\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$\nappears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units to\nscale by the same factor, or in Newtonian gravity where the gravitational\nconstant $G$ appears in the equations. More generally, when there are $N_{udc}$\nindependent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then the\nnumber of free parameters is $N_f = max(0,3-N_{udc})$. When both gravity and\nrelativity are included, there is only one free parameter ($N_f = 1$, as both\n$G$ and $c$ appear in the equations so that $N_{udc} = 2$), and the units of\nmass, length and time must all scale by the same factor. The explicit\nrescalings for different types of systems are discussed and summarized here.\nSuch rescalings of the units also hold for discrete particles, e.g. in N-body\nor particle in cell simulations. They are very useful when numerically\ninvestigating a large parameter space or when attempting to fit particular\nexperimental results, by significantly reducing the required number of\nsimulations. \n\n"}

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the cooling of\nrotationally deformed, two-dimensional (2D) neutron stars in the framework of\ngeneral relativity theory, with the ultimate goal of better understand the\nimpact of 2D effects on the thermal evolution of such objects.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features. \n\n"}

In principle these models can be used to predict the shape of\nthe energy spectrum as well as the frequency-dependence of the time-lags,\nthrough the construction of energy-dependent response functions which map the\nemission as a function of time-delay in the system.

We analyzed dust properties together with other PN\nproperties and found that (i) there is an enhancement of MCD PNe toward the\nGalactic center; (ii) CRD PNe could be seen as defining an evolutionary\nsequence, contrary to the ORD and MCD PNe; (iii) C- and O-rich grains retain\ndifferent equilibrium temperatures, as expected from models; (iv) ORD PNe are\nhighly asymmetric and CRD PNe highly symmetric; point-symmetry is statistically\nmore common in MCD. We find that the Galactic Disk sample does not include MCD\nPNe, and the other dust classes are differently populated from high to low\nmetallicity environments. The MCPNe seem to attain higher dust temperatures at\nsimilar evolutionary stages, in agreement with the observational findings of\nsmaller dust grains in low metallicity interstellar environments. \n\n"}

With enhanced mixing, our synthetic LCs start their post-breakout\nre-brightening phase earlier, follow a more gradual rise to peak, appear\nredder, and fade faster after peak due to enhanced gamma-ray escape.\nNon-thermal electrons, crucial for the production of HeI lines, deposit a\ndominant fraction of their energy as heat. Because energy deposition is\ngenerally local well after the LC peak, the broad HeI lines characteristic of\nmaximum-light SN IIb/Ib spectra require mixing that places 56Ni and helium\nnuclei to within a gamma-ray mean-free-path. This requirement indicates that\nSNe IIb and Ib most likely arise from the explosion of stripped-envelope\nmassive stars (main-sequence masses \\leq25Msun) that have evolved through\nmass-transfer in a binary system, rather than from more massive single WR\nstars. In contrast, the lack of HeI lines in SNe Ic may result from a variety\nof causes: A genuine helium deficiency; strongly-asymmetric mixing; weak\nmixing; or a more massive, perhaps single, progenitor characterized by a larger\noxygen-rich core. Our models, subject to different mixing magnitudes, can\nproduce a variety of SN types, including IIb, IIc, Ib, and Ic.

Recent\nobservations of a number of galactic SNR strongly support the SNR-CR connection\nin general and the Fermi mechanism of CR acceleration, in particular.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

This chemistry develops in the icy mantles when photodissociation\nreactions in the mantle release free hydrogen, which escapes the mantle via\ndiffusion.

We detect highly significant X-ray lags between soft (0.3 - 1 keV)\nand hard (1.2 - 5 keV) energies. The hard band lags the soft at low frequencies\n(i.e. hard lag), while the opposite (i.e. soft lag) is observed at high\nfrequencies.

During the low flux intervals,\nthe soft lag is detected at higher frequencies and with smaller amplitude.\nAssuming that the soft lag is associated with the light travel time between\nprimary and reprocessed emission, this behaviour suggests that the X-ray source\nis more compact during low-flux intervals, and irradiates smaller radii of the\naccretion disc (likely because of light bending effects).

Consequences for\n  secondary star formation in the context of self-enrichment via fast rotating\n  massive stars Abstract: The self-enrichment scenario for globular clusters (GC) requires large\namounts of residual gas after the initial formation of the first stellar\ngeneration. Recently, Krause et al. (2012) found that supernovae may not be\nable to expel that gas, as required to explain their present day gas-free\nstate, and suggested that a sudden accretion on to the dark remnants, at a\nstage when type II supernovae have ceased, may plausibly lead to fast gas\nexpulsion. Here, we explore the consequences of these results for the\nself-enrichment scenario via fast rotating massive stars (FRMS). We analyse the\ninteraction of FRMS with the intra-cluster medium (ICM), in particular where,\nwhen and how the second generation of stars may form. From the results, we\ndevelop a timeline of the first approximately 40 Myr of GC evolution. The\nresults of Paper I imply three phases during which the ICM is in a\nfundamentally different state, namely the wind bubble phase (lasting 3.5 to 8.8\nMyr), the supernova phase (lasting 26.2 to 31.5 Myr), and the dark remnant\naccretion phase (lasting 0.1 to 4 Myr): (i) Quickly after the first generation\nmassive stars have formed, stellar wind bubbles compress the ICM into thin\nfilaments. No stars may form in the normal way during this phase, due to the\nhigh Lyman-Werner flux density. If the first generation massive stars have\nhowever equatorial ejections, as we proposed in the FRMS scenario, accretion\nmay resume in the shadow of the equatorial ejecta. The second generation stars\nmay then form due to gravitational instability in these discs that are fed by\nboth the FRMS ejecta and pristine gas. [...] \n\n"}

Abstract: The intrinsic X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is often found to be\nabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM\nabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the\nobserved opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 K and\n10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could\ntherefore constitute the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable\nlevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening\ncold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say\nwhich, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the\nhost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray\nabsorption. \n\n"}

When a star is disrupted in a bound\norbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal\nbehavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is\ninitially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time ~ the original\nstellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher\nthan the Eddington rate. Furthermore if the star is disrupted close to the\nhole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris\norbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the\ndebris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris\nenergy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a\nspinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection,\nand circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of\nflare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that\nquasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the\ntidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve. The\nlate-time light curve may still show power-law behavior which is generic to\ndisk accretion processes.

We apply the technique to the NLS1 PG1244+026, where the\noptical/UV/X-ray spectrum is consistent with being dominated by a standard disc\ncomponent.

A stochastic\nbackground of GWs from the incoherent superposition of many inspiraling\nsupermassive black hole binaries at nHz frequencies is likely to be the\ndominant GW signal detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic\nbackground this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as\nthe Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of\nthe pulsars. If the background is anisotropic, the cross-correlation is\ndifferent, but predictable, and also depends on the absolute position of the\npulsars. By simulating datasets containing GWBs with various anisotropic\nconfigurations, we have explored the prospects for constraining anisotropy\nusing near future data.

We perform a global fit to data in terms of the\neffective Lagrangian description of two interaction eigenstates of scalar\nbosons, a SM Higgs and a singlet scalar, and their mixing. This framework is\nmore suitable to study singlet-extended scenarios discussed above compared to\nother approaches based on the Lagrangian of mass eigenstates.

In such cases, we show that the two limb\ndarkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,\ndescribing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal\nefficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming:\ntriangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform,\nbivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these\nparametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic,\nsquare-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws. For example, in the case of\nthe popular quadratic law, we advocate fitting for q_1 = (u_1+u_2)^2 and q_2 =\n0.5u_1(u_1+u_2)^{-1} with uniform priors in the interval [0,1] to implement\ntriangular sampling easily.

Yet, the clustering strength\nof cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass,\nsuch as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. If galaxy\ncharacteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, the\nbasic assumption of HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for\nassembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation\nstatistics. We use halo abundance matching and age matching to construct\nfiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additional\nmock catalogs with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit a\nparameterized HOD to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies in\neach catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels of\nassembly bias. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs generally\ndescribe the true underlying HODs well, validating the basic methodology.\nHowever, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs have\nsystematic errors that are statistically significant.

In this thesis we studied third-order correlations, that might\nallow one to further distinguish between inflationary models. From all the\npossible extensions of the standard inflationary model, we chose to study\ntwo-field models with canonical kinetic terms and flat field space. The new\nfeature is the presence of the so-called isocurvature perturbation. Its\ninterplay with the adiabatic perturbation outside the horizon gives birth to\nnon-linearities characteristic of multiple-field models. In this context, we\nestablished the second-order gauge-invariant form of the adiabatic and\nisocurvature perturbation and found the third-order action that describes their\ninteractions. Furthermore, we built on and elaborated the long-wavelength\nformalism in order to acquire an expression for the parameter of\nnon-Gaussianity fNL as a function of the potential of the fields. We next used\nthis formula to study analytically, within the slow-roll hypothesis, general\nclasses of potentials and verified our results numerically for the exact\ntheory.

As the inner density profile of\nthe Milky Way's dark matter halo is uncertain, we study the impact of the slope\nof the Galactic density profile, inwards of the Sun, on the prospects for\ndetecting a dark matter signal with CTA. We find that the sensitivity achieved\nby CTA to annihilation signals is strongly dependent on the inner profile\nslope, whereas the dependence is more mild in the case of dark matter decay.\nSurprisingly, we find that the optimal choice of signal and background regions\nis virtually independent of the assumed density profile. For the fiducial case\nof a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we find that CTA will be able to probe\nannihilation cross sections well below the canonical thermal relic value for\ndark matter masses from a few tens of GeV up to $\\sim 5$ TeV for annihilation\nto $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, and will achieve only a slightly weaker sensitivity for\nannihilation to $b\\bar{b}$ or $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$.

The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time.

I: Assumptions,\n  uncertainties, and implications for the gap size and the accelerating field Abstract: The popular outer gap model of magnetospheric emission from pulsars has been\nwidely applied to explain the properties observed in $\\gamma$-rays. However,\nits quantitative predictions rely on a number of approximations and assumptions\nthat are usually overlooked. Here we examine them, reviewing the main\ningredients entering in the model, evaluating their range of uncertainties.\nUsually, in the quantitative applications of the model, key parameters like the\nradius of curvature and the energies of the interacting photons are taken to be\na fixed, single value. Instead, here we explore their realistic ranges, and the\nimpact of these on the consistency of the model itself.

In particular, after\nperforming a large number of numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with\nnuclear equations of state, we have found that the post-merger emission is\ncharacterized by two distinct and robust spectral features. While the\nhigh-frequency peak was already shown to be associated with the oscillations of\nthe hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and to depend on the\nequation of state, we have highlighted that the low-frequency peak is related\nto the merger process and to the total compactness of the stars in the binary.\nThis relation is essentially universal and provides a powerful tool to set\ntight constraints on the equation of state.

In the quantum field\ntheoretic approach the Schwinger's mechanism is generally used to give an\nexplanation of this tunneling process. It is the decay of quantum vacuum into\nparticle anti-particle pairs near the black hole surface. However, in a\nreference frame undergoing an uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat\nMinkowski space-time geometry, in the non-relativistic approximation, the\nparticle production near the event horizon of a black hole may be treated as a\nkind of Fowler-Nordheim field emission, which is the typical electron emission\nprocess from a metal surface under the action of an external electrostatic\nfield. This type of emission from metal surface is allowed even at extremely\nlow temperature. It has been noticed that in one-dimensional scenario, the\nSchr$\\ddot{\\rm{o}}$dinger equation satisfied by the created particle\n(anti-particle) near the event horizon, can be reduced to a differential form\nwhich is exactly identical with that obeyed by an electron immediately after\nthe emission from the metal surface under the action of a strong electrostatic\nfield.

We explore a new technique to constrain the matter power\nspectrum on smaller scales, assuming the dark matter is a Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particle (WIMP) that annihilates at early epochs. Energy released by\ndark matter annihilation can modify the spectrum of CMB temperature\nfluctuations and thus CMB experiments such as Planck have been able to\nconstrain the quantity f <sigma v> /m < 1/88 picobarn c / GeV, where f is the\nfraction of energy absorbed by gas, <sigma v> is the annihilation rate assumed\nconstant, and m is the particle mass. We assume the standard scale-invariant\nprimordial matter power spectrum of P_prim(k) ~ k^{n_s} at large scales k <\nk_p, while we adopt the modified power law of P_prim(k) ~ k_p^{n_s}\n(k/k_p)^{m_s} at small scales. We then aim at deriving constraints on m_s. For\nm_s > n_s, the excess small-scale power results in a much larger number of\nnonlinear small mass halos, particularly at high redshifts. Dark matter\nannihilation in these halos releases sufficient energy to partially ionize the\ngas, and consequently modify the spectrum of CMB fluctuations.

Dark matter annihilation into standard\nmodel particles has been shown to give a good fit to the signal for a variety\nof final state particles, but generic models are inconsistent with constraints\nfrom direct detection. Models where the dark matter annihilates to mediators\nthat subsequently decay are less constrained. We perform global fits of such\nmodels to recent data, allowing branching fractions to all possible fermionic\nfinal states to vary. The best fit models, including constraints from the\nAMS-02 experiment (and also antiproton ratio), require branching primarily to\nmuons, with a $\\sim 10-20\\%$ admixture of $b$ quarks, and no other species.\nThis suggests models in which there are two scalar mediators that mix with the\nHiggs, and have masses consistent with such a decay pattern. The scalar that\ndecays to $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ must therefore be lighter than $2m_\\tau \\cong 3.6$ GeV.\nSuch a small mass can cause Sommerfeld enhancement, which is useful to explain\nwhy the best-fit annihilation cross section is larger than the value needed for\na thermal relic density. For light mediator masses $\\sim (0.2-2)$ GeV, it can\nalso naturally lead to elastic DM self-interactions at the right level for\naddressing discrepancies in small structure formation as predicted by\ncollisionless cold dark matter. \n\n"}

This process should circularize the orbit, as\nis observed for the vast majority of binary MSPs, which predominantly have\norbital eccentricities $e < 0.001$. However, four recently discovered binary\nMSPs have orbits with $0.027 < e < 0.44$; PSR J1950+2414 is the fifth such\nsystem to be discovered. The upper limits for its intrinsic spin period\nderivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to those\nof the general MSP population.

The peculiarity of the present\nscenario consists of adopting the magnetic flux function as the basic dynamical\nvariable. Such a representation of the dynamics allows to make account of the\nco-rotation theorem as a fundamental feature of the ideal plasma equilibrium,\nevaluating its impact on the perturbation evolution too.

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources. For simplicity, we\nconsider co-located and co-aligned detectors with white detector noise, but the\nmethod can be extended to more realistic detector configurations and power\nspectra.

This\nabundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among\nthe highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies. NGC5866 also simultaneously has\nthe highest Fe/O abundance ratio and molecular gas mass among a small sample of\ngas-poor early-type galaxies. An estimation of the Fe budget indicates that\nNGC5866 could preserve a larger than usual fraction, but far from the total\namount of Fe injected by Type Ia SNe. We also find that the hot gas temperature\nincreases from inner to outer halos, with the inner halo has a temperature of\n~0.25keV, clearly lower than that expected from Type Ia SNe heating.

The measured brightness temperatures of the cores range from\n$10^{8.4}$ to $10^{11.4}$ K with a median value of $10^{10.1}$ K, indicating\nthat the radio emission is from non-thermal jets, and that, likely, most\nsources are not strongly beamed, then implying a lower jet speed in these\nradio-loud NLS1 galaxies. In combination with archival data taken at multiple\nfrequencies, we find that seven sources show flat or even inverted radio\nspectra, while steep spectra are revealed in the remaining seven objects.\nAlthough all these sources are very radio-loud with $R > 100$, their jet\nproperties are diverse, in terms of their milli-arcsecond (mas) scale (pc\nscale) morphology and their overall radio spectral shape. The evidence for slow\njet speeds (i.e., less relativistic jets), in combination with the low\nkinetic/radio power, may offer an explanation for the compact VLBA radio\nstructure in most sources. The mildly relativistic jets in these high accretion\nrate systems are consistent with a scenario, where jets are accelerated from\nthe hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and the radiation force of\nthe accretion disk.

Originally consisting of just four\nidentical IACTs (CT1-4) with an effective mirror diameter of 12$\\,$m each, it\nwas expanded with a fifth IACT (CT5) with a mirror diameter of 28$\\,$m in 2012.\nBeing the largest IACT worldwide, CT5 allows to lower the energy threshold of\nH.E.S.S., making the array sensitive at energies where space-based detectors\nrun out of statistics. Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable.

Here we propose a formation\nmechanism that skips the common-envelope scenario and relies on triple-body\ndynamics. We study the evolution of hierarchical triples, following the secular\ndynamical evolution up to the octupole-level of approximation, including\ngeneral relativity, tidal effects and post-main-sequence evolution, such as\nmass loss, changes to stellar radii and supernovae. During the dynamical\nevolution of the triple system, the \"eccentric Kozai-Lidov\" mechanism can cause\nlarge eccentricity excitations in the LMXB progenitor, resulting in three main\nBH-LMXB formation channels. Here we define BH-LMXB candidates as systems where\nthe inner BH companion star crosses its Roche limit.

To meet these objectives,\nthe KM3NeT Collaboration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure\nconsisting of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean\nSea. A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the\naccess to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the\nsynergetic opportunities for the earth and sea sciences community. Three\nsuitable deep-sea sites are identified, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo\nPassero (Italy) and Pylos (Greece). The infrastructure will consist of three\nso-called building blocks. A building block comprises 115 strings, each string\ncomprises 18 optical modules and each optical module comprises 31\nphoto-multiplier tubes. Each building block thus constitutes a 3-dimensional\narray of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov light produced\nby relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions. Two building\nblocks will be configured to fully explore the IceCube signal with different\nmethodology, improved resolution and complementary field of view, including the\nGalactic plane.

This effect is however not\nseen observationally or in numerical simulations. Previous attempts at\nreconciling the predictions with observations have proposed several mechanisms\nto evade the Meissner effect.

Specifically, we show\nthat the breakdown of stationarity is sufficient to remove the expulsion of the\nmagnetic field at all multipole orders, and that the associated temporal\nvariation is likely turbulent due to the existence of efficient mechanisms for\nsharing energy across different modes. Such an intrinsic (as opposed to being\ndriven externally by, e.g., changes in the accretion rate) variability of the\nelectromagnetic field can produce the recorded linear correlation between\nmicrovariability amplitudes and mean fluxes, help create magnetic randomness\nand seed sheared magnetic loops in jets, and lead to a better theoretical fit\nto the X-ray microvariability power spectral density. \n\n"}

To account for the observed millisecond pulses caused by scatter\nbroadening, we examine a variety of possible models of electron density\nfluctuations in both the IGM and the host galaxy medium. We find that a\nshort-wave-dominated power-law spectrum of density, which may arise in highly\nsupersonic turbulence with pronounced local dense structures of\nshock-compressed gas in the host interstellar medium (ISM), can produce the\nrequired density enhancements at sufficiently small scales to interpret the\nscattering timescale of FRBs.

The scaling\nof the scattering time with dispersion measure (DM) in the host galaxy varies\nin different turbulence and scattering regimes.

In these measurements pseudorapidity ($\\Delta\\eta$) and\nazimuthal ($\\Delta\\varphi$) differences are used to extract the shape of the\nnear-side peak formed by particles associated to a higher $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\ntrigger particle ($1 < p_{\\mathrm{T, trig}} <$ 8 GeV/c). A combined fit of the\nnear-side peak and long-range correlations is applied to the data allowing the\nextraction of the centrality evolution of the peak shape in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. A significant broadening of the peak in\nthe $\\Delta\\eta$ direction at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is found from peripheral to\ncentral collisions, which vanishes above 4 GeV/c, while in the $\\Delta\\varphi$\ndirection the peak is almost independent of centrality.

Large X-ray surveys\nprovide model boundary constraints, for both Compton-thin and Compton-thick\nlevels of obscuration, as obscured fractions are mean covering factors\n$f_{\\text{cov}}$.

The tidally induced departure of the waveform from that of\npoint-particle (or spinless binary black hole (BBH)) increases with the\nstiffness of the EOS. We show that causality (the requirement that the speed of\nsound is less than the speed of light for a perfect fluid satisfying a\none-parameter equation of state) places an upper bound on tidal deformability\nas a function of mass. Like the upper mass limit, the limit on deformabity is\nobtained by using an EOS with $v_{sound} = c$ for high densities and matching\nto a low density (candidate) EOS at a matching density of order nuclear\nsaturation density. We use these results and those of [B.D. Lackey et al.,\nPhys. Rev.

In addition, the maximum energy\nof acceleration capability of the sources grows linearly in Z, while the energy\nloss per distance traveled decreases with increasing A. Each of these two\npoints tend to favor heavy nuclei at the highest energies. The traditional\nbi-dimensional analyses, which simultaneously reproduce Auger data on the\nspectrum and nuclear composition, may not be capable of incorporating the\nrelative importance of these phenomena. In this paper we propose a\nmulti-dimensional reconstruction of the individual emission spectra (in E,\ndirection, and cross-correlation with nearby putative sources) to study the\nhypothesis that primaries are heavy nuclei subject to GZK photo-disintegration,\nand to determine the nature of the extragalactic sources.

Abstract: The mass of the graviton, if nonzero, is usually considered to be very small,\ne.g. of the Hubble scale, from several observational constraints. In this\npaper, we propose a gravity model where the graviton mass is very small in the\nusual weak gravity environments, below all the current graviton mass bounds,\nbut becomes much larger in the strong gravity regime such as a black hole's\nvicinity. For black holes in this model, significant deviations from general\nrelativity emerge very close to the black hole horizon and alter the black hole\nquasi-normal modes, which can be extracted from the ringdown waveform of black\nhole binary mergers. Also, the enhancement of the graviton mass near the\nhorizon can result in echoes in the late time ringdown, which can be verified\nin the upcoming gravitational wave observations of higher sensitivity. \n\n"}

The model has no free parameters and is\ntherefore extremely predictive; moreover, recent studies singled out a Majorana\n$SU(2)_\\text{L}$ quintuplet as the only viable candidate.

Widespread circular polarisation Abstract: We analyse the circular polarisation data accumulated in the first 7 years of\nthe POLAMI project introduced in an accompanying paper (Agudo et al.). In the\n3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one\nof our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most\nsources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is\nbroader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)\ncircular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about\none year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the\nsignal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the\nsign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,\nincluding 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees\nof circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We\ndo find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in\nsynchronism during a time span of 0.9 years.

Using N-body simulations, we address the question of how much\ninformation is retained from different scales in the initial linear power\nspectrum following the nonlinear growth of structure. We run a suite of N-body\nsimulations with different initial linear matter power spectra to show that,\nonce the system undergoes nonlinear evolution, the shape of the linear power\nspectrum at high wavenumbers does not affect the non-linear power spectrum,\nwhile it still matters for the halo mass function. Indeed, we find that linear\npower spectra which differ from one another only at wavenumbers larger than\ntheir half-mode wavenumber give rise to (almost) identical nonlinear power\nspectra at late times, regardless of the fact that they originate from\ndifferent models with damped fluctuations. On the other hand, the halo mass\nfunction is more sensitive to the form of the linear power spectrum. Exploiting\nthis result, we propose a two parameter model of the transfer function in\ngeneric damped scenarios, and show that this parametrisation works as well as\nthe standard three parameter models for the scales on which the linear spectrum\nis relevant. \n\n"}

Nonlinear particle clumping from the SI can trigger\ngravitational collapse into planetesimals. To better understand the numerical\nrobustness of the SI, we perform a suite of vertically-stratified 3D\nsimulations with fixed physical parameters known to produce strong clumping. We\nvary the numerical implementation, namely the computational domain size and the\nvertical boundary conditions (vBCs), comparing newly-implemented outflow vBCs\nto the previously-used periodic and reflecting vBCs. We find strong particle\nclumping by the SI is mostly independent of the vBCs. However, peak particle\ndensities are higher in larger simulation domains due to a larger particle mass\nreservoir. We report SI-triggered zonal flows, i.e., azimuthally-banded radial\nvariations of gas pressure. These structures have low amplitudes, insufficient\nto halt particle radial drift, confirming that particle trapping in gas\npressure maxima is not the mechanism of the SI. We find that outflow vBCs\nproduce artificially large gas outflow rates at vertical boundaries.

The method is based on\nthe comparison of predictions for radio pulse shapes by CoREAS simulations to\nmeasured pulses. We applied our method to the data of Tunka-Rex, a 1 km$^2$\nradio array in Siberia operating in the frequency band of 30-80 MHz. Tunka-Rex\nis triggered by the air-Cherenkov detector Tunka-133 and by scintillators\n(Tunka-Grande). The instrument collects air-shower data since 2012. The present\npaper describes updated data and signal analyses of Tunka-Rex and details of a\nnew method applied. After efficiency cuts, when Tunka-Rex reaches its full\nefficiency, the energy resolution of about 10% given by the new method has\nreached the limit of systematic uncertainties due to the calibration\nuncertainty and shower-to-shower fluctuations. At the same time the shower\nmaximum reconstruction is significantly improved up to an accuracy of 35\ng/cm$^2$ compared to the previous method based on the slope of the lateral\ndistribution. We also define and now achieved conditions of the measurements,\nat which the shower maximum resolution of Tunka-Rex reaches a value of 25\ng/cm$^2$ and becomes competitive to optical detectors. To check and validate\nour reconstruction and efficiency cuts we compare individual events to the\nreconstruction of Tunka-133.

We focus on two particularly interesting scenarios. First, we fix\nthe connection to be metric compatible, but we follow a completely covariant\napproach by imposing the constraints with suitable Lagrange multipliers. For a\ngeneral quadratic theory we show how torsion naturally propagates and we\nreproduce the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity as a particular\nquadratic action that features an additional Lorentz symmetry. We then study\nthe much less explored theories formulated in a geometry with neither curvature\nnor torsion, so that all the geometrical information is encoded in the\nnon-metricity. We discuss how this geometrical framework leads to a purely\ninertial connection that can thus be completely removed by a coordinate gauge\nchoice, the coincident gauge. From the quadratic theory we recover a simpler\nformulation of General Relativity in the form of the Einstein action, which\nenjoys an enhanced symmetry that reduces to a second linearised diffeomorphism\nat linear order. More general theories in both geometries can be formulated\nconsistently by taking into account the inertial connection and the associated\nadditional degrees of freedom. As immediate applications, the new cosmological\nequations and their Newtonian limit are considered, where the role of the lapse\nin the consistency of the equations is clarified, and the Schwarzschild black\nhole entropy is computed by evaluating the corresponding Euclidean action.

As the rate\nof astrophysical sources increases, the probability that a signal will occur at\nthe same time as a glitch also increases. This has occurred previously in the\ngravitational wave binary neutron star detection GW170817. In the case of\nGW170817, the glitch in the Livingston detector was easy to identify, and much\nshorter than the total duration of the signal, making it possible for the\nglitch to be removed. In this paper, we examine the effect of glitches on the\nmeasurement of signal parameters and Bayes factors used for model selection for\nmuch more difficult cases, where it may not be possible to determine that the\nglitch is present or to remove it.

[1] we analyzed the behavior of these\nclumps, assuming spherical symmetry, allowing for both attractive and repulsive\nself-interactions. There is a maximum allowed mass for the clumps in the case\nof attractive interactions, and a minimum radius for the clumps in the case of\nrepulsive interactions, which is saturated at large mass. Here we extend this\nwork to include non-spherically symmetric clumps. Since the system tries to\nre-organize into a BEC ground state, we consider configurations with a\nconserved non-zero angular momentum, and construct minimum energy\nconfigurations at fixed particle number and fixed angular momentum.

With the\naddition of distance information - deriving reliable ages from photometry is a\npossibility. We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability\nmaps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using\nisochrones. Our synthetic tests show that including a near-UV passband enables\nus to break the degeneracy between a star's age and metallicity for certain\nevolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and\nmetallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band\nand a parallax with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are\npossible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with\nthe literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,\nparticularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open\ncluster NGC 188, however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar\nisochrones. The ages derived for the cluster stars vary with evolutionary\nstage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant branch, and\nmetallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary\nappreciably depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation.\nWe identify the causes of these mismatches and show that improvements are\nneeded in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the creation and\ncalibration of synthetic near-UV photometry.

In the firn, the index of refraction\nchanges due to the transition from snow at the surface to glacial ice below,\naffecting the propagation of radio signals in that region. We compare our\nobservations to a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic wave\nsimulation, which supports the existence of three classes of propagation: a\nbulk propagation ray-bending mode that leads to so-called \"shadowed\" regions\nfor certain geometries of transmission, a surface-wave mode induced by the\nice/air interface, and an arbitrary-depth horizontal propagation mode that\nrequires perturbations from a smooth density gradient. In the non-shadowed\nregion, our measurements are consistent with the bulk propagation ray-bending\nmode both in timing and in amplitude.

After quality cuts, the full sample\nconsists of 1511 sources, although the main analysis uses a subset of 416\nsources selected on the geometric mean of their flux in the pairs of\nobservations, which eliminates selection biases. We find a fractional\nvariability that increases with increasing interval between observations, from\nabout 0.25 for observations separated by tens of days up to about 0.45 for\nobservations separated by $\\sim 10$ years.

We want to\nevaluate the best method to correct near-infrared high-resolution spectra as\nwell as the limitations of each software package and methodology. Methods. We\napplied the telluric correction methods to CRIRES archival data taken in the J\nand K bands. We explored how the achieved correction level varies depending on\nthe atmospheric T-P profile used in the modelling, the depth of the atmospheric\nlines, and the molecules creating the absorption. Results. We found that the\nMolecfit and TelFit corrections lead to smaller residuals for the water lines.\nThe standard star method corrects best the oxygen lines. The Molecfit package\nand the standard star method corrections result in global offsets always below\n0.5% for all lines; the offset is similar with TelFit and TAPAS for the H2O\nlines and around 1% for the O2 lines.

Although the\nthreshold cannot at present be accurately determined (or even quantified)\nobservationally, it is clearly higher for bright Z sources than for faint atoll\nsources. Here we propose that the observational manifestation of kHz QPOs {\\em\nrequires} direct interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere and the\nKeplerian accretion disk and that the cessation of kHz QPOs at high accretion\nrate is due to the lack of such an interact when the Keplerian disk terminates\nat the last stable orbit and yet the magnetosphere is pushed farther inward.\nThe threshold is therefore dependent of the magnetic field strength -- the\nstronger the magnetic field the higher the threshold. This is certainly in\nagreement with the atoll/Z paradigm, but we argue that it is also generally\ntrue, even for individual sources within each (atoll or Z) category. For atoll\nsources, the kHz QPOs also seem to vanish at low accretion rate. Perhaps the\n``disengagement'' between the magnetosphere and the Keplerian disk also takes\nplace under such circumstances, because of, for instance, the presence of\nquasi-spherical advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) close to the neutron\nstar. Unfortunately, in this case, the estimation of the accretion rate\nthreshold would require a knowledge of the physical mechanisms that cause the\ndisengagement.

The emission-line profile is suggestive\nof a relativistic accretion disk, and is reminiscent of double-peaked transient\nBalmer emission observed in a handful of other LINERs. The very broad line\nemission thus constitutes clear qualitative evidence for a black hole, and\nspatially resolved narrow-line emission in NGC 4203 can be used to constrain\nits mass, with M_BH less than 6 x 10^6 solar masses at 99.7% confidence.

In particular, we demonstrate the large\ndifference between flare profiles produced in the radiative and adiabatic\nregimes.

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible.

Although the frequency spectrum of the non-linear\nSASI is broadened substantially by non-linear couplings, the typical frequency\nis still much smaller than those of g-modes, the fact leading to a severe\nimpedance mismatch. As a result, the excitations of various $g$-modes are\nrather inefficient and the energy of the saturated g-modes is $\\sim 10^{50}$erg\nor smaller, with the g_2-mode being the largest in our model.

We present an analysis of the\nionization state, chemical abundances, and kinematic characteristics of two\nmetal-line systems at z=1.92 and z=1.94 toward J2233-606. We focus on these two\nsystems because (i) the observations provide full coverage of the Lyman series,\nhence an accurate determination of their HI column densities and (ii) the\nmetal-line transitions allow a measurement of their ionization state.\n  Line-profile fits of the Lyman series for the two systems indicate log N(HI)\n= 17.15 \\pm 0.02 cm^-2 evenly distributed between two components for the z=1.92\nsystem and log N(HI) = 16.33 \\pm 0.04 cm^-2 for the z=1.94 system.
