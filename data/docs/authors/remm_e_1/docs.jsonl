Motivated by the\ntopological theory of surgery, we discuss the problem of classifying up to\nisomorphism all smooth proper varieties having a specified A^1-homotopy type.\nArithmetic considerations involving the sheaf of A^1-connected components lead\nus to introduce several different notions of connectedness in A^1-homotopy\ntheory. We provide concrete links between these notions, connectedness of\npoints by chains of affine lines, and various rationality properties of\nalgebraic varieties (e.g., rational connectedness).\n  We introduce the notion of an A^1-h-cobordism, an algebro-geometric analog of\nthe topological notion of h-cobordism, and use it as a tool to produce\nnon-trivial A^1-weak equivalences of smooth proper varieties.

This raises a number\nof questions on the periodic regime of A^k and A^k x, for a given vector x.\nAlso, this leads to the concept of attraction cones in max algebra, by which we\nmean sets of vectors whose ultimate orbit period does not exceed a given\nnumber.

Hence the computational complexity of such problems\nis of the order O(n^3 log n).

It turns out that such a weak Poisson structure on $A$ is a Lie\nalgebra bracket on the 0-th cyclic homology $ \\HC_0(A) $ satisfying some extra\nconditions; it was thus called in an {\\it $ H_0$-Poisson structure}.\n  This paper studies a higher homological extension of this construction. In\nour more general setting, we show that noncommutative Poisson structures in the\nabove sense behave nicely with respect to homotopy (in the sense that homotopy\nequivalent NC Poisson structures on $A$ induce (via the derived representation\nfunctor) homotopy equivalent Poisson algebra structures on the derved\nrepresentation schemes $\\DRep_V(A) $). For an ordinary algebra $A$, a\nnoncommutative Poisson structure on a semifree (more generally, cofibrant)\nresolution of $A$ yields a graded (super) Lie algebra structure on the full\ncyclic homology $ \\HC_\\bullet(A) $ extending Crawley-Boevey's $\\H_0$-Poisson\nstructure on $ \\HC_0(A) $.

This\nalgorithm was first used in noncommutative algebra to prove catenarity in\ngeneric quantum matrices, and then to show that torus-invariant primes in these\nalgebras are generated by quantum minors. Since then this algorithm has been\nused in various contexts. In particular, the matrix version makes a bridge\nbetween torus-invariant primes in generic quantum matrices, torus-orbits of\nsymplectic leaves in matrix Poisson varieties and totally nonnegative cells in\ntotally nonnegative matrix varieties [12]. This led to recent progress in the\nstudy of totally nonnegative matrices such as new recognition tests, see for\ninstance [18]. The aim of this article is to develop a Poisson version of the\ndeleting derivations algorithm to study the members of a class P of polynomial\nPoisson algebras. It has recently been shown that the Poisson Dixmier-Moeglin\nequivalence does not hold for all polynomial Poisson algebras [2]. Our\nalgorithm allows us to prove this equivalence for a significant class of\nPoisson algebras, when the base field is of characteristic zero. Finally, using\nour deleting derivations algorithm, we compare topologically spectra of quantum\nmatrices with Poisson spectra of matrix Poisson varieties. \n\n"}

It is known\nthat this problem relates to the ring of matrix semi-invariants.

For a particular choice of parameters these\nalgebras recover the polarization of the quadratic map on metric curvature\ntensors that arises in the work of Hamilton on the Ricci flow. Here these\nalgebras are studied as interesting examples of metrized commutative algebras\nand in low dimensions they are described concretely in terms of nonstandard\ncommutative multiplications on self-adjoint endomorphisms.\n  The algebra of curvature tensors on a three-dimensional Euclidean vector\nspace is shown isomorphic to an orthogonally invariant deformation of the\nstandard Jordan product on three by three symmetric matrices.

An associative dialgebra is a vector\nspace equipped with two associative operations satisfying three more\nconditions. For instance, any differential associative algebra gives rise to a\ndialgebra.\n  In this article we construct and study a (co)homology theory for associative\ndialgebras. The surprizing fact, in the construction of the chain complex, is\nthe appearance of the combinatorics of planar binary trees (grafting and\nnesting). The principal result about this homology theory is its vanishing on\nfree associative dialgebras.\n  The Koszul dual (in the sense of Ginzburg and Kapranov) of the operad of\nassociative dialgebras is the operad of \"dendriform algebras\".

We then\ntackle the question as to whether this representation is faithful, but it turns\nout that the answer is often negative. The lack of faithfulness is however\ncompletely understood as long as we restrict to \"continuous\" inverse\nsemigroups, a class generalizing the E*-unitaries. \n\n"}

This isomorphism enables a reformulation of\nthe cotensor product of Eilenberg and Moore as a functor of modules rather than\ncomodules.\n  We prove that the cotensor product M \\Box N of a right A-module M and a left\nA-module N is isomorphic to the vector space of homomorphisms from a particular\nleft A^e-module D to N \\otimes M, viewed as a left A^e-module.

More concretely, it is shown that the $B_\\infty$-operad,\nwhich is generated by multilinear operations known to act on the Hochschild\ncomplex, is a quotient of a certain operad associated to the compactified\nconfiguration spaces. Different notions of homotopy Gerstenhaber algebras are\ndiscussed: one of them is a $B_\\infty$-algebra, another, called a homotopy\nG-algebra, is a particular case of a $B_\\infty$-algebra, the others, a\n$G_\\infty$-algebra, an $\\bar E^1$-algebra, and a weak $G_\\infty$-algebra, arise\nfrom the geometry of configuration spaces.
