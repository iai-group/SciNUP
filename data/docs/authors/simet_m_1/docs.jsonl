Eliminating such biases by neglecting\ninformation in multipoles beyond several hundred leads to weaker parameter\nconstraints by a factor of approximately 2 to 3 compared with using information\nout to multipoles of several thousand. Fortunately, the same numerical studies\nthat explore the influence of baryons indicate that they primarily affect power\nspectra by altering halo structure through the relation between halo mass and\nmean effective halo concentration. We explore the ability of future weak\nlensing surveys to constrain both the internal structures of halos and the\nproperties of the dark energy simultaneously as a first step toward self\ncalibrating for the physics of baryons. This greatly reduces parameter biases\nand no parameter constraint is degraded by more than 40% in the case of LSST or\n30% in the cases of SNAP or DES.

We evaluate\nthe free-streaming (Jeans') length and Jeans' mass: they result independent of\nthe type of DM except for the DM self-gravity dynamics. The free-streaming\nlength today results in the kpc range. These results are based on our\ntheoretical analysis, astronomical observations of dwarf spheroidal satellite\ngalaxies in the Milky Way and N-body numerical simulations.

We revisit the\nquestion of what can be learnt about the spatial geometry of the Universe from\nthe perspective of a three-way Bayesian model comparison. We show that, given\ncurrent data, the probability that the Universe is spatially infinite lies\nbetween 67% and 98%, depending on the choice of priors. For the strongest prior\nchoice, we find odds of order 50:1 (200:1) in favour of a flat Universe when\ncompared with a closed (open) model.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

Many\nprevious studies have investigated this topic, particularly in relation to the\nnon-linear regime of structure formation. However, no careful pre-selection of\nviable quintessence models with high precision cosmological data was performed.\nHere we show that this has led to a misinterpretation (and underestimation) of\nthe imprint of quintessence on the distribution of large scale structures. To\nthis purpose we perform a likelihood analysis of the combined Supernova Ia\nUNION dataset and WMAP5-years data to identify realistic quintessence models.\nDifferences from the vanilla LambdaCDM are especially manifest in the predicted\namplitude and shape of the linear matter power spectrum, though these remain\nwithin the uncertainties of the SDSS data. We use these models as benchmark for\nstudying the clustering properties of dark matter halos by performing a series\nof high resolution N-body simulations.

Using two proposed methods, we show that one\ncould be led to reject the null hypothesis of GR when it is the true theory if\nthis uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected. Recent simulations suggest\nthat we can correct for baryonic effects using a parametrized model in which\nthe halo mass-concentration relation is modified. The correction renders biases\nsmall compared to statistical uncertainties. We study the ability of future\nweak lensing surveys to constrain the internal structures of halos and test the\nnull hypothesis of GR simultaneously. Compared to nulling information from\nsmall-scales to mitigate sensitivity to baryonic physics, this internal\ncalibration program should provide limits on deviations from GR that are\nseveral times more constraining. Specifically, we find that limits on general\nrelativity in the case of internal calibration are degraded by only ~30% or\nless compared to the case of perfect knowledge of nonlinear structure. \n\n"}

The optical spectrum of this object exhibits\nrather narrow Hbeta (FWHM(Hbeta) ~ 1500 km s^-1), weak forbidden lines and is\ntherefore classified as a narrow-line type I quasar. This class of objects is\nthought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at high\nEddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core\nindicates the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi simultaneous\nradio-optical-X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. Both radio and\ngamma-ray emission (observed over 5-months) are strongly variable. The\nsimultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed\nto the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. The\nresulting broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in particular, the\ngamma-ray spectrum measured by Fermi are similar to those of more powerful\nFSRQ.

Combined with results from our\nrecent study of the elliptical galaxy NGC4649, this brings to four the number\nof galaxies with SMBHs measured in this way. Of these, three already have mass\ndeterminations from the kinematics of either the stars or a central gas disc,\nand hence join only a handful of galaxies with Mbh measured by more than one\ntechnique.

The adaptive smoothing scheme allows to take full\nadvantage of the spatially resolved photometric information contained in an\nimage in that at any location the minimal smoothing is applied to reach the\nrequested S/N. Support is given to match more images on the same smoothing\nlength, such that proper estimates of local colours can be done, with a big\npotential impact on multi-wavelength studies of extended sources (galaxies,\nnebulae). Different modes to estimate local S/N are provided. In addition to\nclassical arithmetic-mean averaging mode, the code can operate in median\naveraging mode, resulting in a significant enhancement of the final image\nquality and very accurate flux conservation.

We mainly focus on the WMAP 7-yr data (TT and TE),\nSupernova data (SDSS SN), Hubble constant measurements (HST) and Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillation data (SDSS and LRG). We find that the inclusion of a\nnonzero overall curvature drastically improves the goodness of fit of the Void\nmodel, bringing it very close to that of a homogeneous universe containing Dark\nEnergy, while by varying the profile one can increase the value of the local\nHubble parameter which has been a challenge for these models. We also try to\ngauge how well our model can fit the large-scale-structure data, but a\ncomprehensive analysis will require the knowledge of perturbations on LTB\nmetrics.

In this regime, HI is likely to represent most of the ISM\nand FUV emission to trace recent star formation with little bias due to\nextinction, so that the two quantities closely trace the underlying\nrelationship between gas and star formation rate (SFR). The azimuthally\naveraged HI and FUV intensities both decline with increasing radius in this\nregime, with the scale length of the FUV profile typically half that of the HI\nprofile. Despite the mismatch in profiles, there is a significant spatial\ncorrelation (at 15\" resolution) between local FUV and HI intensities; near r25\nthis correlation is quite strong, in fact stronger than anywhere inside r25,\nand shows a decline towards larger radii. The star formation efficiency (SFE) -\ndefined as the ratio of FUV/HI and thus the inverse of the gas depletion time -\ndecreases with galactocentric radius across the outer disks, though much\nshallower than across the optical disks.

These oscillations induce time varying CP-odd nuclear moments,\nsuch as electric dipole and Schiff moments. The coupling between internal\natomic fields and these nuclear moments gives rise to time varying shifts to\natomic energy levels. These effects can be enhanced by using elements with\nlarge Schiff moments such as the light Actinides, and states with large\nspontaneous parity violation, such as molecules in a background electric field.\nThe energy level shift in such a molecule can be ~ 10^-24 eV or larger.

Among all clusters/groups of a flux-limited X-ray sample, we predict\nVirgo, Fornax and M49 to be the brightest DM sources and find a particularly\nlow CR-induced background for Fornax. For a minimum substructure mass given by\nthe DM free-streaming scale, cluster halos maximize the substructure boost for\nwhich we find a factor above 1000. Since regions around the virial radius\ndominate the annihilation flux of substructures, the resulting surface\nbrightness profiles are almost flat. This makes it very challenging to detect\nthis flux with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Assuming cold dark\nmatter with a substructure mass distribution down to an Earth mass and using\nextended Fermi upper limits, we rule out the leptophilic models in their\npresent form in 28 clusters, and limit the boost from SFE in M49 and Fornax to\nbe < 5.

This is the first detection of a BAL,\nwhich is sometimes seen in powerful quasars with high accretion rates, in a BL\nLac object.

The light curve exhibits a linear decline with a\nrelatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactive\ndecay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003\n$M_{\\odot}$. Spectra of SN2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peaked\nH$\\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component that\nsuggests shock interaction with dense CSM; (2) high-velocity blue and red\nemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wings\nextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. These features persist during 100 days\nafter explosion. We propose that this line profile indicates a bipolar\njet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal SN ejecta\nand CSM interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broad\nline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. Two variations of the jet\ninterpretation seem plausible: (1) A fast jet mixes 56Ni to high velocities in\npolar zones of the H-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jet\nproduces blue and red bumps in Balmer lines when a jet interacts with dense\nCSM. Jet-driven SNeII are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide range\nof initial masses above 25 $M_{\\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. This seems\nconsistent with the SN host environment, which is either an extremely\nlow-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair of\nstar-forming galaxies. It also seems consistent with the low 56Ni mass that may\naccompany black hole formation. We speculate that the jet survives to produce\nobservable signatures because the star's H envelope was mostly stripped away by\nprevious eruptive mass loss. \n\n"}

In addition, the\nobserved baryon density is within an order of magnitude of the dark matter\ndensity. This suggests that the baryon density is physically related to a\ntypical thermal relic WIMP dark matter density. We present a model which\nsimultaneously generates thermal relic WIMP-like densities for both baryons and\ndark matter by modifying a large initial baryon asymmetry.

We find that 50%\n(25/50) of local LIRGs have an AGN component detected with this method. There\nis good agreement between these AGN detections through mid-IR spectral\ndecomposition and other AGN indicators, such as the optical spectral class,\nmid-IR spectral features and X-ray properties. Taking all the AGN indicators\ntogether, the AGN detection rate in the individual nuclei of LIRGs is ~62%. The\nderived AGN bolometric luminosities are in the range L_bol(AGN)=0.4 -50x10^{43}\nerg/s. The AGN bolometric contribution to the IR luminosities of the galaxies\nis generally small, with 70% of LIRGs having L_bol(AGN)/L_IR<0.05. Only ~8% of\nlocal LIRGs have a significant AGN bolometric contribution L_bol(AGN)/L_IR >\n0.25. From the comparison of our results with literature results of\nultraluminous infrared galaxies, we confirm that in the local universe the AGN\nbolometric contribution to the IR luminosity increases with the IR luminosity\nof the galaxy/system. If we add up the AGN bolometric luminosities we find that\nAGNs only account for 5%^{+8%}_{-3%} of the total IR luminosity produced by\nlocal LIRGs (with and without AGN detections). This proves that the bulk of the\nIR luminosity of local LIRGs is due to star formation activity.

Abstract: A few long gamma-ray bursts such as GRB 050421 show no afterglow emission\nbeyond the usual initial steep decay phase. It has been suggested that these\nevents correspond to \"naked\" bursts that occur in a very low density\nenvironment. We reconsider this possibility in the context of various scenarios\nfor the origin of the afterglow. In the standard model where the afterglow\nresults from the forward shock as well as in the alternative model where the\nafterglow comes from the reverse shock, we aim to obtain constraints on the\ndensity of the environment, the microphysics parameters, or the Lorentz factor\nof the ejecta, which are imposed by the absence of a detected afterglow. For\nthe two models we compute the afterglow evolution for different values of the\nexternal density (uniform or wind medium) and various burst parameters. We then\ncompare our results to the Swift data of GRB 050421, which is the best example\nof a long burst without afterglow. In the standard model we show that\nconsistency with the data imposes that the external density does not exceed\n1E-5 cm-3 or that the microphysics parameters are very small with epsilon_e <~\n1E-2 and epsilon_B <~ 1E-4. If the afterglow is caused by the reverse shock, we\nfind that its contribution can be strongly reduced if the central source has\nmainly emitted fast-moving material (with less than 10 - 30 % of the kinetic\nenergy at Gamma<100 and was located in a dense environment. The two considered\nscenarios therefore lead to opposite constraints on the circumburst medium.

For the other two groups, the RASS emission has its origin as either\nan optically dull/X-ray bright AGN, or the blending of distinct X-ray sources.\nUsing SDSS-DR7 data, we confirm, for all groups, the presence of an r-band\nmagnitude gap between the seed elliptical and the second-rank galaxy. However,\nthe gap value depends, up to 0.5mag, on how one estimates the seed galaxy total\nflux, which is greatly underestimated when using SDSS (relative to Sersic)\nmagnitudes. This implies that many FGs may be actually missed when using SDSS\ndata, a fact that should be carefully taken into account when comparing the\nobserved number densities of FGs to the expectations from cosmological\nsimulations. The similarity in the properties of seed--FG and non-fossil\nellipticals, found in our previous study, extends to the sample of X-ray\nconfirmed FGs, indicating that bright ellipticals in FGs do not represent a\ndistinct population of galaxies. For one system, we also find that the velocity\ndistribution of faint galaxies is bimodal, possibly showing that the system\nformed through the merging of two groups.

This\nSFR-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-forming\npopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. While there is a strong\ndependence of the EWH?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that these\ntrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationship\nis absent when considering a \"star-forming\" sample of galaxies.

We find\nthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the\nturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular\nvelocity of early haloes.

Abstract: AGN are known to account for a major portion, if not all, of the cosmic X-ray\nbackground radiation. The dominant sharp spectral feature in their spectra is\nthe 6.4 keV fluorescent line of iron, which may contribute to as much as ~ 5-10\n% of the CXB spectral intensity at ~ 2-6 keV. Owing to cosmological redshift,\nthe line photons detected at the energy E carry information about objects\nlocated at the redshift z=6.4/E-1. In particular, imprinted in their angular\nfluctuations is the information about the large-scale structure at redshift z.\nThis opens the possibility of performing the Fe K_alpha line tomography of the\ncosmic large-scale structure. We show that detection of the tomographic signal\nat ~100 sigma confidence requires an all-sky survey by an instrument with an\neffective area of ~10 m^2 and field of view of ~1 deg^2. The signal is\nstrongest for objects located at the redshift z~1 and at the angular scales\ncorresponding to l ~ 100-300, therefore an optimal detection can be achieved\nwith an instrument having a rather modest angular resolution of ~ 0.1-0.5 deg.\nFor such an instrument, the CCD-type energy resolution of ~ 100-200 eV FWHM is\nentirely sufficient for the optimal separation of the signals coming from\ndifferent redshifts. The gain in the signal strength that could potentially be\nachieved with energy resolution comparable to the line width is nullified by\nthe photon counting and AGN discreteness noise. Among the currently planned and\nproposed missions, these requirements are best satisfied by LOFT, even though\nit was proposed for an entirely different purpose.

Using a\nphysical-evolution model for blazars with a luminosity dependent evolution\n(LDDE) and an observationally-determined luminosity-dependent blazar spectral\nenergy distribution (SED), we find that blazars can account for the observed\nanisotropy of the DGRB consistent with their observed source-count\ndistribution, but are in turn constrained in contributing significantly to the\nobserved DGRB intensity.

Abstract: The Local Group is often seen to be a quiescent environment without\nsignificant merger events. However an ancient major merger may have occurred in\nthe most massive galaxy. Numerical simulations have shown that tidal tails\nformed during gas-rich major mergers are long-lived and could be responsible\nfor old stellar streams and likely induce the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies\n(TDGs). Using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most\nprominent tidal tail formed during the first passage, which is gas-rich and\ncontains old and metal poor stars. We discovered several striking coincidences\nafter comparing its location and motion to those of the Milky Way (MW) and of\nthe Magellanic Clouds (MCs). First, the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively\nsmall volume in which the MW precisely lies. Because the geometry of the merger\nis somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the Giant Stream (GS), we\nevaluate the chance of the MW to be at such a rendez-vous with this gigantic\ntidal tail to be 5 %. Second, the velocity of the tidal tail matches the LMC\nproper motion, and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum\nproperties of the MW dwarfs, i.e. the so-called disk of satellites, better\ncalled Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Third, the simulation of the tidal tail\nreveals one of the formed TDG with mass and location almost comparable to those\nof the LMC. Our present modeling is however too limited to study the detailed\ninteraction of gas-rich TDGs with the potential of the MW, and a complementary\nstudy is required to test whether the dwarf intrinsic properties can be\naccounted for by our scenario. Nevertheless this study suggests a causal link\nbetween an ancient, gas-rich major merger at the M31 location, and several\nenigma in the Local Group, the GS, the VPOS, and the presence of the MCs. \n\n"}

Our results show that asymmetric mass ejection caused\nby hydrodynamic instabilities can accelerate the neutron star (NS) up to recoil\nvelocities of more than 700 km/s by the \"gravitational tug-boat mechanism\",\nwhich is enough to explain most observed pulsar velocities. The associated NS\nspin periods are about 100 ms to 8 s without any correlation between spin and\nkick magnitudes or directions. This suggests that faster spins and a possible\nspin-kick alignment might require angular momentum in the progenitor core prior\nto collapse. Our simulations for the first time demonstrate a clear correlation\nbetween the size of the NS kick and anisotropic ejection of heavy elements\ncreated by explosive burning behind the shock. In the case of large NS kicks\nthe explosion is significantly stronger opposite to the kick vector. Therefore\nthe bulk of the Fe-group elements, in particular nickel, is ejected mostly in\nlarge clumps against the kick direction. This contrasts with the case of low\nrecoil velocity, where the Ni-rich lumps are more isotropically distributed.\nIntermediate-mass nuclei heavier than Si (like Ca and Ti) also exhibit a\nsignificant enhancement in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of fast NS\nmotion, while the distribution of C, O, and Ne is not affected, and that of Mg\nonly marginally.

This model is\nricher than that based on a single walk, because it yields a distribution of\nheights at first crossing. We provide explicit expressions for the\nunconditional first crossing distribution which is usually used to model the\nhalo mass function, the progenitor distributions, and the conditional\ndistributions from which correlations with environment are usually estimated.\nThese latter exhibit perhaps the simplest form of what is often called nonlocal\nbias, and which we prefer to call stochastic bias, since the new bias effects\narise from `hidden-variables' other than density, but these may still be\ndefined locally. We provide explicit expressions for these new bias factors. We\nalso provide formulae for the distribution of heights at first crossing in the\nunconditional and conditional cases. In contrast to the first crossing\ndistribution, these are exact, even for moving barriers, and for walks with\ncorrelated steps. The conditional distributions yield predictions for the\ndistribution of halo concentrations at fixed mass and formation redshift. They\nalso exhibit assembly bias like effects, even when the steps in the walks\nthemselves are uncorrelated. Finally, we show how the predictions are modified\nif we add the requirement that halos form around peaks: these depend on whether\nthe peaks constraint is applied to a combination of the overdensity and the\nother variable, or to the overdensity alone. Our results demonstrate the power\nof requiring models to reproduce not just halo counts but the distribution of\noverdensities at fixed protohalo mass as well. \n\n"}

This hypothesis leads to testable consequences,\nperhaps portending the discovery of a rich hidden world neighboring our own. We\nconsider a scenario that readily satisfies current bounds that we call\nPartially Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM). This scenario contains\nself-interacting dark matter, but it is not the dominant component. Even if\nPIDM contains only a fraction of the net dark matter density, comparable to the\nbaryonic fraction, the subdominant component's interactions can lead to\ninteresting and potentially observable consequences. Our primary focus will be\nthe special case of Double-Disk Dark Matter (DDDM), in which self-interactions\nallow the dark matter to lose enough energy to lead to dynamics similar to\nthose in the baryonic sector. We explore a simple model in which DDDM can cool\nefficiently and form a disk within galaxies, and we evaluate some of the\npossible observational signatures.

It has been proposed that the temporal coincidence of a gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) and a type Ib/c supernova (SN) can be explained with the concept of\ninduced gravitational collapse (IGC), induced by the matter ejected from an SN\nIb/c accreting onto a neutron star (NS). The NS is expected to reach the\ncritical mass necessary for it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and emit a GRB.\nWe found a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray\nemission of this subclass of GRBs. Aims. We test if this standard behavior in\nthe luminosity found in this subclass of GRBs can become a redshift estimator\nof these sources. Methods. We selected a sample of GRBs that belong to this\nsubclass of IGC GRBs associated to an SN (IGC GRB-SN sources). These sources\nhave an isotropic energy $E_{iso} > 10^{52}$ erg and their cosmological\nredshifts are in the range of $z = 0.49-1.261$. We focused on the corresponding\nX-ray luminosity light curves. Results. We find that all GRBs of the sample\nwith measured redshift present a standard luminosity late-time light curve in\nthe $0.3-10$ keV rest-frame energy range. We used these results to estimate the\nGRB redshift of the sample without a measured redshift and found results\nconsistent with other possible redshift indicators. Conclusions. The standard\nlate-time X-ray luminosity light curve of all GRBs of the sample shows a common\nphysical mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly\nrelated to the creation of the NS from the SN process. This scaling law\nmoreover represents strong evidence of very low or even absent beaming in this\nlate phase of the X-ray afterglow emission process.

This is in reasonable agreement with the early\nbolometric light curve of SN2010ah, but a high abundance of 56Ni at high\nvelocity is required to reproduce the early rise, while a dense inner core must\nbe used to reproduce the slow decline at late phases.

Although these values, in particular the\nkinetic energy, are quite large for a SN Ic, they are all smaller (especially\nthe ejecta mass) than those typical of GRB/SNe.

For the black hole systems we focus on\nthe special case of duplex frequencies, when the top, bottom, or mixed\nfrequency is common at two different radii where the resonances occur giving\ntriple frequency sets. The sets of triple frequency ratios and the related spin\nare given. The strong resonance model for \"magic\" values of the black hole spin\nmeans that two (or more) versions of resonance could occur at the same radius,\nallowing cooperative effects between the resonances.

In this paper we use\nperturbation theory (PT) and halo biasing model and apply it to the\ndistribution function approach to RSD, in which RSD is decomposed into several\ncorrelators of density weighted velocity moments. We model each of these\ncorrelators using PT and compare the results to simulations over a wide range\nof halo masses and redshifts. We find that with an introduction of a physically\nmotivated halo biasing, and using dark matter power spectra from simulations,\nwe can reproduce the simulation results at a percent level on scales up to\nk~0.15h/Mpc at z=0, without the need to have free FoG parameters in the model. \n\n"}

In this paper, we compare the properties of clouds and star-forming\nregions in the MW with those in nearby galaxies and in the high-redshift\nUniverse.

We aim to establish the frequency and properties, unaffected by host\ngalaxy dilution and obscuration, of AGNs in central and satellite galaxy\nmembers, also as a function of halo-centric distance.

Here, we use large hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how\ngalaxy formation affects the autocorrelation functions of galaxies and\nsubhaloes, as well as their cross-correlation with matter. We show that the\nchanges due to the inclusion of baryons are not limited to small scales and are\neven present in samples selected by subhalo mass. Samples selected by subhalo\nmass cluster ~10% more strongly in a baryonic run on scales r > 1Mpc/h, and\nthis difference increases for smaller separations. While the inclusion of\nbaryons boosts the clustering at fixed subhalo mass on all scales, the sign of\nthe effect on the cross-correlation of subhaloes with matter can vary with\nradius.

At all redshifts, Tdust increases with infrared luminosities\n(LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*) and distances with respect to the\nmain sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane (i.e.,\nD_SSFR_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). The Tdust-SSFR and Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelations are statistically more significant than the Tdust-LIR one. While\nthe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their\nnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. We convert these results into a recipe\nto derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z. The existence of a strong Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content of\ngalaxies. (i) The slope of the Tdust-D__SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by\nthe increase of the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with D_SSFR_MS as\nfound locally by molecular gas studies.

A non-linear matter power spectrum interpolator developed\n  using artificial neural networks Abstract: In this paper we introduce PkANN, a freely available software package for\ninterpolating the non-linear matter power spectrum, constructed using\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Previously, using Halofit to calculate\nmatter power spectrum, we demonstrated that ANNs can make extremely quick and\naccurate predictions of the power spectrum. Now, using a suite of 6380 N-body\nsimulations spanning 580 cosmologies, we train ANNs to predict the power\nspectrum over the cosmological parameter space spanning $3\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel (CL) around the concordance cosmology. When presented with a set of\ncosmological parameters ($\\Omega_{\\rm m} h^2, \\Omega_{\\rm b} h^2, n_s, w,\n\\sigma_8, \\sum m_\\nu$ and redshift $z$), the trained ANN interpolates the power\nspectrum for $z\\leq2$ at sub-per cent accuracy for modes up to\n$k\\leq0.9\\,h\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. PkANN is faster than computationally expensive\nN-body simulations, yet provides a worst-case error $<1$ per cent fit to the\nnon-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations.

It has\npreviously been classified as a low-peaked BL Lac object based on its broadband\nemission and the absence of optical emission lines. Optical measurements,\nhowever, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronounced\nshort-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for a\nblazar. We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to\nreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For\nthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its\nspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations\nfrom the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength\ndata in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far. Sparse (u, v)-coverage at 22.3GHz prevents an\nunambiguous modeling of the source morphology.

A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the\nstar-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at\nz~1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale\nof 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a\nredshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation\nrate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7.

Motivations for violations of the notion of\nrelativistic locality include the Bell's inequalities for hidden variable\ntheories, the cosmological horizon problem, and Lorentz-violating approaches to\nquantum geometrodynamics, such as Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Here, we explore a\nrecent proposal for a \"real ensemble\" non-local description of quantum\nmechanics, in which \"particles\" can copy each others' observable values AND\nphases, independent of their spatial separation. We first specify the exact\ntheory, ensuring that it is consistent and has (ordinary) quantum mechanics as\na fixed point, where all particles with the same values for a given observable\nhave the same phases.

In this paper, based on the spectra of\nH$\\alpha$-selected star-forming galaxies at $z=2.5$ taken with Multi-Object\nSpectrometer for InfraRed Exploration (MOSFIRE) on Keck-1 telescope, we measure\nelectron densities ($n_e$) using the oxygen line ratio (\n[OII]$\\lambda\\lambda$3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between the\nelectron density of ionized gas and other physical properties.

The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions.

This problem has been addressed\nalready for the previous generation of radio telescopes, but the application to\nSKA is different in many aspects.\n  In this chapter we summarise the contributions to the field of foreground\nremoval in the context of high redshift and high sensitivity 21-cm\nmeasurements. We use a state-of-the-art simulation of the SKA Phase 1\nobservations complete with cosmological signal, foregrounds and\nfrequency-dependent instrumental effects to test both parametric and\nnon-parametric foreground removal methods. We compare the recovered\ncosmological signal using several different statistics and explore one of the\nmost exciting possibilities with the SKA --- imaging of the ionized bubbles.\n  We find that with current methods it is possible to remove the foregrounds\nwith great accuracy and to get impressive power spectra and images of the\ncosmological signal. The frequency-dependent PSF of the instrument complicates\nthis recovery, so we resort to splitting the observation bandwidth into smaller\nsegments, each of a common resolution.\n  If the foregrounds are allowed a random variation from the smooth power law\nalong the line of sight, methods exploiting the smoothness of foregrounds or a\nparametrization of their behaviour are challenged much more than non-parametric\nones. However, we show that correction techniques can be implemented to restore\nthe performances of parametric approaches, as long as the first-order\napproximation of a power law stands. \n\n"}

The highest measured accretion rates\nfor the objects in this campaign are $\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}\\gtrsim 200$, where\n$\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}= \\dot{M}_{\\bullet}/L_{\\rm Edd}c^{-2}$, $\\dot{M}_{\\bullet}$\nis the mass accretion rates, $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$\nis the speed of light. We find that the H$\\beta$ time lags in SEAMBHs are\nsignificantly shorter than those measured in sub-Eddington AGNs, and the\ndeviations increase with increasing accretion rates. Thus, the relationship\nbetween broad-line region size ($R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}$) and optical luminosity at\n5100\\AA, $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}-L_{5100}$, requires accretion rate as an additional\nparameter. We propose that much of the effect may be due to the strong\nanisotropy of the emitted slim-disk radiation. Scaling $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}$ by\nthe gravitational radius of the black hole, we define a new radius-mass\nparameter ($Y$) and show that it saturates at a critical accretion rate of\n$\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}_c=6\\sim 30$, indicating a transition from thin to slim\naccretion disk and a saturated luminosity of the slim disks. The parameter $Y$\nis a very useful probe for understanding the various types of accretion onto\nmassive black holes. We briefly comment on implications to the general\npopulation of super-Eddington AGNs in the universe and applications to\ncosmology. \n\n"}

The fraction (f_SF) of star-forming cluster galaxies rises steadily\nwith cluster-centric radius, increasing fivefold by 2r200, but remains well\nbelow field values even at 3r200. This suppression of star formation at large\nradii cannot be reproduced by models in which star formation is quenched in\ninfalling field galaxies only once they pass within r200 of the cluster, but is\nconsistent with some of them being first pre-processed within galaxy groups.\nDespite the increasing f_SF-radius trend, the surface density of star-forming\ngalaxies actually declines steadily with radius, falling ~15x from the core to\n2r200. This requires star-formation to survive within recently accreted spirals\nfor 2--3Gyr to build up the apparent over-density of star-forming galaxies\nwithin clusters. The velocity dispersion profile of the star-forming galaxy\npopulation shows a sharp peak of 1.44-sigma_v at 0.3r500, and is 10--35% higher\nthan that of the inactive cluster members at all cluster-centric radii, while\ntheir velocity distribution shows a flat, top-hat profile within r500.

The 143GHz channel has the lowest noise level on\nPlanck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. In this\npaper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 Planck data. We\nconcentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143GHz channel maps and power\nspectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acoustic\npeaks, on maps masked for diffuse Galactic emission and for strong unresolved\nsources. Difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin are\nconsistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave background\nstructure. Including small but important corrections for unresolved-source\nresiduals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100GHz power spectra\naveraged over 70<l<390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100GHz\npower spectra of 0.4% over the same l range.

Since the inflaton quartic coupling is very small, once\nquantum corrections through the gauge and Yukawa interactions are taken into\naccount, the inflaton effective potential most likely becomes unstable. In\norder to avoid this problem, we need to impose stability conditions on the\neffective inflaton potential, which lead to not only non-trivial relations\namongst the particle mass spectrum of the model, but also correlations between\nthe inflationary predictions and the mass spectrum. For concrete discussion, we\ninvestigate the minimal $B-L$ extension of the Standard Model with\nidentification of the $B-L$ Higgs field as inflaton.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

Previous timing analysis of the Swift data of NGC 5408 X-1 led to\ndetection of multiple periodicities ranging from 2.6 d to 230 d. In this paper,\nwe focus on the statistical significance and the temporal evolution of these\nperiodicities.\n  Methods. A time-series analysis technique in the time-frequency domain, the\nweighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), was employed to identify the periodicities\nand trace their variations with time.\n  Results. Three periodic components were detected from the WWZ periodogram,\ncorresponding to periods of 2.65$\\pm$0.01 d, 115.4$\\pm$14.4 d and\n189.1$\\pm$15.2 d. All three have statistical significance higher than 99.74%.\nThe 2.65-d periodicity is quite stable in the majority of the light curve.

When the shear reverses, the shearing\naway of this firehose turbulence compensates for the increase in the mean field\nand thus prevents growth of the pressure anisotropy, stopping the system from\ngoing mirror-unstable. Therefore, at ultra-high beta, the system stays close to\nthe firehose threshold, the mirror instability is largely suppressed, while the\nmean magnetic energy barely changes at all. Implications for plasma dynamo and\nthus the origin of cosmic magnetism are discussed. \n\n"}

It is therefore crucial to obtain\nmeasurements of the accelerated expansion of the Universe independently of\nassumptions on cosmological models. Here we exploit the unprecedented\nstatistics provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data\nRelease 9 to provide new constraints on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using the\nem cosmic chronometers approach.

The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are\nquantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat\nspace-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling\nconstants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects\nmight dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at\nleast up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial\nconditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always\npossible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy\nsolution approaches stably the tracker at late times.

We aim at constraining\n$F_{\\rm max}$ by adopting a broken power-law flux distribution, a hypothesis\nsupported by observed properties of any generic astrophysical sources. The\nfirst estimate of $F_{\\rm max}$ comes from the fact that we can only observe\none universe, and hence, the expected number of sources above $F_{\\rm max}$\ncannot be too small compared with one. For abundant source classes such as\nstarburst galaxies, this one-source constraint yields a value of $F_{\\rm max}$\nthat is an order of magnitude lower than the current upper limits from\npoint-source searches.

In this paper we give a comprehensive description of the\nphysical and numerical advances which form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The\nNext Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the\ngalactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal\ncontent, and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population.\nAs described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black hole driven\nkinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics, and improvements\nto the numerical scheme.

The core science driver is mapping the\nlarge-scale matter distribution in the Universe, using weak lensing shear and\nphotometric redshift measurements. Further science cases include galaxy\nevolution, Milky Way structure, detection of high-redshift clusters, and\nfinding rare sources such as strong lenses and quasars. Here we present the\nthird public data release (DR3) and several associated data products, adding\nfurther area, homogenized photometric calibration, photometric redshifts and\nweak lensing shear measurements to the first two releases. A dedicated pipeline\nembedded in the Astro-WISE information system is used for the production of the\nmain release. Modifications with respect to earlier releases are described in\ndetail. Photometric redshifts have been derived using both Bayesian template\nfitting, and machine-learning techniques. For the weak lensing measurements,\noptimized procedures based on the THELI data reduction and lensfit shear\nmeasurement packages are used. In DR3 stacked ugri images, weight maps, masks,\nand source lists for 292 new survey tiles (~300 sq.deg) are made available.

These events are separated in time by about 104 ks,\nwhich likely corresponds to the rotational period of the star (1.2 days). Time\nresolved spectroscopy of the X-ray spectra shows that the first event is caused\nby an increase of the plasma emission measure, while the second increase of\nrate is a major flare with temperatures in excess of 60 MK ($kT\\sim5$ keV).\nFrom the analysis of its rise, we infer a magnetic field of $\\ge300$ G and a\nsize of the flaring region of $\\sim1.4-1.9\\times10^{11}$ cm, which corresponds\nto $\\sim25\\%-30\\%$ of the stellar radius.

The\ntensor perturbations generated by the quadratic combination of linear\nscalar-type cosmological perturbation are widely studied in the literature, but\nall previous studies are based on zero-shear gauge without proper\njustification.

This\ncoupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation,\nespecially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological\nconsequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally\nhelical.

For another thing, the gauge field production during\ninflation feeds back into the primordial tensor power spectrum, leaving an\nimprint in the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this\npaper, we focus on the correlation between these two phenomena. Working in the\napproximation of instant reheating, we (1) update the investigation of\nbaryogenesis via hypermagnetic fields from pseudoscalar inflation and (2)\nexamine the corresponding implications for the GW spectrum. We find that\nsuccessful baryogenesis requires a suppression scale Lambda of around Lambda ~\n3 x 10^17 GeV, which corresponds to a relatively weakly coupled axion.

However, this is not possible with all directional detection\ntechnologies. In nuclear emulsions, for example, the recoil events must be\ndetected and measured after the exposure time of the experiment. Unless the\nentire detector is mounted and rotated with the sidereal day, the recoils\ncannot be reoriented in the Galactic rest frame. We examine the effect of this\n`time integration' on the primary goals of directional detection, namely: (1)\nconfirming that the recoils are anisotropic; (2) measuring the median recoil\ndirection to confirm their Galactic origin; and (3) probing below the neutrino\nfloor. We show that after time integration the DM recoil distribution retains a\npreferred direction and is distinct from that of Solar neutrino-induced\nrecoils. Many of the advantages of directional detection are therefore\npreserved and it is not crucial to mount and rotate the detector. Rejecting\nisotropic backgrounds requires a factor of 2 more signal events compared with\nan experiment with event time information, whereas a factor of 1.5-3 more\nevents are needed to measure a median direction in agreement with the\nexpectation for DM. We also find that there is still effectively no neutrino\nfloor in a time-integrated directional experiment. However to reach a cross\nsection an order of magnitude below the floor, a factor of 8 larger exposure is\nrequired than with a conventional directional experiment. We also examine how\nthe sensitivity is affected for detectors with only 2D recoil track readout,\nand/or no head-tail measurement. As for non-time-integrated experiments, 2D\nreadout is not a major disadvantage, though a lack of head-tail sensitivity is. \n\n"}

To understand how black hole mass affects the duration of\nsuper-Eddington accretion in tidal disruption events, we first run a suite of\nsimulations of the disruption of a Solar-like star by a supermassive black hole\nof varying mass to directly measure the fallback rate onto the hole, and we\ncompare these fallback rates to the analytic predictions of the \"frozen-in\"\nmodel.

The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a\nnovel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme\nconditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial,\nminimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on\nthe tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to\nconstraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by\nworking under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are\ndescribed by the same equation of state and have spins within the range\nobserved in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods:\nthe use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic\nproperties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of\nthe defining function $p(\\rho)$ of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO\nand Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star\nradii as $R_1=10.8^{+2.0}_{-1.7}$ km for the heavier star and $R_2=\n10.7^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$ km for the lighter star at the 90% credible level.

We show that this assumption is incorrect when the energy is injected\nin the form of energetic (i.e. energy much greater than the background CMB\ntemperature) particles. We evolve the electromagnetic cascades, from the\ninjection of high energy particles, in the expanding Universe and follow the\nnon-thermal component of CMB spectral distortions resulting from the\ninteraction of the electromagnetic shower with the background photons,\nelectrons, and ions. The electromagnetic shower loses a substantial fraction of\nits energy to the CMB spectral distortions before the energy of the particles\nin the shower has degraded to low enough energies that they can thermalize with\nthe background plasma. This spectral distortion is the result of the\ninteraction of non-thermal energetic electrons in the shower with the CMB and\nthus has a shape that is substantially different from the $y$-type or $i$-type\ndistortions. The shape of the final \\emph{non-thermal relativistic}\n($ntr$-type) CMB spectral distortion depends upon the initial energy spectrum\nof the injected electrons, positrons, and photons and thus has information\nabout the energy injection mechanism e.g. the decay or annihilation channel of\nthe decaying or annihilating dark matter particles.

The acceleration is the essential non-collective\nmany-body relaxation process. However, existing works have never detailed the\n`discreteness' stochastic acceleration and the corresponding mathematical\nmodel, i.e., the generalized-Landau (g-Landau) kinetic equation for the stellar\ndistribution function.

As these objects pass through the Solar\nsystem, they perturb gravitationally, and thus very weakly, all nearby inertial\nmasses. Making use of this, we propose an approach to the direct detection of\ndark matter at previously inaccessible intermediate masses (1e14 -- 1e20 gm).\nSuch mass scales are relevant for example for dark matter made of primordial\nblack holes or clumped matter in a sequestered sector. If such dark matter\nexists it will be unambiguously detectable through its inelastic gravitational\ninteraction with the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)\nexperiment. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by studying the dark\nmatter signal in numerical simulations of the LISA data stream. A more\nconservative approach -- to detect dark matter in the differential acceleration\npower spectrum -- significantly underestimates the expected rates for LISA.\nInterestingly, while the space-density of 1e15 gm DM objects would be\ncomparable to the space-density of asteroids of similar masses, such ``light\nmatter'' contaminants are readily detectable in reflected Solar light, allowing\nfor the elimination of the major background. \n\n"}

The former contain\nmatter in one of the densest forms found in the Universe which, together with\nthe unprecedented progress in observational astronomy, make such stars superb\nastrophysical laboratories for a broad range of most striking physical\nphenomena. These range from nuclear processes on the stellar surface to\nprocesses in electron degenerate matter at subnuclear densities to boson\ncondensates and the existence of new states of baryonic matter--like color\nsuperconducting quark matter--at supernuclear densities. More than that,\naccording to the strange matter hypothesis strange quark matter could be more\nstable than nuclear matter, in which case neutron stars should be largely\ncomposed of pure quark matter possibly enveloped in thin nuclear crusts.\nAnother remarkable implication of the hypothesis is the possible existence of a\nnew class of white dwarfs.

Our\naim here is to intercompare the results obtained using a variety of commonly\nused modelling techniques, specifically with respect to our own extensively\ntested multi-dimensional approach. Any significant differences among the\nresulting parameters are due to the details of the various, independently\ndeveloped modelling techniques used, rather than to the stellar population\nmodels themselves. Despite the model uncertainties and the selection effects\ninherent to most methods used, we find that the PEAKS in the relative age and\nmass distributions of a given young (<= 10^9 yr) cluster system can be derived\nrelatively robustly and consistently, to accuracies of sigma_t = Delta <log(Age\n/ yr)> <= 0.35 and sigma_M = Delta <log(M_cl / Msun)> <= 0.14, respectively,\nassuming Gaussian distributions in cluster ages and masses for reasons of\nsimplicity.

Unless of course we would like to assume that\nour local region of space is in some way peculiar for which there is no\nevidence. In other words, if we are able to determine accurate star formation\nhistories for the nearby galaxies back to the ages of the oldest globular\nclusters then we will also obtain a representative picture of how galaxies have\nevolved from the earliest times, and predict what nearby galaxies looked like\nat intermediate and high redshifts.\n  Deep, precision, multi-colour photometry of resolved stellar populations in\nexternal galaxies can uniquely determine the star formation histories of nearby\ngalaxies going back many Gyrs.

The presence of an effective\nnonzero time derivative of the scalar field leads to $CPT$ violation so that\nthe lepton asymmetry can be generated even in thermal equilibrium as pointed\nout by Cohen and Kaplan. In this model, the lepton asymmetry varies with time.\nIn particular, we consider the case where it grows with time. The final lepton\nasymmetry is determined by the decoupling of the lepton number violating\ninteraction and can be as large as order unity. On the other hand, if the\ndecoupling takes place after the electroweak phase transition, a small baryon\nasymmetry is obtained from the small lepton asymmetry at that time through\nsphaleron effects. We construct a model in which a rolling scalar field is\nidentified with a quintessence field. \n\n"}
