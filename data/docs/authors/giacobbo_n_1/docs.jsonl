These INSs (RX J0420.0-5022, RX J0806.4-4123, and\nRX J1308.6+2127) either lack an optical counterpart or have one so faint that\nground based or space born optical observations push the current possibilities\nof the instrumentation to the limit. Pairs of ACIS observations were acquired 3\nto 5 years apart to measure the displacement of the sources on the X-ray sky\nusing as reference the background of extragalactic or remote Galactic X-ray\nsources. We derive 2 sigma upper limits of 123 mas/yr and 86 mas/yr on the\nproper motion of RX J0420.0-5022 and RX J0806.4-4123, respectively. RX\nJ1308.6+2127 exhibits a very significant displacement (~ 9 sigma) yielding mu =\n220 +/- 25 mas/yr, the second fastest measured among all ROSAT discovered INSs.\nThe source is probably moving away rapidly from the Galactic plane at a speed\nwhich precludes any significant accretion of matter from the interstellar\nmedium. Its transverse velocity of ~ 740 (d/700pc) km/s might be the largest of\nall ROSAT INSs and its corresponding spatial velocity stands among the fastest\nrecorded for neutron stars. RX J1308.6+2127 is thus a middle-aged (age ~ 1 My)\nhigh velocity cooling neutron star. We investigate its possible origin in\nnearby OB associations or from a field OB star. In most cases, the flight time\nfrom birth place appears significantly shorter than the characteristic age\nderived from spin down rate.

Despite the early comprehension of the\nbasic emission mechanism, their spectral energy distribution is generally\ndescribed by phenomenological or simplified models. We propose a study of the\nspectral emission from the high mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0115+634 by means\nof thermal and bulk Comptonization models based on the physical properties of\nsuch objects. For this purpose, we analyze the BeppoSAX data in the energy\nrange 0.7-100 keV of the 1999 giant outburst, 12 days after the maximum. We\nmodel the spectral energy distribution of the system using a two-component\ncontinuum. At higher energy, above ~7 keV, the emission is due to thermal and\nbulk Comptonization of the seed photons produced by cyclotron cooling of the\naccretion column, and at lower energy, the emission is due to thermal\nComptonization of a blackbody source in a diffuse halo close to the stellar\nsurface. From the best fit parameters, we argue that the cyclotron emission is\nproduced ~1.7 km above the stellar surface, and escapes from the column near\nits base, where the absorption features are generated by the interaction with\nthe magnetic field in a surrounding halo.

SN2006gy can be interpreted in the\ncontext of shock interaction with a dense CSM, but with quite extreme values\nfor the CSM mass of 20 Msun and an explosion kinetic energy of at least 5e51\nerg. A key difference between SN2006gy and other SNeIIn is that, owing to its\nlarge CSM mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. At early\ntimes, H-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, and\nphotons diffuse out through the opaque CSM. The pivotal transition to optically\nthin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in the\nblackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell. From the\nevolution of pre-shock velocities, we deduce that the CSM was ejected by the\nprogenitor in a 1e49 erg precursor event 8yr before explosion.

Furthermore, the spectrum shows strong, broad\nemission features at 8 and 12 micron that are observed in Galactic carbon-rich\nproto-planetary nebulae. Combining these data with published optical and\nnear-IR photometry obtained at the same epoch, we find that the mid-IR excess\ntraced by the Spitzer spectrum accounts for ~20% of the total energy output.\nThis component can be well explained by emission from ~3x10^-4 Msun of\npre-existing progenitor dust at temperature ~400 K. The spectral energy\ndistribution of the transient also shows a near-IR excess that can be explained\nby emission from newly-formed dust in the ejecta.

The hardness-intensity diagram of all RXTE/PCA data\ncombined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.\nThe evolution through the HID suggests that in the early phase of the outburst\nthe source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the soft\nstate, which is supported by our timing analysis. Broadband (4-200 keV)\nspectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard\nspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft\nstate. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during\nthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the\nsoftening in the hard intermediate state.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303.

Such global\nCompton scattering has previously been shown to be important for the dynamics\nof accretion flows. Here, we extend previous treatments of this problem by\nusing accurate global general relativistic Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on\nan inner region of the accretion flow (R < 600R_g), for which we obtain a\nglobal self-consistent solution. As compared to the initial, not\nself-consistent solution, the final solution has both the cooling rate and the\nelectron temperature significantly reduced at radii >=10 gravitational radii.\nOn the other hand, the radiation spectrum of the self-consistent solution has\nthe shape similar to that of the initial iteration, except for the high-energy\ncut-off being at an energy lower by a factor of ~2 and the bolometric\nluminosity decreased by a factor of ~2.

Still, neither local model gives a good approximation to the\nradial profile of the cooling rate, and the differences can be up to two orders\nof magnitude. The local slab model underestimates the cooling rate at outer\nregions whereas it overestimates that rate at inner regions.

In the collapsar\nmodel for LGRBs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launching\nfrom the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of the\ncollapse of a rotating progenitor star. The jet is collimated along the star's\nrotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should be\nrelatively--though certainly not entirely--spherical, and should synthesize a\nsubstantial mass of 56Ni. Our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment of\nthe possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole,\nwhich powers the LGRB, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass in\nthe envelope to produce a luminous supernova. For this, the energy dissipated\nnear the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it can\ndrive a supernova-like shockwave. Here we suggest that the energy is\ntransported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying on\nglobal mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. The\nmodel suggests that a ~10,000 km/s shock can be driven into the envelope and\nthat ~10^51 erg explosions are possible. The efficiency with which the\naccretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by the\ncompetition of advection and convection at distances ~100-1,000 km from the\nblack hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, the\nmagnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum of\nthe infalling envelope. Substantial masses of 56Ni may be synthesized in the\nconvective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initial\ncircularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole.

We focus on\ncompact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a cold\ndegenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of such\nsystems. A fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realistic\nWDNS head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical time\nscales and length scales involved.

We call these scaled-down WD models\n\"pseudo-WDs (pWDs)\". Using pWDs, we can study these systems via a sequence of\nsimulations where the size of the pWD gradually increases toward the realistic\ncase. We perform two sets of simulations; One set studies the effects of the NS\nmass on the final outcome, when the pWD is kept fixed.

Abstract: We show that a relativistic gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet can potentially pierce\nthe envelope of very massive first generation star (Population III; Pop III) by\nusing the stellar density profile to estimate both the jet luminosity (via\naccretion) and its penetrability. The jet breakout is possible even if the Pop\nIII star has a supergiant hydrogen envelope without mass loss, thanks to the\nlong-lived powerful accretion of the envelope itself. While the Pop III GRB is\nestimated to be energetic, E_{gamma,iso} ~ 10^{55} erg, the supergiant envelope\nhides the initial bright phase into the cocoon component, leading to a GRB with\na long duration ~ 1000(1+z) sec and an ordinary isotropic luminosity ~ 10^{52}\nerg s^{-1} (~ 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} at redshift z ~ 20). The\nneutrino-annihilation is not effective for Pop III GRBs because of a low\ncentral temperature, while the magnetic mechanism is viable. We also derive\nanalytic estimates of the breakout conditions, which are applicable to various\nprogenitor models. The GRB luminosity and duration are found to be very\nsensitive to the core and envelope mass, providing possible probes of the first\nluminous objects at the end of the high redshift dark ages. \n\n"}

It is timely to\nreinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties\nwhich are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions.

Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray\npropagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,\nthe Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution\ncan also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species\nthroughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone\ndiffusion/convection model.

Unlike supermassive black holes,\nthe spin of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems is little affected\nby accretion, and accurately reflects the spin set at birth. A modest number of\nstellar-mass black hole angular momenta have now been measured using two\nindependent X-ray spectroscopic techniques. In contrast, rotation-powered\npulsars spin-down over time, via magnetic braking, but a modest number of natal\nspin periods have now been estimated. For both canonical and extreme neutron\nstar parameters, statistical tests strongly suggest that the angular momentum\ndistributions of black holes and neutron stars are markedly different. Within\nthe context of prevalent models for core-collapse supernovae, the angular\nmomentum distributions are consistent with black holes typically being produced\nin GRB-like supernovae with jets, and with neutron stars typically being\nproduced in supernovae with too little angular momentum to produce jets via\nmagnetohydrodynamic processes.

We solve the\none-dimensional steady-state accretion problem between the PNS surface and the\naccretion shock. We quantify the deep connection between the solution space of\nsteady-state accretion flows with bounding shocks and the neutrino mechanism.\nWe show that there is a maximum, critical sound speed above which it is\nimpossible to maintain accretion with a standoff shock, because the shock jump\nconditions cannot be satisfied. The physics of this critical sound speed is\ngeneral and does not depend on a specific heating mechanism. For the simple\nmodel of pressure-less free-fall onto a shock bounding an isothermal accretion\nflow with sound speed c_T, we show that if c_T^2/v_escape^2 > 3/16 explosion\nresults. We generalize this result to the more complete supernova problem,\nshowing explicitly that the same physics determines L_crit.

This raises the\nquestion of how heat is generated and how energy is transported in MHD\nturbulence. By analysis of a number of radiation/MHD stratified shearing-box\nsimulations, we show that the divergence of the diffusive radiation flux is\nindeed capped at the critical rate, but deep inside the disk, substantial\nvertical energy flux is also carried by advection of radiation. Work done by\nradiation pressure is a significant part of the energy budget, and much of this\nwork is dissipated later through damping by radiative diffusion. We show how\nthis damping can be measured in the simulations, and identify its physical\norigins. Radiative damping accounts for as much as tens of percent of the total\ndissipation, and is the only realistic physical mechanism for dissipation of\nturbulence that can actually be resolved in numerical simulations of accretion\ndisks. Buoyancy associated with dynamo-driven, highly magnetized,\nnearly-isobaric nonlinear slow magnetosonic fluctuations is responsible for the\nradiation advection flux, and also explains the persistent periodic magnetic\nupwelling seen at all values of the radiation to gas pressure ratio.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

We\nwant to outline a coherent description of Tycho's properties in terms of SNR\nevolution, shock hydrodynamics and multi-wavelength emission by accounting for\nparticle acceleration at the forward shock via first order Fermi mechanism.

The absorption of electron-type\nneutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the\n\"neutrino mechanism\"). Because the heating rate is proportional to the square\nof neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-type\nneutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (CnuO) may in principle increase\nthe heating rate and drive explosions. In order to assess the potential\nimportance of CnuO for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundary\nvalue problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the PNS surface (r_nu)\nand the shock (r_S), including a scheme for flavor conversion via CnuO. For a\ngiven r_nu, PNS mass (M), accretion rate (Mdot), and assumed values of the\nneutrino energies from the PNS, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosity\nabove which accretion is impossible and explosion results. We show that CnuO\ncan decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only if\nthe flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_S and if there is no matter\nsuppression. The magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (M,\nMdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavor\nconversion. We quantify these dependencies and find that CnuO could lower the\ncritical luminosity only for small M and Mdot, and large r_nu. However, for\nthese parameter values CnuO are suppressed due to matter effects. By\nquantifying the importance of CnuO and matter suppression at the critical\nneutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studies\nthat CnuO are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse\nsupernovae significantly. \n\n"}

Due to heating during the dynamical and viscous\nphases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, and\nradially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.\n  Following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near the\nenvelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convective\ncarbon-burning. If not, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the inner region of the\nenvelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of the\nenvelope, again yielding off-center burning. As a result, the long-term\nevolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous\ncalculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventually\nyielding a high-mass O/Ne WD or a collapse to a neutron star. During the\ncooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near the\nEddington limit.

The remnant is composed of a central pulsar wind nebula and a\nbright partial shell in the south that is visible at radio, IR, and X-ray\nwavelengths. The X-ray emission can be modeled by either a single thermal\ncomponent with a temperature of ~ 1.5 keV, or with two thermal components with\ntemperatures of 1.5 and 0.2 keV. Previous studies suggest that the hot\ncomponent may originate from reverse-shocked SN ejecta. However, our new\nanalysis shows no definitive evidence for enhanced abundances of Si, S, Ar, Mg,\nand Fe, as expected from supernova (SN) ejecta, or for the IR spectral\nsignatures characteristic of confirmed SN condensed dust, thus favoring a\ncircumstellar or interstellar origin for the X-ray and IR emission. The X-ray\nand IR emission in the shell are spatially correlated, suggesting that the dust\nparticles are collisionally heated by the X-ray emitting gas. The IR spectrum\nof the shell is dominated by continuum emission from dust with little, or no\nline emission. Modeling the IR spectrum shows that the dust is heated to a\ntemperature of ~ 140 K by a relatively dense, hot plasma, that also gives rise\nto the hot X-ray emission component. The density inferred from the IR emission\nis significantly higher than the density inferred from the X-ray models,\nsuggesting a low filling factor for this X-ray emitting gas. The total mass of\nthe warm dust component is at least 0.013 solar masses, assuming no significant\ndust destruction has occurred in the shell.

While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN.

We review the relative\nmerits of different acceleration models, in particular the so called first\norder Fermi acceleration by shocks and second order Fermi by stochastic\nprocesses, and point out that plasma waves or turbulence play an important role\nin all mechanisms of acceleration. Thus, stochastic acceleration by turbulence\nis active in most situations. We also show that it is the most efficient\nmechanism of acceleration of relatively cool non relativistic thermal\nbackground plasma particles. In addition, it can preferentially accelerate\nelectrons relative to protons as is needed in many astrophysical radiating\nsources, where usually there are no indications of presence of shocks.

These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and\ndestruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives\nsuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind\nmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher\npost-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. Strong AGN feedback is\nrequired to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. We compare the\npredicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disk\nsurvival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve GMCs or feedback.\nGlobal galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and star\nformation rates can differ significantly. \n\n"}

For ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), the mass transfer rate is\nexpected to be a strong function of orbital period, predicting persistent\nsources at short periods and transients at long periods. Aims. For 14 UCXBs\nincluding two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average\nluminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to\nbe visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities\nwith the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky\nMonitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,\ni.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,\ninformation can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data\npoints or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the\ntime-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show\nthe fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs\nshow significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the\ntime-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period\nlonger than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the\nstatistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and\ntransient sources. UCXBs with a period below ~30 min have a time-averaged\nbolometric luminosity that is in reasonable agreement with estimates based on\nthe theoretical mass transfer rate. Around 40 min the lower bound on the\ntime-averaged luminosity is similar to the luminosity based on the theoretical\nmass transfer rate, suggesting these sources are indeed faint when not\ndetected.

However, much less is known about the content and physical status of\nthe hot X-ray gas in low-mass ellipticals. In the present paper we study the\nX-ray gas content of four low-mass elliptical galaxies using archival Chandra\nX-ray observations. The sample galaxies, NGC821, NGC3379, NGC4278, and NGC4697,\nhave approximately identical K-band luminosities, and hence stellar masses, yet\ntheir X-ray appearance is strikingly different. We conclude that the unresolved\nemission in NGC821 and NGC3379 is built up from a multitude of faint compact\nobjects, such as coronally active binaries and cataclysmic variables. Despite\nthe non-detection of X-ray gas, these galaxies may host low density, and hence\nlow luminosity, X-ray gas components, which undergo a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)\ndriven outflow. We detect hot X-ray gas with a temperature of kT ~ 0.35 keV in\nNGC4278, the component of which has a steeper surface brightness distribution\nthan the stellar light. Within the central 50 arcsec (~3.9 kpc) the estimated\ngas mass is ~3 x 10^7 M_sun, implying a gas mass fraction of ~0.06%. We\ndemonstrate that the X-ray gas exhibits a bipolar morphology in the\nnortheast-southwest direction, indicating that it may be outflowing from the\ngalaxy. The mass and energy budget of the outflow can be maintained by evolved\nstars and SNe Ia, respectively. The X-ray gas in NGC4697 has an average\ntemperature of kT ~ 0.3 keV, and a significantly broader distribution than the\nstellar light.

Ultra-violet (UV) emission from a quasar is normally\nfree from the contamination from its host galaxy. Polarization fraction of the\nquasar's disc emission can therefore be determined by comparing total UV\nemission with polarized visible to near-infrared (NIR) emission; and the\nresulting continuum spectrum from UV to infrared can reveal the theoretically\nexpected Balmer edge absorption feature. We fit the polarized spectra in\nvisible and NIR bands together with the total UV spectra of two type-1 quasars\n(3C 95, 4C 09.72), to an extended geometrically thin and optically thick\naccretion disc model. In addition to the standard model, we include the Balmer\nedge absorption due to co-rotational neutral gas on a narrow annulus of the\naccretion disc. We find that the extended thin accretion disc model provides\nadequate description on the continuum spectra of the two quasars from UV to NIR\nwavelengths. A Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain fitting to the continuum spectra is\nable to well constrain the true polarization fraction of the disk emission,\nwhich allows the Balmer edge feature to be completely revealed from polarized\nvisible to UV continua. The Balmer edge feature is prominent in both quasars'\nspectra, and is significantly broadened due to the orbital motion of gas in the\naccretion disc. The broadening of the Balmer edge feature is therefore related\nto the quasar's inclination. This work proves the concept of determining\nquasar's inclination from the Balmer edge feature in their continuum spectra. \n\n"}

Impacts of the EOS on the\npost-bounce hydrodynamics are more clearly visible in 2D simulations. In 2D\nmodels of a 15 M_sun progenitor using the LS EOS, the stalled bounce shock\nexpands to increasingly larger radii, which is not the case using the SHEN EOS.\nKeeping in mind that the omission of the energy drain by heavy-lepton neutrinos\nin the present scheme could facilitate explosions, we find that 2D models of an\n11.2 M_sun progenitor produce neutrino-driven explosions for all the EOS under\ninvestigation. Models using the LS EOS are slightly more energetic compared to\nthose with the SHEN EOS.

For\nthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni\nprofiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after the plateau has ended,\nthe SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden\ntransitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum. At this stage,\nthe light curve exhibits a low luminosity that is comparable to that\nsub-luminous Type II-P supernovae, and a relatively fast visual-wavelength\ndecline that is significantly steeper than the Co-56 decay rate. However, the\ntotal bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56\ndecay, and implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun).

One such case was SN 2009ip, which was recognized to\nbe a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption. This source had a massive hot\nprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence of\npre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd\noutburst in 2010. This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early\nspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting another\nLBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2009ip,\nindicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days. The broad\nlines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the early\noptically thick phases of SNe IIn. Two weeks later the source leveled off near\n-18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum as\nthe source faded. We conclude that the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip was the\nresult of a true core-collapse SN IIn that occured when the progenitor star was\nin an LBV-like outburst phase, and where the SN was initially faint and then\nrapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged). \n\n"}

Abstract: The lightcurve of the explosion of a star with a radius <10-100Rsun is\npowered mostly by radioactive decay. Observationally such events are dominated\nby hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae: white\ndwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia) and core collapses of\nhydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ibc). Transient surveys are finding SNe I\nin increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be\nstudied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize\nthe physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observations\ncan be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered\nlightcurves probe the shallowest 56Ni deposits. If the amount of 56Ni mixing\ncan be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties of\nthe explosive burning. In practice we find it is difficult to disentangle\nwhether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56Ni heating near the\nsurface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56Ni heating is deeper.\nIn the latter case there is a \"dark phase\" between the moment of explosion and\nthe first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56Ni. Because of this,\nsimply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56Ni back in time is not a reliable\nmethod for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly\nidentify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout or\nshock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the rising\nlightcurve is known. Since this is typically not available, we identify other\ndiagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion\noccurred. As an example we apply these arguments to the SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We\ndemonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and\ntemperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,\nand 56Ni mixing. \n\n"}

Nevertheless, the detection of\nsuch events has so far evaded discovery, likely because the optical,\nsupernova-like emission is expected to be dim and short-lived.

In this paper (Paper II of the series) and the\ncompanion paper (Paper III of the series), we consider low-mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs), whose evolutionary scenario is very different from that of HMXBs. In\nthis paper, we consider the evolution of primordial binaries upto the stage\nwhere the neutron star just formed in the supernova explosion of the primary is\nin a binary with its low-mass unevolved companion, and this binary has\ncircularized tidally, producing what we call a pre-low-mass X-ray binary\n(pre-LMXB). We study the constraints on the formation of such pre-LMXBs in\ndetail (since these are low probability events), and calculate their collective\nproperties and formation rate. To this end, we first consider the changes in\nthe binary parameters in the various steps involved, viz., the common-envelope\n(CE) phase, the supernova, and the tidal evolution. This naturally leads to a\nclarification of the constraints. We then describe our calculation of the\nevolution of the distributions of primordial binary parameters into those of\nthe pre-LMXB parameters, following the standard evolutionary scenario for\nindividual binaries.

Equally important, the SED is\nunusually red for a SLSN, with a color temperature of 6800 K near maximum\nlight, in contrast to previous H-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the UV. The\nspectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with\na photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in the\nrest-frame UV.

We examine the influence of the X-rays from the\nwind-wind collision shocks on the radiative driving of the stellar winds using\nsteady state models that include a parameterized line force with X-ray\nionization dependence. Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations. Due to the feedback loop between\nthe ionizing X-rays from the shocks and the wind-driving, we term this scenario\nas self regulated shocks. This effect is found to greatly increase the range of\nbinary separations at which a wind-photosphere collision is likely to occur in\nsystems where the momenta of the two winds are significantly different.\nFurthermore, the excessive levels of X-ray ionization close to the shocks\ncompletely suppresses the line force, and we suggest that this may render\nradiative braking less effective. Comparisons of model results against\nobservations reveals reasonable agreement in terms of log(LX/Lbol). The\ninclusion of self regulated shocks improves the match for kT values in roughly\nequal wind momenta systems, but there is a systematic offset for systems with\nunequal wind momenta (if considered to be a wind-photosphere collision). \n\n"}

One way\nto distinguish between the SDS and the double-degenerate scenario is to search\nfor the post-impact remnant stars (PIRSs) in SN Ia remnants.

We show that interpreting\nthe diffuse cosmic radio background (CRB) as arising from radio sources with\ncharacteristics similar to the observed cores and radio lobes in powerful AGN\njets suggests that the intergalactic positron-to-electron ratio could be as\nhigh as 10^{-5}, although this can be decreased if the CRB is not all produced\nby pairs and if not all positrons escape to the intergalactic medium. Assuming\nan accretion rate of one solar mass per year of matter into the Milky Way, a\npositron-to-electron ratio of only 10^{-7} is already enough to account for\nmuch of the 511 keV emission of the Galaxy. A simple spherical accretion model\npredicts an emission profile highly peaked in the central bulge, consistent\nwith INTEGRAL observations.

However, our simulations show that $\\nu$ and\n$\\dot\\nu$ obtained this way are systematically biased, unless the time\nintervals between the nearby data points of TOAs are smaller than about $10^4$\ns, which is much shorter than typical observation intervals. Alternatively,\nglitch parameters can be obtained by fitting the phases directly with\nrelatively smaller biases; but the initial recovery timescale is usually chosen\nby eyes, which may introduce a strong bias. We also construct a\nphenomenological model by assuming a pulsar's spin-down law of $\\dot\\nu\\nu^{-3}\n=-H_0 G(t)$ with $G(t)=1+\\kappa e^{-t/\\tau}$ for a glitch recovery, where $H_0$\nis a constant and $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ are the glitch parameters to be found.\nThis model can reproduce the observed data of slow glitches from B1822--09 and\na giant classical glitch of B2334+61, with $\\kappa<0$ or $\\kappa>0$,\nrespectively. We then use this model to simulate TOA data and test several\nfitting procedures for a glitch recovery.

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise. It has been\nproposed, however, that secondary positrons could be produced and then\naccelerated in nearby supernova remnants, potentially explaining the observed\nrise, without the need of primary positron sources. Yet, if secondary positrons\nare accelerated in such shocks, other secondary cosmic ray species (such as\nboron nuclei, and antiprotons) will also be accelerated, leading to rises in\nthe boron-to-carbon and antiproton-to-proton ratios. The measurements of the\nboron-to-carbon ratio by the PAMELA and AMS collaborations, however, show no\nsign of such a rise. With this new data in hand, we revisit the secondary\nacceleration scenario for the rising positron fraction. Assuming that the same\nsupernova remnants accelerate both light nuclei (protons, helium) and heavier\ncosmic ray species, we find that no more than ~25% of the observed rise in the\npositron fraction can result from this mechanism (at the 95% confidence level) \n\n"}

It has\npreviously been classified as a low-peaked BL Lac object based on its broadband\nemission and the absence of optical emission lines. Optical measurements,\nhowever, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronounced\nshort-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for a\nblazar. We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to\nreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For\nthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its\nspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations\nfrom the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength\ndata in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far.

In this paper, we estimate the number and the\norbital distribution of pulsars in the vicinity of the MBH in the GC by\nassuming that the pulsar progenitors, similar to the GC S-stars, were captured\nto orbits tightly bound to the MBH through the tidal breakup of stellar\nbinaries. We use the current observations on both the GC S-stars and the\nhypervelocity stars to calibrate the injection rate(s) of and the dynamical\nmodel(s) for the stellar binaries. By including the relaxation processes,\nsupernova kicks, and gravitational wave radiation in our simulations, we\nestimate that ~97-190 (9-14) pulsars may presently orbit the central MBH with\nsemimajor axes <=4000AU (<=1000AU), which is compatible with the current\nobservational constraints on the number of the GC pulsars. The semimajor axis\nand the pericenter distance of the pulsar closest to the central MBH are\nprobably in the range of ~120-460AU and ~2-230AU, respectively. Future\ntelescopes, such as the SKA, may be able to detect a significant number of\npulsars with semimajor axis smaller than a few thousand AU in the GC. Long-term\nmonitoring of these pulsars would be helpful in constraining both the\nenvironment and the metric of the central MBH.

A potential kilonova imprint of the delay until black hole\n  formation following a neutron star merger Abstract: Mergers of binary neutron stars (NSs) usually result in the formation of a\nhypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Whether- and when this remnant collapses to a\nblack hole (BH) depends primarily on the equation of state and on angular\nmomentum transport processes, both of which are uncertain. Here we show that\nthe lifetime of the merger remnant may be directly imprinted in the\nradioactively powered kilonova emission following the merger. We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta. When BH formation is relatively\nprompt (~ 100 ms), outflows from the disk are sufficiently neutron rich to form\nheavy r-process elements, resulting in ~ week-long emission with a spectral\npeak in the near-infrared (NIR), similar to that produced by the dynamical\nejecta. In contrast, delayed BH formation allows neutrinos from the HMNS to\nraise the electron fraction in the polar direction to values such that\npotentially Lanthanide-free outflows are generated. The lower opacity would\nproduce a brighter, bluer, and shorter-lived ~ day-long emission (a `blue\nbump') prior to the late NIR peak from the dynamical ejecta and equatorial\nwind. This new diagnostic of BH formation should be useful for events with a\nsignal to noise lower than that required for direct detection of gravitational\nwaveform signatures. \n\n"}

This pressure is essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy parameters $S_v$ and $L$, the first two coefficients of a Taylor\nexpansion of the symmetry energy around $n_s$. We discuss constraints on these\nparameters that can be found from nuclear experiments. We demonstrate that\nthese constraints are largely model-independent by deriving them qualitatively\nfrom a simple nuclear model.

Using a large number of accurate\nnumerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state,\nwe find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and\nrobust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak has already been\nassociated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by\nthe merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges\nbetween the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total\ncompactness of the stars in the binary.

It is\nalso known for hosting a bright galaxy, NGC 1400, with a large radial velocity\n(1200 km s$^{-1}$) with respect to the group center. Previous ROSAT X-ray\nobservations revealed an extended region of enhanced surface brightness just\neastward of NGC 1400.

We present an initial\nexploration of the probability that a star will make a BH as a function of its\nZAMS mass, $P_{\\rm BH}(M_{\\rm ZAMS})$. Although we find that it is difficult to\nderive a unique $P_{\\rm BH}(M_{\\rm ZAMS})$ using current measurements of both\nthe BH mass distribution and the degree of chemical enrichment by massive\nstars, we demonstrate how $P_{\\rm BH}(M_{\\rm ZAMS})$ changes with these various\nobservational and theoretical uncertainties.

Despite the spectral instability of many forms of the MRI, this\nproves to be a natural method of analysis that is well-suited to deal with the\nnon-self-adjoint nature of the linear MRI equations. We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times\nfaster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized\nin a completely different region of space. These ideas lead -- for both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes -- to a natural connection between the\nglobal MRI and the local shearing box approximation. By illustrating that the\nfastest growing global structure is well described by the ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) governing a single shear wave, we find that the shearing box\nis a very sensible approximation for the linear MRI, contrary to many previous\nclaims. Since the shear wave ODEs are most naturally understood using nonmodal\nanalysis techniques, we conclude by analyzing local MRI growth over finite\ntime-scales using these methods. The strong growth over a wide range of\nwave-numbers suggests that nonmodal linear physics could be of fundamental\nimportance in MRI turbulence. \n\n"}

The gravity of\nthe spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find\nthat a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of\nseveral, relative to the non-spinning case.

The nucleon self-energies are made available online as\nelectronic tables. The discussion is mostly restricted to relativistic\nmean-field models.\n  In the first part of the article, the generic properties of this class of\nmodels at finite temperature and asymmetry are studied. It is found that the\nquadratic expansion of the EOS in terms of asymmetry works reasonably well at\nfinite temperatures and deviations originate mostly from the kinetic part. The\ninteraction part of the symmetry energy is found to be almost temperature\nindependent. At low densities, the account of realistic nucleon masses requires\nthe introduction of a linear term in the expansion. Finally, it is shown that\nthe important neutron-to-proton potential difference is given approximately by\nthe asymmetry of the system and the interaction part of the zero-temperature\nsymmetry energy. The results of different interactions are then compared with\nconstraints from nuclear experiments and thereby the possible range of the\npotential difference is limited.\n  In the second part, for a certain class of SN EOS models, the formation of\nnuclei is considered.

This implies an\nincrease in flux of ~2 orders of magnitude or more during this ~4 day window.\nWe argue that this is likely due to a rapid rise in the mass accretion rate,\nrather than to a transition from an extremely obscured to an unobscured state.\nDuring the second epoch we observed the broadband 0.3-20.0 keV X-ray luminosity\nto be (1.55+/-0.06)e40 erg/s, similar to the majority of the archival X-ray\nobservations.

These components\nare expected to contribute to an electromagnetic transient and to produce\nr-process elements, each with a different signature when considered separately.\nHere we introduce a two-step approach to investigate their combined evolution,\nusing two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from the\noutput of a merger simulation, we identify each component in the initial\ncondition based on its phase space distribution, and evolve the accretion disk\nin axisymmetry. The wind blown from this disk is injected into a\nthree-dimensional computational domain where the dynamical ejecta is evolved.\nWe find that the wind can suppress fallback accretion on timescales longer than\n~100 ms.

On the ground of our interpretation of the results emerging\nfrom the literature, we suggest that in models describing DNe outbursts, such\nas the disk instability model, the secondary instability model (Bath 1973) and\nthe thermonuclear runaway model (Mitrofanov 1978), the role of the magnetic\nfield is at least twofold.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

The energy release and particle acceleration during\nreconnection have been proposed as a mechanism for producing high-energy\nemissions and cosmic rays. We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic\nsimulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the\nassociated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron\nplasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet\n($\\sigma \\equiv B^2/(4\\pi n_e m_e c^2) \\gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size. Eventually most of the available magnetic free energy is converted\ninto nonthermal particle kinetic energy. An analytic model is presented to\nexplain the key results and predict a general condition for the formation of\npower-law distributions. The development of reconnection in these regimes leads\nto relativistic inflow and outflow speeds and enhanced reconnection rates\nrelative to non-relativistic regimes. In the three-dimensional simulation, the\ninterplay between secondary kink and tearing instabilities leads to strong\nmagnetic turbulence, but does not significantly change the energy conversion,\nreconnection rate, or particle acceleration. This study suggests that\nrelativistic reconnection sites are strong sources of nonthermal particles,\nwhich may have important implications to a variety of high-energy astrophysical\nproblems. \n\n"}

Observational evidence provides\nsupport to the idea that SGRBs originate from the merger of compact binaries,\nconsisting of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH).\nTheoretical models and numerical simulations seem to converge to an explanation\nin which the central engine of SGRBs is given by a spinning BH surrounded by a\nhot accretion torus. Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these\nafterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the\n$\\sim\\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,\nsuggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation. Yet, if the\nmerger results in a massive NS the conditions to generate a relativistic jet\nand thus the prompt SGRB emission are hardly met.

In the\nframework of star-quake model, based on~\\cite{Baym1971}, the glitch-sizes (the\nrelative increases of spin-frequencies during glitches) $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$\ndepend on the released energies during glitches, with less released energies\ncorresponding to smaller glitch sizes. On the other hand, as one of dark matter\ncandidates, our Galaxy might be filled with the so called strange nuggets (SNs)\nwhich are the relics from the early Universe. In this case the collisions\nbetween pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to\nglitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down\nprocess. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the\naccumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches\nwithout SNs. Therefore, if a pulsar is hit frequently by SNs, it would tend to\nhave more small size glitches, whose values of $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$ are\nsmaller than that in standard star-quake model (with larger amounts of released\nenergy).

Abstract: An increasing number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are\ndiscovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light\ncurves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability\nmechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up\nto Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether\nPISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light\ncurve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of\nmacroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting\nobservational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN\nevolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova\nevolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The\ngreatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an\nextreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the\nhydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of\nchemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric\ntemperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider\nrange of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light\ncurves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two\nwell-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme\nchemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore,\nalternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still\nto be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe. \n\n"}

We study the evolution of hierarchical triples, following the secular\ndynamical evolution up to the octupole-level of approximation, including\ngeneral relativity, tidal effects and post-main-sequence evolution, such as\nmass loss, changes to stellar radii and supernovae. During the dynamical\nevolution of the triple system, the \"eccentric Kozai-Lidov\" mechanism can cause\nlarge eccentricity excitations in the LMXB progenitor, resulting in three main\nBH-LMXB formation channels.

Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

A suggested explanation for the observed\ncharacteristics of this subclass is a binary progenitor system consisting of a\nCO white dwarf primary accreting from a helium star companion. A\nsingle-degenerate explosion channel might be expected to result in a dense\ncircumstellar medium (CSM), although no evidence for such a CSM has yet been\nobserved for this subclass. Here we present recent Spitzer observations of the\nSN Iax 2014dt obtained by the SPIRITS program nearly one year post-explosion\nthat reveal a strong mid-IR excess over the expected fluxes of more normal SNe\nIa. This excess is consistent with 1E-5 M_solar of newly formed dust, which\nwould be the first time that newly formed dust has been observed to form in a\nnormal Type Ia. The excess, however, is also consistent with a dusty CSM that\nwas likely formed in pre-explosion mass-loss, thereby suggesting a single\ndegenerate progenitor system. Compared to other SNe Ia that show significant\nshock interaction (SNe Ia-CSM) and interacting core-collapse events (SNe IIn),\nthis dust shell in SN 2014dt is less massive.

The contribution from older main\nsequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From\nMbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a\nlarger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved\nstars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which\nis largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in\nany observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun\nBHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates.

Three main techniques can be\nused to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we\nobserve from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational\npole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation.\nInformation about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via\nrelativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained.\nThe second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting\nneutron stars. The most rapidly rotating stars provide a very clean constraint,\nsince the mass-shedding limit is a function of mass and radius. However the\noverall spin distribution also provides a guide to the torque mechanisms in\noperation and the moment of inertia, both of which can depend sensitively on\ndense matter physics. The third technique is to search for quasi-periodic\noscillations in X-ray flux associated with global seismic vibrations of\nmagnetars (the most highly magnetized neutron stars), triggered by magnetic\nexplosions.

Recent observations hint at high levels of ionisation and at the\npresence of synchrotron emission in protostellar systems, which leads to an\napparent contradiction. We want to explain the origin of these CRs accelerated\nwithin young protostars as suggested by observations.

We analyse three main\nacceleration sites, then we follow the propagation of these particles through\nthe protostellar system up to the hot spot region. We find that jet shocks can\nbe strong accelerators of CR protons, which can be boosted up to relativistic\nenergies. Other promising acceleration sites are protostellar surfaces, where\nshocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough\nto accelerate CR protons. In contrast, accretion flow shocks are too weak to\nefficiently accelerate CRs.

Using this census\nand the published spatially resolved star-formation history map of the LMC, we\nfind that the HMXBs (and as expected the X-ray pulsars) are present in regions\nwith star-formation bursts $\\sim$6-25 Myr ago, in contrast to the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC), for which this population peaks at later ages\n($\\sim$25-60 Myr ago). We also estimate the HMXB production rate to be equal to\n1 system per $\\sim43.5\\times10^{-3}$ Mo/yr, or 1 system per $\\sim$143 Mo of\nstars formed during the associated star-formation episode. Therefore, the\nformation efficiency of HMXBs in the LMC is $\\sim$17 times lower than that in\nthe SMC. We attribute this difference primarily in the different ages and\nmetallicity of the HMXB populations in the two galaxies. We also set limits on\nthe kicks imparted on the neutron star during the supernova explosion.

This method is widely used, however, derived\nwhite dwarf masses M can be systematically underestimated because the accretion\nflow is stopped at and re-accelerates from the magnetospheric boundary R_m, and\ntherefore, its velocity at the surface will be lower than free-fall.To avoid\nthis problem we computed a two-parameter set of model hard X-ray spectra, which\nallows to constrain a degenerate M - R_m dependence. On the other hand,\nprevious works showed that power spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars and\nintermediate polars exhibit breaks at the frequencies corresponding to the\nKeplerian frequencies at the magnetospheric boundary. Therefore, the break\nfrequency \\nu_b in an intermediate polar power spectrum gives another relation\nin the M - R_m plane.

Given that the SFRs are low on average, the latter is\nascribed to low stellar masses.

Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary. Throughout the cluster evolution, turbulent energy is\nonly at the percent level compared to gas thermal energy, and thus turbulent\nheating is not the main source of heating in our simulation. \n\n"}

Time\nseries which resolve the profiles of absorption lines such as Na I D or Ca II\nH&K are expected to reveal variations due to photoionisation and subsequent\nrecombination of the gases. The presence, composition, and geometry of\ncircumstellar matter may hint at the elusive progenitor system of SNe Ia and\ncould also affect the observed reddening law. To date, there are few known\ncases of time-varying Na I D absorption in SNe Ia, all of which occurred during\nrelatively late phases of the supernova evolution. Photoionisation, however, is\npredicted to occur during the early phases of SNe Ia, when the supernova peaks\nin the ultraviolet. We therefore attempt to observe early-time absorption-line\nvariations by obtaining high-resolution spectra of SNe before maximum light. We\nhave obtained photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy of SNe Ia 2013gh and\niPTF 13dge, to search for absorption- line variations.

Using images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we\nhave discovered transient 3.4 micron emission from several previously known\ntidal disruption flares. The observations can be explained by dust heated to\nits sublimation temperature due to the intense radiation of the tidal flare.\nFrom the break in the infrared light curve we infer that this hot dust is\nlocated ~0.1 pc from the supermassive black hole. Since the dust has been\nheated by absorbing UV and (potentially) soft X-ray photons of the flare, the\nreprocessing light curve yields an estimate of the bolometric flare luminosity.\nFor the flare PTF-09ge, we infer that the most likely value of the luminosity\nintegrated over frequencies at which dust can absorb photons is $8\\times\n10^{44}$ erg/s, with a factor of 3 uncertainty due to the unknown temperature\nof the dust.

This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where\nthe drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse\nprofile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population.\nVarious tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of\nperiodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and\npolarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the\nradio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the\nfluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly\ndemonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a\ncompletely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be\ndetermined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint\non the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission\nmodes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being\npresent only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation\ncycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for\nthe bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that\nthe variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking\nimplies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.\nPhase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically\nproposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown\nto be implausible.

We estimate the properties of the system at 4\nevolutionary stages: 1) at the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS), 2) just prior to\nthe supernova (SN) explosion of the primary, 3) just after the SN, and 4) at\nthe moment of RLO onset.We use a hybrid approach, combining detailed stellar\nstructure and binary evolution calculations with approximate population\nsynthesis models. This allows us to estimate potential natal kicks and the\nevolution of the BH spin. In the whole analysis we incorporate as model\nconstraints the most up-to-date observational information, encompassing the\nbinary's orbital properties, the companion star mass, effective temperature,\nsurface gravity and radius, as well as the black hole's mass and spin. We find\nthat LMC X-3 began as a ZAMS system with the mass of the primary star in the\nrange $M_{\\rm{1,ZAMS}}$ = 22-31 $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ and a secondary star of\n$M_{\\rm{2,ZAMS}} = 5.0-8.3M_{\\odot}$, in a wide ($P_{ZAMS} \\gtrsim 2.000\\, \\rm\ndays$) and eccentric ($e_{\\rm{ZAMS}} \\gtrsim 0.23$) orbit.

The goal of this study is to aid the interpretation of spectroscopic\nsearches for binaries and help test one of the leading models of binary\naccretion flows in the literature: SBHB in a circumbinary disk. In this work we\npresent the methodology and a comparison of the preliminary model with the\ndata. We model SBHB accretion flows as a set of three accretion disks: two\nmini-disks that are gravitationally bound to the individual black holes and a\ncircumbinary disk. Given a physically motivated parameter space occupied by\nsub-parsec SBHBs, we calculate a synthetic database of nearly 15 million broad\noptical emission line profiles and explore the dependence of the profile shapes\non characteristic properties of SBHBs. We find that the modeled profiles show\ndistinct statistical properties as a function of the semi-major axis, mass\nratio, eccentricity of the binary, and the degree of alignment of the triple\ndisk system.

However, the recent progress in cosmic gamma-ray studies\nchallenges these attempts. Indeed, as we show, any rational DM model explaining\nthe positron anomaly abundantly produces final state radiation and Inverse\nCompton gamma rays, which inevitably leads to a contradiction with Fermi-LAT\nisotropic diffuse gamma-ray background measurements.

For such systems tidal interactions at close\npericenter passages can lead to orbit circularization and possibly mass\ntransfer, consequently producing X-Ray binaries without the need for common\nenvelope. We test this scenario for the case of Black Hole Low-Mass X-Ray\nBinaries (BH LMXBs) by performing a population synthesis from primordial\nbinaries with numerical treatment of random stellar encounters. We test various\nmodels for the threshold pericenter distance under which tidal forces cause\ncircularization.

{"id": "1608.00487", "contents": "Title: Analysis of Neutron Stars Observations Using a Correlated Fermi Gas\n  Model Abstract: Background: The nuclear symmetry energy is a fundamental ingredient in\ndetermining the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NS). Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

This leads to a significant\nbroadening of the optical light curve, a longer rise to maximum and a slower\ndecline in the tail phase. During the interaction, substantial radiative energy\nis generated, which mostly emerges in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime.\nOnly if reprocessing due to radiation-matter interactions is very efficient, a\nsignificant boost in the optical light curve is observed. We discuss these\nfindings in particular in the context of the super-luminous event SN 2009dc. As\nour calculations are able to reproduce a number of its peculiar properties, we\nconclude that the flavour of the interaction scenario investigated in this work\nconstitutes a promising candidate to explain such 'Super-Chandrasekhar'\nsupernovae. \n\n"}

Employing hydrodynamic\nsimulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is\ngeneric in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after\nmerger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with\nstiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal\nmode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer\nequations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise\nto double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to\nasymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$\ngravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that\nultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further\nsuggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower\n$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies. Thus, if gravitational waves from the\none-arm instability are detected, they could in principle constrain the neutron\nstar equation of state. We estimate that, depending on the equation of state,\nthe one-arm mode could potentially be detectable by second generation\ngravitational wave detectors at $\\sim 10$ Mpc and by third generation ones at\n$\\sim 100$ Mpc. Finally, we provide estimates of the properties of dynamical\nejecta, as well as the accompanying kilonovae signatures. \n\n"}

The leading hypothesis is that such a supernova is a\nthermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, but the exact explosion\nmechanism is still a matter of debate. Observation of a galactic SN Ia would be\nof immense value in answering the many open questions related to these events.\nOne potentially useful source of information about the explosion mechanism and\nprogenitor is the neutrino signal.\n  In this paper we compute the expected neutrino signal from a gravitationally\nconfined detonation (GCD) explosion scenario for a SN~Ia and show how the flux\nat Earth contains features in time and energy unique to this scenario.

Two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations demonstrated that this gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain\nthe observed space velocities of young NSs up to more than 1000 km/s.

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMS; ~ 10^5 M_sun) formed from metal-free gas in the\nearly Universe attract attention as progenitors of supermassive black holes\nobserved at high redshifts. To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very\nextended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are\ncalled super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes\nlocally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs\nwill grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as\nlong as the rapid accretion is maintained. \n\n"}

In this paper, we predict the very high-energy (up\nto 1000 TeV) gamma-ray flux from the solar disk and halo, due to cosmic-ray\nhadrons and electrons ($e^++e^-$), respectively. We neglect solar magnetic\neffects, which is valid at TeV energies; at lower energies, this gives a\ntheoretical lower bound on the disk flux and a theoretical upper bound on the\nhalo flux. We show that the solar-halo gamma-ray flux allows the first test of\nthe $\\sim 5$--70 TeV cosmic-ray electron spectrum. Further, we show that HAWC\ncan immediately make an even stronger test with nondirectional observations of\ncosmic-ray electrons. Together, these gamma-ray and electron studies will\nprovide new insights about the local density of cosmic rays and their\ninteractions with the Sun and its magnetic environment. These studies will also\nbe an important input to tests of new physics, including dark matter. \n\n"}

We undertake a population synthesis study to compute the delay-time\ndistribution of core-collapse supernovae, that is, the supernova rate versus\ntime following a starburst, taking into account binary interactions. We test\nthe systematic robustness of our results by running various simulations to\naccount for the uncertainties in our standard assumptions. We find that a\nsignificant fraction, $15^{+9}_{-8}$%, of core-collapse supernovae are `late',\nthat is, they occur 50-200 Myrs after birth, when all massive single stars have\nalready exploded. These late events originate predominantly from binary systems\nwith at least one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of\nintermediate mass ($4-8M_{\\odot}$). The main evolutionary channels that\ncontribute often involve either the merging of the initially more massive\nprimary star with its companion or the engulfment of the remaining core of the\nprimary by the expanding secondary that has accreted mass at an earlier\nevolutionary stage.

X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars\nand stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star\nevolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged) \n\n"}

The recent SN 2016gkg was a nearby Type IIb SN discovered shortly after\nexplosion, which makes it an excellent candidate for studying this first peak.\nWe numerically explode a large grid of extended envelope models and compare\nthese to SN 2016gkg to investigate what constraints can be derived from its\nlight curve. This includes exploring density profiles for both a convective\nenvelope and an optically thick steady-state wind, the latter of which has not\ntypically been considered for Type IIb SNe models. We find that roughly\n$\\sim0.02\\,M_\\odot$ of extended material with a radius of\n$\\approx180-260\\,R_\\odot$ reproduces the photometric light curve data,\nconsistent with pre-explosion imaging.

We pay\nattention to effects of BH mass function on the total mass and mass ratio\ndistributions of BH binaries ejected from clusters. Firstly, we consider BH\npopulations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from\nmodels with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass\nfunctions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low\nmetallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed. In this work, we\nconsider only binaries that are formed by three-body processes and ignore\nstellar evolution and primordial binaries for simplicity. Our results imply\nthat most BH binary mergers take place after they get ejected from the cluster.\nAlso, mass ratios of dynamically formed binaries should be close to one or\nlikely to be less than 2:1. Since the binary formation efficiency is larger for\nhigher-mass BHs, it is likely that a BH mass function sampled by\ngravitational-wave observations would be weighed toward higher masses than the\nmass function of single BHs for a dynamically formed population. Applying\nconservative assumptions regarding globular cluster populations such as small\nBH mass fraction and no primordial binaries, the merger rate of BH binaries\noriginated from globular clusters is estimated to be at least 6.5 per yr per\nGpc^3.

Two scenarios have been\nsuggested for both phenomena: one of them involves rapid rotation and\nquasi-chemical homogeneous evolution (CHE), the other invokes classical\nevolution through mass loss in single and binary systems. WR spin rates might\nenable us to test these two scenarios. In order to obtain empirical constraints\non black hole progenitor spin, we infer wind asymmetries in all 12 known WR\nstars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at Z = 1/5 Zsun, as well as within a\nsignificantly enlarged sample of single and binary WR stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC at Z = 1/2 Zsun), tripling the sample of Vink (2007).\nThis brings the total LMC sample to 39, making it appropriate for comparison to\nthe Galactic sample.

We report the detection of new line effects in the LMC WN\nstar BAT99-43 and the WC star BAT99-70, as well as the famous WR/LBV HD 5980 in\nthe SMC, which might be evolving chemically homogeneously.

The specific\naccretion-rate distribution is defined as the probability of a galaxy with a\ngiven stellar mass and redshift hosting an active nucleus with a certain\nspecific accretion rate. We find that the probability of a galaxy hosting an\nAGN increases with decreasing specific accretion rate. There is evidence that\nthis trend reverses at low specific accretion rates, $\\lambda<10^{-4}-10^{-3}$\n(in Eddington units). There is also a break close to the Eddington limit, above\nwhich the probability of an accretion event decreases steeply. The specific\naccretion-rate distribution evolves such that the fraction of AGN among\ngalaxies drops toward lower redshifts. This decrease in the AGN duty cycle is\nresponsible for the strong evolution of the accretion density of the Universe\nfrom redshift $z\\approx1-1.5$ to the present day. Our analysis also suggests\nthat this evolution is accompanied by a decoupling of accretion events onto\nblack holes from the formation of stars in galaxies.

If the BH spin magnitudes are large then (i) either\nboth BH spin vectors must be nearly in the orbital plane or (ii) the spin\nangular momenta of the BHs must be oppositely directed and similar in\nmagnitude. Or, (iii) the BH spin magnitudes are small. We test the third\nhypothesis within the framework of the classical isolated binary evolution\nscenario of the BH-BH merger formation. We test three models of angular\nmomentum transport in massive stars: a mildly efficient transport by meridional\ncurrents (as employed in the Geneva code), an efficient transport by the\nTayler-Spruit magnetic dynamo (as implemented in the MESA code), and a\nvery-efficient transport (as proposed by Fuller et al.) to calculate natal BH\nspins. We allow for binary evolution to increase the BH spins through accretion\nand account for the potential spin-up of stars through tidal interactions.\nAdditionally, we update the calculations of the stellar-origin BH masses,\ninclude revisions to the history of star formation and to the chemical\nevolution across cosmic time. We find that we can match simultaneously the\nobserved BH-BH merger rate density, BH masses, and effective spins. Models with\nefficient angular momentum transport are favored. The updated stellar-mass\nweighted gas-phase metallicity evolution now used in our models appears to be a\nkey in better reproducing the LIGO/Virgo merger rate estimate. Mass losses\nduring the pair-instability pulsation supernova phase are likely overestimated\nif the merger GW170729 hosts a BH more massive than 50 Msun.

Our CMFGEN models suggest that the progenitor of\nSN2015bh had an effective temperature between 8700 and 10000 K, luminosity in\nthe range ~ 1.8-4.74e6 Lsun, contained at least 25% H in mass at the surface,\nand half-solar Fe abundances. The results also show that the progenitor of SN\n2015bh generated an extended wind with a mass-loss rate of ~ 6e-4 to 1.5e-3\nMsun/yr and a velocity of 1000 km/s. We determined that the wind extended to at\nleast 2.57e14 cm and lasted for at least 30 days prior to the observations,\nreleasing 5e-5 Msun into the circumstellar medium. In analogy to 2009ip, we\npropose that this is the material that the explosive ejecta could interact at\nlate epochs, perhaps producing observable signatures that can be probed with\nfuture observations. We conclude that the progenitor of SN 2015bh was most\nlikely a warm luminous blue variable of at least 35 Msun before the explosion.\nConsidering the high wind velocity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the\nprogenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star that inflated just before the 2013 eruption,\nsimilar to HD5980 during its 1994 episode. If the star survived, late-time\nspectroscopy may reveal either a similar LBV or a Wolf-Rayet star, depending on\nthe mass of the H envelope before the explosion. If the star exploded as a\ngenuine SN, 2015bh would be a remarkable case of a successful explosion after\nblack-hole formation in a star with a possible minimum mass 35 Msun at the\npre-SN stage. \n\n"}

Here we emphasize that two families of\ncompact stars, viz., neutron stars and strange stars, can coexist in nature,\nand that neutron stars can get converted to strange stars through the\nnucleation process of quark matter in the stellar center. From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars.

This approach is based on the\nmultipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the global\nphysical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state),\nbut not to canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It\nleads to simple derivation of the CFS instability criterion for normal modes\nand the evolution equations for a star, affected by this instability. The\napproach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS\ninstability: it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission\nremoves angular momentum from the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation\nenergy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy, than the released amount\nof the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability in slowly\nrotating Newtonian stars. In resulting evolution equations emission of\ngravitational waves directly affects the spin frequency, being in line with the\narguments by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), but in contrast to widely accepted\nequations by Lindblom et al.

We find that the dipole axis is not\nstationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general\ncoincide with the location of the magnetic spot. This is due to\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal\ndipole axis at rates that may reach $0.4^{\\circ}$ per century.

An important difference between these two cases\nis the nucleosynthetic yield, which is altered by the increased neutron excess\nin Chandrasekhar progenitors due to their pre-explosion simmering and high\ncentral density.\n  From comparison with theoretical nucleosynthesis yields, we show that the\nchemical composition of the most metal-rich star in the Ursa Minor dwarf\ngalaxy, COS 171, is dominated by nucleosynthesis from a low-metallicity,\nlow-mass, sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Key diagnostic abundance ratios include\nC/Fe, {\\alpha}/Fe, Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios, which could not have been produced\nby Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia, Core-Collapse Type II supernovae or\nPair-Instsability supernovae. Strong deficiencies of Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe\nalso suggest the absence of alpha-rich freeze-out nucleosynthesis, favoring\nlow-mass WD progenitor SNe Ia. Based on comparisons of the measured Mn/Fe and\nSi/Fe ratios with detonation models, we estimate a WD mass near 0.95Msun. We\nalso compare Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios to the recent theoretical yields predicted\nby Shen et al., finding consistent results. To explain the COS 171 [Fe/H], at\n-1.35 dex, requires dilution of the ejecta from a single SNIa event with ~10^4\nMsun of material; this is expected for a SN Ia remnant expanding into a warm\ninterstellar medium with n~1 /cm^3.

The mass range for ECSN from close binary systems is\nthought to be wider than the range for single stars, because of the effects of\nmass transfer on the helium core.

Here, we utilize recent observations of the cosmic-ray\nelectron spectrum (extending up to ~20 TeV) by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration to\nshow that the local diffusion coefficient cannot be as low as it is in the\nregions surrounding Geminga and Monogem. Instead, we conclude that cosmic rays\nefficiently diffuse through the bulk of the local interstellar medium.

We use a finite-difference code for simulation of\nneutron-star thermal evolution on timescales from hours to megayears with an\nupdated microphysics input. The consideration of short timescales ($\\lesssim1$\nyr) is made possible by a treatment of the heat-blanketing envelope without the\nquasistationary approximation inherent to its treatment in traditional\nneutron-star cooling codes. For the strongly magnetized neutron stars, we take\ninto account the effects of Landau quantization on thermodynamic functions and\nthermal conductivities. We simulate cooling of ordinary neutron stars and\nmagnetars with non-accreted and accreted crusts and compare the results with\nobservations. Suppression of radiative and conductive opacities in strongly\nquantizing magnetic fields and formation of a condensed radiating surface\nsubstantially enhance the photon luminosity at early ages, making the life of\nmagnetars brighter but shorter.

This extra term\ninvolves the moment of inertia of the neutron stars. Moment of inertia, on the\nother hand, depends on the mass and spin of the neutron star as well as the\nequation of state of the matter. If at least one member of the double neutron\nstar binary (better the faster one) is a radio pulsar, then accurate timing\nanalysis might lead to the estimation of the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance, which will lead to the measurement of the\nmoment of inertia of the pulsar. Combination of the knowledge on the values of\nthe moment of inertia, the mass, and the spin of the pulsar, will give a new\nconstraint on the equation of state. Pulsars in double neutron star binaries\nare the best for this purpose as short orbits and moderately high\neccentricities make the Lense-Thirring effect substantial, whereas tidal\neffects are negligible (unlike pulsars with main sequence or white-dwarf\nbinaries). The most promising pulsars are PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854.\nThe spin-precession of pulsars due to the misalignment between the spin and the\norbital angular momentum vectors affect the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance. This effect has been explored for both PSR\nJ0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854, and as the misalignment angles for both of\nthese pulsars are small, the variation in the Lense-Thirring term is not much.\nHowever, to extract the Lense-Thirring effect from the observed rate of the\nperiastron advance, more accurate timing solutions including precise proper\nmotion and distance measurements are essential. \n\n"}

Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure.

The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex\nscaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other\nparameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important\nfact is that early-type galaxies can show both decreasing and increasing radial\ntemperature profiles. We have calculated the diffusion based on the observed\ngas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that\nbelonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray\nluminosities.

Energy\nconservation guarantees that a bubble loses most of its energy to the ICM after\ncrossing several pressure scale heights. However, actual processes responsible\nfor transferring the energy to the ICM are still being debated. One attractive\npossibility is the excitation of internal waves, which are trapped in the\ncluster's core and eventually dissipate. Here we show that a sufficient\ncondition for efficient excitation of these waves in stratified cluster\natmospheres is flattening of the bubbles in the radial direction. In our\nnumerical simulations, we model the bubbles phenomenologically as rigid bodies\nbuoyantly rising in the stratified cluster atmosphere. We find that the\nterminal velocities of the flattened bubbles are small enough so that the\nFroude number ${\\rm Fr}\\lesssim 1$. The effects of stratification make the\ndominant contribution to the total drag force balancing the buoyancy force. In\nparticular, clear signs of internal waves are seen in the simulations. These\nwaves propagate horizontally and downwards from the rising bubble, spreading\ntheir energy over large volumes of the ICM.

Gravitational waves (GWs) from\ntheir mergers with other IMBHs or with stellar BHs in the cluster are mostly\nemitted in frequencies <10 Hz, which unfortunately is out of reach for current\nground-based observatories such as advanced LIGO (aLIGO). Nevertheless, we show\nthat aLIGO measurements can be used to efficiently probe one of the possible\nformation mechanisms of IMBHs in GCs, namely a runaway merger process of\nstellar seed BHs. In this case, aLIGO will be sensitive to the lower-mass rungs\nof the merger ladder, ranging from the seed BH mass to masses >~50-300 Msun,\nwhere the background from standard mergers is expected to be very low.

We argue that mass loss by radiation-driven winds mediated by\nline opacity is one of the prime candidates setting the upper-mass limit. We\npresent mass-loss predictions (dM/dt_wind) from Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nmodels for relatively cool (Teff = 15kK) inflated very massive stars (VMS) with\nlarge Eddington Gamma factors in the mass range 100-1000 Msun as a function of\nmetallicity down to 1/100 Z/Zsun. We employ a hydrodynamic version of our Monte\nCarlo method, allowing us to predict the rate of mass loss (dM/dt_wind) and the\nterminal wind velocity (vinf) simultaneously. Interestingly, we find wind\nterminal velocities (vinf) that are low (100-500 km/s) over a wide Z-range, and\nwe propose that the slow winds from VMS are an important source of\nself-enrichment in globular clusters. We also find mass-loss rates\n(dM/dt_wind), exceeding the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt_accr) of 0.001\nMsun/yr during massive-star formation. We express our mass-loss predictions as\na function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun) + 0.74\nlog(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse\nmass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar\nmergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar\ngrowth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass limit is effectively\nZ-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds.

If most of\nX-ray photons have traveled from the primary source to the observer with\nminimum light-matter interaction, a fraction of radiation is emitted at\ndifferent directions and is reprocessed by the parsec-scale equatorial\ncircumnuclear region or the polar outflows.

In this paper, we examine the\ncontribution of remote material onto the polarized X-ray spectrum of type-1\nSeyfert galaxies using radiative transfer Monte Carlo codes. We find that the\nobserved X-ray polarization strongly depends on the initial polarization\nemerging from the disk-corona system.

The CO\nobservation shows that the SNR delineated by the radio emission is projectively\ncovered by a molecular cloud (MC) complex at V$_{\\rm {LSR}}$ = $-60$ to $-54$\nkm s$^{-1}$.

Asymmetric broad profiles of $^{12}$CO\nlines peaked at $-58$ km s$^{-1}$ are found at the eastern and southwestern\nedges of the radio emission. This represents a kinematic signature consistent\nwith an SNR-MC interaction.

We summarize how such shell-burning\ndepend on the accretion rate and the WD mass and how the WD blows strong wind.\nWe identify the following evolutionary routes for the accreting WD to trigger a\nthermonuclear explosion. With a decreasing rate with time, 5 phases are\nobserved: 1. The WD increases its mass by stable H burning and blows a strong\nwind, which strips a part of the companion star's envelope to control the\naccretion rate and forms circumstellar matter (CSM). The WD may explode within\nCSM as an \"SN Ia-CSM\". 2. The wind stops and an SN Ia is triggered under\nsteady-stable H shell-burning, which is observed as a super-soft X-ray source:\n\"SN Ia-SSXS\". 3. H shell-burning becomes unstable and many flashes recur. The\nWD undergoes recurrent nova (RN) whose mass ejection is smaller than the\naccreted matter, evolving to an \"SN Ia-RN\". 4. If the companion is a He star or\nWD, the accretion of He can trigger He and C double detonations at the\nsub-Chandrasekhar (sub-Chand) mass or the WD grows to the Chand mass while\nproducing and He-wind: \"SN Ia-He CSM\". 5.

In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths.

For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating\ncores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of\nthe proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure\nto compute the eigenmodes of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled\naccretion shock in general relativity including spacetime perturbations. The\nnew method improves on previous results by accounting for perturbations of both\nthe lapse function and the conformal factor. We apply our analysis to two\nnumerical core-collapse simulations and show that our improved method is able\nto obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately match the features observed in the\nGW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial\noscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to\nclassify the computed eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes),\nimproving previous results which suffered from misclassification issues. We\nfind that most of the GW energy is stored in the lowest order eigenmodes, in\nparticular in the $^2g_1$ mode and in the $^2f$ mode.

By investigating the OGLE light-curves of 64 B supergiants\n(Bsgs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) on a timescale of three years with a\ncadence of one night, the incidence of S Dor variables amongst the Bsgs\npopulation is investigated.

If,\nhowever, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the\ntwo stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least\nmassive star does not, this correlation will be weakened. In all cases, a\nminimum Lambda for each neutron star mass is imposed by causality, and a less\nconservative limit is imposed by the unitary gas constraint, both of which we\ncompute. In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively. Moreover, they are\nbounded by q^{n_-}>Lambda_1/Lambda_2> q^{n_{0+}+qn_{1+}}, where\nn_-<n_{0+}+qn_{1+}; the parameters depend only on M_chirp, which is accurately\ndetermined from the gravitational-wave signal. We also provide analytic\nexpressions for the wider bounds that exist in the case of a strong phase\ntransition. We argue that bounded ranges for Lambda_1/Lambda_2, tuned to\nM_chirp, together with lower bounds to Lambda(M), will be more useful in\ngravitational waveform modeling than other suggested approaches. \n\n"}

In active galactic nuclei (AGN) the origin and role of dust are\nuncertain. Here, we have studied dust in the X-ray bright and reddened type-1\nquasar IC 4329A, which exhibits an ionised AGN wind. We incorporated\nhigh-resolution X-ray and mid-IR spectroscopy, combined with broad-band\ncontinuum modelling, to investigate the properties of dust in this AGN. We used\nnew Chandra HETGS observations taken in June 2017, as well as archival data\nfrom XMM-Newton, Swift, HST, Spitzer, IRAS, and Herschel for our\nIR-optical-UV-X-ray modelling. Two distinct components of dust in IC 4329A are\nfound. One component is in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy,\nand the other is a nuclear component in the AGN torus and its associated wind.\nThe emitting dust in the torus is evident in mid-IR emission (9.7 and 18 micron\nfeatures), while dust in the wind is present through both reddening and X-ray\nabsorption (O, Si, and Fe edge features). The gas depletion factors into dust\nfor O, Si, and Fe are measured. We derive an intrinsic reddening E(B-V) ~ 1.0,\nwhich is most consistent with a grey (flat) extinction law. The AGN wind\nconsists of three ionisation components. From analysis of long-term changes in\nthe wind, we determine limits on the location of the wind components. The two\nlowest ionisation components are likely carriers of dust from the AGN torus. We\nfind that the dust in the nuclear component of IC 4329A is different from dust\nin the Milky Way. The dust grains in the AGN torus and wind are likely larger\nthan the standard Galactic dust, and are in a porous composite form (containing\namorphous silicate with iron and oxygen). This can be a consequence of grain\ncoagulation in the dense nuclear environment of the AGN. \n\n"}

First, the observed drop\nin terminal wind velocity around spectral type B1 is confirmed by the Monte\nCarlo method -- at the correct effective temperature of about 21 000 K. This\ndrop in wind velocity is much steeper than would be expected from the drop in\nescape speed for cooler stars. The results may be particularly relevant for\nslow winds inferred for some High-Mass X-ray binaries. Second, the strength of\nthe mass-loss bi-stability jump is found to be significantly larger than\npreviously assumed. Not only could this make bi-stability braking more\nefficient in massive star evolution, but a rotationally-induced version of the\nbi-stability mechanism may now be capable of producing the correct density of\noutflowing disks around B[e] supergiants, although multi-dimensional modelling\nincluding the disk velocity structure is still needed. For LBVs, we find the\nbi-stability jump to become larger at higher metallicities, but perhaps\nsurprisingly also larger at lower Eddington parameters. This may have\nconsequences for the role of LBVs in the evolution of massive stars at\ndifferent metallicities and Cosmic Epochs.

We present Hubble Space Telescope\nfar-UV (FUV) observations of eight optical/UV selected TDFs 5-10 years\npost-peak. Six sources are cleanly detected, showing point-like FUV emission\nfrom the centers of their host galaxies.

Conversely, FUV light curves from high-mass black hole TDFs are\ngenerally consistent with an extrapolation from the early-time light curve. The\nobserved late-time emission cannot be explained by existing models for\nearly-time TDF light curves (i.e. reprocessing or circularization shocks), but\nis instead consistent with a viscously spreading, unobscured accretion disk.\nThese disk models can only reproduce the observed FUV luminosities, however, if\nthey are assumed to be thermally and viscously stable, in contrast to the\nsimplest predictions of alpha-disk theory. For one TDF in our sample, we\nmeasure an upper limit to the UV luminosity that is significantly lower than\nexpectations from theoretical modeling and an extrapolation of the early-time\nlight curve.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

We find that black hole accretion rate can be expressed as\n$\\frac{\\dot M_{\\rm BH} }{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}=10^{-3.11} (\\rho_0/10^{-22}{\\rm g\ncm}^{-3})^{1.36} (T_0/10^7 {\\rm K})^{-1.9}$, with $\\rho_0$ and $T_0$ being\ndensity and temperature at parsec scale, respectively. We find the formula can\naccurately predict the luminosity of observed low-luminosity AGNs (with black\nhole mass $\\sim 10^8M_{\\odot}$). This formula can be used in the sub-grid\nmodels in large scale cosmological simulations with a black hole mass of $\\sim\n10^8M_{\\odot}$. \n\n"}

During the propagation of neutrinos\nfrom the proto-neutron star, their flavors change and the neutrino reaction\nrates for spallation of 12C and 4He are affected. In this work corrected\nneutrino spallation cross sections for 4He and 12C are adopted. Initial\nabundances involving heavy s-nuclei and other physical conditions are derived\nin a new calculation of the SN 1987A progenitor in which effects of the\nprogenitor metallicity are included. A dependence of the SN nucleosynthesis and\nfinal yields of 7Li and 11B on the neutrino mass hierarchy are shown in several\nstellar locations. In the normal hierarchy case, the charged current reaction\nrates of electron neutrinos are enhanced, and yields of proton-rich nuclei,\nalong with 7Be and 11C, are increased. In the inverted hierarchy case, the\ncharged current reaction rates of electron antineutrinos are enhanced, and\nyields of neutron-rich nuclei, along with 7Li and 11B, are increased. We find\nthat variation of the metallicity modifies the yields of 7Li, 7Be, 11B, and\n11C. This effect is caused by changes in the neutron abundance during SN\nnucleosynthesis. Therefore, accurate calculations of Li and B production in SNe\nshould take into account the metallicity of progenitor stars. \n\n"}

The simulations reveal a\nthree-component outflow: 1) A hot, dense, super-fast and highly magnetised 'jet\ncore'; 2) a cold, rarefied, trans-fast and highly magnetised 'sheath'\nsurrounding the jet core and extending to a tangential discontinuity; and 3) a\nwarm, dense, trans-slow and weakly magnetised shocked ambient medium entrained\nby the advancing bow shock. The simulations reveal power-law relationships\nbetween $B_{\\rm i}$ and the jet advance speed, $v_{\\rm jet}$, the average jet\nrotation speed, $\\langle v_\\varphi\\rangle$, as well as fluxes of mass,\nmomentum, and kinetic energy.

The lack of any obvious star formation at that location presented a\nchallenge to models of Type Ibn supernovae as the explosions of very massive\nWolf-Rayet stars.

We do not detect\nany ultraviolet emission within 1 kpc of the supernova location, which allows\nus deepen the limit on star formation rate by an order of magnitude compared to\nthe original study on this event. In light of this new limit, we discuss\nwhether the progenitors of Type Ibn supernovae can be massive stars and what\nreasonable alternatives have been proposed. \n\n"}

Here\nwe use the second Gaia data release to search for wide astrometric companions\nto Galactic O-B5 stars which share similar parallax and proper motion with the\nprimaries. Using the data we characterize the frequency and properties of such\nbinaries. We find an ultra-wide multiplicity fraction of $4.4\\pm0.5$ per cent,\nto our completeness limit (up to $\\approx 17$~mag; down to G-stars at distances\nof 0.3-2~kpc, excluding stars in clusters). The secondary mass-function is\ngenerally consistent with a Kroupa initial stellar function; if extrapolated to\nlower mass companion stars we then might expect a wide-binary fraction of $\\sim\n27\\pm5\\%$. In addition we use these data as a verification sample to test the\nexistence of ultra-wide binaries among neutron stars (NSs) and black holes\n(BHs). We propose that the discovery of such binary can provide unique\nconstraints on the weakest natal kicks possible for NSs/BHs. If a compact\nobject is formed in an ultra-wide binary and receives a very-low natal kick,\nsuch a binary should survive as a common proper motion pair. We therefore use\nGaia data to search for ultra-wide companions to pulsars (normal and\nmillisecond ones) and X-ray binaries. We find no reliable pairs. Future data\ncould potentially provide stringent constraints through this method. \n\n"}

The line\nenergies range from 5.8 to 6.8 keV with widths from unresolved to 0.6 keV,\nconsistent with emission close to spinning black holes viewed at different\ninclination angles. We also confirm the positive offset from the\nIwasawa-Taniguchi effect, the inverse correlation between the FeK$\\alpha$\nequivalent width and the X-ray luminosity in AGN, where our measured equivalent\nwidths are larger in lensed quasars. We attribute this effect to microlensing,\nand perform a microlensing likelihood analysis to constrain the emission size\nof the relativistic reflection region and the spin of supermassive black holes,\nassuming that the X-ray corona and the reflection region, responsible for the\niron emission line, both follow power-law emissivity profiles. The microlensing\nanalysis yields strong constraints on the spin and emissivity index of the\nreflection component for Q2237+0305, with $a > 0.92$ and $n > 5.4$.

Pre-collapse Evolution and\n  Pulsational Mass Ejection Abstract: We calculate the evolution of massive stars, which undergo pulsational\npair-instability (PPI) when the O-rich core is formed. The evolution from the\nmain-sequence through the onset of PPI is calculated for stars with the initial\nmasses of $80 - 140$ $M_{\\odot}$ and metallicities of $Z = 10^{-3} - 1.0$\n$Z_\\odot$. Because of mass loss, $Z \\leq 0.5$ $Z_\\odot$ is necessary for stars\nto form He cores massive enough (i.e., mass $>40 ~M_\\odot$) to undergo PPI. The\nhydrodynamical phase of evolution from PPI through the beginning of Fe core\ncollapse is calculated for the He cores with masses of $40 - 62 ~M_\\odot$ and\n$Z = 0$. During PPI, electron-positron pair production causes a rapid\ncontraction of the O-rich core which triggers explosive O-burning and a\npulsation of the core. We study the mass dependence of the pulsation dynamics,\nthermodynamics, and nucleosynthesis. The pulsations are stronger for more\nmassive He cores and result in such a large amount of mass ejection such as $3\n- 13$ $M_\\odot$ for $40 - 62 ~M_\\odot$ He cores. These He cores eventually\nundergo Fe-core collapse. The $64 ~M_\\odot$ He core undergoes complete\ndisruption and becomes a pair-instability supernova. The H-free circumstellar\nmatter ejected around these He cores is massive enough for to explain the\nobserved light curve of Type I (H-free) superluminous supernovae with\ncircumstellar interaction. We also note that the mass ejection sets the maximum\nmass of black holes (BHs) to be $\\sim 50$ $M_{\\odot}$, which is consistent with\nthe masses of BHs recently detected by VIRGO and aLIGO. \n\n"}
