While one of them was clearly caused by stellar activity from the\nsecondary late-type main-sequence star, our analysis indicated that the white\ndwarf primary star is potentially the origin of the second component. However,\nthe low resolution of the data means that our interpretation remains ambiguous.\nWe here use time-series UVES data to compare the radial velocities of the\nHalpha emission components to those of metal absorption lines from the primary\nand secondary stars. We find that the weaker component most certainly\noriginates in the white dwarf and is probably caused by accretion. An abundance\nanalysis of the white dwarf spectrum yields accretion rates that are consistent\nwith mass loss from the secondary due to a stellar wind. The second and\nstronger Halpha component is attributed to stellar activity on the secondary\nstar. An active secondary is likely to be present because of the occurrence of\na flare in our time-resolved spectroscopy.

Without thus\nappealing to the Euler-Lagrange equation, we establish for all configurations\nwhich have \"almost minimal energy\" the asymptotic roundness and radius of the\ndroplets, and the fact that they asymptotically shrink to points whose\narrangement minimizes the renormalized energy in some averaged sense. Via a\nkind of $\\Gamma$-equivalence, the obtained results also yield an expansion of\nthe minimal energy for the original Ohta-Kawasaki energy.

It\nhas been seen as improbable that we would find planets in such a small final\nfraction of their lives. The favored solution has been that the tidal\ndissipation is much weaker than expected, which would mean that the final\ninfall would be a larger fraction of the planets' life. We find no reason to\nexclude the explanation that a small number of planets are continuously sent\nmigrating inwards such that these planets indeed are in the last fraction of\ntheir lives. Following the observation that the distribution of medium planets\ndisfavors tidal dissipation being significantly weaker than has been found from\nobservations of binary stars, we now show that the numbers of planets in such a\n\"flow\" of excess planets migrating inwards is low enough that even depletion of\nthe three-day pileup is a plausible source.

It was shown in our previous work that at 1\nAU, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is completely suppressed when both\nOhmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (AD) are taken into account,\nresulting in a laminar flow with accretion driven by magnetocentrifugal wind.\nIn this work, we study the radial dependence of the laminar wind solution using\nlocal shearing-box simulations. Scaling relation on the angular momentum\ntransport for the laminar wind is obtained, and we find that the wind-driven\naccretion rate can be approximated as\nM_dot~0.91x10^(-8)R_AU^(1.21)(B_z/10mG)^(0.93)M_Sun/yr, where B_z is the\nstrength of the large-scale vertical magnetic field threading the disk. The\nresult is independent of disk surface density. Four criteria are outlined for\nthe existence of the laminar wind solution: 1). Ohmic resistivity dominated\nmidplane region; 2). AD dominated disk upper layer; 3). Presence of (not too\nweak) net vertical magnetic flux. 4). Sufficiently well ionized gas beyond disk\nsurface. All these criteria are likely to be met in the inner region of the\ndisk from ~0.3 AU to about 5-10 AU for typical PPD accretion rates. Beyond this\nradius, angular momentum transport is likely to proceed due to a combination of\nthe MRI and disk wind, and eventually dominated by the MRI (in the presence of\nstrong AD) in the outer disk. Our simulation results provide key ingredients\nfor a new paradigm on the accretion processes in PPDs. \n\n"}

Many high-dimensional data, such as face\nimages and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of low-dimensional\nsubspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively\nstudied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters\ncorresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. However,\nlow-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world\nobservations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models.\nWe propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces\nusing matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear norm, as the optimization\ncriteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for\ndata from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a a maximally\nseparated structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce\nvariations within subspaces, and increase separation between subspaces for a\nmore robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace\nclustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing\nsubspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results here presented help to\nfurther support the underlying framework.

The models proposed\nrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of\nencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into\na fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation.

A phenomenological finite-range force for the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$\ninteraction is considered as well. Equation of state (EoS) of NS matter is\nobtained in the framework of density functional theory, and\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are solved to obtain the mass-radius\nrelations of NSs.

However, various\ndiscrepancies with other solar indices recently motivated a full re-calibration\nof this series.

When training data are obtained from internet, the labels are\nlikely to be ambiguous and inaccurate. This paper presents a Light CNN\nframework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with\nmassive noisy labels. First, we introduce a variation of maxout activation,\ncalled Max-Feature-Map (MFM), into each convolutional layer of CNN. Different\nfrom maxout activation that uses many feature maps to linearly approximate an\narbitrary convex activation function, MFM does so via a competitive\nrelationship. MFM can not only separate noisy and informative signals but also\nplay the role of feature selection between two feature maps. Second, three\nnetworks are carefully designed to obtain better performance meanwhile reducing\nthe number of parameters and computational costs. Lastly, a semantic\nbootstrapping method is proposed to make the prediction of the networks more\nconsistent with noisy labels.

This\ndetermination relies on the calculation of deep-inelastic structure functions\nin the FONLL scheme, generalized to account for massive charm-initiated\ncontributions. In contrast to the usual situation in which the charm PDF is\nassumed to be generated perturbatively by pair radiation off gluons and light\nquarks, vanishing at a scale set by the value of the charm mass m_c, we find\nthat the fitted charm PDF vanishes within uncertainties at a scale Q~1.5 GeV\nfor all x<~0.1, independent of the value of m_c used in the coefficient\nfunctions. We also find some evidence that the charm PDF at large x>~0.1 and\nlow scales does not vanish, but rather has an \"intrinsic\" component, very\nweakly scale dependent and almost independent of the value of m_c, carrying\nabout 1% of the total momentum of the proton. The uncertainties in all other\nPDFs are only slightly increased by the inclusion of fitted charm, while the\ndependence of these PDFs on m_c is significantly reduced. When the EMC charm\nstructure function dataset is included, it is well described by the fit, and\nPDF uncertainties in the fitted charm PDF are significantly reduced, though we\nverify that excluding the EMC data does not qualitatively modify any of our\nfindings. The increased stability with respect to m_c persists at high scales\nand is the main implication of our results for LHC phenomenology.

Similar to the region-based\nCNNs, our proposed network consists of the region proposal component and the\nregion-of-interest (RoI) detection component. However, far apart of that\nnetwork, there are two main contributions in our proposed network that play a\nsignificant role to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in face detection.\nFirstly, the multi-scale information is grouped both in region proposal and RoI\ndetection to deal with tiny face regions.

In this work we offer some\ntheoretical guarantees for networks with piecewise affine activation functions,\nwhich have in recent years become the norm.

Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat\nthe disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc\nlocally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity. Using numerical simulations we\ndemonstrate that this source of vorticity can lead to the growth of a single\nlarge scale vortex in $\\sim 100$ orbits, which is capable of trapping\nparticles.

The\nrecognition sub- network are responsible for producing discriminative feature\nrepresentations using the hallucinated images as inputs generated by\nhallucination sub-network. During training, we feed LR facial images into the\nnetwork and optimize the parameters by minimizing two loss items, i.e. 1) face\nhallucination loss measured by the pixel wise difference between the ground\ntruth HR images and network-generated images; and 2) verification loss which is\nmeasured by the classification error and intra-class distance. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LFW and YTF datasets. The experimental results show that\nour method can achieve recognition accuracy 97.95% on 4x down-sampled LFW\ntesting set, outperforming the accuracy 96.35% of conventional face recognition\nmodel. And on the more challenging YTF dataset, we achieve recognition accuracy\n90.65%, a margin over the recognition accuracy 89.45% obtained by conventional\nface recognition model on the 4x down-sampled version. \n\n"}

To train such a\nwell-designed deep network, tremendous amounts of data is indispensable. Long\ntail distribution specifically refers to the fact that a small number of\ngeneric entities appear frequently while other objects far less existing.\nConsidering the existence of long tail distribution of the real world data,\nlarge but uniform distributed data are usually hard to retrieve. Empirical\nexperiences and analysis show that classes with more samples will pose greater\nimpact on the feature learning process and inversely cripple the whole models\nfeature extracting ability on tail part data. Contrary to most of the existing\nworks that alleviate this problem by simply cutting the tailed data for uniform\ndistributions across the classes, this paper proposes a new loss function\ncalled range loss to effectively utilize the whole long tailed data in training\nprocess. More specifically, range loss is designed to reduce overall\nintra-personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences within one\nmini-batch simultaneously when facing even extremely unbalanced data. The\noptimization objective of range loss is the $k$ greatest range's harmonic mean\nvalues in one class and the shortest inter-class distance within one batch.\nExtensive experiments on two famous and challenging face recognition benchmarks\n(Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces (YTF) not only demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach in overcoming the long tail effect\nbut also show the good generalization ability of the proposed approach. \n\n"}

While\nthe introduction of affordable sensors have helped the scalability issue by\nmaking the sensors more accessible, the application of such sensors in a\nloosely controlled human-computer interaction setup is not yet studied for\naffective image tagging. On the other hand, deep convolutional neural networks\nhave boosted the performance of vision-based techniques significantly in recent\nyears. To investigate the current status in regard to affective image tagging,\nwe (1) introduce a new eye movement dataset using an affordable eye tracker,\n(2) study the use of deep neural networks for pleasantness recognition, (3)\ninvestigate the gap between deep features and eye movements. To meet these\nends, we record eye movements in a less controlled setup, akin to daily\nhuman-computer interaction. We assess features from eye movements, visual\nfeatures, and their combination. Our results show that (1) recognizing natural\nimage pleasantness from eye movement under less restricted setup is difficult\nand previously used techniques are prone to fail, and (2) visual class\ncategories are strong cues for predicting pleasantness, due to their\ncorrelation with emotions, necessitating careful study of this phenomenon. This\nlatter finding is alerting as some deep learning approaches may fit to the\nclass category bias. \n\n"}

However, such a projection function is only concerned with predicting\nthe training seen class semantic representation (e.g.~attribute prediction) or\nclassification. When applied to test data, which in the context of ZSL contains\ndifferent (unseen) classes without training data, a ZSL model typically suffers\nfrom the project domain shift problem. In this work, we present a novel\nsolution to ZSL based on learning a Semantic AutoEncoder (SAE). Taking the\nencoder-decoder paradigm, an encoder aims to project a visual feature vector\ninto the semantic space as in the existing ZSL models. However, the decoder\nexerts an additional constraint, that is, the projection/code must be able to\nreconstruct the original visual feature.

First, we\nbuild a face feature extraction model, and improve its performance, especially\nfor the persons with very limited training samples, by introducing a\nregularizer to the cross entropy loss for the multi-nomial logistic regression\n(MLR) learning.

Second, we build a\nmulti-class classifier using MLR on top of the learned face feature extraction\nmodel. Since the standard MLR has poor generalization capability for the\none-shot classes even if these classes have been oversampled, we propose a\nnovel supervision signal called underrepresented-classes promotion loss, which\naligns the norms of the weight vectors of the one-shot classes (a.k.a.\nunderrepresented-classes) to those of the normal classes.

In particular, the accretion shock region, where the accreting\nmaterial is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its inward bulk\nmotion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first\ntime the motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a\nDoppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This\ntest should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component in CTTS,\nand constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in\nthe X-ray emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the\nposition of a selected sample of emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW\nHya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity to vary. We found that\nthe plasma at T~2-4 MK has a line-of-sight velocity of 38.3+/-5.1 km/s with\nrespect to the stellar photosphere. This result definitively confirms that this\nX-ray-emitting material originates in the post-shock region, at the base of the\naccretion stream, and not in coronal structures. The comparison of the observed\nvelocity along the line of sight, 38.3+/-5.1 km/s, with the inferred intrinsic\nvelocity of the post shock of TW Hya, v_post~110-120 km/s, indicates that the\nfootpoints of the accretion streams on TW Hya are located at low latitudes on\nthe stellar surface. Our results indicate that complex magnetic field\ngeometries, such as that of TW Hya, permit low-latitude accretion spots.\nMoreover, since on TW Hya the redshift of the soft X-ray emission is very\nsimilar to that of the narrow component of the CIV resonance doublet at 1550\nAng, as found by Ardila et al. (2013), then the plasma at 2-4 MK and that at\n0.1 MK likely originate in the same post-shock regions. \n\n"}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel face\ndetector, named FaceBoxes, with superior performance on both speed and\naccuracy. Specifically, our method has a lightweight yet powerful network\nstructure that consists of the Rapidly Digested Convolutional Layers (RDCL) and\nthe Multiple Scale Convolutional Layers (MSCL). The RDCL is designed to enable\nFaceBoxes to achieve real-time speed on the CPU.

Satellite images have been\nwidely utilized for various purposes, such as natural environment monitoring\n(pollution, forest or rivers), transportation improvement and prompt emergency\nresponse to disasters. However, the obscurity caused by clouds makes it\nunstable to monitor the situation on the ground with the visible light camera.\nImages captured by a longer wavelength are introduced to reduce the effects of\nclouds. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is such an example that improves\nvisibility even the clouds exist. On the other hand, the spatial resolution\ndecreases as the wavelength increases. Furthermore, the images captured by long\nwavelengths differs considerably from those captured by visible light in terms\nof their appearance. Therefore, we propose a network that can remove clouds and\ngenerate visible light images from the multispectral images taken as inputs.\nThis is achieved by extending the input channels of cGANs to be compatible with\nmultispectral images. The networks are trained to output images that are close\nto the ground truth using the images synthesized with clouds over the ground\ntruth as inputs. In the available dataset, the proportion of images of the\nforest or the sea is very high, which will introduce bias in the training\ndataset if uniformly sampled from the original dataset. Thus, we utilize the\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to improve the problem of\nbias in the training dataset. Finally, we confirm the feasibility of the\nproposed network on the dataset of four bands images, which include three\nvisible light bands and one near-infrared (NIR) band. \n\n"}

The risk of colorectal cancer\ncan be mitigated by the identification and removal of premalignant lesions\nthrough optical colonoscopy. Unfortunately, conventional colonoscopy misses\nmore than 20% of the polyps that should be removed, due in part to poor\ncontrast of lesion topography. Imaging tissue topography during a colonoscopy\nis difficult because of the size constraints of the endoscope and the deforming\nmucosa.

In this paper, we\npresent a method that avoids these restrictions, using a joint deep\nconvolutional neural network-conditional random field (CNN-CRF) framework.\nEstimated depth is used to reconstruct the topography of the surface of the\ncolon from a single image.

To our knowledge, this\nis the first work to introduce a dictionary-based representation that is\ninspired by Product Quantization and which is learned end-to-end, and thus\nbenefits from the supervised signal. DPQ explicitly learns soft and hard\nrepresentations to enable an efficient and accurate asymmetric search, by using\na straight-through estimator.

However, there are\ntwo big drawbacks to CNN's: their failure to take into account of important\nspatial hierarchies between features, and their lack of rotational invariance.\nAs long as certain key features of an object are present in the test data,\nCNN's classify the test data as the object, disregarding features' relative\nspatial orientation to each other. This causes false positives. The lack of\nrotational invariance in CNN's would cause the network to incorrectly assign\nthe object another label, causing false negatives.

The linear semigroup assumes a central role: it is bounded on\nthe domain of its generator for all time t > 0. This permits eigenfunction\napproximation within the semigroup framework as a tool for the study of weak\nsolutions. The semigroup convolution formula, known to be rigorous on the\ngenerator domain, is extended to the interpretation of weak solution on an\narbitrary time interval. A separate approximation theory can be developed by\nusing the invariance of the semigroup on eigenspaces of the Laplacian as the\nsystem evolves.

In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization\nincreases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally\nhigher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily\ndistinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which\npredicts almost no wavelength dependence.

One hurdle is that CT\nimages can exhibit high noise and low contrast, particularly in lower dosages.\nTo address this, we focus on a preprocessing method for CT images that uses\nstacked generative adversarial networks (SGAN) approach. The first GAN reduces\nthe noise in the CT image and the second GAN generates a higher resolution\nimage with enhanced boundaries and high contrast.

A clinically validated AI\nsystem that can reliably separate normals from abnormals can be invaluble\nparticularly in low-resource settings. The aim of this study was to develop and\nvalidate a deep learning system to detect various abnormalities seen on a chest\nX-ray. Methods: A deep learning system was trained on 2.3 million chest X-rays\nand their corresponding radiology reports to identify various abnormalities\nseen on a Chest X-ray. The system was tested against - 1. A three-radiologist\nmajority on an independent, retrospectively collected set of 2000\nX-rays(CQ2000) 2.

This\napplies both to the case of supervised detection, where the known template is\nexpected to match in just a few areas and unsupervised anomaly detection, as\nanomalies are rare by definition. This problem is frequently related to the\nimaging applications, i.e. detection within the scene acquired by a camera. To\nmaximize available data about the scene, hyperspectral cameras are used; at\neach pixel, they record spectral data in hundreds of narrow bands.\n  The typical feature of hyperspectral imaging is that characteristic\nproperties of target materials are visible in the small number of bands, where\nlight of certain wavelength interacts with characteristic molecules. A\ntarget-independent band selection method based on statistical principles is a\nversatile tool for solving this problem in different practical applications.\n  Combination of a regular background and a rare standing out anomaly will\nproduce a distortion in the joint distribution of hyperspectral pixels. Higher\nOrder Cumulants Tensors are a natural `window' into this distribution, allowing\nto measure properties and suggest candidate bands for removal. While there have\nbeen attempts at producing band selection algorithms based on the 3 rd\ncumulant's tensor i.e. the joint skewness, the literature lacks a systematic\nanalysis of how the order of the cumulant tensor used affects effectiveness of\nband selection in detection applications.

Lip-reading driven\nspeech enhancement significantly outperforms benchmark audio-only approaches at\nlow signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, at high SNRs or low levels of\nbackground noise, visual cues become fairly less effective for speech\nenhancement. Therefore, a more optimal, context-aware audio-visual (AV) system\nis required, that contextually utilises both visual and noisy audio features\nand effectively accounts for different noisy conditions. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel contextual AV switching component that contextually exploits\nAV cues with respect to different operating conditions to estimate clean audio,\nwithout requiring any SNR estimation. The switching module switches between\nvisual-only (V-only), audio-only (A-only), and both AV cues at low, high and\nmoderate SNR levels, respectively. The contextual AV switching component is\ndeveloped by integrating a convolutional neural network and long-short-term\nmemory network.

In this paper we are concerned with\nweak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, that is\nvector fields that satisfy both the SEI and the LEI (but not necessarily solve\nthe Navier-Stokes equations).

We assume that the waveguide is thin in one of these\ntransverse directions, which leads us to consider a Kirchhoff-Love plate model\nin a locally perturbed 2D strip. For time harmonic scattering problems in\nunbounded domains, well-posedness does not hold in a classical setting and it\nis necessary to prescribe the behaviour of the solution at infinity. This is\nchallenging for the model that we consider and constitutes our main\ncontribution. Two types of boundary conditions are considered: either the strip\nis simply supported or the strip is clamped. The two boundary conditions are\ntreated with two different methods.

Conventional caricature generation approaches mainly use low-level\ngeometric transformations such as image warping to generate exaggerated images,\nwhich lack richness and diversity in terms of content and style. The recent\nprogress in generative adversarial networks (GANs) makes it possible to learn\nan image-to-image transformation from data, so that richer contents and styles\ncan be generated. However, directly applying the GAN-based models to this task\nleads to unsatisfactory results because there is a large variance in the\ncaricature distribution. Moreover, some models require strictly paired training\ndata which largely limits their usage scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nCariGAN overcome these problems. Instead of training on paired data, CariGAN\nlearns transformations only from weakly paired images.

Based on HandRGBD, we explore variants\nof the proposed approach in an ablative study and determine the best performing\none. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate that hand\ndepth estimation from a single RGB frame can be achieved with an accuracy of\n22mm, which is comparable to the accuracy achieved by contemporary low-cost\ndepth cameras. Such a 3D reconstruction of hands based on RGB information is\nvaluable as a final result on its own right, but also as an input to several\nother hand analysis and perception algorithms that require depth input.\nEssentially, in such a context, the proposed approach bridges the gap between\nRGB and RGBD, by making all existing RGBD-based methods applicable to RGB\ninput. \n\n"}

For each\nx in Omega, let u^epsilon(x) be the value for player I of the following\ntwo-player, zero-sum game. The initial game position is x. At each stage, a\nfair coin is tossed and the player who wins the toss chooses a vector v of\nlength at most epsilon to add to the game position, after which a random\n``noise vector'' with mean zero and variance (q/p)|v|^2 in each orthogonal\ndirection is also added. The game ends when the game position reaches some y on\nthe boundary of Omega, and player I's payoff is F(y).\n  We show that (for sufficiently regular Omega) as epsilon tends to zero the\nfunctions u^epsilon converge uniformly to the unique p-harmonic extension of F.\nUsing a modified game (in which epsilon gets smaller as the game position\napproaches the boundary), we prove similar statements for general bounded\ndomains Omega and resolutive functions F.\n  These games and their variants interpolate between the tug of war games\nstudied by Peres, Schramm, Sheffield, and Wilson (p=infinity) and the\nmotion-by-curvature games introduced by Spencer and studied by Kohn and Serfaty\n(p=1).

For this purpose, the\nEgorov-type theorem is established with canonical transformations in the form\nof a class of Fourier integral operators, and their weighted L2-boundedness\nproperties are derived. This allows us to globally reduce general dispersive\nequations to normal forms in one or two dimensions. Then, several comparison\nprinciples are introduced to relate different smoothing estimates by comparing\ncertain expressions involving their symbols. As a result, it is shown that the\nmajority of smoothing estimates for different equations are equivalent to each\nother. Moreover, new estimates as well as several refinements of known results\nare obtained. The proofs are considerably simplified. A comprehensive analysis\nof smoothing estimates for dispersive and also non-dispersive equations with\nconstant coefficients is presented. Applications are given to the detailed\ndescription of smoothing properties of the Schrodinger, relativistic\nSchrodinger, wave, Klein-Gordon, and other equations. Critical cases of some\nestimates and their relation to the trace estimates are discussed. \n\n"}
