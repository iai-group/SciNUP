The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result. \n\n"}

The decoherence parameters as well as their energy\ndependence are chosen in such a way that the damping affects only oscillations\nwith the large (atmospheric) $\\Delta m^2$ and rapidly decreases with the\nneutrino energy. This allows us to reconcile the positive LSND signal with\nMiniBooNE and other null-result experiments. The standard explanations of\nsolar, atmospheric, KamLAND and MINOS data are not affected. No new particles,\nand in particular, no sterile neutrinos are needed. The LSND signal is\ncontrolled by the 1-3 mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ and, depending on the degree\nof damping, yields $0.0014 < \\sin^2\\theta_{13} < 0.034$ at $3\\sigma$.

These approaches allow us to\ndifferentiate between the preferred (global best fit) and allowed (g.o.f.)\nparameter regions. It is hard to find WIMP masses and couplings consistent with\nall existing data sets. For spin-independent (SI) interactions, the best fit\nDAMA regions are ruled out to the 3$\\sigma$ C.L., even with channeling taken\ninto account. However, for WIMP masses of ~8 GeV some parameters outside these\nregions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the DAMA data and are\ncompatible with all 90% C.L. upper limits from negative searches, when\nchanneling is included.

Current direct and\nindirect bounds on such exotic quarks restrict their masses to be between 300\nand 600 GeV, and the dark matter's mass may be anywhere below m_T'. We simulate\nthe signal and main backgrounds with MadGraph/MadEvent-Pythia-PGS4.

In\nthis paper we attempt to address both the sense and the sensitivity of such\nproposals. Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and\nunambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana\nneutrino mass, m_bb. In order to make sense of how the different experimental\napproaches compare, we apply this recipe to a selection of proposals, comparing\nthe resulting sensitivities. We also propose a \"physics-motivated range\" (PMR)\nof the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different\nnuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in\nterms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,\nisotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass. For each\nproposal, both a reference and an optimistic scenario for the experimental\nperformance are studied. In the reference scenario we find that all the\nproposals will be able to partially explore the degenerate spectrum, without\nfully covering it, although four of them (KamLAND-Zen, CUORE, NEXT and EXO)\nwill approach the 50 meV boundary.

However, 4G variations (BSM4) are possible if the new\nparticle is not the SM Higgs boson and/or if other new quanta modify its\nproduction and decay rates. Since LHC searches have pushed 4G quarks to high\nmass and strong coupling where perturbation theory eventually fails, we examine\nthe leading nondecoupling EW (electroweak) corrections at two loop order to\nestimate the domain of validity for perturbation theory. We find that the two\nloop hypercharge correction, which has not been included in previous EW fits of\n4G models, makes the largest quark sector contribution to the rho parameter,\nmuch larger even than the nominally leading one loop term. Because it is large\nand negative, it has a big effect on the EW fits.

We obtain for the first time expressions in the\nNon-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism for heavy quarkonium\ndifferential cross sections as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity.\nWe observe that the production of color singlet heavy quark pairs is sensitive\nto both \"quadrupole\" and \"dipole\" Wilson line correlators, whose energy\nevolution is described by the Balitsky-JIMWLK equations. In contrast, the color\noctet channel is sensitive to dipole correlators alone. In a quasi-classical\napproximation, our results for the color singlet channel reduce to those of\nDominguez et. al.

The existence\nof such particles is strongly motivated by theory, as they can simultaneously\nexplain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, account for the pattern of\nneutrino masses and oscillations and provide a Dark Matter candidate.\n  Cosmological constraints on the properties of HNLs now indicate that the\nmajority of the interesting parameter space for such particles was beyond the\nreach of the previous searches at the PS191, BEBC, CHARM, CCFR and NuTeV\nexperiments. For HNLs with mass below 2 GeV, the proposed experiment will\nimprove on the sensitivity of previous searches by four orders of magnitude and\nwill cover a major fraction of the parameter space favoured by theoretical\nmodels.\n  The experiment requires a 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS with a total of\n2x10^20 protons on target, achievable within five years of data taking. The\nproposed detector will reconstruct exclusive HNL decays and measure the HNL\nmass. The apparatus is based on existing technologies and consists of a target,\na hadron absorber, a muon shield, a decay volume and two magnetic\nspectrometers, each of which has a 0.5 Tm magnet, a calorimeter and a muon\ndetector.

Based on such a prediction, in this\npaper we investigate phenomena in the neighborhood of an accelerating electron\nin the inertial frame. The model we consider is the four-dimensional\nKlein-Gordon real scalar field model with the Higgs type potential term at the\nfinite temperature identified with the Unruh temperature on the de Sitter\nspace-time. We calculate the one-loop effective potential in the inertial frame\nwith the corrections by the thermal radiation rooted in the Unruh effect in the\naccelerating frame. In this calculation, we take into account that the\nbackground space-time is deformed due to the field theory's corrected one-loop\neffective potential. Based on such an analysis, we illustrate the restoration\nof the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the variation of the background\nspace-time, and we examine the accelerating particle's world-line and the\namount of the energy corresponding to the change of the acceleration. \n\n"}

Scenarios featuring superparticles with\ndetector-scale lifetimes have therefore remained a tantalizing possibility for\nsub-TeV SUSY, since explicit limits are relatively sparse. Nonetheless, the\nextremely low backgrounds of the few existing searches for collider-stable and\ndisplaced new particles facilitates recastings into powerful long-lived\nsuperparticle searches, even for models for which those searches are highly\nnon-optimized. In this paper, we assess the status of such models in the\ncontext of baryonic R-parity violation, gauge mediation, and mini-split SUSY.\nWe explore a number of common simplified spectra where hadronic decays can be\nimportant, employing recasts of LHC searches that utilize different detector\nsystems and final-state objects.

As the\neffective theory for the walking technicolor at the scales relevant to the LHC\nexperiment, we take a scale-invariant version of the hidden local symmetry\nmodel so constructed as to accommodate technipions, technivector mesons, and\nthe technidilaton in such a way that the model respects spontaneously broken\nchiral and scale symmetries of the underlying walking technicolor. In\nparticular, the technidilaton, a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson of the\n(approximate) scale symmetry predicted in the walking technicolor, has been\nshown to be successfully identified with the 125 GeV Higgs. Currently available\nLHC limits on those technihadrons are used to fix the couplings of technivector\nmesons to the standard-model fermions and weak gauge bosons. We find that the\ntechnirho's are mainly produced through the Drell-Yan process and predominantly\ndecay to the dibosons, which accounts for the currently reported excess at\naround 2 TeV. The consistency with the electroweak precision test and other\npossible discovery channels of the 2 TeV technirhos are also addressed. \n\n"}

By sampling all kinematically allowed values of $p_{\\perp}$\nand $m_{vis/inv}$ according to their joint probability distributions determined\nby the MC simulations, the mass of the mother resonance is assumed to lie at\nthe position with the maximal probability. Since $p_{\\perp}$ and $m_{vis/inv}$\nare invariant under the boost in the $\\tau$ lepton direction, the joint\nprobability distributions are independent upon $\\tau$'s origin.

Because of\nthe nature of proton-proton processes, observables based on the measurement of\nthe direction and energy of leptons provide the most precise signatures.\n  In the present paper, we concentrate on the angular distribution of leptons\nfrom W to l nu decays in the lepton-pair rest-frame. The vector nature of the\nintermediate state imposes that distributions are to a good precision described\nby spherical polynomials of at most second order. We argue, that contrary to\ngeneral belief often expressed in the literature, the full set of angular\ncoefficients can be measured experimentally, despite the presence in the final\nstate of neutrino escaping detection. There is thus no principle difference\nwith respect to the phenomenology of the Z/gamma to l^+ l^- Drell-Yan process.\n  We show also, that with the proper choice of the coordinate frames, only one\ncoefficient in this polynomial decomposition remains sizable, even in the\npresence of one or more high p_T jets.

In the case of the charm and bottom quarks,\nthe usual decoupling of one heavy mass at a time no longer holds, since the\nratio of the respective masses, $\\eta = m_c^2/m_b^2 \\sim 1/10$, is not small\nenough. Therefore, the usual variable flavor number scheme (VFNS) has to be\ngeneralized. The renormalization procedure in the two--mass case is different\nfrom the single mass case derived in \\cite{Bierenbaum:2009mv}. We present the\nmoments $N=2,4$ and $6$ for all contributing operator matrix elements,\nexpanding in the ratio $\\eta$.

We also calculate the\ntwo-mass scalar integrals of all topologies contributing to the gluonic\noperator matrix element $A_{gg}$.

Existing\napproaches attempt to tackle this problem by either synthesizing visible faces\nfrom NIR faces, extracting domain-invariant features from these modalities, or\nprojecting heterogeneous data onto a common latent space for cross-modal\nmatching. In this paper, we take a different approach in which we make use of\nthe Disentangled Variational Representation (DVR) for cross-modal matching.\nFirst, we model a face representation with an intrinsic identity information\nand its within-person variations. By exploring the disentangled latent variable\nspace, a variational lower bound is employed to optimize the approximate\nposterior for NIR and VIS representations. Second, aiming at obtaining more\ncompact and discriminative disentangled latent space, we impose a minimization\nof the identity information for the same subject and a relaxed correlation\nalignment constraint between the NIR and VIS modality variations.

The third analysis reconstructs\nb-hadrons topologically and exploits the $b \\to c$ cascade charge structure to\ndetermine the flavor of the b-hadron at decay. All three analyses take\nadvantage of the large forward-backward asymmetry of the polarized $Z^0 \\to b\n\\bar{b}$ decays and information in the hemisphere opposite to the reconstructed\nB vertex to determine the b-hadron flavor at production. The results of the\nthree analyses are combined to exclude the following values of the $B_s^0 -\n\\bar{B_s^0}$ oscillation frequency: $\\Delta m_s < 7.6 ps^{-1}$ and $11.8 <\n\\Delta m_s < 14.8 ps^{-1}$ at the 95% confidence level. \n\n"}

Large values of the NSI couplings are accommodated if the vacuum\noscillation parameters are changed from their standard values. Short and medium\nbaseline neutrino beams can break this degeneracy by measuring the true vacuum\noscillation parameters with the muon neutrino disappearance mode, for which the\nmatter effects are negligible or subdominant. These experiments can also search\nfor the nu_e-nu_tau flavor changing effects directly, by looking for\nnu_mu->nu_e conversion caused by the intervening matter. We discuss both of\nthese methods for the case of MINOS.

Ionization cooling is provided by high pressure hydrogen\ngas which removes both transverse and longitudinal momentum. Lost longitudinal\nmomentum is replaced using radio frequency (RF) cavities, giving a net\ntransverse emittance reduction. The longer path length in the hydrogen of\nhigher momentum muons decreases longitudinal emittance at the expense of\ntransverse emittance. Thus emittance exchange allows these rings to cool in all\nsix dimensions and not just transversely. Alternatively, if the RF is located\nafter the ring, it may be possible to cool the muons by stopping them as they\nspiral adiabatically into a central swarm. As momentum goes to zero, the\nmomentum spread goes to zero. The resulting cooled muons can lead to an intense\nmuon beam which could be a source for neutrino factories or muon colliders. \n\n"}
