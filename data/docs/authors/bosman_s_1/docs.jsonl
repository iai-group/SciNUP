We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux\nratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same\nhalo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is\ncomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is\nnot. The probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violations\nof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. We therefore conclude that the amount of\nsubstructure in the central regions of the Aquarius haloes is insufficient to\nexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.\nThese conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignore\nthe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability. \n\n"}

An adiabatic feedback mechanism was adopted where gas cooling\nwas prevented to generate galactic winds without explicit wind particles. The\nsimulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly\nconsistent with observations until z $\\sim$ 0.5, and a steady evolution of the\nuniversal neutral hydrogen fraction ($\\Omega_{\\rm H I}$). At z=0, about 40% of\nthe baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals\n(80%-90%) are locked in stars. At higher z the proportion of metals in the IGM\nis higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The IGM metals primarily\nreside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history. The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5. Galactic winds most efficiently enrich\nthe IGM for halos in the intermediate mass range $10^{10}$M$_{\\sun}$ -\n$10^{11}$ M$_{\\sun}$. At the low mass end gas is prevented from accreting onto\nhalos and has very low metallicities. At the high mass end, the fraction of\nhalo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar mass\nfraction of the galaxies. This is likely because of the decrease in star\nformation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which\nallows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal\ndiffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content\nin favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas. Diffusion\nsignificantly increases the amount of gas with low metallicities and changes\nthe density-metallicity relation. \n\n"}

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that\nis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest\nhalo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter\npotential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy.

In addition,\nwe confirm and clarify several enormous stellar over-densities previously\nreported in the literature, but never before interpreted as tidal streams.

Unlike RZ2109, the X-ray spectrum of\nthis BH source did not change during the period of rapid variability. In\naddition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-term\nvariability. After being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a span\nof 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, or\nmarginally detectable, in deep Chandra and XMM observations.

Inefficient fueling (and/or\nfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we\nargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of\nthese effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of\nBH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale\ncorresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local\ndynamical times). This predicts that the inferred delay will vary in a specific\nmanner with the radius over which the star formation rate is measured.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is a\npromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics.

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop.

These methods propose a more rigorous statistical framework\nwithin which to determine the LF compared to some of the more traditional\nmethods. I also look at how photometric redshift estimations are being\nincorporated into the LF methodology as well as considering the construction of\nbivariate LFs. Finally, I review the ongoing development of completeness\nestimators which test some of the fundamental assumptions going into LF\nestimators and can be powerful probes of any residual systematic effects\ninherent magnitude-redshift data. \n\n"}

Two mechanisms are usually considered: the\ncurrent blockage due to repulsion at the occupied trap states, and the noise\nfrom electrons hopping across a trap. We extend previous studies of\nnoninteracting traps to the case where the traps have on-site electron\nrepulsion inside one ballistic channel.

JCs in the galaxy center heat up their MACHOs by tidal\nforces, which makes them expand, so that coagulation and star formation occurs.\nBeing continuously fed by matter from bypassing JCs, the central star(s) may\ntransform into a super massive black hole. It has a fast $t^3$ growth during\nthe first mega years, and a slow $t^{1/3}$ growth at giga years. JCs disrupted\nby a close encounter with this black hole can provide matter for the bulge.\nThose that survive can be so agitated that they form stars inside them and\nbecome globular star clusters.

Classical bulges are thought to form by\ngalactic merger with bursty star formation, whereas pseudobulges are suggested\nto form by secular evolution due to spiral arms and a barred structure\nfunneling gas into the galactic centre. Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This\nbulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the\nhigh-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.\nTherefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties. We perform\na high-resolution N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation for\nthe formation of the clump-origin bulge in an isolated galaxy model and study\ndynamical and chemical properties of the clump-origin bulge.

In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind.

The apex of the\noutflowing gas spatially coincides with the strongest [FeII] emission peak and\nwith the dominant component of the extranuclear hard X-ray emission. All these\nfeatures provide evidence for a plausible direct physical link between\nsupernova-driven outflows and the hard X-ray emitting gas in a LIRG. This\nresult is consistent with model predictions of starbursts concentrated in small\nvolumes and with high thermalization efficiencies.

The former result from\nthe direct collapse of gas in T_s^h >1.5x10^4K, H_2-free halos; the latter are\nthe endproduct of a standard H_2-based star formation process. The H_2-free\ncondition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (J_21 > 10^3) Lyman-Werner\nUV background produced by both accreting BHs and stars, thus establishing a\nself-regulated growth regime. We find that this condition is met already at z\nclose to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. The key\nparameter allowing the formation of SMBHs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halos\nthat can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy>0.001; SMBH\nas large as 2x10^10 Msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.\nIndependently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black hole\nmass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that SMBHs formed\nbefore their bulge was in place. The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the\nLyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial\nto achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of\nits evolution, i.e. z>7. The UV photon production is largely dominated by stars\nin galaxies, i.e. black hole accretion radiation is sub-dominant.\nInterestingly, we find that the final mass of light BHs and of the SMBH in the\nquasar is roughly equal by z=6; by the same time only 19% of the initial baryon\ncontent has been converted into stars. The SMBH growth is dominated at all\nepochs z > 7.2 by mergers (exceeding accretion by a factor 2-50); at later\ntimes accretion becomes by far the most important growth channel.

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

We investigate the momentum and\nenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and\nstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star\nforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern\ncosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid\nmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds\nfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young\nstar clusters.

This\ninteraction entangles the quantum state with the inherent fluctuations of the\nenvironment. If these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be\nviewed as a source of noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system\nfrom an initially pure state into a statistical mixture-a process known as\ndecoherence. However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the\nquantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution\ndescribed by a quantum trajectory conditioned on the measurement outcome. We\nemploy weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity embedding a\nsuperconducting qubit and track the individual quantum trajectories of the\nsystem. In this architecture, the environment is dominated by the fluctuations\nof a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity. Using a near-quantum-limited\nparametric amplifier, we selectively measure either the phase or amplitude of\nthe cavity field, and thereby confine trajectories to either the equator or a\nmeridian of the Bloch sphere. We perform quantum state tomography at discrete\ntimes along the trajectory to verify that we have faithfully tracked the state\nof the quantum system as it diffuses on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Our\nresults demonstrate that decoherence can be mitigated by environmental\nmonitoring and validate the foundations of quantum feedback approaches based on\nBayesian statistics. Moreover, our experiments suggest a new route for\nimplementing what Schrodinger termed \"quantum steering\"-harnessing action at a\ndistance to manipulate quantum states via measurement. \n\n"}

We present new CO observations and/or Spitzer\nmid-IR spectroscopy for 6 70 micron selected galaxies at z~1 in order to\nquantify the properties of the molecular gas reservoir, the contribution of an\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) to the mid-IR luminosity and the star formation\nefficiency (SFE=LIR/L'CO). The mid-IR spectra show strong polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission and our spectral decomposition suggests that the AGN\nmakes a minimal contribution (<25%) to the mid-IR luminosity. The 70 micron\nselected ULIRGs which we find to be spectroscopic close pairs, are observed to\nhave high SFE, similar to local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter\ngalaxies, consistent with enhanced IR luminosity due to an ongoing major\nmerger. Combined with existing observations of local and high redshift ULIRGs,\nwe further compare the PAH, IR and CO luminosities. We show that the ratio\nLPAH6.2/LIR decreases with increasing IR luminosity for both local and high\nredshift galaxies but the trend for high redshift galaxies is shifted to higher\nIR luminosities; the average LPAH6.2/LIR ratio at a given LIR is ~3 times\nhigher at high redshift.

The nuclear subsystem\ndynamically evolves in response to Landau-Zener singlet-triplet transitions of\nthe electronic subsystem controlled by external gate voltages. Without noise\nand spin-orbit coupling, subsequent Landau-Zener transitions die out after\nabout $10^4$ sweeps, the system self-quenches, and nuclear spins reach one of\nthe numerous glassy dark states.

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the\nmulti-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar\nfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly\nfrom stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero\nadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo\nmass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and\nsmall groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the\nstellar mass function for M_star<10^11 M_sun. We predict weak redshift\nevolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to\nz>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only\nsupernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly\nin dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and\nradiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt GMCs and enable efficient coupling\nof later supernovae to the gas.

In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals\nof motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in\nthese systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local\nintegrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a\nlocal particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's\nHamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such\noperators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL\nsystem to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents\na density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes\nhow this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely\ndefined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for\ncharacterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and\nnumerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an\nextensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin chain model. We\nshow that the resulting LIOMs are quasi-local, and use their decay to extract\nthe localization length and establish the location of the transition between\nthe MBL and ergodic phases. \n\n"}

Magnetic anisotropy parameters, vibrational\nenergies, and electron-vibron coupling strengths of the Fe$_4$ are computed\nusing DFT. A giant spin model is applied to the Fe$_4$ with only two charge\nstates, specifically a neutral state with the total spin $S=5$ and a singly\ncharged state with $S=9/2$, which is consistent with our DFT result and\nexperiments on Fe$_4$ single-molecule transistors. In sequential electron\ntunneling, we find that the magnetic anisotropy gives rise to new features in\nconductance peaks arising from vibrational excitations. In particular, the peak\nheight shows a strong, unusual dependence on the direction as well as magnitude\nof applied B field. The magnetic anisotropy also introduces vibrational\nsatellite peaks whose position and height are modified with the direction and\nmagnitude of applied B field. Furthermore, when multiple vibrational modes with\nconsiderable electron-vibron coupling have energies close to one another, a\nlow-bias current is suppressed, independently of gate voltage and applied B\nfield, although that is not the case for a single mode with the similar\nelectron-vibron coupling. In the former case, the conductance peaks reveal a\nstronger B-field dependence than in the latter case. The new features appear\nbecause the magnetic anisotropy barrier is of the same order of magnitude as\nthe energies of vibrational modes with significant electron-vibron coupling.\nOur findings clearly show the interesting interplay between magnetic anisotropy\nand electron-vibron coupling in electron transport via the Fe$_4$.

In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information.

Yet there is currently great\ndebate (and few measurements) about the behaviour of the 1.4-GHz counts in the\nmicroJy regime. One way to push the counts to these levels is via 'stacking',\nthe covariance of a map with a catalogue at higher resolution and (often) a\ndifferent wavelength. For the first time, we cast stacking in a fully bayesian\nframework, applying it to (i) the SKADS simulation and (ii) VLA data stacked at\nthe positions of sources from the VIDEO survey. In the former case, the\nalgorithm recovers the counts correctly when applied to the catalogue, but is\nbiased high when confusion comes into play. This needs to be accounted for in\nthe analysis of data from any relatively-low-resolution SKA pathfinders. For\nthe latter case, the observed radio source counts remain flat below the 5-sigma\nlevel of 85 microJy as far as 40 microJy, then fall off earlier than the flux\nhinted at by the SKADS simulations and a recent P(D) analysis (which is the\nonly other measurement from the literature at these flux-density levels, itself\nextrapolated in frequency).

The evident impact of this\nconclusion on cosmological theory calls for an independent confirmation. In\nthis paper, we carry out this crucial one-on-one comparison between the R_h=ct\nUniverse (an FRW cosmology with zero active mass) and wCDM/LCDM, using the\nlatest high-z measurements of H(z).

Our motivation is\nto study and characterize the behavior of WISE source populations in\nanticipation of the deep multi-wavelength surveys that will define the next\ndecade, with the principal science goal of mapping the 3D large scale\nstructures and determining the global physical attributes of the host galaxies.\nIn combination with cosmological redshifts, we identify galaxies from their\nWISE W1 3.4um resolved emission, and by performing a star-galaxy separation\nusing apparent magnitude, colors and statistical modeling of star-counts. The\nresultant galaxy catalog has ~590,000 sources in 60 deg^2, reaching a W1\n5-sigma depth of 31 uJy. At the faint end, where redshifts are not available,\nwe employ a luminosity function analysis to show that approximately 27% of all\nWISE extragalactic sources to a limit of 17.5 mag (31 uJy) are at high\nredshift, z > 1. The spatial distribution is investigated using two-point\ncorrelation functions and a 3D source density characterization at 5 Mpc and 20\nMpc scales. For angular distributions, we find brighter and more massive\nsources are strongly clustered relative to fainter and lower mass source;\nlikewise, based on WISE colors, spheroidal galaxies have the strongest\nclustering, while late-type disk galaxies have the lowest clustering\namplitudes. Along the radial direction, the strongest clustering is in the\nlargest redshift shell, while the weakest is in the nearest redshift shell,\nconsistent with the stellar mass and morphological type dependency results. In\nthree dimensions, we find a number of distinct groupings, often bridged by\nfilaments and super-structures.

The vast majority of cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations implement the UVB via a set of spatially uniform photoionization\nand photoheating rates derived from UVB synthesis models. We show that\nsimulations using canonical UVB rates reionize and, perhaps more importantly,\nspuriously heat the IGM, much earlier z ~ 15 than they should. This problem\narises because at z > 6, where observational constraints are nonexistent, the\nUVB amplitude is far too high. We introduce a new methodology to remedy this\nissue, and we generate self-consistent photoionization and photoheating rates\nto model any chosen reionization history. Following this approach, we run a\nsuite of hydrodynamical simulations of different reionization scenarios and\nexplore the impact of the timing of reionization and its concomitant heat\ninjection on the the thermal state of the IGM.

We find that\nmatching the observed scatter at z ~ 5.5 requires a short spatially averaged\nmean free path of < 15 comoving Mpc/h, a factor of > 3 shorter than direct\nmeasurements at z ~ 5.2. We argue that such rapid evolution in the mean free\npath is difficult to reconcile with our measurements of the global H I\nphotoionization rate, which stay approximately constant over the interval z ~\n4.8 - 5.5. However, we also show that measurements of the mean free path at z >\n5 are likely biased towards higher values by the quasar proximity effect.

We cover longitudinal and transverse vibrations of\nchains and out-of-plane vibrations of two-dimensional lattices with\ninteractions of an arbitrary number of neighbors. Motion of each particle is\ngoverned by a single scalar equation and therefore the notion \"scalar lattice\"\nis used. Evolution of initial temperature field in an infinite lattice is\ninvestigated. An exact equation describing the evolution is derived.\nContinualization of this equation with respect to spatial coordinates is\ncarried out. The resulting continuum equation is solved analytically. The\nsolution shows that the kinetic temperature is represented as the sum of two\nterms, one describing short time behavior, the other large time behavior. At\nshort times, the temperature performs high-frequency oscillations caused by\nredistribution of energy among kinetic and potential forms (fast process).\nCharacteristic time of this process is of order of ten periods of atomic\nvibrations.

A comprehensive SPW theory is presented taking\ninto account both the inter-band transition effects and the dielectric effects.\nExperimental consequences, especially in regard to the possibility of\novercompensating for the energy losses suffered by SPWs, are exemplified for\ntwo common plasmonic materials: silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al).

In Ag,\nthe inter-band transition effects significantly weaken the intrinsic gain\nchannel and make it unable to overcompensate for the losses, while in Al it is\nbecause the loss rate is too big.

In light\nof this theory, we analyze the behaviors of SPWs according to several electron\ndynamics models, including the widely used local dielectric model (DM), the\nhydrodynamic model (HDM) and the specular reflection model (SRM), in addition\nto the less common semi-classical model (SCM).

In Weyl semimetals, the foundational gapless topological\nphase, chiral degeneracies are isolated near the Fermi level and give rise to\nthe Fermi-arc surface states. However, it is now recognized that chiral\ndegeneracies are ubiquitous in the band structures of systems with broken\nspatial inversion ($\\mathcal{P}$) or time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) symmetry.\nThis leads to a broadly defined notion of topological metals, which implies the\npresence of disconnected Fermi surface sheets characterized by non-zero Chern\nnumbers inherited from the enclosed chiral degeneracies. Here, we address the\npossibility of experimentally observing surface-related signatures of chiral\ndegeneracies in metals. As a representative system we choose bcc iron, a\nwell-studied archetypal ferromagnetic metal with two nontrivial electron\npockets. We find that the (110) surface presents arc-like resonances attached\nto the topologically nontrivial electron pockets. These Fermi-arc resonances\nare due to two different chiral degeneracies, a type-I elementary Weyl point\nand a type-II composite (Chern numbers $\\pm 2$) Weyl point, located at slightly\ndifferent energies close to the Fermi level.

Quantitative understanding of and\nprecise physical control over donor (e.g. Phosphorus) exchange are crucial\nelements in the physics underlying the proposed Si-based quantum computer\nhardware.

We discuss two competing transport channels for Cooper pairs\nto tunnel from the SC into the LL leads.
