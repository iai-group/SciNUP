The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds.

The peculiarity of the SLG-BLG heterostructure is\nthat the electrons in the layers (SLG and BLG) have different chiralities. We\nfind that the difference of chirality between electrons in the two layers\ncauses the spontaneously broken symmetry state to be N-fold degenerate.\nMoreover, we find that some of the degenerate states are chiral superfluid\nstates, topologically distinct from the usual layer-ferromagnetism. The chiral\nnature of the ground state opens the possibility to realize protected midgap\nstates. The N-fold degeneracy of the ground state makes the physics of SLG-BLG\nhybrid systems analogous to the physics of helium-3, in particular given the\nrecent discovery of chiral superfluid states in this system. \n\n"}

But the significant controversy surrounding the nature of\nthe $\\nu = 5/2$ state has been hampered by the fact that the competition\nbetween these and other states is affected by small parameter changes. To study\nthe phase diagram of the $\\nu = 5/2$ state we numerically diagonalize a\ncomprehensive effective Hamiltonian describing the fractional quantum Hall\neffect of electrons under realistic conditions in GaAs semiconductors. The\neffective Hamiltonian takes Landau level mixing into account to lowest-order\nperturbatively in $\\kappa$, the ratio of the Coulomb energy scale to the\ncyclotron gap. We also incorporate non-zero width $w$ of the quantum well and\nsub-band mixing. We find the ground state in both the torus and spherical\ngeometries as a function of $\\kappa$ and $w$. To sort out the non-trivial\ncompetition between candidate ground states we analyze the following 4\ncriteria: its overlap with trial wave functions; the magnitude of energy gaps;\nthe sign of the expectation value of an order parameter for particle-hole\nsymmetry breaking; and the entanglement spectrum. We conclude that the ground\nstate is in the universality class of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state, rather\nthan the anti-Pfaffian, for $\\kappa < {\\kappa_c}(w)$, where ${\\kappa_c}(w)$ is\na $w$-dependent critical value $0.6 \\lesssim{\\kappa_c}(w)\\lesssim 1$.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

The Au/Ge(100) system in particular is the\nsubject of controversy as to whether the Au-induced nanowires do indeed host\nexotic, 1D metallic states. We report on a thorough study of the electronic\nproperties of high quality nanowires formed at the Au/Ge(100) surface.

Comparison of the E(k$_x$,k$_y$) surface measured using ARPES to\ntight-binding calculations yields hopping parameters in the two different\ndirections that differ by a factor of two. We find that the larger of the two\nhopping parameters corresponds, in fact, to the direction perpendicular to the\nnanowires (t$_{\\perp}$). This, the topology of the $E$=$E_F$ contour in\nk$_{\\||}$, and the fact that $t_{\\||}$/$t_{\\perp}\\sim 0.5$ proves that the\nAu-induced electron pockets possess a 2D, closed Fermi surface, this firmly\nplaces the Au/Ge(100) nanowire system outside being a potential hosts of a\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid.

These spin singlets can be used to store\nquantum correlations since they preserve entanglement even under dissipation,\ndriving and dipole-dipole interactions. One of the features for these dark\nstates is that their eigenenergies are independent of the qubitphoton coupling\nstrength.

From this theoretical study a\npicture emerges in which impurity dynamics is universal on essentially all time\nscales, and where the high-frequency few-body response is related to the\nlong-time dynamics of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe by Tan relations.\nOur theoretical description relies on different and complementary approaches:\nfunctional determinants give an exact numerical solution for time- and\nfrequency-resolved responses, bosonization provides analytical expressions at\nlow temperatures, and the theory of Toeplitz determinants allows one to\nanalytically predict response up to high temperatures.

In order to\nelucidate the mechanisms of Josephson transport due to split Cooper pairs, we\nassume the arms to be single-channel wires in the short-junction limit.\nDifferent geometries of the system (determined by the length of the arms and\nthe phases acquired by quasiparticles during splitting between the arms) lead\nto qualitatively different behavior of the SQUID characteristics (the Andreev\nlevels, the current-phase relation, and the critical Josephson current) as a\nfunction of two control parameters, the external magnetic flux and\nmisorientation of the two spin filters.

We first examine the quasiparticle scattering interference spectra in\nthe superconducting state at optimal doping as temperature is increased.\nAssuming agreement with angle-resolved photoemission experiments which suggest\nthat the scattering rate depends on temperature, resulting in the filling of\nthe $d$-wave gap, we find that the peaks predicted by the octet model become\nprogressively smeared as temperature is increased. When the scattering rate is\nof the same order of magnitude as the superconducting gap, the spectral\nfunction shows Fermi-arc-like patterns, while the power spectrum of the local\ndensity of states shows the destruction of the octet-model peaks. We next\nconsider the normal state properties of the optimally-doped cuprates. We model\nthis by adding a marginal Fermi liquid self-energy to the normal-state\npropagator, and consider the dependence of the QPI spectra on frequency,\ntemperature, and doping. We demonstrate that the MFL self-energy leads to a\nsmearing of the caustics appearing in the normal-state QPI power spectrum as\neither temperature or frequency is increased at fixed doping. The smearing is\nfound to be more prominent in the MFL case than in an ordinary Fermi liquid. We\nalso consider the case of a marginal Fermi liquid with a strongly\nmomentum-dependent self-energy which gives rise to a visible \"nodal-antinodal\"\ndichotomy at the normal state, and discuss how the spectra as seen in ARPES and\nSTS differ from both an isotropic metal and a broadened $d$-wave\nsuperconductor. \n\n"}

The origin of such advantages lies in the role of\nquantum correlations, which may arise during the charging and discharging\nprocesses performed on the battery. In this theoretical work, we introduce a\nsystematic characterization of the relevant quantities of quantum batteries,\ni.e., the capacity and the power, in relation to such correlations. For these\nquantities, we derive upper bounds for batteries that are a collection of\nnoninteracting quantum cells with fixed Hamiltonians. The capacity, that is, a\nbound on the stored or extractable energy, is derived with the help of the\nenergy-entropy diagram, and this bound is respected as long as the charging and\ndischarging processes are entropy preserving. While studying power, we consider\na geometric approach for the evolution of the battery state in the energy\neigenspace of the battery Hamiltonian. Then, an upper bound for power is\nderived for arbitrary charging process, in terms of the Fisher information and\nthe energy variance of the battery. The former quantifies the speed of\nevolution, and the latter encodes the nonlocal character of the battery state.\nIndeed, due to the fact that the energy variance is bounded by the multipartite\nentanglement properties of batteries composed of qubits, we establish a\nfundamental bound on power imposed by quantum entanglement. We also discuss\nparadigmatic models for batteries that saturate the bounds both for the stored\nenergy and power. Several experimentally realizable quantum batteries, based on\nintegrable spin chains, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and the Dicke models, are also\nstudied in the light of these newly introduced bounds. \n\n"}

This paper provides a review\nof the current understanding of non-Fermi liquid effects in metallic\nsingle-wall nanotubes (SWNTs). We provide a self-contained theoretical\ndiscussion of electron-electron interaction effects and show that the tunneling\ndensity of states exhibits power-law behavior. The power-law exponent depends\non the interaction strength parameter $g$ and on the geometry of the setup.\n  We then show that these features are observed experimentally by measuring the\ntunneling conductance of SWNTs as a function of temperature and voltage. These\ntunneling experiments are obtained by contacting metallic SWNTs to two\nnanofabricated gold electrodes.

The ratio of the two determines the dimensionless coupling constant for\nspin-fermion interaction $\\lambda^2 \\propto {\\bar g}/\\omega_{sf}$.

One representative example is electron traps in the device\nmaterial or substrate. Electrons can tunnel or hop between a charged and an\nempty trap, or between a trap and a gate electrode. A single trap typically\nproduces telegraph noise and can hence be modeled as a bistable fluctuator.\nSince the distribution of hopping rates is exponentially broad, many traps\nproduce flicker-noise with spectrum close to 1/f. Here we develop a theory of\ndecoherence of a qubit in the environment consisting of two-state fluctuators,\nwhich experience transitions between their states induced by interaction with\nthermal bath. Due to interaction with the qubit the fluctuators produce\n1/f-noise in the qubit's eigenfrequency.

We\nargue that in the two-band superconductor MgB_2 such a case is realised.\nMotivated by the experimental findings on MgB_2, we assume that\nsuperconductivity in the diffusive band is ``weak'', i.e., mostly induced. We\nexamine intriguing features of the order parameter, the current density, and\nthe vortex core spectrum in the ``strong'' ballistic band under the influence\nof hybridization with the ``weak'' diffusive band. Although the order parameter\nin the diffusive band is induced, the characteristic length scales in the two\nbands differ due to Coulomb interactions. The current density in the vortex\ncore is dominated by the contribution from the ballistic band, while outside\nthe core the contribution from the diffusive band can be substantial, or even\ndominating. The current density in the diffusive band has strong temperature\ndependence, exhibiting the Kramer-Pesch effect when hybridization is strong.
