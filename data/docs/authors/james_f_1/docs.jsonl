The\nexplicit solutions corresponding to each scale factor are analogs of the\nwell-known spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker family.

Our approach\nrelies on new integral formulations as well as associated high-order quadrature\nrules. The new integral formulations involve weighted versions of the classical\nintegral operators associated with the thin-screen Dirichlet and Neumann\nproblems as well as a generalization to the open surface problem of the\nclassical Calderon formulae. The high-order quadrature rules we introduce for\nthese operators, in turn, resolve the multiple Green function and edge\nsingularities (which occur at arbitrarily close distances from each other, and\nwhich include weakly singular as well as hypersingular kernels) and thus give\nrise to super-algebraically fast convergence as the discretization sizes are\nincreased.

For any gauge theory, we define from first principles an\neffective action for a fixed number of \"probe\" D-branes in the presence of N\n\"background\" D-branes on which the gauge theory lives. This effective action is\nshown to encode all the information about the large N gauge theory. The\nanalysis of the planar diagram expansion which computes the effective action\nyields a simple and generic mechanism explaining the emergence of holographic\nspace dimensions: the probe D-branes move in a higher dimensional dual\nholographic space-time. The construction yields a new perspective on the notion\nof bulk space-time locality and draws unexpected links with some aspects of the\n't Hooft Abelian projection ideas. It also provides a new non-perturbative\napproximation scheme, able to capture both the weak and strong coupling\nregimes. We sketchily illustrate the basic ideas on a few examples, including\nthe pure four dimensional Yang-Mills theory. \n\n"}

We do likewise for the closely related $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$,\nwhich will be measured by the KOTO experiment around 2020. As the perturbative\nQCD and electroweak corrections in both decays are under full control, the\ndominant uncertainties within the SM presently originate from the CKM\nparameters $V_{cb}$, $V_{ub}$ and $\\gamma$. We show this dependence with the\nhelp of analytic expressions as well as accurate interpolating formulae.\nUnfortunately a clarification of the discrepancies between inclusive and\nexclusive determinations of $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ from tree-level decays will\nlikely require results from the Belle II experiment available at the end of\nthis decade.

We prove four main theorems:\n  (i) a representation formula for classical solutions,\n  (ii) a quantitative decay rate at which the solution tends to the fundamental\nsolution,\n  (iii) optimal $L^2$-decay of mild solutions in all dimensions,\n  (iv) $L^2$-decay of weak solutions via energy methods.\n  The first result relies on a delicate analysis of the definition of classical\nsolutions. After proving the representation formula we carefully analyze the\nintegral representation to obtain the quantitative decay rates of (ii).\n  Next we use Fourier analysis techniques to obtain the optimal decay rate for\nmild solutions. Here we encounter the critical dimension phenomenon where the\ndecay rate attains the decay rate of that in a bounded domain for large enough\ndimensions. Consequently, the decay rate does not anymore improve when the\ndimension increases. The theory is markedly different from that of the standard\ncaloric functions and this substantially complicates the analysis.\n  Finally, we use energy estimates and a comparison principle to prove a\nquantitative decay rate for weak solutions defined via a variational\nformulation. Our main idea is to show that the $L^2$-norm is actually a\nsubsolution to a purely time-fractional problem which allows us to use the\nknown theory to obtain the result. \n\n"}

One such a property\nis that $\\mu$-almost every $x$ in $\\R^d$ is transported by the optimal\nmartingale plan into a probability measure $\\pi_x$ concentrated on the extreme\npoints of the closed convex hull of its support.

However, the rate of isocline\nmovement can be highly variable, with much uncertainty associated with yearly\nshifts. The same is true for population growth rates. Growth rates can be\nvariable and uncertain, even within suitable habitats for growth. In this paper\nwe reanalyze the question of population persistence in the context of the\nuncertainty and variability in isocline shifts and rates of growth.\nSpecifically, we employ a stochastic integrodifference equation model on a\npatch of suitable habitat that shifts poleward at a random rate.

The\nequations allow one to use the full power of the geometric vectorfield method\nin treating the \"wave part\" of the system.\n  A crucial feature of the new formulation is that all derivative-quadratic\ninhomogeneous terms verify the strong null condition. The latter is a nonlinear\ncondition signifying the complete absence of nonlinear interactions involving\nmore than one differentiation in a direction transversal to the acoustic\ncharacteristics. Moreover, the same good structures are found in the equations\nverified by the Euclidean divergence and curl of the specific vorticity. This\nis important because one needs to combine estimates for the divergence and curl\nwith elliptic estimates to obtain sufficient regularity for the specific\nvorticity, whose derivatives appears as inhomogeneous terms in the wave\nequations.\n  The above structures collectively open the door for our forthcoming results:\nexhibiting a stable regime in which initially smooth solutions develop a shock\nsingularity (in particular the first Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives\nof the velocity and density blow up) while, relative to a system of geometric\ncoordinates adapted to the acoustic characteristics, the solution (including\nthe vorticity) remains many times differentiable, all the way up to the shock.\nThe good null structures, which are often associated with global solutions, are\nin fact key to proving that the shock singularity forms.

Trapped\nrays necessitate a loss when compared to the estimate on Minkowski space. A\nloss of regularity is a common way to incorporate such. When trapping is\nsufficiently weak, a logarithmic loss of regularity suffices. Here, by studying\na warped product manifold introduced by Christianson and Wunsch, we encounter\nthe first explicit example of a situation where an estimate with an algebraic\nloss of regularity exists and this loss is sharp. Due to the global-in-time\nnature of the estimate for the wave equation, the situation is more complicated\nthan for the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. An initial estimate with sub-optimal\nloss is first obtained, where extra care is required due to the low frequency\ncontributions.

We study harmonic mappings, i.e.\nminimizers of the Dirichlet energy provided that the values on the boundary d\nOmega are fixed.

Allowed regions\nfor the scattering lengths in the 1S0 and 3S1 channels as functions of the\nlight-quark masses are determined from the current uncertainty in\nstrong-interaction parameters that appear at next-to-leading order in the\neffective field theory. Where experimental constraints are absent, as is the\ncase for the quark-mass dependent four-nucleon operators, we use naive\ndimensional analysis. We find it likely that there is no bound state in the 1S0\nchannel in the chiral limit. However, given the present uncertainties in\nstrong-interaction parameters it is unclear whether the deuteron is bound or\nunbound in the chiral limit. \n\n"}

It reports features of, and results for, pseudoscalar and scalar\nbound-state residues in vacuum polarisations, and exhibits how a restoration of\nchiral symmetry in meson trajectories could be manifest in a relationship\nbetween them. It also touches on nucleon studies, emphasising the importance of\nboth scalar and axial-vector diquark correlations, and reporting the\ncalculation of mu_n G_E^n(Q^2)/G_M^n(Q^2). The value of respecting symmetries,\nincluding Poincare' covariance, is stressed. \n\n"}
