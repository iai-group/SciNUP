In particular, we explore the link\nbetween the U_A(1) restoration and the recent lattice QCD results of de\nForcrand and Philipsen, in which the first order phase transition region near\nzero chemical potential (mu) shrinks in the quark mass and mu space when mu is\nincreased. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau theory for general discussions, we\nthen use the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quantitative studies.

At higher mu, the critical\nsurface might shrink or expand, depending on the scenarios. This raises the\npossibility that despite the shrinking of the critical surface at lower mu, the\nQCD critical end point might still exist due to the expansion at higher mu. In\nthis case, very high precision lattice data will be needed to detect the\nback-bending of the critical surface with the currently available analytic\ncontinuation or Taylor expansion approaches.

Although one can theoretically\nformulate two-flavor theories for the various hyperon multiplets, the nearness\nof kaon thresholds can seriously undermine the effectiveness of the\nperturbative expansion in practice. We investigate the importance of virtual\nkaon thresholds on hyperon properties, specifically their masses and isovector\naxial charges. Using a three-flavor expansion that includes SU(3) breaking\neffects, we uncover the underlying expansion parameter governing the\ndescription of virtual kaon thresholds. For spin-half hyperons, this expansion\nparameter is quite small. Consequently virtual kaon contributions are well\ndescribed in the two-flavor theory by terms analytic in the pion mass-squared.\nFor spin three-half hyperons, however, one is closer to the kaon production\nthreshold, and the expansion parameter is not as small. Breakdown of SU(2)\nchiral perturbation theory is shown to arise from a pole in the expansion\nparameter associated with the kaon threshold. Estimating higher-order\ncorrections to the expansion parameter is necessary to ascertain whether the\ntwo-flavor theory of spin three-half hyperons remains perturbative.

The derivation and analysis of Dyson-Schwinger equations increase\nconsiderably in complexity when going beyond the standard Landau gauge fixing\nand the available tools have to be improved. For the derivation of the\nequations a computer program (DoDSE) was developed in order to handle the\nplethora of terms. The process of determining possible infrared solutions is\nabstracted to obtain further insight into the structure of the so-called\ninfrared scaling solutions. It is found that a few simple steps suffice to\ndetermine possible infrared scaling relations directly from the action. For the\nmaximally Abelian gauge an infrared enhanced diagonal gluon propagator is\nfound, while the off-diagonal degrees of freedom are infrared suppressed. This\nis in agreement with the idea of Abelian infrared dominance. Furthermore, it is\nproven that SU(2) and higher SU(N) have the same infrared behavior, although\nthe corresponding actions differ. Under a suitable truncation the\nDyson-Schwinger equations are solved in the deep infrared to obtain values for\nthe exponents of the power laws. Restricting the integration in field\nconfiguration space to the Gribov region of the Landau gauge with the\nGribov-Zwanziger action leads to two qualitatively equivalent infrared\nsolutions. In both cases the gluon propagator is infrared suppressed and the\ninfrared enhanced ghost propagator dominates the Dyson-Schwinger equations.\nThis result corroborates the conjecture by Zwanziger that the functional\nintegration can be cut at the first Gribov horizon and only the applied\nboundary conditions are important. For one solution the Dyson-Schwinger\nequations reduce in the deep infrared exactly to those obtained with the usual\nFaddeev-Popov gauge fixing. \n\n"}

The physical\nimplications of this abundance of symmetry remain unclear. In recent work, it\nhas been shown how these chiral symmetries for overlap fermions can be derived\nfrom a renormalisation group blocking in the continuum, transforming the action\nfrom the standard continuum action to an equivalent to the lattice overlap\naction. There is no unique blocking, and different blockings lead to different\nchiral symmetries. The group of symmetries found by Mandula immediately\nfollows. In this way, the excess chiral symmetry on the lattice can be\nexplained in terms of different renormalisation schemes.\n  The previous work suffered from one technical challenge: there is no\ncontinuum analogue of the lattice chiral eigenvectors at eigenvalue $2/a$. As\nthe construction of the overlap operator required a mapping between lattice and\ncontinuum eigenvalues, the lack of a continuum counterpart to the doublers of\nthe zero modes creates an ambiguity in the construction. Although the lattice\nchiral symmetry can still be defined, this leads to difficulties when\nconsidering $\\mathcal{CP}$ symmetry on the lattice. In this work, we\ninvestigate the possibility of resolving this ambiguity by adding a second\nfermion field to the original continuum action used as a basis of the\nrenormalisation group blockings. This second fermion field has a mass of the\norder of the momentum cut-off, to simulate the effects of the fermion doublers.\nWorking through the same renormalisation group procedure to map this action to\nthe lattice overlap action yields additional Ginsparg-Wilson relations\nsatisfied by the overlap operator, and more (non-commuting) lattice chiral\nsymmetries. \n\n"}

Since a severe sign problem makes a numerical treatment of QED and\nQCD at high density difficult, such models help to explore various effects\npeculiar to the full theory. Studying them gives insights into the large\ndensity behavior of the Polyakov loop by taking both bosonic and fermionic\ndegrees of freedom into account, although in one dimension only the\nimplementation of a global gauge symmetry is possible. For these models we\nevaluate the respective partition functions and discuss several observables as\nwell as the Silver Blaze phenomenon. \n\n"}

The effective masses influenced under the magnetic field are\nevaluated in a way of the derivative/chiral expansion established in the HLS\nmodel. At the leading order O(p^2) the g-factor of the charged rho meson is\nfixed to be 2, implying that the rho meson at this order is treated just like a\npoint-like spin-1 particle. Beyond the leading order, one finds anomalous\nmagnetic interactions of the charged rho meson, involving the anomalous\nmagnetic moment, which give corrections to the effective mass. It is then\nsuggested that up to O(p^4) the charged rho meson tends to become massless. Of\ninterest is that nontrivial magnetic-dependence of neutral mesons emerges to\ngive rise to the significant mixing among neutral mesons. Consequently, it\nleads to the dramatic enhancement of the omega meson mass, which is testable in\nfuture lattice simulations. Corrections from terms beyond O(p^4) are also\naddressed. \n\n"}

In order to compute the form factors of a single\nenergy eigenstate, we must perform a variational analysis at non-zero momentum.\nWhen we do this with baryons, we run into issues with parity mixing, as boosted\nbaryons are not eigenstates of parity.

The\npresent paper applies two approximate analytical methods to the investigation\nof critical properties of the self-avoiding loop model with variable bending\nrigidity, discusses their validity and makes comparison with known MC results.\nOne method is based on the independent loop approximation used in the\nliterature for studying phase transitions in polymers, liquid helium and cosmic\nstrings.

It consists in simulating QCD in the background of a\n''electromagnetic\" field whose potential is non-vanishing, but whose field\nstrength is zero. By tuning the background field, phase-shifts at any (but\nsmall) momenta can be determined by measuring the shift of the ground state\nenergy. Lattice sizes as small as 5 Fermi can be sufficient for the calculation\nof phase shifts up to momenta of order of $m_{\\pi}/2$. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/0611096", "contents": "Title: Nuclear Force from Lattice QCD Abstract: Nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential is studied by lattice QCD simulations in the\nquenched approximation, using the plaquette gauge action and the Wilson quark\naction on a 32^4 (\\simeq (4.4 fm)^4) lattice. A NN potential V_{NN}(r) is\ndefined from the equal-time Bethe-Salpeter amplitude with a local interpolating\noperator for the nucleon. By studying the NN interaction in the ^1S_0 and ^3S_1\nchannels, we show that the central part of V_{NN}(r) has a strong repulsive\ncore of a few hundred MeV at short distances (r \\alt 0.5 fm) surrounded by an\nattractive well at medium and long distances. These features are consistent\nwith the known phenomenological features of the nuclear force. \n\n"}
