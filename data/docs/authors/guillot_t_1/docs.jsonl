Over 900 X-ray\nsources are detected; 77% have optical or FLAMINGOS near-infrared (NIR) stellar\ncounterparts and are mostly previously uncatalogued young stellar cluster\nmembers.

This is inconsistent with the top-heavy IMF\nreported from earlier optical studies that lacked a good census of <4Msun\nstars.

While particle\nacceleration processes such as diffusive shock acceleration can accelerate ions\nand electrons, the accelerated electrons suffer larger radiative losses. Under\ncertain conditions, the ions can attain higher energies and reach farther ahead\nof the shock than the electrons, and so the nonthermal particles can be\npartially charge-separated. To compensate for the charge separation, the\nupstream plasma develops a return current, which, as it flows across the\nmagnetic field, drives transverse acceleration of the upstream plasma and a\ngrowth of density contrast in the shock upstream.

In this review, I introduce\nthe different environments encountered in the Magellanic System and compare\nthese with the Schmidt-Kennicutt law and the predicted efficiencies of various\nchemo-physical processes. I then concentrate on three aspects that are of\nparticular importance: the chemistry of the embedded stages of star formation,\nthe Initial Mass Function, and feedback effects from massive stars and its\nability to trigger further star formation. \n\n"}

Although the available\nmass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface\ndensity (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha < 2, the\naccretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances.\nEfficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution,\nwhen the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take\nplace. The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\nM_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can\naccrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.\nOur results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in\nextra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead\nto larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the\ncorrelation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity. Our\ncalculations also suggest that Jupiter could have formed at a larger radial\ndistance than its current location while still accreting the mass of heavy\nelements predicted by interior models. We conclude that in the disk instability\nmodel the final composition of a giant planet is strongly determined by its\nformation environment.

We find that\nwhen the pebble-to-gas column density ratio is 0.01, corresponding roughly to\nsolar metallicity, clumping is weak, so the pebble density rarely exceeds the\ngas density.

This paper presents the results of numerical experiments\ncomparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible\nmechanism in model A star, G star and M star disks.\n  First, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming\nbeyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorable\nconditions one can construct. Second, a set of N-body simulations demonstrates\nthat planet-planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems such\nas HR 8799.

These are compared with the CoRoT detection, and with\nmeasurements at 4.5 and 8 um from the Spitzer Space Telescope from Gillon et\nal. (2009).

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit. We suggest that the\nchanging shadows cast by the dust clouds on the outer disk are a cause of the\ndaily to monthly mid-infrared variability in some young stars. (Abridged.) \n\n"}

In this regime warps are know to propagate\ndiffusively, with a diffusion coefficient approximately inversely proportional\nto the disc viscosity. Previous numerical investigations of this problem\n(Lodato & Pringle 2007) did not find a good agreement between the numerical\nresults and the predictions of the analytic theories of warp propagation, both\nin the linear and in the non-linear case. Here, we take advantage of a new,\nlow-memory and highly efficient SPH code to run a large set of very high\nresolution simulations (up to 20 million SPH particles) of warp propagation,\nimplementing an isotropic disc viscosity in different ways, to investigate the\norigin of the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results. Our new\nand improved analysis now shows a remarkable agreement with the analytic theory\nboth in the linear and in the non-linear regime, in terms of warp diffusion\ncoefficient and precession rate. It is worth noting that the resulting\ndiffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the disc viscosity only for\nsmall amplitude warps and small values of the disc $\\alpha$ coefficient\n($\\alpha < 0.1$). For non-linear warps, the diffusion coefficient is a function\nof both radius and time, and is significantly smaller than the standard value.\nWarped accretion discs are present in many contexts, from protostellar discs to\naccretion discs around supermassive black holes. In all such cases, the exact\nvalue of the warp diffusion coefficient may strongly affect the evolution of\nthe system and therefore its careful evaluation is critical in order to\ncorrectly estimate the system dynamics (abridged). \n\n"}

The adopted relative\nmass for the proto-satellite was 10^-6 of Saturn's mass and for each\nplanetesimal of the cloud three cases of relative mass were considered, 10^-14,\n10^-13 and 10^-12 masses of Saturn.

Much of the analysis relates to the 'high energy' cosmic\nrays ($E>10^{14}eV;=0.1PeV$) and their variability due to the changing\nproximity of the solar system to supernova remnants which are generally\nbelieved to be responsible for most cosmic rays up to PeV energies. It is\npointed out that, on a statistical basis, there will have been considerable\nvariations in the likely 100 My between the Earth's biosphere reaching\nreasonable stability and the onset of very elementary life. Interestingly,\nthere is the increasingly strong possibility that PeV cosmic rays are\nresponsible for the initiation of terrestrial lightning strokes and the\npossibility arises of considerable increases in the frequency of lightnings and\nthereby the formation of some of the complex molecules which are the 'building\nblocks of life'.

According to this\nanalysis, the stable stratification $N^2\\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,\nand the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with\nthe potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.\nGlobally, $Fr_t^2 \\leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than\nthe total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the\nkinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the\nother hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy\n($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to\nthe kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile\n$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must\nbe long-wave scale.

The average color of the S-complex pairs is PC_1=0.49+/-0.03, over\n5-sigma redder than predicted by Willman et al., 2008.

Thus, we compute the\ndifferential torque felt by a moonlet embedded in a two-dimensional disk of\nsolid particles, with flat surface density profile, both analytically and\nnumerically. We find that the corresponding migration rate is too small to\nexplain the observed variations of the propeller's orbit in Saturn's A-ring.\n  However, local density fluctuations (due to gravity wakes in the marginally\ngravitationally stable A-ring) may exert a stochastic torque on a moonlet. Our\nsimulations show that this torque can be large enough to account for the\nobservations, depending on the parameters of the rings. We find that on time\nscales of several years the migration of propellers is likely to be dominated\nby stochastic effects (while the former, non-stochastic migration dominates\nafter ~ 10^{4-5} years). In that case, the migration rates provided by\nobservations so far suggests that the surface density of the A ring should be\nof the order of 700 kg/m^2. The age of the propellers shouldn't exceed 1 to 100\nmillion years, depending on the dominant migration regime. \n\n"}

We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways.\nWe use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs\nfrom the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey (GCS) to infer the mean metallicity of M\ndwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood, we use theoretical models of M dwarf\ninteriors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in\nthe V-K_s--M_Ks CMD, and we base our final calibration purely on\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions. As a\nresult, we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in the\ncalibration sample than previous photometric calibrations. We\nnon-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that M dwarfs\nthat host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane\npopulated by metal-rich M dwarfs. We find that the probability p that\nplanet-hosting M dwarfs are distributed across the V-K_s--M_Ks CMD in the same\nway as field M dwarfs is p = 0.06 +/- 0.008.

This allows the employment of the standard viscous\nevolution equations, and gives promising results. It is, however, still not\nclear when such an approximation is appropriate. This paper tests this\napproximation using high resolution 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations of self-gravitating protostellar discs with radiative transfer. The\nnature of angular momentum transport associated with the gravitational\ninstability is characterised as a function of both the stellar mass and the\ndisc-to-star mass ratio. The effective viscosity is calculated from the\nReynolds and gravitational stresses in the disc. This is then compared to what\nwould be expected if the effective viscosity were determined by assuming local\nthermodynamic equilibrium or, equivalently, that the local dissipation rate\nmatches the local cooling rate. In general, all the discs considered here\nsettle into a self-regulated state where the heating generated by the\ngravitational instability is modulated by the local radiative cooling. It is\nfound that low-mass discs can indeed be represented by a local\n\"alpha-parametrisation\", provided that the disc aspect ratio is small (H/R <\n0.1) which is generally the case when the disc-to-star mass ratio q <0.5.\nHowever, this result does not extend to discs with masses approaching that of\nthe central object. These are subject to transient burst events and global wave\ntransport, and the effective viscosity is not well modelled by assuming local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. In spite of these effects, it is shown that massive\n(compact) discs can remain stable and not fragment, evolving rapidly to reduce\ntheir disc-to-star mass ratios through stellar accretion and radial spreading. \n\n"}

Among other\nscenarios considered, it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through\nplanet-disc interaction. Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping. In viscous discs the orbital eccentricity of embedded\nplanets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence,\nplanet-disc interaction does not seem to be a viable mechanism to explain the\nobserved high eccentricity of exoplanets. \n\n"}

In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage.

We calibrate the model with the well-characterized\ntransiting planet, HD 189733b, then compute light curves for seven of the most\neccentric transiting planets. We present phase variations for a variety of\ndifferent radiative times and wind speeds. In the limit of instant\nre-radiation, the light curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet's\neccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads or\ntrails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or\napproaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. For a planet with\nnon-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super- rotating\nwinds, and late for sub-rotating winds. We find that for a circular orbit, the\ntiming of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunction\nindicates the direction of the dominant winds, but cannot break the degeneracy\nbetween wind speed and radiative time. For circular planets the phase minimum\noccurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum -despite the fact that the\ncoolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator- and therefore does not\nconvey any additional information. In general, increasing the advective\nfrequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-trough\namplitude of phase variations, but there are interesting exceptions to these\ntrends. Lastly, eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer\nthan their radiative time exhibit \"ringing\" whereby the hot spot generated at\nperiastron rotates in and out of view. The existence of ringing makes it\npossible to directly measure the wind speed (the frequency of the ringing) and\nthe radiative time constant (the damping of the ringing). \n\n"}

At this level of accuracy, we start to be confronted\nwith stellar noise produced by 3 different physical phenomena: oscillations,\ngranulation phenomena (granulation, meso- and super-granulation) and activity.\nOn solar type stars, these 3 types of perturbation can induce m/s RV variation,\nbut on different time scales: 3 to 15 minutes for oscillations, 15 minutes to\n1.5 days for granulation phenomena and 10 to 50 days for activity.

Recent observations have shown\nthat a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrograde\norbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin.\nIt is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of\nthese misaligned hot Jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes after\nthe gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed\ninclination and eccentricity distributions. One particularly promising\ncandidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in the\nnon-linear regime of tides. Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scattered\ninto an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being\nless than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or\ncompletely ejected from the system. We find that as few as 5 and as many as 18\nof the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for\nscattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets must\nhave migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to\ntheir current positions.

Given the mass loss rates estimated\nfrom current observations --- and from theoretical arguments --- magnetic\nfields will dominate the flow provided that field strength near the planet is\ngreater than $\\sim1$ gauss, comparable to the surface fields of the Sun and\nJupiter. The problem can be separated into an inner regime, near the planet,\nwhere the outflow is launched, and an outer regime where the flow follows\n(primarily) stellar field lines and interacts with the stellar wind. This paper\nconcentrates on the flow in the inner regime.

In light of the last decade of\ndiscovery in the field of PN, we revise this framework, which, although\nsimplistic, can still serve as a benchmark against which to test theories of PN\norigin and shaping. Within the framework, we revisit the role of planets in\nshaping PN. Soker invoked a planetary role in shaping PN because there are not\nenough close binaries to shape the large fraction of non-spherical PN. In this\npaper we adopt a model whereby only ~20% of all 1-8 solar mass stars make a PN.\nThis reduces the need for planetary shaping. Through a propagation of\npercentages argument, and starting from the assumption that planets can only\nshape mildly elliptical PN, we conclude, like in Soker, that ~20% of all PN\nwere shaped via planetary and other substellar interactions but we add that\nthis corresponds to only ~5% of all 1-8 solar mass stars. This may be in line\nwith findings of planets around main sequence stars. PN shaping by planets is\nmade plausible by the recent discovery of planets that have survived\ninteractions with red giant branch (RGB) stars.

The\nCN morphology varied during the apparition: no morphology was seen in July; in\nAugust and September the northern feature dominated and appeared as a mostly\nface-on spiral; in October, November, and December the northern and southern\nfeatures were roughly equal in brightness and looked like more side-on\ncorkscrews; in January the southern feature was dominant but the morphology was\nindistinct due to very low signal.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the intermediate stages - from planetesimals to planetary\nembryos/cores - of planet formation in such highly inclined cases. Our focus is\non the effects of gas drag on the planetesimals' orbital evolution, in\nparticular on the evolution of the planetesimals' semimajor axis distribution\nand their mutual relative velocities. We first demonstrate that a non-evolving\naxisymmetric disk model is a good approximation for studying the effects of gas\ndrag on a planetesimal in the highly inclined case ($30^\\circ <i_B<150^\\circ$).\nWe then find that gas drag plays a crucial role, and the results can be\ngenerally divided into two categories, i.e., the Kozai-on regime and the\nKozai-off regime, depending on the specific value of $i_B$. For both regimes, a\nrobust outcome over a wide range of parameters is that, planetesimals\nmigrate/jump inwards and pile up, leading to a severely truncated and dense\nplanetesimal disk around the primary. In this compact and dense disk, collision\nrates are high but relative velocities are low, providing conditions which are\nfavorable for planetesimal growth, and potentially allow for the subsequent\nformation of planets. \n\n"}

The beaming effect is due\nto the increase (decrease) of the brightness of any light source approaching\n(receding from) the observer. To first order, the beaming and the\nreflection/heating effects modulate the stellar brightness at the orbital\nperiod, with phases separated by a quarter of a period, whereas the ellipsoidal\neffect is modulated with the orbital first harmonic.

Nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open in\nthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the GRB environment. In\nparticular, GRB 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic halo\nenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and the\nnon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. In this work we collect all\npublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the NIR-to-X-ray\nspectral energy distribution (SED) and studying the high signal-to-noise\nVLT/FORS afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of GRB\nabsorbers. The SED reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the UV, low\nequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a LMC- or\nSMC-type extinction curve. From the weak MgII absorption at z=1.5477 in the\nspectrum, we derived logN(MgII)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ionic\ncolumn density of several metals. These suggest that the GRB absorber is most\nlikely an LLS with a 0.03Z\\odot<Z<1.3Z\\odot metallicity. The comparison with\nother GRB absorbers places GRB070125 at the low end of the absorption line\nequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features and\nspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.\nMoreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surrounding\nthe GRB, combined with a low N(HI) along a short segment of the line of sight\nwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in GRB070125.\nFinally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faint\nGRB host galaxy, well within the GRB host brightness distribution. Thus, the\npossibility that GRB070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,\nmassive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems more\nlikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin. \n\n"}

Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk).

Conversely, since almost all single stars have a\nsimilar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity\nin RV surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is\nvery well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the\ndisk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation. \n\n"}

During the flyby, the\non-board OSIRIS imaging system acquired spectacular images of Lutetia's\nnorthern hemisphere revealing a complex surface scarred by numerous impact\ncraters, reaching the maximum dimension of about 55km.

For this purpose, we apply current\nmodels describing the formation and evolution of main belt asteroids, that\nprovide the rate and velocity distributions of impactors. These models, coupled\nwith appropriate crater scaling laws, allow us to interpret the observed crater\nsize-frequency distribution (SFD) and constrain the cratering history.

A fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfs\nexhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk,\ncompared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our\ntargets, we find a flat disk structure, which is consistent with the stronger\nsigns of dust processing observed in these disks.

Simple large-scale\nradial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical\ncomposition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in\nthis disk.

Methodology\n  and Validation Abstract: We examine the observational consequences of partial gaps being opened by\nplanets in protoplanetary disks. We model the disk using a static alpha-disk\nmodel with detailed radiative transfer, parametrizing the shape and size of the\npartially cleared gaps based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations.\nShadowing and illumination by stellar irradiation at the surface of the gap\nleads to increased contrast as the gap trough is deepened by shadowing and\ncooling and the far gap wall is puffed up by illumination and heating. In\ncalculating observables, we find that multiple scattering is important and\nderive an approximation to include these effects. A gap produced by a 200\nM_Earth (70 M_Earth) planet at 10 AU can lower/raise the midplane temperature\nof the disk by up to ~-25/+29% (~-11/+19%) by shadowing in the gap trough and\nillumination on the far shoulder of the gap.

The observations were taken at 340 GHz (880\nmicron) with the SMA in its most extended configuration, resulting in an\nangular resolution of 0.3\" (35 AU at the distance of the target).

We simultaneously model\nthe entire optical to millimeter wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED)\nand SMA visibilities of RX J1633.9-2442 in order to constrain the structure of\nits disk. We find that an empty cavity ~25 AU in radius is inconsistent with\nthe excess emission observed at 12, 22, and 24 micron. Instead, the mid-IR\nexcess can be modeled by either a narrow, optically thick ring at ~10 AU or an\noptically thin region extending from ~7 AU to ~25 AU. The inner disk (r < 5 AU)\nis mostly depleted of small dust grains as attested by the lack of detectable\nnear-IR excess.

Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that\ncause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine the\ntheory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely\nconvective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular,\nwe examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor\nQ, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered\nstar or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is\nreduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This\ngenerates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide\nwhich is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is\ndissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an\neddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a\nsecond velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature\nwith the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the\ndisturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,\nfrom which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the\nsystem evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and\nspecifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the\nthickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low\nfrequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a\nconstant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate. \n\n"}

As a result, the conductiv- ity,\nproportional to the ionization fraction, gains a strong, positive dependence on\ntemperature. In this paper, we demonstrate that this relation between the\ntemperature and the conductivity triggers an exponential instability that acts\nsimilarly to an electrical short, where the increased conductivity concentrates\nthe current and locally increases the Ohmic heating. This contrasts with the\nresistiv- ity increase expected in an ideal magnetic reconnection region. The\ninstability acts to focus narrow current sheets into even narrower sheets with\nfar higher currents and temparatures. We lay out the basic principles of this\nbehavior in this paper using protoplanetary disks as our example host system,\nmotivated by observations of chondritic meteorites and their ancestors, dust\ngrains in protoplanetary disks, that reveal the existence of strong, frequent\nheating events that this instability could explain. \n\n"}

With the\nexistence of low-velocity collisions, a small fraction of the particles manage\nto grow to masses orders of magnitude above the main population.

Recently, the validity of the often used\nfast orbital advection algorithm (FARGO) has been put into question, and\nspecial numerical resolution and stability requirements have been suggested.

Additionally, we study the difference of two and\nthree-dimensional simulations, compare global with local setups, as well as\nisothermal and adiabatic conditions.

Methods. We\nperformed a test that simulates transits of super-Earths and Neptunes in real\nCoRoT light curves and searches for them blindly by using the LAM transit\ndetection pipeline. Results. The CoRoT detection rate of planets with radius\nbetween 2 and 4 Rearth and orbital period P \\leq 20 days is 59% (31%) around\nstars brighter than r'=14.0 (15.5).

Transit detection\ndepends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host\nstar properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are\nsmaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more\nmetal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii\nproduce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous\nfinding, that highly-irradiated giant are more likely to have \"inflated\" radii,\nremains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit\ndepth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of\nany intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation\nbetween giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an\nartifact. \n\n"}

On average, this sample size\nroughly corresponds to 180 real galaxy members within 3r200, similar to recent\nredshift surveys of cluster regions.

We confirmed\nthat the spiral arms are formed due to a swing amplification mechanism that\nreinforces density enhancement as a seeded wake. In the damping phase, the\nCoriolis force exerted on a portion of the arm surpasses the gravitational\nforce that acts to shrink the portion. Consequently, the stars in the portion\nescape from the arm, and subsequently they form a new arm at a different\nlocation. The time-dependent nature of the spiral arms are originated in the\ncontinual repetition of this non-linear phenomenon. Since a spiral arm does not\nrigidly rotate, but follows the galactic differential rotation, the stars in\nthe arm rotate at almost the same rate as the arm. In other words, every single\nposition in the arm can be regarded as the co-rotation point. Due to\ninteraction with their host arms, the energy and angular momentum of the stars\nchange, thereby causing the radial migration of the stars. During this process,\nthe kinetic energy of random motion (random energy) of the stars does not\nsignificantly increase, and the disk remains dynamically cold. Owing to this\nlow degree of disk heating, the short-lived spiral arms can recurrently develop\nover many rotational periods. The resultant structure of the spiral arms in the\n$N$-body simulations is consistent with some observational nature of spiral\ngalaxies. We conclude that the formation and structure of spiral arms in\nisolated disk galaxies can be reasonably understood by non-linear interactions\nbetween a spiral arm and its constituent stars. \n\n"}

We observed 20 candidates with the adaptive optics imager NaCo and 18\nwith the high-resolution infrared spectrograph CRIRES. We found previously\nunknown stars within 2 arcsec of the targets in seven of the candidates. All of\nthese are too faint and too close to the targets to have been previously\ndetected with seeing-limited telescopes in the optical. Our study thus leads to\nthe surprising results that if we remove all candidates excluded by the\nsophisticated analysis of the light-curve, as well as carrying out deep imaging\nwith seeing-limited telescopes, still 28-35% of the remaining candidates are\nfound to possess companions that are bright enough to be false-positives. Given\nthat the companion-candidates cluster around the targets and that the J-K\ncolours are consistent with physical companions, we conclude that the\ncompanion-candidates are more likely to be physical companions rather than\nunrelated field stars. \n\n"}

Accretion is strongly dependent on the SED\ntype. About half of the transition objects are consistent with no accretion,\nand dust-depleted disks have weak (or undetectable) accretion signatures,\nespecially among M-type stars. The analysis of accretion and disk structure\nsuggests a parallel evolution of dust and gas.

The differences in disk structure between M-type and solar-type stars in\nTr37 (4 Myr) are not as remarkable as in the young, sparse, Coronet cluster\n(1-2 Myr), suggesting that other factors, like the environment/interactions,\nare likely to play a role in the disk evolution and dispersal.

In this scenario the MWA can be\nconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM\nbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters.

However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal\ndissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the\nso-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems,\nexplaining some systematic features present in the observations. This\nhydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical\nstreamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such\nsystems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the\ninfluence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot\nJupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical\nsimulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated\nto the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of\nad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the\nelliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of\ncompressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the\nincompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability\nto grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized\nlatitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the\nfluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a\ncentrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an\nincompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability.\nFinally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the\nmain tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and\nmisaligned stars is consistent with current data. \n\n"}

The actual value depends on\nseveral factors: the location in the protoplanetary disk, atmospheric opacity,\nand the accretion rate of solids. Motivated by ongoing direct imaging searches\nfor giant planets, this study investigates core mass requirements in the outer\ndisk. To determine the fastest allowed rates of gas accretion, we consider\nsolid cores that no longer accrete planetesimals, as this would heat the\ngaseous envelope.

It is typically\nfound that there will be many well-constrained degrees of freedom. However, not\nall and, probably most, of these degrees of freedom were physical if the\nparametrization had allowed for an arbitrary $k$-dependence. In this paper, we\nrestrict the $k$-dependence to that allowed in local theories of gravity under\nthe quasi-static approximation, i.e. ratios of polynomials in $k$, and identify\nthe best constrained features in the ($z$,$k$)-dependence of the commonly\nconsidered functions $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ as measured by an LSST-like weak\nlensing survey.

Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. Rather,\nthe underlying distribution of minimum-mass disks is characterized by a broad\nrange of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous disks can only explain a\nnarrow range of slopes (roughly between r^0 and r^-1.5). Yet accretion of\nterrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radial\ndistribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths must\ntherefore not represent the structure of their parent gas disks and can not\nhave predominantly formed in situ.

Recent work on the transmission spectrum has shown\nclear evidence for the presence of clouds in its atmosphere, which\nsignificantly increases the model atmosphere parameter space that must be\nexplored in order to fully characterise this planet.

We then perform a new\nretrieval of the temperature profile and abundances of H2O, CO2, CO and CH4\nfrom the dayside thermal emission spectrum.

The turbulence is driven by the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) with either ideal or non-ideal MHD that\nincludes ambipolar diffusion (AD). In ideal MHD simulations, the surface\ndensity evolution (except for dust that drifts fastest), turbulent diffusion,\nand vertical scale height of dust can all be reproduced by simple\none-dimensoinal and/or analytical models.

To understand this anomaly in more\ndetail, we carry out both unstratified and stratified local shearing box\nsimulations with Lagrangian particles, and find that turbulence in AD dominated\ndisks has very different properties (e.g., temporal autocorrelation functions\nand power spectra) than turbulence in ideal MHD disks, which leads to quite\ndifferent particle diffusion efficiency. For example, MRI turbulence with AD\nhas a longer correlation time for the vertical velocity, which causes\nsignificant vertical particle diffusion and large dust scale height.

We show that\npairs of similar-mass planets in co-orbital resonance are disrupted during\nlarge-scale orbital migration. Destabilization occurs when one or both planets\nis near the critical mass needed to open a gap in the gaseous disk. A confined\ngap is opened that spans the 60 degree azimuthal separation between planets.\nThis alters the torques imparted by the disk on each planet -- pushing the\nleading planet outward and the trailing planet inward -- and disrupts the\nresonance.

In discs with an efficient radiative transport, the\nmigration can be directed outwards for planets with more than 3-5 Earth masses.\nThis is due to the entropy driven corotation torque, a process that extends the\nlifetimes of growing planetary embryos. We investigate the influence on the\ndisc structure caused by a jump in the alpha parameter of the viscosity to\nmodel a dead-zone structure in the disc. We focus on M-dot discs, which have a\nconstant net mass flux. Using the resulting disc structure, we investigate the\nconsequences for the formation of planetesimals and determine the regions of\noutward migration for proto-planets. We performed numerical hydrosimulations of\nM-dot discs in the r-z-plane. We used the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code\nFARGOCA that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation as well\nas a two-temperature solver that includes radiation transport in the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation. Viscosity transitions inside the disc\ncreate transitions in density that stop inward migration for small planets\nthrough the so-called \"planet trap\" mechanism. This mechanism also works for\nplanets down to M_P > 0.5M_E. Additionally, the viscosity transitions change\nthe pressure gradient in the disc, which facilitates planetesimal formation via\nthe streaming instability. However, a very steep transition in viscosity is\nneeded to achieve in a pressure bump in the disc. The transition in viscosity\nfacilitates planetesimal formation and can stop the migration of small-mass\nplanets (M_P>0.5M_E), but still does not halt inward migration of smaller\nplanets and planetesimals that are affected by gas drag.

The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life.

For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity.

We investigate the occurrence rate of substellar\ncompanions around giant stars as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. We\nprobe the stellar mass range from about 1 to beyond 3 M_Sun, which is not being\nexplored by main-sequence samples.

This minimum\nM_crit applies when planetesimal accretion does not substantially heat the\natmosphere. Compared to an ideal gas polytrope, the inclusion of molecular\nhydrogen (H_2) dissociation and variable occupation of H_2 rotational states\nincreases M_crit. Specifically, M_crit increases by a factor of ~2 if the H_2\nspin isomers, ortho- and parahydrogen, are in thermal equilibrium, and by a\nfactor of ~2-4 if the ortho-to-para ratio is fixed at 3:1.

Planet-metallicity correlations Abstract: Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation,\nrequires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gas\ngiant planets. The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling\nin the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around\nmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide\nrange of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these\nobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation\nhypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis\ncalculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations\nof the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and\nnot even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the\ninner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star\nmetallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these\nsmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around\nthe Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low\nmetallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,\nwhereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow\ncontract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally,\nsimulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity\npreference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known\ndirectly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor. \n\n"}

The bias towards smaller radii depends on the properties of the\ncompanion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companion\nstars. Defining a planetary radius correction factor $X_R$, we find that if the\nKOIs are assumed to be single, then, {\\it on average}, the planetary radii may\nbe underestimated by a factor of $\\langle X_R \\rangle \\approx 1.5$. If typical\nradial velocity and high resolution imaging observations are performed and no\ncompanions are detected, this factor reduces to $\\langle X_R \\rangle \\approx\n1.2$.

These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets.

Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) process,\ntheoretical predictions for the temporal and spectral evolution of TGFs are\ncompared to observations made with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board\nthe Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Assuming a single source altitude of 15\nkm, a comparison of simulations to data is performed for a range of empirically\nchosen source electron variation time scales. The data exhibit a clear\nsoftening with increased source distance, in qualitative agreement with\ntheoretical predictions. The simulated spectra follow this trend in the data,\nbut tend to underestimate the observed hardness. Such a discrepancy may imply\nthat the basic RREA model is not sufficient. Alternatively, a TGF beam that is\ntilted with respect to the zenith could produce an evolution with source\ndistance that is compatible with the data.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution. \n\n"}

In primarily neutral regions, dust grains move as aerodynamic particles,\nnot necessarily with the gas. We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case. Our results are applicable to MCs of essentially all sizes\nand densities, but we note how Lorentz forces and other physics (neglected\nhere) may change them in some regimes.

We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets\n(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer\nNeptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth). We find no systematic trend in\nthe planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the\nincreasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass-radius relationship\nand heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are\nindependent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass\nlocked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where\nKepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average\nheavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with\nstellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7\nM_Earth in M stars.

We conduct a\nlarge population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational\npotential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar\nspin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar\nspin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking.

However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have\ndecreased below water condensation level well before the disk was\nphotoevaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is\npuzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be\ndirect condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the\nSun more slowly than the gas itself. The appearance of ice in a range of\nheliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial\ndrift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a sufficiently massive\nplanet is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because the\ndisk acquires a superKeplerian rotation just outside of the planetary orbit.\nFrom this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved about 20\nEarth masses when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively\nfossilized the snowline at that location. Although cooling, the disk inside of\nthe Jovian orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from\nthe outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that\nplanetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in\ntheir inner regions than our system.

By combining the new\nHerschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a\nparameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using\ntwo-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling.

We find that the four disks have critical radii\nof $\\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5\norders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are\nconsistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted\nby the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp\ndrop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local\ngas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase\nchemical pathways to water below 300 K.

Here we present a three-dimensional model\nthat explains this relationship, in order to shed insight on the processes that\ncontrol heat redistribution in tidally-locked planetary atmospheres. This\nthree-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric\ncirculation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of\nequilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag\nstrengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic\ntheory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves\nmediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,\nanalogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure\nin Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by\neither radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag\nwould likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere\nthreaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with\nincreasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and\ncooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative\nheating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing\nequilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in\ncontrolling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our\nanalytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important\nif it is stronger than the Coriolis force.

Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape\nthe observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible\nfor producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact\noutcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass\nloss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO.\nIn this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments\nin Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous\nplanets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several\nproperties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass\nof the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion\nthat accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that\ndepends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a\ngas giant near this orbital period, which provides an observational prediction\nthat can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period gas giants undergo RLO.\nWe conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed\npopulation of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that\nmay be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some\nshort-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can\nelucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain\nlargely unconstrained. \n\n"}

Abstract: Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities.

Eventually, we also study\nthe case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable\nIR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual\ninstruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY. We suggest a new method, which\nconsists in using astrometry to quantify asymmetries (clumpiness) in inner\ndebris discs that cannot be otherwise resolved. \n\n"}

Application of\nthis technique found a variation of radius with wavelength which was far too\nstrong to be explained by scattering processes in the planetary atmosphere. A\nfaint nearby star was subsequently detected, whose contamination of the transit\nlight curves might explain this anomaly. We present a reanalysis of published\ndata in order to characterise the faint star and assess its effect on the\nmeasured transmission spectrum. The faint star has a mass of 0.72 +/- 0.08 Msun\nand is almost certainly gravitationally bound to the planetary system. We find\nthat its effect on the measured physical properties of the planet and host star\nis small, amounting to a planetary radius larger by 0.6 sigma and planetary\ndensity smaller by 0.8 sigma. Its influence on the measured transmission\nspectrum is much greater: the spectrum now has a minimum around 760 nm and\nopacity rises to both bluer and redder wavelengths. It is a poor match to\ntheoretical spectra and the spectral slope remains too strong for Rayleigh\nscattering. The existence of the faint nearby star cannot therefore explain the\nmeasured spectral properties of this hot and inflated planet. We advocate\nfurther observations of the system, both with high spatial resolution in order\nto improve the measured properties of the faint star, and with higher spectral\nresolution to confirm the anomalous transmission spectrum of the planet. \n\n"}

In the simplest model, SM+D,\nwhich is the standard model plus a real singlet scalar named darkon acting as\nthe DM candidate, the LUX and PandaX-II limits rule out DM masses roughly from\n4 to 450 GeV, except a small range around the resonance point at half of the\nHiggs mass where the interaction cross-section is near the neutrino-background\nfloor. In the THDM II+D, which is the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model combined\nwith a darkon, the region excluded in the SM+D by the direct searches can be\nrecovered due to suppression of the DM effective interactions with nucleons at\nsome values of the ratios of Higgs couplings to the up and down quarks, making\nthe interactions significantly isospin-violating.

The technique of image stacking allows us to measure the averaged\nlight profile beneath the detection limit and probe the extended structure of a\ngroup of galaxies. We carry out simulations to examine the recovery of the\naveraged surface brightness profile through stacking model HST/ACS images of a\nset of galaxies as functions of Sersic index (n), effective radius (Re) and\naxis ratio (AR). The Sersic profile best fitting the radial profile of the\nstacked image is taken as the recovered profile, in comparison with the\nintrinsic mean profile of the model galaxies. Our results show that, in\ngeneral, the structural parameters of the mean profile can be properly\ndetermined through stacking, although systematic biases need to be corrected\nwhen spreads of Re and AR are counted. We find that Sersic index is slightly\noverestimated and Re is underestimated at AR < 0.5 as the stacked image appears\nto be more compact due to the presence of inclined galaxies; the spread of Re\nbiases the stacked profile to have a higher Sersic index. We stress that the\nmeasurements of structural parameters through stacking should take these biases\ninto account. We estimate the biases in the recovered structural parameters\nfrom stacks of galaxies when the samples have distributions of Re, AR and n\nseen in local galaxies. \n\n"}

High contrast imaging with VLT/SPHERE Abstract: We search for signs of ongoing planet-disk interaction and study the\ndistribution of small grains at the surface of the transition disk around\nRXJ1615.3-3255 (RX J1615). We observed RXJ1615 with VLT/SPHERE. We image the\ndisk for the first time in scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a\ngap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of\nthe arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting\nfor the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 \\pm 2 degrees\nand find semi-major axes of 1.50 \\pm 0.01\" (278 au), 1.06 \\pm 0.01\" (196 au)\nand 0.30 \\pm 0.01\" (56 au), respectively.

Nine\npoint sources are detected between 2.1\" and 8.0\" separation and considered as\ncompanion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources,\nwhich we determine not to be co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. We\npresent the first detection of the transition disk of RXJ1615 in scattered\nlight. The height of the rings indicate limited flaring of the disk surface,\nwhich enables partial self-shadowing in the disk.

In disks, the ratios of volatile elements, such as C/O and\nN/O, are regulated by the abundance of the main C, N, O carriers, their ice\nbinding environment, and the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at\ndifferent distances from the central star. We explore the effects of disk\ndynamical processes, molecular compositions and abundances, and ice\ncompositions on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers, and the\nC/N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout the disk. The gas-phase N/O ratio\nenhancement in the outer disk (exterior to the H2O snowline) exceeds the C/O\nratio enhancement for all reasonable volatile compositions. Ice compositions\nand disk dynamics individually change the snowline location of N2, the main\nnitrogen carrier, by a factor of 2-3, and when considered together the range of\npossible N2 snowline locations is ~11- ~79 AU in a standard disk model.\nObservations that anchor snowline locations at different stages of planet\nformation are therefore key to develop C/N/O ratios as a probe of planet\nformation zones. \n\n"}

Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model to\nsimulate the ability of frozen planets to escape from glaciation by\naccumulating enough gaseous CO$_2$. We find that Earth-like planets orbiting a\nSun-like star may never be able to escape from glaciation if their orbital\ndistance is greater than $\\sim$ 1.27 AU (Flux $<$ 847 W m$^{-2}$ or 62$\\%$ of\nthe Solar constant), because CO$_2$ would condense at the poles forming\npermanent CO$_2$ ice caps. This limits the amount of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere\nand thus its greenhouse effect. The amount of CO$_2$ that can be trapped in the\npolar caps depends on the efficiency of CO$_2$ ice to flow laterally as well as\nits graviational stability relative to subsurface water ice. The flow of CO$_2$\nice from poles to equator is mostly controlled by the bottom temperature, and\nhence by the internal heat flux. We find that a frozen Earth-like planet\nlocated at 1.30 AU of a Sun-like star could store as much as 1.5/4.5/15 bars of\ndry ice at the poles, for internal heat fluxes of 100/30/10 mW m$^{-2}$. But\nthese amounts are lower limits. For planets with a significant water ice cover,\nwe show that CO$_2$ ice deposits should be gravitationnally unstable. They get\nburied beneath the water ice cover in geologically short timescales of\n$\\sim$~10$^4$ yrs, mainly controlled by the viscosity of water ice. CO$_2$\nwould be permanently sequestered underneath the water ice cover, in the form of\nCO$_2$ liquids, CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates and/or dissolved in subglacial water\nreservoirs (if any).

Dynamical simulations show that the outcome of the planetary formation\nprocess can lead to different planetary architectures (i.e. location, size,\nmass, and water content) when the star system is single or double. In the late\nphase of planetary formation, when embryo-sized objects dominate the inner\nregion of the system, asteroids are also present and can provide additional\nmaterial for objects inside the habitable zone (HZ). In this study, we make a\ncomparison of several binary star systems and aim to show how efficient they\nare at moving icy asteroids from beyond the snow line into orbits crossing the\nHZ. We also analyze the influence of secular and mean motion resonances on the\nwater transport towards the HZ. Our study shows that small bodies also\nparticipate in bearing a non-negligible amount of water to the HZ. The\nproximity of a companion moving on an eccentric orbit increases the flux of\nasteroids to the HZ, which could result in a more efficient water transport on\na short timescale, causing a heavy bombardment. In contrast to asteroids moving\nunder the gravitational perturbations of one G-type star and a gas giant, we\nshow that the presence of a companion star not only favors a faster depletion\nof our disk of planetesimals, but can also bring 4-5 times more water into the\nwhole HZ. However, due to the secular resonance located either inside the HZ or\ninside the asteroid belt, impacts between icy planetesimals from the disk and\nbig objects in the HZ can occur at high impact speed. Therefore, real collision\nmodeling using a GPU 3D-SPH code show that in reality, the water content of the\nprojectile is greatly reduced and therefore, also the water transported to\nplanets or embryos initially inside the HZ. \n\n"}

Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM.

In the case of 3-10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$\nplanets a disk always forms. The temperature profile of the circumplanetary\ndisks is very steep, the inner 1/6th is over the silicate condensation\ntemperature and the entire disk is above water freezing point, making satellite\nformation impossible in this early stage ($<$1 Myr). Satellites might form much\nlater and first in the outer parts of the disk migrating inwards later on. Our\ndisk masses are $1, 7, 20, 40 \\times 10^{-3}\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ for the 1, 3, 5,\n10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ gas giants respectively, and we provide an empirical\nformula to estimate the subdisk masses based on the planet- and circumstellar\ndisk mass.

From the PMS to the RGB at solar\n  metallicity Abstract: Star-planet interactions must be taken into account in stellar models to\nunderstand the dynamical evolution of close-in planets. The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

Jupiter's\nlarge internal dynamo magnetic field generates a gigantic magnetosphere, which\nis strongly rotational driven and possesses large plasma sources located deeply\nwithin the magnetosphere. The combination of the latter two effects is the\nprimary reason for Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the\nonly known moon with an intrinsic dynamo magnetic field, which generates a\nmini-magnetosphere located within Jupiter's larger magnetosphere including two\nauroral ovals. Ganymede's magnetosphere is qualitatively different compared to\nthe one from Jupiter. It possesses no bow shock but develops Alfv\\'en wings\nsimilar to most of the extrasolar planets which orbit their host stars within\n0.1 AU. New numerical models of Jupiter's and Ganymede's magnetospheres\npresented here provide quantitative insight into the processes that maintain\nthese magnetospheres. Jupiter's magnetospheric field is approximately\ntime-periodic at the locations of Jupiter's moons and induces secondary\nmagnetic fields in electrically conductive layers such as subsurface oceans. In\nthe case of Ganymede, these secondary magnetic fields influence the oscillation\nof the location of its auroral ovals. Based on dedicated Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations, an analysis of the amplitudes of the auroral oscillations\nprovides evidence that Ganymede harbors a subsurface ocean.

Assuming that civilisations reside\nin a Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ), I conduct Monte Carlo Realisation\nsimulations of the establishment and growth of this network, and analyse its\nproperties in the context of graph theory.\n  I find that at any instant, only a few civilisations are correctly aligned to\ncommunicate via transits.

Under such a circumstance, it may\nbe invaluable to attempt to specify when and how planet formation begins in\nstar-forming regions and to identify what physical processes/quantities are the\nmost significant to make a link between star and planet formation. To this end,\nwe have recently developed a couple of projects. These include an observational\nproject about dust growth in Class 0 YSOs and a theoretical modeling project of\nthe HL Tauri disk. For the first project, we utilize the archive data of radio\ninterferometric observations, and examine whether dust growth, a first step of\nplanet formation, occurs in Class 0 YSOs. We find that while our observational\nresults can be reproduced by the presence of large ($\\sim$ mm) dust grains for\nsome of YSOs under the single-component modified blackbody formalism, an\ninterpretation of no dust growth would be possible when a more detailed model\nis used.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory.

For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature.

The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit\ntheory of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For\nsufficiently large core mass (in the \"Hill regime\"), essentially all particles\nof appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be captured. However, the\nouter regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle\norbits may affect the efficiency of pebble accretion.

IOPF involves sequential planet formation from\npebble-rich rings that are fed from the outer disk and trapped at the pressure\nmaximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB). Planet masses are\nset by their ability to open a gap and cause the DZIB to retreat outwards. We\npresent models for the disk density and temperature structures that are\nrelevant to the conditions of IOPF. For a wide range of DZIB conditions, we\nevaluate the gap opening masses of planets in these disks that are expected to\nlead to truncation of pebble accretion onto the forming planet. We then\nconsider the evolution of dust and pebbles in the disk, estimating that pebbles\ntypically grow to sizes of a few cm during their radial drift from several tens\nof AU to the inner, $\\lesssim1\\:$AU-scale disk. A large fraction of the\naccretion flux of solids is expected to be in such pebbles. This allows us to\nestimate the timescales for individual planet formation and entire planetary\nsystem formation in the IOPF scenario. We find that to produce realistic STIPs\nwithin reasonable timescales similar to disk lifetimes requires disk accretion\nrates of $\\sim10^{-9}\\:M_\\odot\\:{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ and relatively low viscosity\nconditions in the DZIB region, i.e., Shakura-Sunyaev parameter of\n$\\alpha\\sim10^{-4}$. \n\n"}

This state may be subject\nto a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical shear instability' (VSI), whose\nbreakdown into turbulence transports a moderate amount of angular momentum\nwhile also facilitating planet formation, possibly via the production of\nsmall-scale vortices. In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit\narbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the\nincompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are\nthemselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk\nrotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain\nlarge amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed). This `delay' in\nsaturation probably explains the prominence of the VSI linear modes in global\nsimulations. More generally, the parasites may set the amplitude of VSI\nturbulence in strongly irradiated disks. They are also important in breaking\nthe axisymmetry of the flow, via the unavoidable formation of vortices. The\nvortices, however, are not aligned with the orbital plane and thus express a\npronounced $z$-dependence. We also briefly demonstrate that the vertical shear\nhas little effect on the magnetorotational instability, whereas magnetic fields\neasily quench the VSI, a potential issue in the ionised surface regions of the\ndisk and also at larger radii. \n\n"}

The system expands with period ratios increasing and mean\neccentricities decreasing with time. This evolution is largely driven by tides\nacting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones. In order\nthat deviations from commensurability become significant only on $Gy$ time\nscales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the\nplanets has to be such that $Q' > \\sim 10^{2-3}.$ At the same time, if we start\nwith two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one,\n$Q'$ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly\nexceeding) $10^{2-3}$ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the\nobserved configuration.

Atmospheric Effects for an Unmagnetized Planet Abstract: Understanding the impact of active M-dwarf stars on the atmospheric\nequilibrium and surface conditions of a habitable zone Earth-like planet is key\nto assessing M dwarf planet habitability. Previous modeling of the impact of\nelectromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on an\nEarth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in\nozone were possible, but the atmosphere recovered. These stars more\nrealistically exhibit frequent flaring with a power-law distribution of\nenergies. Here we use a coupled 1D photochemical and radiative-convective model\nto investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and\nsurface UV of an Earth-like planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field.\nWe use time-resolved flare spectra obtained for the dM3 star AD Leo, combined\nwith flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically 10$^{30.5}$ to\n10$^{34}$ erg) from the 4-year Kepler light curve for the dM4 flare star\nGJ1243. Our model results show repeated EM-only flares have little effect on\nthe ozone column depth, but that multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the\nozone column. Combining the realistic flare and proton event frequencies with\nnominal CME & SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like planet\ncan be depleted by 94% in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery\nunlikely and suggests further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs O3\ndepletion allows a constant 0.1-1 W m$^{-2}$ of UV-C at the planet's surface,\nwhich is likely detrimental to organic complexity. Our results suggest that\nactive M dwarf hosts may comprehensively destroy ozone shields and subject the\nsurface of magnetically-unprotected Earth-like planets to long-term radiation\nthat can damage complex organic structures. However, this does not preclude\nhabitability, as a safe haven for life could still exist below an ocean\nsurface. \n\n"}

By studying the arrival times of the p-mode maxima and\nminima through the O-C method, in a previous article the presence of a planet\nwas inferred with an orbital period of 3.2 yr and a minimum mass of 3.2 M_Jup.\nHere we present an updated O-C analysis using a larger data set of 1066 hours\nof photometric time series (~2.5x larger in terms of the number of data\npoints), which covers the period between 1999 and 2012 (compared with 1999-2006\nof the previous analysis). Up to the end of 2008, the new O-C diagram of the\nmain pulsation frequency (f1) is compatible with (and improves) the previous\ntwo-component solution representing the long-term variation of the pulsation\nperiod (parabolic component) and the giant planet (sine wave component). Since\n2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation\nperiod (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of\nregime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between\ndifferent pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the\nO-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1\nand f2 differ or at least agree less well than before. The nice agreement found\npreviously was a coincidence due to various small effects that are carefully\nanalysed. Now, with a larger dataset, the presence of a planet is more\nuncertain and would require confirmation with an independent method. The new\ndata allow us to improve the measurement of p_dot for f1 and f2: using only the\ndata up to the end of 2008, we obtain p_dot_1=(1.34+-0.04)x10**-12 and\np_dot_2=(1.62+-0.22)x10**-12 ... \n\n"}

The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears as the best\nparametrisation by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra\nof brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets.

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$.

We find the mean grain\nsize of silicate minerals to be a key control on magma ascent. For grain sizes\nlarger than $\\approx$ 1 mm, melt segregation produces distinct radial structure\nand chemical stratification. This stratification is most pronounced for bodies\nformed at around 1 Myr after formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions. These findings\nsuggest a link between the time and orbital location of planetesimal formation\nand their subsequent structural and chemical evolution. According to our\nmodels, the evolution of partially molten planetesimal interiors falls into two\ncategories. In the magma ocean scenario, the whole interior of a planetesimal\nexperiences nearly complete melting, which would result in turbulent convection\nand core-mantle differentiation by the rainfall mechanism. In the magma sill\nscenario, segregating melts gradually deplete the deep interior of the\nradiogenic heat source. In this case, magma may form melt-rich layers beneath a\ncool and stable lid, while core formation would proceed by percolation.

The\nadvent, however, of the Gaia era, with measurements of $\\sim 10^9$ stellar\nparallaxes, in combination with upcoming large polarimetric surveys, make, for\nthe first time, a 3D measurement of the GMF possible in principle. Such\nmeasurements can then be used to attempt a reconstruction of the trajectories\nof individual UHECRs through the Galaxy, in order to correct for their\ndeflection.\n  Motivated by these developments, in the present work, we study the limits of\nsuch a correction, by examining how its effectiveness depends on the\nuncertainty of any such future magnetic field measurements. To that end, we\nsimulate attempts to reconstruct the trajectory of the cosmic ray by using\nhypothetical measurements of the GMF, based on values received from two\nrecently updated GMF models.

We\ninvestigate two scenarios that could lead to such a truncation, and find that\nthe observed SED is compatible with both. The first scenario involves the\ntruncation of both the dust and gas in the disc, perhaps due to a previous\ndynamical interaction or the presence of an undetected companion. The second\nscenario involves the fact that a radial location of 0.6 au is close to the\nexpected location of the H$_2$O snowline in the disc.

The goal of this project, for which the obtained\ndata will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the acquisition and\ndiffusion of technical expertise for transiting exoplanet observations with\nJWST, while also providing a compelling set of representative datasets that\nwill enable immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet\nCommunity ERS Program will exercise the time-series modes of all four JWST\ninstruments that have been identified as the consensus highest priorities,\nobserve the full suite of transiting planet characterization geometries\n(transits, eclipses, and phase curves), and target planets with host stars that\nspan an illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations in this program\nwere defined through an inclusive and transparent process that had\nparticipation from JWST instrument experts and international leaders in\ntransiting exoplanet studies. Community engagement in the project will be\ncentered on a two-phase Data Challenge that culminates with the delivery of\nplanetary spectra, time-series instrument performance reports, and open-source\ndata analysis toolkits in time to inform the agenda for Cycle 2 of the JWST\nmission. \n\n"}

To examine the planet--disk interaction model, we\npresent results of two-dimensional two fluid (gas + dust) hydrodynamic\nsimulations coupled with three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations. In\norder to fit the high gas-to-dust ratio of the first gap, we find the\nShakura--Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ must be very small ($\\lesssim\n10^{-4}$) in the inner disk. On the other hand, a relatively large $\\alpha$\n($\\sim 7.5\\times 10^{-3}$) is required to reproduce the dust surface density in\nthe outer disk. We interpret the variation of $\\alpha$ as an indicator of the\ntransition from an inner dead zone to the outer magnetorotational instability\n(MRI) active zone.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

The RV data is modelled\ntogether with the Kepler photometry using a photodynamical model. The inclusion\nof velocity information breaks the $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy inherent in timing data\nalone, allowing us to measure the absolute stellar and planetary radii and\nmasses. With uncertainties of 12% and 13% for the stellar and inner planet\nradii, and 35%, 24%, and 35% for the masses of the star, planet b, and planet c\nrespectively, these measurements are the most precise to date for a single host\nstar system using this technique. The transiting planet mass is determined at\nbetter precision than the star mass. This shows that modelling the radial\nvelocities and the light curve together in systems of dynamically interacting\nplanets provides a way of characterising both the star and the planets without\nbeing limited by knowledge of the star. On the other hand, the period ratio and\neccentricities place the Kepler-419 system in a sweet spot; had around twice as\nmany transits been observed, the mass of the transiting planet could have been\nmeasured using its own TTVs. Finally, the origin of the Kepler-419 system is\ndiscussed. We show that the system is near a coplanar high-eccentricity secular\nfixed point, related to the alignment of the orbits, which has prevented the\ninner orbit from circularising.

We present new VLT/SPHERE\nIRDIS Dual-Polarization Imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust\nring around the M2 spectral type star TWA\\,7. Combined with additional Angular\nDifferential Imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the\ndebris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets. We\nmodel the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of the small dust\ngrains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using\nthe results inferred from the observations, and perform simple N-body\nsimulations. We find that the dust density distribution peaks at 25 au, with a\nvery shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of 13\ndegrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low\nsignal-to-noise detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the\nstar, of a spiral arm in the Southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty\nclump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a\nyear. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close\nvicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper\nlimits.

This technique explicitly considers the time domain in\na given data set (specifically the frequencies of speckle variations and their\ntime dependence) and allows us to filter-out speckle noise. We combine our\nwavelet-based algorithm with state-of-the-art principal component analysis\n(PCA) based PSF subtraction routines and apply it to archival data sets of\nknown directly imaged exoplanets. The data sets were obtained in the L filter\nwhere the short integration times allow for a sufficiently high temporal\nsampling of the speckle variations. Results. We demonstrate that improvements\nin the peak SNR of up to forty to sixty percent can be achieved. We also show\nthat, when combined with wavelet-denoising, the PCA PSF model requires\nsystematically smaller numbers of components for the fit to achieve the highest\nSNR.

This paper investigates the evolution\nof such discs if they are very massive, as may be the case if their progenitor\nwas a terrestrial planet, moon, or dwarf planet. Assuming the discs are\nphysically thin and flat, like Saturn's rings, their evolution is governed by\nPoynting-Robertson drag or viscous spreading, where the disc's effective\nviscosity is due to self-gravity wakes. For discs with masses >10^26 g, located\nin the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone, viscous spreading dominates\nthe evolution, and mass is transported both in- and outwards. When\noutwards-spreading material flows beyond the Roche limit, it coagulates into\nnew (minor) planets in a process analogous to the ongoing formation of moonlets\nat the outer edge of Saturn's rings. The newly formed bodies migrate outwards\nby exchanging angular momentum with the disc and coalesce into larger objects\nthrough mutual collisions. Eventually, the disc's Roche-limit overflow recycles\ntens of percent of the original disc mass; most ends up in a single large body\nnear 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the disc's outer edge. Hence, the recycling\nof a tidally disrupted super-Earth, for example, could yield an Earth-mass\nplanet on a ~10-h orbit, located in the habitable zone for 2-to-10-Gyr-old\nwhite dwarfs. The recycling process also creates a population of smaller bodies\njust outside the Roche limit, which may explain the minor planets recently\npostulated to orbit WD 1145+017. \n\n"}

A\nsurprisingly high fraction of disks that have been well-studied in scattered\nlight have spiral arms of some kind (8/29), as do a high fraction (6/11) of\nwell-studied Herbig intermediate mass stars (i.e., Herbig stars $>\n1.5M_\\odot$). Here we explore the origin of spiral arms in Herbig systems by\nstudying their occurrence rates, disk properties, and stellar accretion rates.\nWe find that two-arm spirals are more common in disks surrounding Herbig\nintermediate mass stars than are directly imaged giant planet companions to\nmature A and B stars. If two-arm spirals are produced by such giant planets,\nthis discrepancy suggests that giant planets are much fainter than predicted by\nhot start models. In addition, the high stellar accretion rates of Herbig\nstars, if sustained over a reasonable fraction of their lifetimes, suggest that\ndisk masses are much larger than inferred from their submillimeter continuum\nemission.As a result, gravitational instability is a possible explanation for\nmulti-arm spirals.

However,\nthe efficiency in forming PHPs is directly related to the size of the\nplanetesimals. The smaller the planetesimals, the greater the efficiency in\nforming PHPs. We also analyze the sensitivity of our results to scenarios with\ntype I migration rates and gap-opening giants, finding that both phenomena act\nin a similar way. These effects seem to favor the formation of PHPs for small\nplanetesimal scenarios and to be detrimental for scenarios formed from big\nplanetesimals. Finally, another interesting result is that the formation of\nwater-rich PHPs seems to be more common than the formation of dry PHPs. \n\n"}

However, if a star has dark starspots (or bright regions) distributed\nthroughout the transit chord, the transit depth will be biased towards smaller\n(larger) values, and thus the inferred planet radius will be smaller (larger)\nif unaccounted for. We reparameterize the transit light curve to account for\n\"self-contamination\" by photospheric inhomogeneities by splitting the parameter\n$R_p/R_\\star$ into two parameters: one for the radius ratio -- which controls\nthe duration of ingress and egress -- and another which measures the possibly\ncontaminated transit depth. We show that this is equivalent to the formulation\nfor contamination by a second star (with positive or negative flux), and that\nit is sensitive to time-steady inhomogeneity of the stellar photosphere. We use\nsynthetic light curves of spotted stars at high signal-to-noise to show that\nthe radius recovered from measurement of the ingress/egress duration can\nrecover the true radii of planets transiting spotted stars with axisymmetric\nspot distributions if the limb-darkening parameters are precisely known.

We explore such correlations and data specific to\nthe multiplanetary-system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our\nunderstanding of planet interiors.

However, the\nphysical mechanism for the H{\\alpha} emission is poorly understood. According\nto recent high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the\nflow accreting onto protoplanets, the disk gas flows down almost vertically\nonto and collides with the surface of a circum-planetary disk at a super-sonic\nvelocity and thus passes through a strong shockwave. The shock-heated gas is\nhot enough to generate H{\\alpha} emission. Here we develop a one-dimensional\nradiative hydrodynamic model of the flow after the shock by detailed\ncalculations of chemical reactions and electron transitions in hydrogen atoms,\nand quantify the hydrogen line emission in the Lyman-, Balmer-, and\nPaschen-series from the accreting gas giant system.

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions.

We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow.

The DSHARP campaign shows\nthat several of these rings are very narrow in radial extent. In this paper we\ntest the hypothesis that these dust rings are caused by dust trapping in radial\npressure bumps, and if confirmed, put constraints on the physics of the dust\ntrapping mechanism. We model this process analytically in 1D, assuming\naxisymmetry. By comparing this model to the data, we find that all rings are\nconsistent with dust trapping. Based on a plausible model of the dust\ntemperature we find that several rings are narrower than the pressure scale\nheight, providing strong evidence for dust trapping. The rings have peak\nabsorption optical depth in the range between 0.2 and 0.5. The dust masses\nstored in each of these rings is of the order of tens of Earth masses, though\nmuch ambiguity remains due to the uncertainty of the dust opacities.

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength. We show that the composite\ngrain model cannot be ruled out if constituent particles are very small with\nradius $a_{p}\\le$ 25 nm, but large composite grains would be destroyed if the\nparticles are large with $a_{p}\\ge 50$ nm. We suggest that grain internal\nstructures can be constrained with observations using the dynamical RATD\nconstraint for strong radiation fields such as supernova, nova, or star-forming\nregions. Finally, our obtained results suggest that micron-sized grains perhaps\nhave compact/core-mantle structures or have composite structures but located in\nregions with slightly higher gas density and weaker radiation intensity than\nthe average ISM. \n\n"}

The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt.

More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

On the other hand, while\nmeshless methods have been widely used in both cosmology, galactic dynamics,\nand planet formation they have not been fully deployed on the MRI problem.

Concerning variants of the\nSPH hydro force formulation we consider both the \"vanilla\" SPH and the PSPH\nvariant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise\ninherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order\nkernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can\nadequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net\nvertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified\nboxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation. In zero-net-flux\nvertically stratified simulations, MFM can reproduce the MRI dynamo and its\ncharacteristic butterfly diagram for several tens of orbits before ultimately\ndecaying. In contrast, extremely strong toroidal fields, as opposed to\nsustained turbulence, develop in equivalent simulations using SPH MHD.

We first demonstrate that if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic\nprimitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial\natmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have\nno effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to\nsay, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation\nis unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is\nradiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will\ngenerally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the\ncondensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the\ngreenhouse effect.

They\ntentatively interpret these unresolved events as due to microlensing of\nbackground bulge stars by free-floating planets in M22. I show that if these\nspike events are due to microlensing, the lensing objects are unlikely to be\nassociated with M22, and unlikely to be part of a smoothly distributed Galactic\npopulation. Thus either there happens to be a massive, dark cluster of planets\nalong our line-of-sight to M22, or the spike events are not due to\nmicrolensing. The lensing planets cannot be bound to stars in the core of M22:\nif they were closer than 8 AU, the lensing influence of the parent star would\nhave been detectable. Moreover, in the core of M22, all planets with\nseparations > 1 AU would have been ionized by random stellar encounters. Most\nunbound planets would have escaped the core via evaporation which\npreferentially affects such low-mass objects. Bound or free-floating planets\ncan exist in the outer halo of M22; however, for reasonable assumptions, the\nmaximum optical depth to such a population falls short of the observed optical\ndepth, tau ~ 3x10^{-6}, by a factor of 5-10. Therefore, if real, these events\nrepresent the detection of a significant free-floating Galactic planet\npopulation. The optical depth to these planets is comparable to and mutually\nexclusive from the optical depth to resolved events measured by microlensing\nsurvey collaborations toward the bulge, and thus implies a similar additional\nmass of lensing objects. Such a population is difficult to reconcile with both\ntheory and observations. \n\n"}

Indeed, in the framework of a thermal corona\nmodel, we expect that part (or even all, depending on the coronal covering\nfactor) of the reflection features should cross the hot plasma, and thus suffer\nCompton scattering, before being observed. We have studied in detail the\ndependence of these effects on the physical (i.e. temperature and optical\ndepth) and geometrical (i.e. inclination angle) parameters of the corona,\nconcentrating on the slab geometry . Due to the smoothing and shifting towards\nhigh energies of the comptonized reflection hump, the main effects on the\nemerging spectra appear above 100 keV. We have also investigated the importance\nof such effects on the interpretation of the results obtained with the standard\nfitting procedures. We found that fitting Comptonization models, taking into\naccount comptonized reflection, by the usual cut-off power law + uncomptonized\nreflection model, may lead to an underestimation of the reflection\nnormalization and an overestimation of the high energy cut-off.

One factor that could have a significant effect on the\naction of the r-mode instability is fallback of supernova remnant material. The\nassociated accretion torque could potentially counteract any gravitational-wave\ninduced spin-down, and accretion heating could affect the viscous damping rates\nand hence the instability. We discuss the effects of various external agents on\nthe r-mode instability scenario within a simple model of supernova fallback on\nto a hot young magnetized neutron star. We find that the outcome depends\nstrongly on the strength of the star's magnetic field. Our model is capable of\ngenerating spin rates for young neutron stars that accord well with initial\nspin rates inferred from pulsar observations. The combined action of r-mode\ninstability and fallback appears to cause the spin rates of neutron stars born\nwith very different spin rates to converge, on a timescale of about a year. The\nresults suggest that stars with magnetic fields $\\le10^{13}$ G could emit a\ndetectable gravitational wave signal for perhaps several years after the\nsupernova event. Stars with higher fields (magnetars) are unlikely to emit a\ndetectable gravitational wave signal via the r-mode instability.

This is the first time that IR spectra\nof a supernova have been obtained to such late epochs. The spectra comprise\nemission from both the ejecta and the bright, ring-shaped circumstellar medium\n(CSM).

The ejecta spectra include\nallowed lines of H I, He I and Na I and forbidden lines of [Si I], [Fe I], [Fe\nII], and possibly [S I]. The intensity ratios and widths of the H I ejecta\nlines are consistent with a low-temperature Case B recombination spectrum\narising from non-thermal ionisation/excitation in an extended, adiabatically\ncooled H-envelope, as predicted by several authors. The slow decline of the\nejecta forbidden lines, especially those of [Si I], indicates that pure\nnon-thermal excitation was taking place, driven increasingly by the decay of\n44Ti.

For both cores, we derive radial profiles of constant temperature\nand constant turbulence, together with density distributions close to those of\nnon-singular isothermal spheres. Using these physical conditions and a Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer model, we derive abundance profiles for all species\nand model the strong chemical differentiation of the core interiors. According\nto our models, the NH3 abundance increases toward the core centers by a factor\nof several while N2H+ has a constant abundance over most of the cores. In\ncontrast, both C18O and CS (and isotopomers) are strongly depleted in the core\ninteriors, most likely due to their freeze out onto grains at densities of a\nfew 10^4 cm^{-3}. Concerning the kinematics of the dense gas, we find (in\naddition to constant turbulence) a pattern of internal motions at the level of\n0.1 km s^{-1}. These motions seem correlated with asymmetries in the pattern of\nmolecular depletion, and we interpret them as residuals of core contraction.\nTheir distribution and size suggest that core formation occurs in a rather\nirregular manner and with a time scale of a Myr. A comparison of our derived\ncore properties with those predicted by supersonic turbulence models of core\nformation shows that our Taurus cores are much more quiescent than\nrepresentative predictions from these models. \n\n"}

As found in previous studies, the [alpha/Fe]\nratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally lower than similar\nmetallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample. Our kinematically selected\nstars confirm that this is true for all major stellar components of the Galaxy,\nincluding the halo, thin disk, and thick disk. There is marginal overlap in the\nlow [alpha/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on extreme\nretrograde orbits, but this is not supported by other element ratios, like\n[Ba/Y]. Thus, the full chemical signature of most of the dSph stars are\ndistinct from the main components of the Galaxy. This result rules out\ncontinuous merging of low mass galaxies similar to these dSph satellites during\nthe formation of the Galaxy, which is discuss further. The new environments\noffered by the dSph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptions\nrelated to nucleosynthesis. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -1.8) in the dSph\ngalaxies have [alpha/Fe] ratio that are consistent with predictions from the\nalpha-process (alpha-rich freeze out). This may also explain the very low Y\nabundances, and could suggest a separate r-process site for this light (first\npeak r-process) element. In stars with higher metallicities ([Fe/H] > -1.8),\ncontributions from the s-process are expected; [Ba/Y] is still much higher in\nthe dSph stars than similar metallicity Galactic stars though, consistent with\ns-process contributions from only the low metallicity AGB stars in dSph\ngalaxies.

A promising possibility to\nexplain giant radio halos is given by the presence of relativistic electrons\nreaccelerated by some kind of turbulence generated in the cluster volume during\nmerger events. With the aim to investigate the connection between thermal and\nnon-thermal properties of the ICM, in this paper we develope a statistical\nmagneto-turbulent model which describes in a self-consistent way the evolution\nof the thermal ICM and that of the non-thermal emission from clusters. Making\nuse of the extended Press & Schechter formalism, we follow cluster mergers and\nestimate the injection rate of the fluid turbulence generated during these\nenergetic events. We then calculate the evolution of the spectrum of the\nrelativistic electrons in the ICM during the cluster life by taking into\naccount both the electron-acceleration due to the merger-driven turbulence and\nthe relevant energy losses of the electrons. We end up with a synthetic\npopulation of galaxy clusters for which the evolution of the ICM and of the\nnon-thermal spectrum emitted by the accelerated electrons is calculated.

We find that a surface wave in the shallow burning layer transitions\ninto a crustal interface wave as the envelope cools, a new and previously\nuninvestigated phenomenon.

Therefore we suggest that it will be\nnecessary to consider the rotation effects in the analyses of the coming binary\nevents if the microlensing events towards the halo are self-lensing. As an\nexample, we reexamine the MACHO LMC-9 event, in which the slow transverse\nvelocity of the lens binary suggests a microlensing event in the LMC disk. From\na simple analysis, it is shown that the lens binary with total mass $\\sim\n1M_{\\odot}$ rotates by more than $\\sim 60^{\\circ}$ during the Einstein radius\ncrossing time. However, the fitting of MACHO LMC-9 with an additional\nparameter, the rotation period, shows that the rotation effects are small,\ni.e., the projected rotation angle is only $\\sim 5.9^{\\circ}\n(M/M_{\\odot})^{1/4}$ during the Einstein radius crossing time.

The\npredicted proton spectrum can account for the observed flux of extremely high\nenergy cosmic rays beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff, for a decaying\nparticle mass of O(10^{12}) GeV. The lifetime required is of O(10^{20}) yr if\nsuch particles constitute all of the dark matter (with a proportionally shorter\nlifetime for a smaller contribution). Such values are plausible if the\nmetastable particles are hadron-like bound states from the hidden sector of\nsupersymmetry breaking which decay through non-renormalizable interactions. The\nexpected ratio of the proton to neutrino flux is given as a diagonistic of the\ndecaying particle model for the forthcoming Pierre Auger project. \n\n"}

One class of group manifolds (class B) leads to\nsupergravities that are defined by a set of equations of motion that cannot be\nintegrated to an action.\n  All 1/2 BPS domain wall solutions are given. We also find a\nnon-supersymmetric domain wall solution where the single transverse direction\nis time. This solution describes an expanding universe and upon reduction gives\nthe Einstein-de Sitter universe in D=4. The uplifting of the different\nsolutions to M-theory and the isometries of the corresponding group manifold\nare discussed. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/9408023", "contents": "Title: Stationarity of Inflation and Predictions of Quantum Cosmology Abstract: We describe several different regimes which are possible in inflationary\ncosmology. The simplest one is inflation without self-reproduction of the\nuniverse. In this scenario the universe is not stationary. The second regime,\nwhich exists in a broad class of inflationary models, is eternal inflation with\nthe self-reproduction of inflationary domains. In this regime local properties\nof domains with a given density and given values of fields do not depend on the\ntime when these domains were produced. The probability distribution to find a\ndomain with given properties in a self-reproducing universe may or may not be\nstationary, depending on the choice of an inflationary model. We give examples\nof models where each of these possibilities can be realized, and discuss some\nimplications of our results for quantum cosmology. In particular, we propose a\nnew mechanism which may help solving the cosmological constant problem. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9604064", "contents": "Title: Quantum Naked Singularities in 2d Dilaton Gravity Abstract: Roughly speaking, naked singularities are singularities that may be seen by\ntimelike observers. The Cosmic Censorship conjecture forbids their existence by\nstating that a reasonable system of energy will not, under reasonable\nconditions, collapse into a naked singularity. There are however many\n(classical) counter-examples to this conjecture in the literature. We propose a\ndefense of the conjecture through the quantum theory. We will show that the\nHawking effect and the accompanying back reaction, when consistently applied to\nnaked singularities in two dimensional models of dilaton gravity with matter\nand a cosmological constant, prevent their formation by causing them to explode\nor emit radiation catastrophically. This contrasts with black holes which\nradiate slowly. If this phenomenon is reproduced in the four dimensional world,\nthe explosion of naked singularities should have observable consequences. \n\n"}

The results we present are then exploited in a set of\nprocedures aimed at testing non-Gaussianity; for these statistics, we are able\nto show convergence to functionals of standard Brownian motion under the null\nhypothesis.

The increased accuracy and predictive power of the code CEM2k are shown\nby several examples. To describe fission and light-fragment (heavier than 4He)\nproduction, the CEM2k code has been merged with the GEM2 code of Furihata. We\npresent some results on proton-induced fragmentation and fission reactions\npredicted by this extended version of CEM2k. We show that merging CEM2k with\nGEM2 allows us to describe many fission and fragmentation reactions in addition\nto the spallation reactions which are already relatively well described. We\nhave initiated another approach to describe fission, complex particles and\nfragment emission by developing further our CEM2k code addressing specifically\nthese problems. In this effort, we have developed our own universal\napproximation for inverse cross sections, new routines to calculate Coulomb\nbarriers and widths of emitted particles and to simulate their kinetic energy\nusing arbitrary approximations for the inverse cross sections. To describe\nfission-fragment production, we have incorporated into CEM2k a thermodynamical\nmodel of fission by Stepanov. This extended version of CEM2k allows us to\ndescribe much better complex particle emission and many fission fragments, but\nit is still incomplete and needs further work. \n\n"}
