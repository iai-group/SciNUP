Unlike the often studied Z' cases, in this framework, there are\nthree neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X\ngauge group in the bulk. Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light\nquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are\nenhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light\nquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM\nconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the\ntop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly\ndecaying into them.

We perform a particle-level study of events with muons\nproduced inside of boosted tops, as well as in generic QCD jets and from\nW-strahlung off of hard quarks. We characterize the discriminating power of\ncuts previously explored in the literature, as well two new ones. We find a\nparticularly powerful isolation variable which can potentially reject light QCD\njets with hard embedded muons at the 10^3 level while retaining 80~90% of the\ntops. This can also be fruitfully combined with other cuts for O(1) greater\ndiscrimination.

The spectrometer features a large\nangular acceptance and high momentum resolution and also good coverage by\nelectromagnetic calorimetry, crucial for the detection of final states\ninvolving $\\pi^0$ or $\\eta$. A first important result is the observation of a\nsignificant $J^{PC}$ spin exotic signal consistent with the disputed\n$\\pi_1(1600)$ in the pilot run data. This result was recently published. We\npresent an overview of the status of various ongoing analyses on the 2008/09\ndata. \n\n"}

Various strategies are discussed to control these flavour changing\nscalar currents and their phenomenological consequences are analysed. In\nparticular, scenarios with natural flavour conservation are investigated,\nincluding the so-called type I and type II models as well as lepton-specific\nand inert models. Type III models are then discussed, where scalar flavour\nchanging neutral currents are present at tree level, but are suppressed by\neither specific ansatze for the Yukawa couplings or by the introduction of\nfamily symmetries. We also consider the phenomenology of charged scalars in\nthese models. Next we turn to the role of symmetries in the scalar sector. We\ndiscuss the six symmetry-constrained scalar potentials and their extension into\nthe fermion sector. The vacuum structure of the scalar potential is analysed,\nincluding a study of the vacuum stability conditions on the potential and its\nrenormalization-group improvement.

The results are obtained using fully reconstructed jets using the\nanti-kt algorithm with a per-event background subtraction procedure.

In\nthis paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of new\nphysics in these results. We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may\nbe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the\nfinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0\nK*+ likewise appear interesting. We discuss how isospin symmetry yields\nobservables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in the\nStandard Model. Some modes considered in this context are D-> pi pi, rho pi,\nrho rho as well as Ds-> K* pi.

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys.

None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like\nrelativistic particles.

While the scattering process is governed by the S-matrix the\ninteraction evolves the produced state rho_f(S) to observed state rho_f(O). To\nbe consistent with the Standard Model this new interaction must be a pure\ndephasing interaction governed by a non-unitary evolution law modifying the\nphases of the amplitudes. We present the first test of the unitary evolution\nlaw in particle scattering. The unitary evolution law evolves pure initial\nstates into pure final states in exclusive processes.

This study is based on ILC beam\nparameters according to the Technical Design Report for a center of mass energy\nof $500\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. A full detector simulation of the International Large\nDetector (ILD) was performed for all Standard Model backgrounds and for\n$\\widetilde{\\chi}_1^0$-pair production within a simplified model. The bRPV\nparameters are fixed according to current neutrino data. In this scenario, the\n$\\widetilde{\\chi}_1^0$ mass can be reconstructed with an uncertainty of $\\delta\nm = (40(\\text{stat.}) + 50(\\text{syst.}))\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ for an integrated\nluminosity of $500\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ from direct $\\widetilde{\\chi}_1^0$-pair\nproduction, thus, to a large extent independently of the rest of the SUSY\nspectrum. The achievable precision on the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle\n$\\sin^2 \\theta_{23}$ from measuring the neutralino branching fractions\n$\\mathrm{BR}(\\widetilde{\\chi}_1^0 \\rightarrow W \\mu)$ and\n$\\mathrm{BR}(\\widetilde{\\chi}_1^0 \\rightarrow W \\tau)$ at the ILC is better\nthan current uncertainties from neutrino experiments.

Three of the ubiquitous jet-based observables---jet\nmultiplicity, summed scalar transverse momentum, and missing transverse\nmomentum---have event shape counterparts that are closely correlated with their\njet-based cousins. Due to their \"local\" computational structure, these jet-like\nevent shapes could potentially be used for trigger-level event selection at the\nLHC.

Traditionally, broadening has been measured with respect to\nthe thrust axis, which is aligned along the (hemisphere) jet momentum to\nminimize the vector sum of transverse momentum within a jet. In this paper, we\nadvocate measuring broadening with respect to the \"broadening axis\", which is\nthe direction that minimizes the scalar sum of transverse momentum within a\njet. This approach eliminates many of the calculational complexities arising\nfrom recoil of the leading parton, and observables like the jet angularities\nbecome recoil-free when measured using the broadening axis. We derive a simple\nfactorization theorem for broadening-axis observables which smoothly\ninterpolates between the thrust-like and broadening-like regimes. We argue that\nthe same factorization theorem holds for two-point energy correlation functions\nas well as for jet shapes based on a \"winner-take-all axis\". Using kinked\nbroadening axes, we calculate event-wide angularities in e+e- collisions with\nnext-to-leading logarithmic resummation. Defining jet regions using the\nbroadening axis, we also calculate the global logarithms for angularities\nwithin a single jet. We find good agreement comparing our calculations both to\nshowering Monte Carlo programs and to automated resummation tools.

Firstly, this allows us to\nderive robust model-independent phenomenological features and, conversely, to\nidentify the peculiarities of different explicit realizations. Secondly, limits\non cross-section times BR can be converted into bounds on a few relevant\nparameters in a fully analytic way, allowing for an interpretation in any given\nexplicit model.

For this purpose we extract the charm\nvacuum polarisation via a standard dispersion relation from BESII-data on\n$e^+e^-\\to hadrons$. In the factorisation approximation (FA) the vacuum\npolarisation describes the interference fully non-perturbatively. The observed\ninterference pattern by the LHCb collaboration is opposite in sign and and\nsignificantly enhanced as compared to the FA. A change of the FA-result by a\nfactor of -2.5, which correspond to a 350%-corrections, results in a reasonable\nagreement with the data. This raises the question on the size of\nnon-factorisable corrections which are colour enhanced but loop-suppressed. In\nthe parton picture it is found that the corrections are of relative size ~-0.5\nwhen averaged over the open charm-region which is far below -3.5 needed to\nexplain the observed effect. We present combined fits to the BESII- and the\nLHCb-data, testing for effects beyond the Standard Model (SM)-FA.

Mutual information can be used to diagnose such situations,\nand thus determine which discriminant variables are redundant and which can be\ncombined to improve performance. Using both parton showers and analytic\nresummation, we study a two-parameter family of generalized angularities, which\nincludes familiar infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables like thrust and\nbroadening, as well as IRC unsafe variants like $p_T^D$ and hadron\nmultiplicity.

Unfortunately, explicit calculations\nare often not feasible due to the complexity of the observables used for\ndiscrimination, and so many validation studies rely heavily, and solely, on\nMonte Carlo. In this paper we show how methods based on the parametric power\ncounting of the dynamics of QCD, familiar from effective theory analyses, can\nbe used to design, understand, and make robust predictions for the behavior of\njet substructure variables.

A central part of the Higgs programme at an e+e- collider\nis the model-independent determination of the absolute Higgs couplings to\nfermions and to gauge bosons. Here the measurement of the e+e-->HZ\nHiggsstrahlung cross section, using the recoil mass technique, sets the\nabsolute scale for all Higgs coupling measurements. Previous studies have\nconsidered e+e- ->ZH with Z->l+l-, where l = electron or muon. In this paper it\nis shown for the first time that a near model-independent recoil mass technique\ncan be extended to the hadronic decays of the Z boson. Because the branching\nratio for Z->qq is approximately ten times greater than for Z->l+l-, this\nmethod is statistically more powerful than using the leptonic decays. For an\nintegrated luminosity of 500 fb-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 350 GeV at\nCLIC, the e+e-->HZ cross section can be measured to 1.8 % using the hadronic\nrecoil mass technique.

In this paper, we demonstrate that one particular\ngroomer called soft drop actually makes precision jet substructure easier. In\nparticular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop\njet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation\nthat allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle\nradiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The\nsimplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show\nthat to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no\ncontributions from non-global logarithms.

Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass\nto next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.

No significant excesses are observed over the\nbackground prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields\nexclusion limits in the signal cross section in the m[Z']-m[A] phase space. For\nexample, the observed data exclude the Z' mass range from 600 to 1860 GeV, for\nZ' coupling strength g[Z'] = 0.8, the coupling of A with dark matter particles\ng[chi] = 1, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan[beta] = 1, and m[A]\n= 300 GeV.

A vertically misplaced quadrupole introduces electric\nfield proportional to its misplacement, changing periodically in the particle's\nrest frame during the storage. This leads to accumulation of vertical spin\ncomponent at every revolution. We investigated this effect by simulating a\nproton in an all-electric ring with several quadrupole scenarios.

We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

Abstract: A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle.\nIntroduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally\nhigh-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities.\nArgon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the\npurge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses\nthrough materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact\nwith the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$.

When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings.

As a consequence, the theoretical error is now starting to\nlag behind the experimental one, and a ceaseless effort is required to reduce\nthe theory uncertainty to match the precision of the data. At hadron colliders,\nQCD predictions are obtained by convoluting perturbative parton-level results\nwith non-perturbative PDFs, whose precise determination is crucial to reach\npercent-accurate theoretical predictions. At the parton level, cross sections\nare obtained through a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling. In some\ncases, large terms appear at all orders and spoil the convergence of the\nseries. The perturbative description is rescued by resumming the series to all\norders, thereby making theory calculations accurate in regions where a\nfixed-order treatment is not sufficient. In this thesis I first present two\nglobal PDF sets where fixed-order calculations are supplemented by threshold\nand high-energy resummation, respectively. In the first case, it is found that\nincluding resummation into PDFs can compensate for the enhancement in the\npartonic cross sections, with implications for high-mass resonance searches. In\nthe second case, resummation quantitatively improves the description of the\nHERA structure functions, thus providing evidence of the onset of a new\ndynamical regime of QCD in the HERA data.

The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton\ninteraction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias\nevents. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged\ntrack momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at\n$\\sqrt{s}=1800$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV and comparing this ambient momentum\nwith that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two\nMonte Carlo models.

In particular, the ``golden'' $ZZ$ decay mode offers a\ndistinctive 4-lepton signal that could lead to the observation at the LHC with\n300 fb$^{-1}$ (SLHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$) of a KK graviton with a mass up to $\\sim\n2$ ($\\sim 3$) TeV for the ratio of the AdS$_5$ curvature to the Planck scale\nmodestly above unity.
