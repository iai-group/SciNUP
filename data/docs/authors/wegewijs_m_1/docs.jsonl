We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level.

This property gives rise to\nnumerous applications, both in applied sciences and in theoretical physics.\nElectronic circuits made out of graphene could take advantage of its high\nelectron mobility that is witnessed even at room temperature.

Away from linear response, however, this symmetry is not\nfulfilled and the conductance phase of the interferometer when a quantum dot is\ninserted in one of its arms can be a continuous function of the bias voltage.\nSuch magnetoasymmetries have been investigated in related mesoscopic systems\nand arise as a consequence of the asymetric response of the internal potential\nof the conductor out of equilibrium.

We find\nthat at very low temperatures the asymmetric element of the differential\nconductance shows an abrupt change for voltages around the Fermi level.

Apart from the off-diagonal correlations which depends on the\nso-called Jordan-Wigner string, real-space observables are similar for\nfree-fermions and hard-core bosons on a chain. Interestingly, by coupling only\ntwo chains, thus forming a two-leg ladder, particle exchange becomes allowed,\nand leads to a totally different physics between free-fermions and hard-core\nbosons. Using a combination of analytical (strong coupling, field theory,\nrenormalization group) and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, density-matrix\nrenormalization group) approaches, we study the apparently simple but\nnon-trivial model of hard-core bosons hopping in a two-leg ladder geometry. At\nhalf-filling, while a band insulator appears for fermions at large interchain\nhopping tperp >2t only, a Mott gap opens up for bosons as soon as tperp\\neq0\nthrough a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

The purpose of this paper is to\ngeneralize the pseudopotential construction to situations where interactions\nare N-body and where the particles may have internal degrees of freedom such as\nspin or valley index. Assuming a rotationally invariant Hamiltonian, the\nessence of the problem is to obtain a full basis of wavefunctions for N\nparticles with fixed relative angular momentum L. This basis decomposes into\nrepresentations of SU(n) with n the number of internal degrees of freedom. We\ngive special attention to the case where the internal degree of freedom has n=2\nstates, which encompasses the important cases of spin-1/2 particles and quantum\nHall bilayers.

We focus on the temperature dependence of the DNP for zero\nenergy-detuning (i.e. equal electrostatic energy of one electron in each dot\nand a singlet in the right dot). Our main result is the existence of a\ntransition temperature, below which the DNP is bistable, so a hysteretic\nleakage current versus external magnetic field B appears. This is studied in\ntwo cases: (i) Close to the crossing of the three triplet energy levels near\nB=0, where spin-blockade is lifted due to the inhomogeneity of the effective\nmagnetic field from the nuclei.

In this sense, the Andreev energy levels play a role of\neffective impurity levels. When the normal lead is coupled to the QD-S system,\non the one hand, the Andreev energy levels broaden to form the so-called\nAndreev bound states (ABSs), on the other hand, it can screen the magnetic\nmoment of the ABSs. By tuning the couplings between the QD and the normal\n(superconducting) leads, the ABSs can simulate the Kondo, mixed-valence, and\neven empty orbit regimes of the usual single-impurity Anderson model. The above\npicture is confirmed by the Green's function calculation of the hybrid N-QD-S\nAnderson model and is also able to explain qualitatively experimental phenomena\nobserved by Deacon \\textit{et al.}.

From this theoretical study a\npicture emerges in which impurity dynamics is universal on essentially all time\nscales, and where the high-frequency few-body response is related to the\nlong-time dynamics of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe by Tan relations.\nOur theoretical description relies on different and complementary approaches:\nfunctional determinants give an exact numerical solution for time- and\nfrequency-resolved responses, bosonization provides analytical expressions at\nlow temperatures, and the theory of Toeplitz determinants allows one to\nanalytically predict response up to high temperatures. Using these approaches\nwe predict the thermal decoherence rate and prove that within the considered\nmodel the fastest rate of long-time decoherence is given by $\\gamma=\\pi\nk_BT/4$. We show that Feshbach resonances in cold atomic systems give access to\nnew interaction regimes where quantum effects prevail even in the thermal\nregime of many-body dynamics.

By contrast, weak\ninterorbital disorder can cause a 3D QAHI-WSM transition for a 3D QAHI in\nproximity to the WSM phase in the clean limit, and it can annihilate a WSM near\nthe NI phase, bringing about a WSM-NI transition.

Our intriguing observation is that averaging the individual PFTs does not\nlead to a structureless curve, but rather yields a series of distinct transform\npeaks. This suggests universality, namely that the underlying random resonators\nthat are responsible for the laser emission from the pi-conjugated polymer film\nare almost identical. We argue that the reason for such an universality is the\nlarge size of a typical resonator, which we determined from the PFT, as\ncompared to the emission wavelength, lambda. This fact is, in turn, a\nconsequence of the large light mean free path, l* approximately 10 lambda in\nthe polymer film. This contrasts previous observations of random lasing in\npowders, where l* approx. lambda. We develop a simple theory that explains the\npresence of peaks in the average PFT and predicts their shape. The results of\nthe theory agree quantitatively with the data. \n\n"}

We\nstart by proving that the dephasing rate must vanish at the $T\\to 0$ limit,\nunless a large ground state degeneracy exists. This thermodynamic proof\nincludes most systems of relevance and it is valid for any determination of\n$\\tau_{\\phi}$ from {\\em linear} transport measurements. In fact, our\nexperiments demonstrate unequivocally that indeed when strictly linear\ntransport is used, the apparent low-temperature saturation of $\\tau_{\\phi}$ is\neliminated. However, the conditions to be in the linear transport regime are\nmore strict than hitherto expected. Another novel result of the experiments is\nthat introducing heavy nonmagnetic impurities (gold) in our samples produces,\neven in linear transport, a shoulder in the dephasing rate at very low\ntemperatures. We then show theoretically that low-lying local defects may\nproduce a relatively large dephasing rate at low temperatures. However, as\nexpected, this rate in fact vanishes when $T \\to 0$, in agreement with our\nexperimental observations. \n\n"}

When the\ncritical temperature of the Mott transition is much higher than the quantum\ndegeneracy temperature, the transition is essentially described by the Ising\nuniversality class. Below the critical temperature, phase separation or\nfirst-order transition occurs. However, if the critical point is involved in\nthe Fermi degeneracy region, a marginal quantum critical point appears at zero\ntemperature. The originally single Mott critical point generates subsequent\nmany unstable fixed points through various Fermi surface instabilities induced\nby the Mott criticality characterized by the diverging charge susceptibility or\ndoublon susceptibility. This occurs in marginal quantum-critical region.\nCharge, magnetic and superconducting instabilitites compete severely under\nthese critical charge fluctuations. The quantum Mott transition triggers\nmulti-furcating criticality, which goes beyond the conventional concept of\nmulticriticality in quantum phase transitions. Near the quantum Mott\ntransition, the criticality generically drives growth of inhomogeneous\nstructure in the momentum space with singular points of flat dispersion on the\nFermi surface. The singular points determine the quantum dynamics of the Mott\ntransition by the dynamical exponent $z=4$. We argue that many of\nfilling-control Mott transitions are classified to this category.

Finally, we\nconsider the transport of quantum information via the motion of individual\nelectrons in mesoscopic structures; specific transport and noise measurements\nin coupled quantum dot geometries for detecting and characterizing\nelectron-state entanglement are analyzed. \n\n"}

Due to the interplay between parity effects and pairing correlations,\nthe dependence of chi on temperature T is qualitatively different from the\nstandard BCS result valid in the bulk limit. If the number of electrons on the\ngrain is odd, chi shows a re-entrant behavior as a function of temperature.\nThis behavior persists even in the case of ultrasmall grains where the mean\nlevel spacing is much larger than the BCS gap. If the number of electrons is\neven, chi(T) is exponentially small at low temperatures. \n\n"}

The experiment has been\ncarried out on single crystals of Si doped heavily with P and B beyond the\ncritical composition of insulator to metal transition. The phenomenon is\nidentified as a consequence of electric field induced dephasing of the electron\nwavefunction.

A systematic diagram technique\nis developed for perturbation study of the current in physical systems out of\nequilibrium governed by time - dependent Hamiltonians of the Anderson and the\nKondo models. The ensuing calculations prove to be too complicated for the\nAnderson model, and hence, a mapping on an effective Kondo problem is called\nfor. This is achieved by constructing a time - dependent version of the\nSchrieffer - Wolff transformation. Perturbation expansion of the current is\nthen carried out up to third order in the Kondo coupling J yielding a set of\nremarkably simple analytical expressions for the current. The zero - bias\nanomaly of the direct current differential conductance is shown to be\nsuppressed by the alternating field while side peaks develop at finite source -\ndrain voltage. Both the direct component and the first harmonics of the time -\ndependent response are equally enhanced due to the Kondo effect, while\namplitudes of higher harmonics are shown to be relatively small. A zero\nalternating bias anomaly is found in the alternating current differential\nconductance, that is, it peaks around zero alternating bias. This peak is\nsuppressed by the constant bias. No side peaks show up in the differential\nalternating - conductance but their counterpart is found in the derivative of\nthe alternating current with respect to the direct bias. The results pertaining\nto nonlinear response are shown to be valid also below the Kondo temperature. \n\n"}

One of these is that the leading term in the energy/particle is $4\\pi a\n\\rho$ where $a$ is the scattering length of the 2-body potential. Owing to the\ndelicate and peculiar nature of bosonic correlations (such as the strange\n$N^{7/5}$ law for charged bosons), four decades of research failed to establish\nthis plausible formula rigorously. The only previous lower bound for the energy\nwas found by Dyson in 1957, but it was 14 times too small. The correct\nasymptotic formula has recently been obtained jointly with J. Yngvason and this\nwork will be presented. The reason behind the mathematical difficulties will be\nemphasized. A different formula, postulated as late as 1971 by Schick, holds in\ntwo-dimensions and this, too, will be shown to be correct. Another problem of\ngreat interest is the existence of Bose-Einstein condensation, and what little\nis known about this rigorously will also be discussed. With the aid of the\nmethodology developed to prove the lower bound for the homogeneous gas, two\nother problems have been successfully addressed. One is the proof (with\nYngvason and Seiringer) that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation correctly describes\nthe ground state in the `traps' actually used in the experiments. The other is\na very recent proof (with Solovej) that Foldy's 1961 theory of a high density\ngas of charged particles correctly describes its ground state energy. \n\n"}

More precisely, we study\nthe correlator omega_U(s)=<|Z(st)|^2> (averaging t over the unit circle).\nIdentifying the group U(N) as one member of a dual pair acting in the spinor\nrepresentation of Spin(4N), omega_U(s) is expanded in terms of irreducible\ncharacters of U(N). In close analogy with the ballistic non-linear sigma model,\na coherent-state integral representation of omega_U(s) is developed. We show\nthat the leading-order saddle-point approximation reproduces omega_U(s)\nexactly, up to a constant factor; this miracle can be explained by interpreting\nomega_U(s) as a character of U(2N), for which the saddle-point expansion yields\nthe Weyl character formula. Unfortunately, this decomposition behaves\nnon-smoothly in the semiclassical limit, and to make further progress some\naveraging over U needs to be introduced. Several averaging schemes are\ninvestigated. In general, a direct application of the saddle-point\napproximation to these schemes is demonstrated to give incorrect results; this\nis not the case for a `semiclassical averaging scheme', for which all loop\ncorrections vanish identically. As a side product of the dual pair\ndecomposition, we compute a crossover between the Poisson and CUE ensembles for\nomega_U(s). \n\n"}
