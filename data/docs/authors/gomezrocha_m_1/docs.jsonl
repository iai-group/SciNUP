In this article the measurement of the mass of the\nscalar partner of the top quark (stop) at an e+e- collider is studied. A\nrelatively light stop is motivated by attempts to explain electroweak\nbaryogenesis and can play an important role in dark matter relic density.

These new\nstates will form a resonance decaying into difermions, as occurs in many\nextensions of the Standard Model, such as models predicting the existence of\nadditional neutral gauge bosons, usually named $Z^\\prime$. Using the dielectron\nchannel we evaluate the integrated luminosity needed for a $5\\sigma$ discovery\nas a function of the torsion mass, for different coupling values. We also\ncalculate the luminosity needed for discriminate, with 95% C.L., the two\npossible different torsion natures. Finally, we show that the observed signal\ncoming from the torsion field could be distinguished from a signal coming from\na new neutral gauge boson, provided there is enough luminosity. \n\n"}

Assuming the two lighter heavy Majorana neutrinos are degenerate\nat the GUT scale, it is shown that the renormalization group (RG) evolution\nfrom the GUT scale to the seesaw scale gives rise to breaking of the mu-tau\nsymmetry and a tiny splitting between two degenerate heavy Majorana neutrino\nmasses as well as small variations of the CP phases in Y_nu, which are\nessential to achieve a successful leptogenesis. Such small RG effects lead to\ntiny deviations of theta_{23} from the maximal value and the CP phase\ndelta_{CP} from pi/2 imposed at the GUT scale due to mu-tau reflection\nsymmetry. In our scenario, the required amount of the baryon asymmetry eta_B\ncan be generated via so-called resonant e-leptogenesis, in which the wash-out\nfactor concerned with electron flavor plays a crucial role in reproducing a\nsuccessful leptogenesis. We show that CP violation responsible for the\ngeneration of baryon asymmetry of our universe can be directly linked with CP\nviolation measurable through neutrino oscillation as well as neutrino mixing\nangles theta_{12} and theta_{13}.

In the gravity approximation, weak and strong shocks should be\ndescribed by smooth metrics with no discontinuities. For weak shocks we find\nthe dual metric in a derivative expansion and for strong shocks we use\nlinearized gravity to find the exponential tail that determines the width of\nthe shock.

The subsequent evolution of systems\nmay, or may not, lead to the formation of a (transient) Bose condensate,\ndepending on the value of f_0.

We provide a possible explanation of the excess as the isospin-triplet\ntechnivector mesons (technirhos, denoted as $\\rho_\\Pi^{\\pm,3}$) of the walking\ntechnicolor in the case of the one-family model as a benchmark. As the\neffective theory for the walking technicolor at the scales relevant to the LHC\nexperiment, we take a scale-invariant version of the hidden local symmetry\nmodel so constructed as to accommodate technipions, technivector mesons, and\nthe technidilaton in such a way that the model respects spontaneously broken\nchiral and scale symmetries of the underlying walking technicolor. In\nparticular, the technidilaton, a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson of the\n(approximate) scale symmetry predicted in the walking technicolor, has been\nshown to be successfully identified with the 125 GeV Higgs. Currently available\nLHC limits on those technihadrons are used to fix the couplings of technivector\nmesons to the standard-model fermions and weak gauge bosons. We find that the\ntechnirho's are mainly produced through the Drell-Yan process and predominantly\ndecay to the dibosons, which accounts for the currently reported excess at\naround 2 TeV. The consistency with the electroweak precision test and other\npossible discovery channels of the 2 TeV technirhos are also addressed. \n\n"}

We take the above as indications that at some level the small\nquantities are well-approximated by zero. In particular the mixing angles, to a\nzero order, should be either 0 or $\\pi/4$. Accordingly, in this model the\nType-II see-saw dominates and generates the larger atmospheric mass splitting\nand sets $\\theta_{23} = \\pi/4$.

This is not a newly discovered relation. Rather,\nit improves on the many previous studies of it, with more and better data. Like\nits precedents, it bears crucial ramifications for the observed dynamical\nanomalies in disc galaxies, and, in particular, on their resolution by the MOND\nparadigm. Their result, indeed, constitute a triumph for MOND. However, unlike\nprevious analyses of the MDAR, McGaugh et al. have chosen to obfuscate the MOND\nroots of their analysis, and its connection with, and implications for, this\nparadigm. For example, the fitting formula they use, seemingly as a result of\nsome unexplained inspiration, follows in its salient properties from the basic\ntenets of MOND, and has already been used in the past in several MOND analyses.\nNo other possible origin for such a function is known. Given that this formula\nhad already been shown to reproduce correctly the observed rotation curves from\nthe baryon distribution (as a MOND effect), it must have been clear, a priory,\nthat it should describe correctly the MDAR, which is but a summary of rotation\ncurves.

For\ncapturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e.g., in terms\nof a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple\nscalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time.\nNext, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a\nspin-2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and\nsimultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent\nstate of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons\nturns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while\ntheir frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the\nsemi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known\nproperties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal\nGibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix\nscatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this\nframework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical\ntreatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite\nquantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times\n$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to\nthe number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time\nimposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes\nmust have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically\nacceptable number of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate\nthis bound if our Universe were $10^{100}$ years old in its entire classical\nhistory. \n\n"}

This is puzzling, because (i) no\nStandard Model (SM) particle is expected to survive passage through Earth at\nsuch energies and incident angles, and (ii) no such events were reported by\nIceCube. In this paper, we address both these issues by invoking a beyond SM\ninterpretation of the EeV events as due to the decay of a long-lived bino in\nthe R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry. In particular, a TeV-scale\nslepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV\nneutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,\nlong-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before\ndecaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air\nshowers in the atmosphere near ANITA.

Assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium also for spin degrees of\nfreedom, baryons get a net polarization at their formation (freeze-out). This\npolarization depends on the time evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP),\nwhich can be described as an almost perfect fluid. By using exact analytic\nsolutions, we thus can analyze the necessity of rotation (and vorticity) for\nnon-zero net polarization.

Although the two\nmethods should give the same results theoretically, qualitatively different\nresults have been reported. Recently, we pointed out that the separation of the\nground state from the excited states is crucial to obtain sensible results in\nthe former, while both states provide useful signals in the latter. In this\npaper, we identify the contribution of each state in the direct method by\ndecomposing the two-baryon correlators into the finite-volume eigenmodes\nobtained from the HAL QCD method. We consider the $\\Xi\\Xi$ system in the\n$^1$S$_0$ channel at $m_\\pi = 0.51$ GeV in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD using the\nwall and smeared quark sources. We demonstrate that the \"pseudo-plateau\" at\nearly time slices (t = 1~2 fm) from the smeared source in the direct method\nindeed originates from the contamination of the excited states, and the true\nplateau with the ground state saturation is realized only at t > 5~15 fm\ncorresponding to the inverse of the lowest excitation energy.

This was the driving motivation to propose\nmeasurements at HERMES using nuclear targets, and to provide predictions based\non a pQCD model of hadronization [1]. Now when the first results of the\nexperiment are released [2,3], one can compare the predictions with the data.\nThe model successfully describes with no adjustment the nuclear effects for\nvarious energies, zh, pT, and Q2, for different flavors and different nuclei.\nIt turns out that the main source of nuclear suppression of the hadron\nproduction rate is attenuation of colorless pre-hadrons in the medium. An\nalternative model [4] is based upon an ad hoc assumption that the colorless\npre-hadron is produced outside the nucleus. This model has apparent problems\nattempting to explain certain features of the results from HERMES. A good\nunderstanding of the hadronization dynamics is important for proper\ninterpretation of the strong suppression of high-pT hadrons observed in heavy\nion collisions at RHIC.

With the\nassumption of the anti-grand unified group SMG x SMG x SMG (three copies of the\nStandard Model gauge group, one for each generation), it is also possible to\nsuccessfully predict the three fine structure constants in the Standard Model.\nWe also discuss the extension of the SMG x SMG x SMG group by an extra abelian\nfactor U(1)_f and the fermion mass matrices in this model. Other vacua than the\npresent one might appear in the future due to human activity. The breaking of\nlocality is really of the same mild character as suggested by baby universe\ntheory, so the present work may be considered as a development of baby universe\ntheory. \n\n"}

The simplified equation is used to evaluate a new Hamiltonian of order\nalpha_lambda that acts only in the effective quark-anti-quark sector and in the\nnon-relativistic limit turns out to contain the Coulomb term with Breit-Fermi\norrections and spin-independent harmonic oscillator term with frequency omega =\n[(4/3)(alpha_lambda/pi)]^1/2 lambda (lambda/m)^2 (pi/1152)^1/4. The latter\noriginates from the hole excavated in the overlapping quark self-interaction\ngluon clouds by the exchange of effective gluons between the quarks. The new\nterm is largely independent of the details of mu^2 and in principle can fit\ninto the ball park of phenomenology. The first approximation can be improved by\nincluding more terms in H_lambda and solving the eigenvalue equations\nnumerically. \n\n"}

In particular,\nit is shown that in theories with the amplitudes which asymptotic behavior is\ngoverned by known Regge intercepts, the system of independent renormalization\nconditions only contains those fixing the counterterm vertices with $n \\leq 3$\nlines, while other prescriptions are determined by self-consistency\nrequirements.

The expression is based on consistency of\nunitarity cuts and infrared divergences. We expand the integrals around e=0,\nand obtain analytic expressions for the poles from 1/e^8 through 1/e^4.
