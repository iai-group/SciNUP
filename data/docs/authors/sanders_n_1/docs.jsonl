To explain observations of\nSN 1998bw associated with Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 980425, the following\nconditions are required: Edot_iso Mdot_iso > ~ 10^{51} erg M_sun s^{-2} and\nEdot_iso > ~ 2 x 10^{52} erg s^{-1} (if the wind Lorentz factor Gamma_w ~ 1) or\nEdot_iso > ~ 7 x 10^{52} erg s^{-1} (if Gamma_w >> 1). In SN 1998bw, 56Ni (~\n0.4M_sun) is probably produced in the shocked stellar mantle, not in the wind.\nThe expected natures of SNe, e.g., ejected 56Ni masses and ejecta masses, vary\ndepending on Edot_iso and Mdot_iso. The sequence of the SN properties from high\nEdot_iso and Mdot_iso to low Edot_iso and Mdot_iso is the following: SN\n1998bw-like -- intermediate case -- low mass ejecta (< ~ 1M_sun$) where 56Ni is\nfrom the wind -- whole collapse. This diversity may explain the diversity of\nsupernovae associated with GRBs.

But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure.

The data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), covering 2008 July 7\n- October 6, indicate strong, highly variable gamma-ray emission with an\naverage flux of ~3 x 10^{-6} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, for energies above 100\nMeV. The gamma-ray flux is variable, with strong, distinct,\nsymmetrically-shaped flares for which the flux increases by a factor of several\non a time scale of about three days. This variability indicates a compact\nemission region, and the requirement that the source is optically thin to\npair-production implies relativistic beaming with Doppler factor delta > 8,\nconsistent with the values inferred from VLBI observations of superluminal\nexpansion (delta ~ 25). The observed gamma-ray spectrum is not consistent with\na simple power-law, but instead steepens strongly above ~2 GeV, and is well\ndescribed by a broken power-law with photon indices of ~2.3 and ~3.5 below and\nabove the break, respectively.

As compared to the initial, not\nself-consistent solution, the final solution has both the cooling rate and the\nelectron temperature significantly reduced at radii >=10 gravitational radii.\nOn the other hand, the radiation spectrum of the self-consistent solution has\nthe shape similar to that of the initial iteration, except for the high-energy\ncut-off being at an energy lower by a factor of ~2 and the bolometric\nluminosity decreased by a factor of ~2.

We find that\nthe slab model approximates the global model significantly better than the\nspherical one. Still, neither local model gives a good approximation to the\nradial profile of the cooling rate, and the differences can be up to two orders\nof magnitude.

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that\nis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest\nhalo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter\npotential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy.

Wald on geodesic motion in general relativity\ncan be generalized to classical field theories of a metric and other tensor\nfields on four-dimensional spacetime that 1) are second-order and 2) follow\nfrom a diffeomorphism-covariant Lagrangian. The approach is to consider a\none-parameter-family of solutions to the field equations satisfying certain\nassumptions designed to reflect the existence of a body whose size, mass, and\nvarious charges are simultaneously scaled to zero. (That such solutions exist\nplaces a further restriction on the class of theories to which our results\napply.) Assumptions are made only on the spacetime region outside of the body,\nso that the results apply to ordinary bodies as well as black holes. The\nworldline \"left behind\" by the shrinking, disappearing body is interpreted as\nits lowest-order motion. An equation for this worldline follows from the\n\"Bianchi identity\" for the theory, without use of any properties of the field\nequations beyond their being second-order.

{"id": "1004.0959", "contents": "Title: Impulsive Acceleration of Strongly Magnetized Relativistic Flows Abstract: The strong variability of magnetic central engines of AGN and GRBs may result\nin highly intermittent strongly magnetized relativistic outflows. We find a new\nmagnetic acceleration mechanism for such impulsive flows that can be much more\neffective than the acceleration of steady-state flows. This impulsive\nacceleration results in kinetic-energy-dominated flows at astrophysically\nrelevant distances from the central source. For a spherical flow, a discrete\nshell ejected from the source over a time t_0 with Lorentz factor Gamma~1 and\ninitial magnetization sigma_0 = B_0^2/(4 pi rho_0 c^2) >> 1 quickly reaches a\ntypical Lorentz factor Gamma ~ sigma_0^{1/3} and magnetization sigma ~\nsigma_0^{2/3} at the distance R_0 ~ ct_0. At this point the magnetized shell of\nwidth Delta ~ R_0 in the lab frame loses causal contact with the source and\ncontinues to accelerate by spreading significantly in its own rest frame. The\nexpansion is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient and leads to relativistic\nrelative velocities between the front and back of the shell. While the\nexpansion is roughly symmetric in the center of momentum frame, in the lab\nframe most of the energy and momentum remain in a region (or shell) of width\nDelta ~ R_0 at the head of the flow. This acceleration proceeds as Gamma ~\n(sigma_0 R/R_0)^{1/3} and sigma ~ sigma_0^{2/3} (R/R_0)^{-1/3} until reaching a\ncoasting radius R_c ~ R_0 sigma_0^2 where the kinetic energy becomes dominant:\nGamma ~ sigma_0 and sigma ~ 1 at R_c. Then the shell starts coasting and\nspreading (radially) causing its magnetization to drop as sigma ~ R_c/R at\nR>R_c. Given the typical variability time-scales of AGN and GRBs, the magnetic\nacceleration in these sources is a combination of the quasi-steady-state\ncollimation acceleration close to the source and the impulsive acceleration\nfurther out. The interaction with the external medium is briefly discussed. \n\n"}

Whereas\nthe average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before\nleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low\nHI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\nwhich is not the case within r25.

Secondly, the onset of a secular bar-mode instability, associated\nwith the long lived plateau observed in the X-ray afterglows of many gamma-ray\nbursts (Corsi & Meszaros 2009a). With regards to detectability, we find that\nthe onset of a secular instability is the most optimistic scenario: under the\nhypothesis that SL-GRBs associated with secularly unstable magnetars occur at a\nrate of (48; 80)Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} or greater, cross-correlation of data from two\nEinstein Telescopes (ETs) could detect the GW background associated to this\nsignal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 or greater after 1 year of\nobservation.

If interpreted as\nthe products of annihilating dark matter, this signal implies that the dark\nmatter consists of particles with a mass between 7.3 and 9.2 GeV annihilating\nprimarily to charged leptons. This mass range is very similar to that required\nto accommodate the signals reported by CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA. In addition to\ngamma rays, the dark matter is predicted to produce energetic electrons and\npositrons in the Inner Galaxy, which emit synchrotron photons as a result of\ntheir interaction with the galactic magnetic field. In this letter, we\ncalculate the flux and spectrum of this synchrotron emission assuming that the\ngamma rays from the Galactic Center originate from dark matter, and compare the\nresults to measurements from the WMAP satellite.

However, several issues are yet to be clarified: SNe~Ia show\ncolor variations after the standardization. Also, individual SNe~Ia can show\nresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\\sim\n0.15$ mag.

A sample of 11 SNe Ia which likely suffer from\nlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\\sigma$) between the peak\n$B-V$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. Furthermore, a nearly\nidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three SNe with\n$B-V \\gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. Following the interpretation that the\nlate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from which\nan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is a\ndominant factor controlling the SN color and that a large part of the color\nvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction.

It is aimed at estimating bulk flows of cosmological\nvolumes containing large numbers of galaxies. Constraints on the bulk flow are\nobtained by minimizing systematic variations in galaxy luminosities with\nrespect to a reference luminosity function measured from the whole survey. This\nmethod offers two advantages over more popular bulk flow estimators: it is\nindependent of error-prone distance indicators and of the poorly-known galaxy\nbias. We apply the method to the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) to measure the\nlocal bulk flows of spherical shells centered on the Milky Way (MW).

Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still\nlargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object.

Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidal\nmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of\nrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and\nrigidly rotating models.

For both\nnon-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary\ninstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The\ninterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis.

Here we demonstrate that the OIR colour-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) of the evolution of the X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 in\noutburst can be used to separate the disc from the jet. Monitoring in two\nwavebands is all that is required. This outburst in 2000 was well studied, and\nboth disc and jet were known to contribute. During the outburst the data follow\na well defined path in the CMD, describing what would be expected from a heated\nsingle-temperature blackbody of approximately constant area, except when the\ndata appear redder than this track. This is due to the non-thermal jet\ncomponent which dominates the OIR moreso during hard X-ray states at high\nluminosities, and which is quenched in the soft state. The CMD therefore shows\nstate-dependent hysteresis, in analogy with (but not identical to) the well\nestablished X-ray hardness-intensity diagram of black hole transients. The\nblackbody originates in the X-ray illuminated, likely unwarped, outer accretion\ndisc.

Our sample comprises roughly 640000\ngalaxies at z~0.1, 130000 galaxies at z~1, and 36000 galaxies at z~2.\nStructural measurements for all but the z~0.1 galaxies were based on HST\nimaging, and SFRs are derived using a Herschel-calibrated ladder of SFR\nindicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar\npopulation of galaxies (i.e., a 'Hubble sequence') is already in place since at\nleast z~2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence\nare well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent\ngalaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles.

The radio to optical data are mostly from the GASP-WEBT, UV and X-ray\ndata from Swift, and gamma-ray data from the AGILE and Fermi satellites. We\nimproved the calibration of optical-UV data from the UVOT and OM instruments\nand estimated the Lyalpha flux to disentangle the contributions from different\ncomponents in this spectral region. The observations reveal prominent\nvariability above 8 GHz. In the optical-UV band, the variability amplitude\ndecreases with increasing frequency due to a steadier radiation from both a\nbroad line region and an accretion disc. The optical flux reaches nearly the\nsame levels in the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 observing seasons; the mm one shows\nsimilar behaviour, whereas the gamma and X-ray flux levels rise in the second\nperiod. Two prominent gamma-ray flares in mid 2008 and late 2009 show a\ndouble-peaked structure, with a variable gamma/optical flux ratio. The X-ray\nflux variations seem to follow the gamma-ray and optical ones by about 0.5 and\n1 d, respectively. We interpret the multifrequency behaviour in terms of an\ninhomogeneous curved jet, where synchrotron radiation of increasing wavelength\nis produced in progressively outer and wider jet regions, which can change\ntheir orientation in time. In particular, we assume that the long-term\nvariability is due to this geometrical effect.

A slight,\nvariable misalignment between the synchrotron and Comptonisation zones would\nexplain the increased gamma and X-ray flux levels in 2009-2010, as well as the\nchange in the gamma/optical flux ratio during the outbursts peaks. \n\n"}

At the highest energies, they\nare supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the\nobservations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of\ndirectional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a\nnonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative\ndistributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected\nforms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived\nfrom fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.\nWe use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594\n(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale\nindices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between\nthose estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called\nMultiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each\nchoice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is\nbased on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet\ncoefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures\nand compare them to other methods in the literature.

We here suggest that many of the low\nluminosity GRBs, due to their low luminosity, can not trigger the current GRB\ndetectors and hence their contribution to the local gamma-ray energy production\nrate is missing. We find that the real local energy production rate by\nlow-luminosity GRBs, taking into account the missing part, which constitutes a\ndominant fraction of the total amount, could be sufficient to account for the\nflux of UHECRs. Due to the low-luminosity, only intermediate-mass or heavy\nnuclei can be accelerated to ~ 10^20 eV. We discuss the acceleration and\nsurvival of these UHE nuclei in low-luminosity GRBs, especially in those\nmissing low-luminosity GRBs.

This effect is present even when the\nquintessence parameters are chosen to reproduce an expansion history consistent\nwith observations.

When\nsufficient gas is driven towards the BH, gravitational instabilities\ngenerically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. The lopsided\nstellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuel\nrapid BH growth. Here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'\ninvoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has\ncharacteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the\ntorus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are\nsubstantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the\nvertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and\nwarps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly\nattributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:\nmisalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and\nturbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN\nluminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations\nof gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities\nin AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent.

The non-thermal emissions come from the interaction\nbetween CR protons and intracluster medium (ICM).

The\nhydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,\nfocusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,\nusing the code \\textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a\nclumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual\nclumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter\ninto the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their\nsize divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump.

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

Based on the well-defined TOUGH sample of 69\nX-ray selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs\nknown from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range 1.8-4.5. We\ndetect Lya emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting\n3sigma line flux being 8E-18 erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a Lya luminosity of\n6E41 erg/s at z=3. The Lya luminosities for the 7 hosts in which we detect Lya\nemission are in the range (0.6-2.3)E42 erg/s corresponding to star-formation\nrates of 0.6-2.1 Msun/yr (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Lya\nequivalent widths (EWs) for the 7 hosts are in the range 9-40A. For 6 of the 13\nhosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits\non the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less\nconstraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Lya EWs is\ninconsistent with being drawn from the Lya EW distribution of bright Lyman\nbreak galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average\nhave larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on\na smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are\nLya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the\npre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92%\nlevel. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly\nindicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies.

We present a radio\ncontinuum survey of all z<1 GRB hosts in The Optically Unbiased GRB Host\n(TOUGH) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-Swift) GRB-SN\nhosts discovered before October 2006.

First, it is pointed out the existence of\nexact asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes when a self\ninteracting, minimally coupled scalar field is the source of the energy\nmomentum of the Einstein equations in four dimensions. The scalar field\npotential is the recently found to be compatible with the hairy generalization\nof the Plebanski-Demianski solution of general relativity. This paper describes\nthe spherically symmetric solutions that smoothly connect the Schwarzschild\nblack hole with its hairy counterpart. The geometry and scalar field are\neverywhere regular except at the usual Schwarzschild like singularity inside\nthe black hole. The scalar field energy momentum tensor satisfies the null\nenergy condition in the static region of the spacetime. The first law holds\nwhen the parameters of the scalar field potential are fixed under\nthermodynamical variation. Secondly, it is shown that an extra, dimensionless\nparameter, present in the hairy solution, allows to modify the gravitational\nfield of a spherically symmetric black hole in a remarkable way. When the\ndimensionless parameter is increased, the scalar field generates a flat\ngravitational potential, that however asymptotically matches the Schwarzschild\ngravitational field.

Hadronic CR interactions can also lead to a high\nluminosity in gamma rays and neutrinos, enhanced by the confinement of CRs from\ncluster accretion/merger shocks and active galactic nuclei.

Neutrino\nobservations are relevant at high energies, especially at >10 TeV. Our results\nshould be useful for improving experimental searches for high-energy neutrino\nemission. Neutrino telescopes are sensitive to extended sources formed by dark\nmatter substructures and CRs distributed over large scales.

The local\nand non-local fluctuations and perturbations with respect to the q-average\nconvey the effects of inhomogeneity through the ratio of curvature and\nkinematic invariants and the magnitude of radial gradients. All curvature and\nkinematic proper tensors that characterize the models are expressible as\nirreducible algebraic expansions on the metric and 4-velocity, whose\ncoefficients are the q-scalars and their linear and quadratic local\nfluctuations.

The\npaper analyses the observational parameters luminosity, effective radius, and\nprojected distance to the host galaxy, of all known ECs and UCDs and the\ndependence of these parameters on the type and the luminosity of their host\ngalaxy.

In\ntotal, we found 813 EOs of which 171 are associated with late-type and 642 with\nearly-type galaxies. EOs cover a luminosity range from about MV = -4 to -14\nmag. However, the vast majority of EOs brighter than -10 mag are associated\nwith elliptical galaxies. At each magnitude EOs are found with effective radii\nbetween 10 pc and an upper size limit, which shows a clear trend: the more\nluminous the object the larger is the upper size limit. For EOs associated with\nearly-and late-type galaxies, the luminosity functions peak at -6.40 and -6.47\nmag, respectively, which is about one magnitude fainter than the peak of the GC\nluminosity function. EOs and GCs form a coherent structure in the reff vs. MV\nparameter space, while there is a clear gap between EOs and early type dwarf\ngalaxies.

If these particles receive a sizeable\nfraction of the explosion energy, the morphological and spectral evolution of\nthe SNR must be modified. To assess this, we run 3D hydrodynamic simulations of\na remnant coupled with a non-linear acceleration model.

The observed higher [Mg/Fe] (> 0.3) at [Fe/H] ~\n-0.6 and higher [Ba/Fe] (>0.5) at [Fe/H] ~ -0.3 can be due to significantly\nenhanced star formation about 2 Gyr ago. The observed overall [Ca/Fe]-[Fe/H]\nrelation and remarkably low [Ca/Fe] (<-0.2) at [Fe/H]>-0.6 are consistent with\nmodels with short-delay supernova Ia and with the more efficient loss of Ca\npossibly caused by an explosion mechanism of type II supernovae. Although the\nmetallicity distribution functions do not show double peaks in the models with\na starburst about 2 Gyr ago, they show characteristic double peaks in the\nmodels with double starbursts at ~200 Myr and ~2 Gyr ago. The observed apparent\ndip of [Fe/H] around ~1.5 Gyr ago in the age--metallicity relation can be\nreproduced by models in which a large amount (~10^9 M_{sun}) of metal-poor\n([Fe/H]<-1) gas can be accreted onto the LMC. \n\n"}

We calculate the typical Jeans mass using\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model\nfor the ISM, which yields a parameterisation of the IMF characteristic mass as\na function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We then calculate the star\nformation histories of galaxies utilising an equilibrium galaxy growth model\ncoupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance\nmatching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust\nand gas drive warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/top- heavy IMFs\nassociated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. Owing\nto the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases at\nearly times, the resultant M/L_K(sigma) in massive galaxies at the present\nepoch is increased relative to the non- varying IMF case. At late times, lower\ncosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ISM temperatures in massive galaxies, and\nhence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs, further increasing\nM/L_K(sigma). Our central result is hence that a given massive galaxy may go\nthrough both top-heavy and bottom-heavy IMF phases during its lifetime, though\nthe bulk of the stars form during a top-heavy phase. Qualitatively, the\nvariations in M/L_K(sigma) with galaxy mass are in agreement with observations,\nhowever, our model may not be able to account for bottom-heavy mass functions\nas indicated by stellar absorption features. \n\n"}

We find that the latter model fits the\nintegrated burst spectrum significantly better than the former, and that their\nrespective spectral parameters are dramatically different: when fit with a Band\nfunction only, the Epeak of the event is unusually soft for a short GRB, while\nadding a thermal component leads to more typical short GRB values.

When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the\nhigh-l CMB anisotropy, the BAO scale, and the Hubble constant, the densities,\nOmegabh2, Omegach2, and Omega_L, are each determined to a precision of ~1.5%.\nThe amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is\nnow evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level,\nconfirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the\nend of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of\nthe six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to\npre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show\nthat their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from\nthe six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution\nof tensor modes is limited to r<0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter\nis limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is <0.44\neV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40\nwhen the full data are analyzed.

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter\nassumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in\na manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets. Comparing the predicted\nX-ray fluxes with limits from hard X-ray surveys, we conclude that either the\nBondi-Hoyle efficiency parameter \\lambda, is rather small (< 0.01), the\nvelocities of the IBH are rather high, or some combination of both.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored. The magnetic flux required\nto power Swift J1644+57 is too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it\ncould be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disk present in the\ngalactic nucleus prior to the TD.

We have acquired near-infrared (NIR) spectra\nof AGNs up to z ~ 1.8 in the COSMOS and Extended Chandra Deep Field-South\nSurvey, with the Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS) mounted on the Subaru\nTelescope.

To investigate the extent to which satellite and central\ngalaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (M*\n-Mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 < z < 1.\nThis relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against\nrecent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). At z ~\n0 the satellites, on average, have ~10% larger stellar masses at fixed peak\nsubhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass. This is\nrequired in order to reproduce the observed stellar mass-dependent 2PCF and\nsatellite fractions. At low masses our model slightly under-predicts the\ncorrelation function at ~1 Mpc scales.

To\ncompare such models to observations, one must understand how to translate\nbetween surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc) scales and\nsurface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which are\ntreated by models. We define a \"clumping factor\" that captures this translation\nas the ratio of the mass-weighted surface density, which is often the quantity\nof physical interest, to the area-weighted surface density, which is observed.\nWe use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of CO and HI emission from nearby\ngalaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas. The\nmolecular and atomic ISM exhibit dramatically different degrees of clumping. As\na result, the ratio H2/HI measured at ~kpc resolution cannot be trivially\ninterpreted as a cloud-scale ratio of surface densities. HI emission appears\nvery smooth, with a clumping factor of only ~1.3. Based on the scarce and\nheterogeneous high resolution data available, CO emission is far more clumped\nwith a widely variable clumping factor, median ~7 for our heterogeneous data.\nOur measurements do not provide evidence for a universal mass-weighted surface\ndensity of molecular gas, but also cannot conclusively rule out such a\nscenario. We suggest that a more sophisticated treatment of molecular ISM\nstructure, one informed by high spatial resolution CO maps, is needed to link\ncloud-scale models to kpc-scale observations of galaxies. \n\n"}

When the\nrate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these\nbinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the\nneutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by\nthe detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron\nstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered\nmillisecond pulsar.

The\nPAndAS collaboration has identified a particularly thin configuration with\nkinematic coherence among companions of M31 and there have been long standing\nclaims that the dwarf companions to the Milky Way lie in a plane roughly\northogonal to the disk of our galaxy. This discussion investigates the possible\norigins of four Local Group planes: the plane similar, but not identical to\nthat identified by PAndAS, an adjacent slightly tilted plane, and two planes\nnear the Milky Way: one with nearer galaxies and the other with more distant\nones. Plausible orbits are found by using a combination of Numerical Action\nmethods and a backward in time integration procedure. For M31, M33, IC10, and\nLeoI, solutions are found that are consistent with measurements of their proper\nmotions. For galaxies in planes, there must be commonalities in their proper\nmotions, and this constraint greatly limits the number of physically plausible\nsolutions. Key to the formation of the planar structures has been the\nevacuation of the Local Void and consequent build-up of the Local Sheet, a wall\nof this void. Most of the M31 companion galaxies were born in early-forming\nfilamentary or sheet-like substrata that chased M31 out of the void. M31 is a\nmoving target because of its attraction toward the Milky Way, and the result\nhas been alignments stretched toward our galaxy.

We show how the power spectrum of the gas density\nperturbations can accurately constrain both processes. The characteristic\namplitude of density perturbations is linearly related to the strength of\nturbulence, i.e. the 3D Mach number, as A(k)_max = 0.25 M. The slope of A(k) in\nturn reflects the level of conduction. In a non-conductive medium, subsonic\nstirring motions advect density with a similar nearly Kolmogorov cascade.\nIncreasing conduction (via magnetic suppression f = 0.001-1) progressively\nsteepens the spectrum towards the Burgers-like regime. The turbulent Prandtl\nnumber defines the dynamic similarity of the flow; at scales where Pt < 100,\nthe spectrum develops a significant decay. The transition is gentle for highly\nsuppressed conduction, f < 0.001, while sharp in the opposite regime. For\nstrong conductivity (f > 0.1), Pt ~ 100 occurs on spatial scales larger than\nthe injection scale. The velocity spectrum is instead not much affected by\nconduction. The f > 0.1 regime affects the appearance of X-ray images, in which\nKelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor rolls and filaments are washed out.

The source has large fractional circular polarization, m_c \\equiv |V|/I,\ndetected at high significance across the entire band (from 15 to 90\\sigma per\n128 MHz sub-band).

Here, we use a combined X-ray spectral and timing analysis\nof a sample of ULXs to investigate this new accretion regime. We suggest a\nspectral classification scheme that separates ULXs into three classes: a\nbroadened disc class, and two-component hard and soft ultraluminous regimes. At\nthe lowest luminosities the ULX population is dominated by sources with\nbroadened disc spectra, whilst two component spectra are seen at higher\nluminosities, suggestive of a distinction between ~ Eddington and\nsuper-Eddington accretion modes. We find high levels of variability are limited\nto ULXs with soft ultraluminous spectra, and a few broadened disc sources.\nFurthermore, the variability is strongest at high energies, suggesting it\noriginates in the harder spectral component. These properties are consistent\nwith current models of super-Eddington emission, where a wind forms a funnel\naround the central regions of the accretion flow. As the wind provides the soft\ncomponent this suggests that inclination is the key determinant in the observed\nX-ray spectra, which is very strongly supported by the variability results if\nthis originates due to clumpy material at the edge of the wind intermittently\nobscuring our line-of-sight to the central regions of the ULX. The pattern of\nspectral variability with luminosity in two ULXs that straddle the hard/soft\nultraluminous regime boundary is consistent with the wind increasing at higher\naccretion rates, and thus narrowing the opening angle of the funnel.

Other physical estimates of the extent of gravitational\ninfluence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and\n\"galactopause\" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range of\noutflow parameters and confining gas pressures. Physical criteria are proposed\nto define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of R_vir (M*,\nM_h, z_a) for stellar mass M* and halo mass M_h, half of which formed at\n\"assembly redshifts\" z_a = 0.7-1.3. We estimate the extent of bound gas and\ndark matter around L* galaxies to be ~200 kpc.

We find that gas expulsion and the associated dark matter (DM) expansion\ninduced by supernova-driven winds are important for haloes with masses M200 <\n10^13 Msun, lowering their masses by up to 20% relative to a DM-only model. AGN\nfeedback, which is required to prevent overcooling, has a significant impact on\nhalo masses all the way up to cluster scales (M200 ~ 10^15 Msun). Baryonic\nphysics changes the total mass profiles of haloes out to several times the\nvirial radius, a modification that cannot be captured by a change in the halo\nconcentration. The decrease in the total halo mass causes a decrease in the\nhalo mass function of about 20%.

The main goal of this work is to constrain the\ngalaxy group scaling relations corrected for selection effects, and to quantify\nthe influence of non-gravitational physics at the low-mass regime. We analyzed\nXMM-Newton observations for a complete sample of galaxy groups selected from\nthe ROSAT All-Sky Survey and we compared the derived scaling properties with a\ngalaxy cluster sample. To investigate the role played by the different\nnon-gravitational processes we then compared the observational data with the\npredictions of hydrodynamical simulations. After applying the correction for\nselection effects (e.g. Malmquist bias) the L-M relation is steeper than the\nobserved one. Its slope is also steeper than the value obtained by using the\nmore massive systems of the HIFLUGCS sample.

Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger. We show that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar\ndisk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient in exciting the eccentricity of dark\nmatter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely high values where\nthey are accreted by the IMBH.

The\nfirst comment by Boyarsky et al. confirms the absence of a line from M31 in the\n3-4 keV energy range, but criticizes the energy range for spectral fitting on\nthe basis that (i) the background model adopted between 3-4 keV is invalid\noutside that range and that (ii) extending the energy range multiple features\nappear, including a 3.5 keV line. Point (i) is manifestly irrelevant (the 3-4\nkeV background model was not meant to extend outside that range), while closer\ninspection of point (ii) shows that the detected features are inconsistent and\nlikely unphysical. We demonstrate that the existence of an excess near 3.5 keV\nin the M31 data requires fitting a broad enough energy range such that the\nbackground modeling near 3.5 keV is poor to a level that multiple spurious\nresidual features become significant. Bulbul et al. criticize our use of\nWebGuide instead of the full AtomDB package. While a technically correct\nremark, this is only a red herring: our predictions are based on line ratios,\nand not on absolute emissivities; line ratios, for atomic transitions with\nsimilar peak temperatures, are largely temperature-independent, thus the line\nratios we employed to draw our conclusions are substantially correct. Bulbul et\nal. also present a new analysis of their data at lower energy, which excludes a\nsignificant Cl contamination to the 3.5 keV line. Cl emission was however\npredicted to be subdominant in our original study. Both of the Bulbul et al.'s\ncriticisms are thus inconsequential to the conclusions of our original study.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the multi-temperature models employed in Bulbul et\nal. are, in fact, inconsistent, based on the Ca XX to Ca XIX line ratio: we\nshow that the overestimated cluster plasma temperatures they employ lead to\ngross underestimates of the K XVIII line emissivity. \n\n"}

It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates\nslower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores. We find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks\nbetween their gravitational-wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating\nindividual neutron stars, that exist for fixed total binary masses.

Furthermore,\na $f(R)$ gravity cosmological model can be constructed in brane-antibrane\nsystem starting from the very early universe and accounting for the\ncosmological redshift at all phases of cosmic history, from inflation to late\ntime acceleration. Here we propose a $f(R)$ model where transition redshifts\ncorrespond to inflation-deceleration and deceleration-late time acceleration\ntransitions starting froma BIon system. At the point where the universe was\nborn, due to the transition of $k$ black fundamental strings to the BIon\nconfiguration, the redshift is approximately infinity and decreases with\nreducing temperature ($z\\sim T^{2}$). The BIon is a configuration in flat space\nof a universe-brane and a parallel anti-universe-brane connected by a wormhole.\nThis wormhole is a channel for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our\nuniverse, occurring at inflation and decreasing with redshift as $z\\sim\nT^{4+1/7}$.

In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet\nseparates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each\nother. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,\nrather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across\nthe current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a\nmechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical\ndescription of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar\ngamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse\ngamma-ray bursts and supernovae. \n\n"}

In the present work, we consider a detailed analysis of\nthe astrophysical properties of the Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter halos\nthat could provide clear observational signatures that help discriminate\nbetween different dark matter models. In the Bose-Einstein condensation model\ndark matter can be described as a non-relativistic, gravitationally confined\nNewtonian gas, whose density and pressure are related by a polytropic equation\nof state with index $n=1$. The mass and gravitational properties of the\ncondensate halos are obtained in a systematic form, including the mean\nlogarithmic slopes of the density and of the tangential velocity. The lensing\nproperties of the condensate dark matter are investigated in detail. In\nparticular, a general analytical formula for the surface density, an important\nquantity that defines the lensing properties of a dark matter halos, is\nobtained in the form of series expansions. This enables arbitrary-precision\ncalculations of the surface mass density, deflection angle, deflection\npotential, and of the magnification factor, thus giving the possibility of the\ncomparison of the predicted lensing properties of the condensate dark matter\nhalos with observations.

Observational evidence provides\nsupport to the idea that SGRBs originate from the merger of compact binaries,\nconsisting of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH).\nTheoretical models and numerical simulations seem to converge to an explanation\nin which the central engine of SGRBs is given by a spinning BH surrounded by a\nhot accretion torus. Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these\nafterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the\n$\\sim\\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,\nsuggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation. Yet, if the\nmerger results in a massive NS the conditions to generate a relativistic jet\nand thus the prompt SGRB emission are hardly met. Here we consider an\nalternative scenario that can reconcile the two aspects and account for both\nthe prompt and the X-ray afterglow emission.

Such models generally assume the existence of\nStandard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later\nconsequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that\nDM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is\ngenerated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not\nnecessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially\nleads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by\nthe late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM\nrelic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would\ntake for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call\nFlooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is\nthat DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most\nnatural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the\ndecaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling\nand hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter\ncontent of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We\nalso show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector,\nrelaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the\nimplications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has\ninteresting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and\nbaryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump.\nAlternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis\nimplementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time\nreheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of\na lepton asymmetry. \n\n"}

Fast ejecta from supernovae, from these massive stars, shocks this\ncircumstellar medium. Emission generated by this interaction provides a window\ninto the final stages of stellar evolution, by probing the history of mass loss\nfrom the progenitor. Here we use Chandra and Swift x-ray observations of the\ntype II-P/L SN 2013ej to probe the history of mass loss from its progenitor. We\nmodel the observed x-rays as emission from both heated circumstellar matter and\nsupernova ejecta. The circumstellar density profile probed by the supernova\nshock reveals a history of steady mass loss during the final 400 years.

Simulations of these mergers\nwith fully general relativistic codes are critical to understand the merger and\npost-merger gravitational wave signals and their neutrinos and electromagnetic\ncounterparts. In this paper, we employ the SpEC code to simulate the merger of\nlow-mass neutron star binaries (two $1.2M_\\odot$ neutron stars) for a set of\nthree nuclear-theory based, finite temperature equations of state. We show that\nthe frequency peaks of the post-merger gravitational wave signal are in good\nagreement with predictions obtained from simulations using a simpler treatment\nof gravity.

Removal of\nfrequency-dependent interstellar medium (ISM) delays due to dispersion and\nscattering is a key issue in the detection process. Current timing algorithms\nroutinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to\ncold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct\nfor delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering\nintroduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in\npulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for\ninterstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements\nthat can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from\nfrequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.\nCyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest\n(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency\ndecomposition.

Magnetic reconnection within\nthe layers heats a fraction of particles to very high energies.

Below the breaking energy, the Band function\nreduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple\npower law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working\nenergy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can\nbe fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy\nband of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well\neven using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample\nof Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the\nempirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the\nreconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram. We mainly focus on two luminosity\ncorrelations, i.e., the Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. We calculate\nthese two luminosity correlations on both the case that the GRB spectra are\nmodeled by Band function and cut-off power law. It is found that both\nluminosity correlations only moderately depend on the choice of GRB spectra.\nMonte Carlo simulations show that Amati relation is insensitive to the\nhigh-energy power-law index of the Band function. As a result, the GRB Hubble\ndiagram calibrated using luminosity correlations is almost independent on the\nGRB spectra. \n\n"}

We find that this system is a post\ncore passage, dissociative, binary merger, with the optical galaxy density\npeaks of each subcluster leading their associated X-ray emission peaks. This\nseparation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while\nthe effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark\nmatter halos) do not. This system contains double peaked diffuse radio\nemission, possibly a double radio relic with the relics lying along the merger\naxis and also leading the X-ray cores. We find evidence for a temperature peak\nassociated with the SW relic, likely created by the same merger shock that is\npowering the relic radio emission in this region.

In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$.

To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon.

The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured\nstandard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our\nabundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly\nunderestimated by the models.

Previous studies showed that only a certain\ncombination of the individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal\ndeformability) can be measured with second-generation gravitational wave\ninterferometers, such as Adv.

To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or\nequation-of-state independent) relations between two combinations of the\nindividual tidal deformabilities, such that once one of them has been measured,\nthe other can be automatically obtained and the individual ones decoupled\nthrough these relations.

In this picture, dark matter arises as a\nresponse to the standard model of particle physics from the delocalized degrees\nof freedom that build up the dark energy component of the Universe. Dark matter\nphysics is then regulated by a characteristic acceleration scale $a_0$,\nidentified with the radius of the (quasi)-de Sitter universe we inhabit. For a\npoint particle matter source, or outside an extended spherically symmetric\nobject, MOND's empirical fitting formula is recovered. However, Verlinde's\ntheory critically departs from MOND when considering the inner structure of\ngalaxies, differing by a factor of 2 at the centre of a regular massive body.\nFor illustration, we use the eight classical dwarf spheroidal satellites of the\nMilky Way. These objects are perfect testbeds for the model given their\napproximate spherical symmetry, measured kinematics, and identified missing\nmass. We show that, without the assumption of a maximal deformation, Verlinde's\ntheory can fit the velocity dispersion profile in dwarf spheroidals with no\nfurther need of an extra dark particle component. If a maximal deformation is\nconsidered, the theory leads to mass-to-light ratios that are marginally larger\nthan expected from stellar population and formation history studies. We also\ncompare our results with the recent phenomenological interpolating MOND\nfunction of McGaugh {\\it et al}, and find a departure that, for these galaxies,\nis consistent with the scatter in current observations. \n\n"}

Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted\nin an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here\nwe report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known\nrepeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric\nobservations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The\nflux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day\ntimescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size\nless than 1.7 mas.

We show that the size distributions are\nconsistent with log-normal, which severely limits the number of model\nparameters in any SNR population synthesis model. Simple Monte Carlo\nsimulations demonstrate that the size distribution is indistinguishable from\nlog-normal when the SNR sample size is less than 600. This implies that these\nSNR distributions provide only information on the mean and variance, yielding\nadditional information only when the sample size grows larger than $\\sim{600}$\nSNRs. To infer the parameters of the ambient density, we use Bayesian\nstatistical inference under the assumption that SNR evolution is dominated by\nthe Sedov phase. In particular, we use the SNR sizes and explosion energies to\nestimate the mean and variance of the ambient medium surrounding SNR\nprogenitors.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

We also present\nnumerical spectra from photospheres occurring during the transition into the\ncoasting phase of the flow. Using these spectral models, we reanalyse Fermi\nobservations of GRB100507 and GRB101219, which both have been reported to have\nvery narrow spectra. The bursts can be fitted by the spectral models: For\nGRB101219 the spectrum is consistent with the photosphere occurring below or\nclose to the saturation radius, while for GRB100507 the photosphere position\nrelative to the saturation radius can be determined as a function of time. In\nthe latter case, we find that the photosphere initially occurs in the\nacceleration phase and thereafter transitions into the coasting phase. We also\nfind that this transition occurs at the same time as the change in observed\ncooling behaviour: the temperature is close to constant before the break and\ndecays after. We argue that such a transition can be explained by an increasing\nmass outflow rate. Both analysed bursts thus give strong evidence that the jets\nare (initially) radiation dominated. \n\n"}

Using the catalog of 2148 probable cluster\nmembers obtained from Chandra, VVV, and optical surveys (Paper I), we examine\nthe cluster's spatial structure and dynamical state. The spatial distribution\nof stars is remarkably well fit by an isothermal sphere with moderate\nelongation, while other commonly used models like Plummer spheres, multivariate\nnormal distributions, or power-law models are poor fits. The cluster has a core\nradius of $1.2\\pm0.1$ pc and a central density of ~200 stars pc$^{-3}$. The\ndistribution of stars is mildly mass segregated. However, there is no radial\nstratification of the stars by age. Although most of the stars belong to a\nsingle cluster, a small subcluster of stars is found superimposed on the main\ncluster, and there are clumpy non-isotropic distributions of stars outside ~4\ncore radii.

Owing to the natural tendency for\nspecialization, a disconnect can develop between the best available theories\nand the best available data, potentially delaying advances in our understanding\nnew classes of transients. We introduce MOSFiT: the Modular Open-Source Fitter\nfor Transients, a Python-based package that downloads transient datasets from\nopen online catalogs (e.g., the Open Supernova Catalog), generates Monte Carlo\nensembles of semi-analytical light curve fits to those datasets and their\nassociated Bayesian parameter posteriors, and optionally delivers the fitting\nresults back to those same catalogs to make them available to the rest of the\ncommunity.

In some cases\na bouncing universe can have a particle horizon and we specify the conditions\nfor its existence. In the absence of a particle horizon the Hubble surface\nspecifies the causal structure of a bouncing universe. We specify the complex\nrelationship between the Hubble surface and the particle horizon when the\nparticle horizon exists. The article also address the issue related to the\nevent horizon in a bouncing universe. A toy example of a bouncing universe is\nfirst presented where we specify the conditions which dictate the presence of a\nparticle horizon. Next we specify the causal structures of three widely used\nbouncing models. The first case is related to quintom matter bounce model, the\nsecond one is loop quantum cosmology based bounce model and lastly $f(R)$\ngravity induced bounce model. We present a brief discussion on the horizon\nproblem in bouncing cosmologies. We point out that the causal structure of the\nvarious bounce models fit our general theoretical predictions. \n\n"}

So far\nneither observational systematics nor new physics has been successfully\nimplemented to explain this tension away. This paper present a new solution to\nthe Hubble constant problem. The solution is based on the Simsilun simulation\n(relativistic simulation of the large scale structure of the Universe) with the\nray-tracing algorithm implemented. The initial conditions for the Simsilun\nsimulation were set up as perturbations around the $\\Lambda$CDM model. However,\nunlike in the Standard Cosmological Model (i.e. $\\Lambda$CDM model +\nperturbations), within the Simsilun simulation relativistic and nonlinear\nevolution of cosmic structures leads to the phenomenon of emerging spatial\ncurvature, where the mean spatial curvature evolves from spatial flatness of\nthe early universe towards slightly curved present-day universe. Consqeuently,\nthe present-day expansion rate is slightly faster compared to the spatially\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM model. The results of the ray-tracing analysis show that the\nuniverse which starts with initial conditions consistent with the Planck\nconstraints should have the Hubble constant $H_0 = 72.5 \\pm 2.1$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$. When the Simsilun simulation was re-run with no inhomogeneities\nimposed, the Hubble constant inferred within such a homogeneous simulation was\n$H_0 = 68.1 \\pm 2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

Here, we investigate the properties that magnetar power\nwould have on standard-energy SNe associated with 15-20Msun blue or red\nsupergiant (BSG/RSG) stars. We use a combination of Eulerian grey\nradiation-hydrodynamics and non-LTE steady-state radiative transfer to study\ntheir dynamical, photometric, and spectroscopic properties. Adopting magnetar\nfields of 1, 3.5, 7 x 10^14G and rotational energies of 0.4, 1, and 3 x\n10^51erg, we produce bolometric light curves with a broad maximum covering\n50-150d and a magnitude of 10^43-10^44erg/s. The spectra at maximum light are\nanalogous to those of standard SNe II-P but bluer. Although the magnetar energy\nis channelled roughly in equal proportion between SN kinetic energy and SN\nluminosity, the latter may be boosted by a factor 10-100 compared to a standard\nSN II. This influence breaks the observed relation between brightness and\nexpansion rate of standard Type II SNe. Magnetar energy injection also delays\nrecombination and may even cause re-ionization, with a reversal in photospheric\ntemperature and velocity.

Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure.

Current knowledge of the GMF is limited, as most experimental\nmeasurements track line-of-sight--integrated quantities that are used to obtain\nbest-fit parameters for global models including a large random component. The\nadvent, however, of the Gaia era, with measurements of $\\sim 10^9$ stellar\nparallaxes, in combination with upcoming large polarimetric surveys, make, for\nthe first time, a 3D measurement of the GMF possible in principle. Such\nmeasurements can then be used to attempt a reconstruction of the trajectories\nof individual UHECRs through the Galaxy, in order to correct for their\ndeflection.\n  Motivated by these developments, in the present work, we study the limits of\nsuch a correction, by examining how its effectiveness depends on the\nuncertainty of any such future magnetic field measurements. To that end, we\nsimulate attempts to reconstruct the trajectory of the cosmic ray by using\nhypothetical measurements of the GMF, based on values received from two\nrecently updated GMF models. To simulate the uncertainty of a 3D measurement,\nrandom errors to these values are introduced separately for the\nplane-of-the-sky (POS) magnitude, the line-of-sight (LOS) magnitude and the POS\ndirection.\n  Our results highlight the conditions under which an effective correction is\nachievable. We find that the effectiveness is dependent on the particle\nrigidity and arrival direction, and can vary significantly depending on the GMF\nmodel used. \n\n"}

However, recent\nliterature has shown possible contamination (up to 2.4% of the stellar mass in\na high redshift sample) of a young component embedded within the predominantly\nold population of the quiescent galaxy.\n  We compared the data with the predictions of each model, using a new approach\nof distinguishing between systematic and statistical errors (in previous works,\nthese had incorrectly been added in quadrature) and evaluating the effects of\ncontamination by a young stellar component. The ages inferred using cosmic\nchronometers represent a galaxy-wide average rather than a characteristic of\nthe oldest population alone. The average contribution from the young component\nto the rest luminosity at 4000 angstroms may constitute a third of the\nluminosity in some samples, which means that this is far from negligible.

Many of these simulations use moment-based methods\nto track radiative transfer processes using explicit solvers and are therefore\nsubject to strict stability conditions regarding the speed of light, which\nimplies a great computational cost. It can be reduced by assuming a reduced\nspeed of light, and this approximation is now widely used to produce\nlarge-scale simulations of reionization.

We applied it to a set of cosmological simulations of\nthe reionization using a set of reduced speeds of light, and measured the\nevolution of the ionization front speeds during the reionization process. We\nfind that ionization fronts progress via a two-stage process, the first stage\nat low velocity as the fronts emerge from high density regions and a second\nlater stage just before the overlap, during which front speeds increase close\nto the speed of light. Using a set of small 8Mpc/h^3 simulations, we find that\na minimal velocity of 0.3c is able to model these two stages in this specific\ncontext without significant impact. Values as low as 0.05c can model the first\nlow velocity stage, but limit the acceleration at later times. Lower values\nmodify the distribution of front speeds at all times.

Our revised CMB temperature maps agree with corresponding products\nin the Planck 2015 delivery, whereas the polarization maps exhibit\nsignificantly lower large-scale power, reflecting the improved data processing\ndescribed in companion papers; however, the noise properties of the resulting\ndata products are complicated, and the best available end-to-end simulations\nexhibit relative biases with respect to the data at the few percent level.\nUsing these maps, we are for the first time able to fit the spectral index of\nthermal dust independently over 3 degree regions. We derive a conservative\nestimate of the mean spectral index of polarized thermal dust emission of\nbeta_d = 1.55 +/- 0.05, where the uncertainty marginalizes both over all known\nsystematic uncertainties and different estimation techniques. For polarized\nsynchrotron emission, we find a mean spectral index of beta_s = -3.1 +/- 0.1,\nconsistent with previously reported measurements. We note that the current data\nprocessing does not allow for construction of unbiased single-bolometer maps,\nand this limits our ability to extract CO emission and correlated components.\nThe foreground results for intensity derived in this paper therefore do not\nsupersede corresponding Planck 2015 products.

This new generic profile applies remarkably well\nto all magnetized neutron star configurations built on hadronic equations of\nstate. We then apply this profile to build magnetized neutron stars in\nspherical symmetry, using a modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) system of\nequations.

We consider, therefore, two reference abundance distributions that\nmatch the r-process residuals to the solar abundances for A >= 69 (light\ntrans-iron plus r-process elements) and A >= 90 (r-process elements).\nNucleosynthetic abundances are obtained by using free-expansion models with\nthree parameters: expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction.\nRadioactive energies are calculated as an ensemble of weighted free-expansion\nmodels that reproduce the reference abundance patterns. The results are\ncompared with the bolometric luminosity (> a few days since merger) of the\nkilonova associated with GW170817. We find that the former case (fitted for A\n>= 69) with an ejecta mass 0.06 M_sun reproduces the light curve remarkably\nwell including its steepening at > 7 days, in which the mass of r-process\nelements is ~ 0.01 M_sun. Two beta-decay chains are identified: 66Ni -> 66Cu ->\n66Zn and 72Zn -> 72Ga -> 72Ge with similar halflives of parent isotopes (~ 2\ndays), which leads to an exponential-like evolution of heating rates during\n1-15 days.

These high-energy flares are often\ndifficult to explain with shock acceleration models due to the small size of\nthe inferred emitting region, with recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations\nshowing that magnetic reconnection is a promising alternative mechanism. Here,\nwe present a macroscopic emission model physically motivated by PIC\nsimulations, where the energy for particle acceleration originates from the\nreconnecting magnetic field. We track the radial growth and relative velocity\nof a reconnecting plasmoid, modelling particle acceleration and radiative\nlosses from synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. To test\nthe viability of magnetic reconnection as the mechanism behind rapid blazar\nflares we simultaneously fit our model to the observed light-curve and SED from\nthe 2016 TeV flare of BL Lacertae. We find generally that, without considering\nexternal photons, reconnecting plasmoids are unable to produce Compton-dominant\nTeV flares and so cannot reproduce the observations due to overproduction of\nsynchrotron emission. Additionally, problematically large plasmoids, comparable\nin size to the entire jet radius, are required to emit sufficient SSC\ngamma-rays to be observable. However, our plasmoid model can reproduce the\nrapid TeV lightcurve of the flare, demonstrating that reconnection is able to\nproduce rapid, powerful TeV flares on observed timescales. We conclude that\nwhile reconnection can produce SSC flares on the correct timescales, the\nprimary source of TeV emission cannot be SSC and the size of plasmoids required\nmay be implausibly large. \n\n"}

With the\ndiffusion-reacceleration model, we consider two schemes to reproduce the\nhardening in the spectra: (i) A high-rigidity break in primary source\ninjection; (ii) A high-rigidity break in diffusion coefficient. The global\nfitting results show that both schemes could reproduce the spectra hardening in\ncurrent status. More precise multi-TV data (especially the data of secondary CR\nspecies) is needed if one wants to distinguish these two schemes. In our global\nfitting, each of the nuclei species is allocated an independent solar\nmodulation potential and a re-scale factor (which accounts for the isotopic\nabundance for primary nuclei species and uncertainties of production cross\nsection or inhomogeneity of CR sources and propagation for secondary nuclei\nspecies).

This state, which has been known to persist for\nyears, has recently been interpreted as emission from a shock that enshrouds\nthe pulsar. However, the pressure balance for such a configuration is a crucial\nunresolved issue. We consider two scenarios for pressure balance: a companion\nmagnetosphere and stellar mass loss with gas dominance. It is found that the\nmagnetospheric scenario requires several kilogauss poloidal fields for isobaric\nsurfaces to enshroud the MSP as well as for the magnetosphere to remain stable\nif there is significant mass loss. For the gas-dominated scenario, it is\nnecessary that the companion wind loses angular momentum prolifically as an\nadvection or heating-dominated flow. Thermal bremsstrahlung cooling in the flow\nmay be observable as a UV to soft X-ray component independent of orbital phase\nif the mass rate is high.

Therefore, the optical transient emission can be somewhat absorbed\nand scattered by the dusty wind, which can suppress the peak emission and cause\na scattering plateau in optical light curves.

Discovery of and observations to such dust-affected\noptical transients and shock-driven radio transients can help to explore the\nnature of super-Chandrasekhar merger remnants and as well as the density and\ntype ratios of double white dwarf systems, which is beneficial in assessing\ntheir gravitational wave contributions. \n\n"}

In the analysis, we consider\nrealistic conditions inside supernovae and discuss both the Dirac and Majorana\ncases. We show that due to the interaction with the polarized matter a neutrino\nflux from a supernova suffers additional attenuation at low neutrino energies.\nAnother possible effect is that when taken together the effects of conventional\nmagnetic moment and polarized matter can cancel each other so that under\ncertain condition the oscillations disappear. We note that this can lead to the\nappearance of a characteristic maximum in the spectrum of electron neutrinos\nfrom supernovae. Accounting for neutrino mixing (in the two-flavor\napproximation) can significantly increase (almost twice) the effective value of\nthe IMM of the electron neutrino. As a result, electron neutrinos with twice as\nhigh energy will be able to participate in the processes of spin conversion.\nVarious feedback mechanisms accompanying the considered phenomena are also\ndiscussed. \n\n"}

The explosions were\nmodeled in 3D with the neutrino-hydrodynamics code PROMETHEUS-HOTB, and\nlight-curve calculations were performed in spherical symmetry with the\nradiation-hydrodynamics code CRAB. Our results confirm the basic findings of\nthe previous work: 3D neutrino-driven explosions with SN 1987A-like energies\nsynthesize an amount of Ni-56 that is consistent with the radioactive tail of\nthe light curve. Moreover, the models mix hydrogen inward to minimum velocities\nbelow 400 km/s as required by spectral observations. Hydrodynamic simulations\nwith the new progenitor models, which possess smaller radii than the older\nones, show much better agreement between calculated and observed light curves\nin the initial luminosity peak and during the first 20 days. A set of\nexplosions with similar energies demonstrated that a high growth factor of\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the (C+O)/He composition interface combined\nwith a weak interaction of fast Rayleigh-Taylor plumes, where the reverse shock\noccurs below the He/H interface, provides a sufficient condition for efficient\noutward mixing of Ni-56 into the hydrogen envelope. This condition is realized\nto the required extent only in one of the older stellar models, which yielded a\nmaximum velocity of around 3000 km/s for the bulk of ejected Ni-56, but failed\nto reproduce the helium-core mass of 6 Msun inferred from the absolute\nluminosity of the presupernova star.

{"id": "1901.07572", "contents": "Title: The Evolution of Binaries in a Gaseous Medium: Three-Dimensional\n  Simulations of Binary Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion Abstract: Binary stars are common. While only those with small separations may exchange\ngas with one another, even the widest binaries interact with their gaseous\nsurroundings. Drag forces and accretion rates dictate how these systems are\ntransformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term\nevolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing\nof the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic\npredictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the\ntimescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the\n$0.19 \\pm 0.01$ power. This positive scaling indicates that gaseous drag forces\ncan drive binaries either to coalescence or to the critical separation at which\ngravitational radiation dominates their further evolution. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for binaries embedded in the interstellar medium,\nactive galactic nuclei disks, and common envelope phases. \n\n"}

Abstract: We analyze the monopole in the peculiar velocities of 44 Type Ia supernovae\n(SNe Ia) to test for a local void. The sample extends from 20 to 300 Mpc/h,\nwith distances, deduced from light-curve shapes, accurate to ~6%. Assuming\nOmega_m=1 and Omega_lambda=0, the most significant deviation we find from the\nHubble law is an outwards flow of (6.6+/-2.2)% inside a sphere of radius 70\nMpc/h as would be produced by a void of ~20% underdensity surrounded by a dense\nshell. This shell roughly coincides with the local Great Walls. Monte Carlo\nanalyses, using Gaussian errors or bootstrap resampling, show the probability\nfor chance occurrence of this result out of a pure Hubble flow to be ~2%. The\nmonopole could be contaminated by higher moments of the velocity field,\nespecially a quadrupole, which are not properly probed by the current limited\nsky coverage. The void would be less significant if Omega_m is low and\nOmega_lambda is high. It would be more significant if one outlier is removed\nfrom the sample, or if the size of the void is constrained a-priori. This\nputative void is not in significant conflict with any of the standard\ncosmological scenarios. It suggests that the Hubble constant as determined\nwithin 70 Mpc/h could be overestimated by ~6% and the local value of Omega may\nbe underestimated by ~20%. While the present evidence for a local void is\nmarginal in this data set, the analysis shows that the accumulation of SNe Ia\ndistances will soon provide useful constraints on elusive and important aspects\nof regional cosmic dynamics. \n\n"}
