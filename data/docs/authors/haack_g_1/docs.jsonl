Under special circumstances, a\nsubspace of the system's Hilbert space remains coherent, or \"decoherence free\",\nand the reduced density matrix approaches a non-trivial limit which contains\ninformation on its initial quantum state, despite the coupling to the\nenvironment. This situation is called \"partial decoherence\". Here we find the\nconditions for partial decoherence for a mesoscopic system (with $N$ quantum\nstates) which is coupled to an environment. When the Hamiltonian of the system\ncommutes with the total Hamiltonian, one has \"adiabatic decoherence\", which\nyields N-1 time-independent combinations of the reduced density matrix\nelements. In the presence of a magnetic flux, one can measure circulating\ncurrents around loops in the system even at long times, and use them to\nretrieve information on the initial state.

For an electron moving\non a ring, with $N>2$ single-level quantum dots, non-adiabatic partial\ndecoherence can arise only when the total flux through the ring vanishes (or\nequals an integer number of flux quanta), and therefore there is no asymptotic\ncirculating current. \n\n"}

We determine simple\nexpressions for the photon noise spectrum and find that the multiphoton\nresonances also induces a multiple peak structure in that noise. When the\ncorresponding multiphoton Rabi oscillations are underdamped, zero temperature\nquantum fluctuations determine comparable populations of all quasienergy states\nwhich belong to a resonant multiphoton doublet. Most interestingly, the quantum\nfluctuations probe the multiphoton transitions by inducing several peaks in the\nnoise spectrum of the resonator observables.

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states.

Defects often play a central role in ionic and electronic solids, not\nonly to limit reliability, but more importantly to enable the functionalities\nthat make these materials of critical importance. Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A\ncentral hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both\nshort-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density\nfunctional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these\nmaterials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic\nmethod to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals\nwith defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in\nan almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density\nfield as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. In regions far from the\ndefect, where the crystal is close-to-perfect, the polarization field serves as\na proxy that enables us to avoid accounting for the details of the charge\nvariation. We combine this approach for long-range electrostatics with the\nstandard Quasicontinuum method for short-range interactions to achieve an\nefficient multiscale atomistic-to-continuum method. \n\n"}

We show that for some parameters of the Fermi energy, the beam\nsplitter device built on 2D TIs can achieve higher in-plane spin polarization\nthan one built on materials described by the Rashba model itself.

In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals\nof motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in\nthese systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local\nintegrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a\nlocal particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's\nHamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such\noperators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL\nsystem to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents\na density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes\nhow this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely\ndefined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for\ncharacterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and\nnumerical simulations.

{"id": "1503.05716", "contents": "Title: Equivalence of matrix product ensembles of trajectories in open quantum\n  systems Abstract: The equivalence of thermodynamic ensembles is at the heart of statistical\nmechanics and central to our understanding of equilibrium states of matter.\nRecently, it has been shown that there is a formal connection between the\ndynamics of open quantum systems and the statistical mechanics in an extra\ndimension. This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics\ngenerates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible\nquantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions\nin the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of\ncontinuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad\nmaster equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which\nencodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed\ntotal observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates\ntrajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events\ninto the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an\ninteresting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different\nensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by\ntotal number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of\ndifferent thermodynamic ensembles, akin to \"grand-canonical\" and \"isobaric\",\nbut for trajectories. Here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are\nequivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps. This is\nin direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence\nbetween ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit. An\nintrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all\nobservables that commute with the number of quantum jumps. \n\n"}

So far, work\nhas focused on Weyl semimetals with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However,\nWeyl semimetals with weak SOC may allow tunable spin-splitting for device\napplications and may exhibit a crossover to a spinless topological phase, such\nas a Dirac line semimetal in the case of spinless TaAs. NbP, isostructural to\nTaAs, may realize the first Weyl semimetal in the limit of weak SOC. Here we\nstudy the surface states of NbP by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and we find that we $\\textit{cannot}$ show Fermi arcs based on our\nexperimental data alone. We present an $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculation of the\nsurface states of NbP and we find that the Weyl points are too close and the\nFermi level is too low to show Fermi arcs either by (1) directly measuring an\narc or (2) counting chiralities of edge modes on a closed path. Nonetheless,\nthe excellent agreement between our experimental data and numerical\ncalculations suggests that NbP is a Weyl semimetal, consistent with TaAs, and\nthat we observe trivial surface states which evolve continuously from the\ntopological Fermi arcs above the Fermi level. Based on these results, we\npropose a slightly different criterion for a Fermi arc which, unlike (1) and\n(2) above, does not require us to resolve Weyl points or the spin splitting of\nsurface states. We propose that raising the Fermi level by $> 20$ meV would\nmake it possible to observe a Fermi arc using this criterion in NbP.

However, we understand\nthe interaction effects unsatisfactorily, and should have clarified issues\nabout the roles of the Fermi sea term and Fermi surface term of the\nconductivity of the intrinsic AHE or SHE of an interacting multiorbital metal\nand about the effects of spin-Coulomb drag on the intrinsic SHE.

The most striking result is that\neven without impurities the Fermi surface term, a non-Berry-curvature term,\nplays dominant roles at high or slightly low temperatures. In particular, this\nFermi surface term causes the temperature dependence of the dc anomalous Hall\nor spin Hall conductivity due to the interaction-induced quasiparticle damping\nand the correction of the dc spin Hall conductivity due to the spin-Coulomb\ndrag. Those results revise our understanding of the intrinsic AHE and SHE.

Inversion symmetry breaking gives rise to an effective Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction. We derive general spin-charge kinetic equations which\nshow that such spin-orbit interaction, together with anisotropic Elliott-Yafet\nspin relaxation, yields significant corrections to the magnetization-induced\ndynamics.

We present here a realistic proposal\nto construct a chaotic driven top from the nuclear spin of a single donor atom\nin silicon, in the presence of a nuclear quadrupole interaction. This system is\nexquisitely measurable and controllable, and possesses extremely long intrinsic\nquantum coherence times, allowing for the observation of subtle dynamical\nbehavior over extended periods. We show that signatures of chaos are expected\nto arise for experimentally realizable parameters of the system, allowing the\nstudy of the relation between quantum decoherence and classical chaos, and the\nobservation of dynamical tunneling. \n\n"}

We find that, in the strong-coupling limit of a sizable\nproximity-induced superconducting gap, all transverse subbands of the wire are\nsignificantly shifted in energy relative to the chemical potential of the wire.\nFor the lowest subband, this band shift is comparable in magnitude to the\nspacing between quantized levels that arise due to the finite thickness of the\nsuperconductor (which typically is $\\sim500$ meV for a 10-nm-thick layer of\nAluminum); in higher subbands, the band shift is much larger.

Recently, ultrastrong coupling to a transmission line has been\nachieved where the emitter resonance broadens to a significant fraction of its\nfrequency.

This coupling causes\nthe degenerate ground state of the topological superconductor to be dressed in\na polaron-like manner by quasi-particle states and bosons, and the system to\nbecome gapless. Topological protection and hence full coherence is only\nmaintained if the qubit is operated and read out within the low-energy spectrum\nof the dressed states.

Previous studies have indicated that the corrections to the\nFermi-liquid forms of the specific heat and the static spin susceptibility\nscale as $T^{D}$ and $T^{D-1}$, respectively (with extra logarithms for\n$D=1,3$). In addition, the non-uniform spin susceptibility is expected to\ndepend on the bosonic momentum $Q$ in a non-analytic way, i.e., as $Q^{D-1}$\n(again with extra logarithms for $D=1,3$). It is shown that these non-analytic\ncorrections originate from the universal singularities in the dynamical bosonic\nresponse functions of a generic Fermi liquid. In contrast to the leading,\nFermi-liquid forms which depend on the interaction averaged over the Fermi\nsurface, the non-analytic corrections are parameterized by only two coupling\nconstants, which are the components of the interaction potential at momentum\ntransfers $q=0$ and $q=2k_F$.

This theory is expressed in terms of collective many-body excitations\nthat show exotic behavior such as spin-charge separation. Luttinger liquid\ntheory is commonly applied on the premise that \"low energy\" describes both the\nspin and charge sectors. However, when the interactions in the system are very\nstrong, as they typically are at low particle densities, the ratio of spin to\ncharge energy may become exponentially small. It is then possible at very low\ntemperatures for the energy to be low compared to the characteristic charge\nenergy, but still high compared to the characteristic spin energy.

The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated\nevolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the\nwhich-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its\ncoherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a\npair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise\nflip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped\ninto the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a\ngeometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control\nschemes.

The existing scaling equation for quantum wires with off-diagonal\ndisorder [Brouwer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 862 (1998)] is a special point\nin this family. Both parameters depend on the details of the microscopic model.\nSince there are two parameters involved, instead of only one, localization in a\nwire with off-diagonal disorder is not universal. We take a geometric point of\nview and show that this nonuniversality follows from the fact that the group of\ntransfer matrices is not semi-simple.
