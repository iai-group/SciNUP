Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Neutrinos are the least\ndetectable particles in the SM and a null signal in this channel would allow to\nset the most conservative bound on the total annihilation cross section.

Abstract: We consider the effect of mass segregation on the observable integrated\nproperties of star clusters. The measurable properties depend on a combination\nof the dynamical age of the cluster and the physical age of the stars in the\ncluster. To investigate all possible combinations of these two quantities we\npropose an analytical model for the mass function of segregated star clusters\nthat agrees with the results of N-body simulations, in which any combination\ncan be specified. For a realistic degree of mass segregation and a fixed\ndensity profile we find with increasing age an increase in the measured core\nradii and a central surface brightness that decreases in all filters more\nrapidly than what is expected from stellar evolution alone. Within a Gyr the\nmeasured core radius increases by a factor of two and the central surface\ndensity in all filters of a segregated cluster will be overestimated by a\nsimilar factor when not taking into account mass segregation in the conversion\nfrom light to mass. We find that the $V-I$ colour of mass segregated clusters\ndecreases with radius by about 0.1-0.2 mag, which could be observable. From\nrecent observations of partially resolved extra-galactic clusters a decreasing\nhalf-light radius with increasing wavelength was observed, which was attributed\nto mass segregation.

We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from\nthe planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this corresponds\nto minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-\n48 K and 1220 +/- 47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an\norbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30\ndegrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would\nhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the\nsmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's\natmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night\nside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature\ndifferences. The similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for HD\n189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a\nfundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these two\nwavelengths.

An important\ndiagnostic is the Toomre Q stability parameter which controls the stability of\na galactic disk against local Jeans collapse. I also show how the density wave\ntheory of galactic spiral arms can be employed to constrain the mass of a\ngalactic disk. Applying both diagnostics to the example of NGC 2985 and\ndiscussing also the implied mass-to-light ratio I demonstrate that the inner\nparts of the galaxy, where the optical disk resides, are dominated by baryons.\nWhen I apply this method to the disks of low surface brightness galaxies, I\nfind unexpectedly high mass-to light ratios. These could be explained by\npopulation synthesis models which assume a bottom heavy initial mass function\nsimilar to the recently proposed `integrated galactic initial mass function'. \n\n"}

The structure of the jet is similar to the previous study: a\npoynting flux jet is surrounded by a funnel-wall jet. Even at the final stage\nof the simulation, bulk Lorentz factor of the jet is still low, and total\nenergy of the jet is still as small as 10^48 erg.

The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the\nambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles\nproduce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)\nprocesses. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR)\nframe-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation\nexpected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in\n47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period\nderivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects\nof pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small\nerrors) of particles leaving the MSPs.

We find that the IC radiation\nfrom 47 Tucanae may be visible for H.E.S.S., depending on the nebular field B\nas well as the number of MSPs N in the GC.

This is supported by the slowly-evolving light\ncurve. A notable feature in the spectrum of SN 2007rt is the presence of a\nbroad He I 5875 line, not usually detected in Type IIn supernovae.

In this work we show that the lack of\ndetection of a GeV spectrum excess in almost all GRBs, though somewhat\nsurprisingly, can be well understood within the standard internal shock model\nand several alternatives like the photosphere-internal shock (gradual magnetic\ndissipation) model and the magnetized internal shock model. The delay of the\narrival of the >100 MeV photons from some Fermi bursts can be interpreted too.\nWe then show that with the polarimetry of prompt emission these models may be\ndistinguishable. In the magnetized internal shock model, high linear\npolarization level should be typical. In the standard internal shock model,\nhigh linear polarization level is still possible but much less frequent. In the\nphotosphere-internal shock model, the linear polarization degree is expected to\nbe roughly anti-correlated with the weight of the photosphere/thermal\ncomponent, which may be a unique signature of this kind of model. We also\nbriefly discuss the implication of the current Fermi GRB data on the detection\nprospect of the prompt PeV neutrinos.

The theory of\ngravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not\nsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory\nvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.\nIn this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show\nthat it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close\nto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity. We then show that using the\nTrans-Planckian ansatz (as a quantum gravity effect) close to the black hole\nhorizon, leads to an accelerating cosmological solution, far from the horizon.\nInterestingly, this acceleration matches current observations for stellar mass\nblack holes.

The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD) may\nlead to the formation of a protoneutron star and a collapse-driven supernova\nexplosion. This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear\ndisruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and\ngravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary\nto reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of\nthe GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of\ngeneral-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature\nequation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during\ncollapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational\nequilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and\ncentral densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW\nsignal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a \"Type III\" signal in the\nliterature.

Some of our AIC\nmodels form massive quasi-Keplerian accretion disks after bounce. In rapidly\ndifferentially rotating models, the disk mass can be as large as ~0.8-Msun.\nSlowly and/or uniformly rotating models produce much smaller disks.

Between directional sweeps, the\nthree-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always\nperformed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.\nHence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation\nequations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel\nparallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI\nfor cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory. This scheme\nis then combined with an additional OpenMP parallelisation of different sweeps\nthat can take advantage of clusters of shared memory.

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN. AGN jets of this magnitude must be almost perfectly\nidentically bipolar. The relativistic momentum of a single jet would cause a\ncentral AGN black hole of mass 10^9 M_{sun} to recoil at ~6000 km s^{-1},\nexceeding kick velocities during black hole mergers, and be ejected from the\ncluster-center galaxy. When the cavity inflation is complete, 4PV\nunderestimates the total energy received by the cluster gas. Deviations of the\ncluster gas from hydrostatic equilibrium are most pronounced during the early\ncavity evolution when the integrated cluster mass found from the observed gas\npressure gradient can have systematic errors near the cavities of ~10-30%.

At the transition to reheating the state of\nthe field changes to a many particle/anti-particle state. We characterize that\nstate as a fluid flow of zero mean velocity but with a stochastic velocity\nfield. We compute the scale-dependent Reynolds number $% Re(k)$, and the\ncharacteristic times for decay of turbulence, $t_{d}$ and pair annihilation\n$t_{a}$, finding $t_{a}<< t_{d}$.

In this context, a novel numerical procedure utilising Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC), ABC and a Bayesian bootstrap procedure was developed in a\ntruly distribution-free setting. The ABC methodology arises because we work in\na distribution-free setting in which we make no parametric assumptions, meaning\nwe can not evaluate the likelihood point-wise or in this case simulate directly\nfrom the likelihood model. The use of a bootstrap procedure allows us to\ngenerate samples from the intractable likelihood without the requirement of\ndistributional assumptions, this is crucial to the ABC framework.

Our study is focused on a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during\nits first four years of operation. The sample contains those bursts with\nmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.\nIntermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long\nGRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average\none order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. There is a less significant\ntrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer than\nlong bursts. Except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties to\nlong bursts.

Unlike to usual experiments in particle\nphysics, where noise always adds to the signal, radio noise can in principle\ndecrease or increase the signal if it interferes by chance destructively or\nconstructively. Consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from the\nsignal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulses\nmust be studied with care. First, noise has to be determined consistently with\nthe definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum field\nstrength of the radio pulse. Second, the average impact of noise on radio pulse\nmeasurements at individual antennas is studied for LOPES. It is shown that a\ncorrect treatment of noise is especially important at low signal-to-noise\nratios: noise can be the dominant source of uncertainty for pulse height and\ntime measurements, and it can systematically flatten the slope of lateral\ndistributions.

In the test-mass limit,\nwell-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.\nIn the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in\na post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO\ncondition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)\nbinaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected\nproperties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass\nlimit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the\nSchwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational\nself-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to\nspinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr\nISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are\ncurrently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is\nalso calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly\nreproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a\nfully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the\nstability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of\n\"resummation\") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr\nspacetime.

This\npaper examines the prospects for the detectability of such gamma ray halos. We\nexplore a broad range of astrophysical parameters, including the inhomogeneous\ndistribution of magnetic fields in the large scale structure as well as various\npossible chemical compositions and injection spectra; and we consider the case\nof a source located outside clusters of galaxies. With respect to the gamma-ray\nflux associated to synchrotron radiation of ultra-high energy secondary pairs,\nwe demonstrate that it does not depend strongly on these parameters and\nconclude that its magnitude ultimately depends on the energy injected in the\nprimary cosmic rays.

In a stepwise procedure regulatory measures are\nintroduced and their implications on market liquidity and stability examined.\nParticularly, the effects of (i) a ban of short selling (ii) a mandatory risk\nlimit, i.e. a Value-at-Risk limit, (iii) an introduction of a Tobin Tax, i.e.\ntransaction tax on trading, and (iv) any arbitrary combination of the measures\nare observed and discussed.

Just after the launch of the supernova\nshock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The\noutflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As\nthe magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux\ndominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet\nto clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the\nprompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models:\nmagnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic\ndissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band'\nspectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading\ndecreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t\n~ 10-100 seconds. Jets with ultra-high magnetization cannot effectively\naccelerate and dissipate their energy, suggesting this transition ends the\nprompt emission and may explain the steep decay phase that follows. We assess\nseveral phenomena potentially related to magnetar birth, including low\nluminosity GRBs, thermal-rich GRBs/X-ray Flashes, very luminous supernovae, and\nshort duration GRBs with extended emission. \n\n"}

As\nsupported by the Pickands-Balkema-de Haan Theorem, tail events exceeding some\nhigh threshold are usually modeled by a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).\nEstimation of GPD tail quantiles is not a trivial task, in particular if one\ntakes into account the heavy tails of this distribution, the possibility of\nsingular outliers, and, moreover, the fact that data is usually pooled among\nseveral sources.

A key signature of the ejection is non-thermal\nradio emission. The level of this jet component at high frequencies is still\npoorly constrained. Aims: The X-ray binary and microquasar black hole candidate\nXTE J1550-564 exhibited a faint X-ray outburst in April 2003 during which it\nstayed in the X-ray low/hard state. We took optical and near-infrared (NIR)\nobservations with the ESO/NTT telescope during this outburst to disentangle the\nvarious contributions to the spectral energy distribution (SED) and investigate\nthe presence of a jet component. Methods: Photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations allowed us to construct an SED and also to produce a high\ntime-resolution lightcurve. Results: The SED shows an abrupt change of slope\nfrom the NIR domain to the optical. The NIR emission is attributed to\nnon-thermal synchrotron emission from the compact, self-absorbed jet that is\nknown to be present in the low/hard state. This is corroborated by the fast\nvariability, colours, lack of prominent spectral features and evidence for\nintrinsic polarisation. The SED suggests the jet break from the optically thick\nto the thin regime occurs in the NIR. Conclusions: The simultaneous optical-NIR\ndata allow an independent confirmation of jet emission in the NIR. The\ntransition to optically thin synchrotron occurs at NIR frequencies or below,\nwhich leads to an estimated characteristic size greater than 2x10^8cm and\nmagnetic field less than 5T for the jet base, assuming a homogeneous one-zone\nsynchrotron model. \n\n"}

We also include in our calculations the\neffect of DM substructure. Willman 1 appears as the best candidate in the\nsample. However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other\ncandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor\nand Segue 1, might be better options. As for galaxy clusters, Virgo represents\nthe one with the highest flux. However, its large spatial extension can be a\nserious handicap for IACT observations and posterior data analysis. Yet, other\nlocal galaxy cluster candidates with more moderate emission regions, such as\nPerseus, may represent good alternatives.

The technique employed to identify these characteristics is a Monte\nCarlo simulation of such diffusive acceleration in test-particle, relativistic,\noblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks. Using a compact prescription for\ndiffusion of charges in MHD turbulence, this approach generates particle\nangular and momentum distributions at any position upstream or downstream of\nthe shock. Simulation output is presented for both small angle and large angle\nscattering scenarios, and a variety of shock obliquities including superluminal\nregimes when the de Hoffmann-Teller frame does not exist. The distribution\nfunction power-law indices compare favorably with results from other\ntechniques. They are found to depend sensitively on the mean magnetic field\norientation in the shock, and the nature of MHD turbulence that propagates\nalong fields in shock environs. An interesting regime of flat spectrum\ngeneration is addressed; we provide evidence for it being due to shock drift\nacceleration, a phenomenon well-known in heliospheric shock studies. The impact\nof these theoretical results on blazar science is outlined. Specifically,\nFermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of these relativistic jet sources are\nproviding significant constraints on important environmental quantities for\nrelativistic shocks, namely the field obliquity, the frequency of scattering\nand the level of field turbulence. \n\n"}

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

For practical purposes, the chiral\nfermionic sector of Lee-wick theories requires two Lee-Wick partners per\nfermion which opens up the possibility for a negative energy density of the\nearly universe. A toy Lee-Wick model with one fermionic partner relaxes such\noddities and hence easy to deal with. In a similar way, the longitudinal\ndegrees of freedom of the massive gauge boson partners also have the potential\nto yield negative energy densities and thus those will be neglected in a toy\nmodel study. In such a toy model one can analytically calculate the\ntime-temperature relation in the very early radiation dominated universe which\nshows interesting new physics. The article also tries to point out how a\nLee-Wick particle dominated early cosmology transforms into the standard\ncosmological model. Based on the results of this toy model analysis a brief\ndiscussion on the more realistic model, which can accommodate two Lee-Wick\npartners for each standard fermionic field and the longitudinal degree of\nfreedom of partners of the gauge fields, is presented.

While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN. The possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor SLSN, 2006oz, could be\nthe first example of this signature and give support to the SN-CSM interaction\nas the power source of SLSN 2006oz. \n\n"}

Homogeneous and inhomogeneous unpinning\ngeometries, representing creep- and avalanche-like glitches, provide lower and\nupper bounds on the gravitational wave signal strength respectively.

To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity.

As primary source of seed\nphotons for inverse Compton scattering, we consider radiation from the broad\nline region (BLR), from the molecular torus, and the local synchrotron\nradiation (SSC). Different scenarios are assessed by comparing simulated light\ncurves and SEDs with one of the best flares by PKS1510-089, in March 2009.

Finally, we consider the situation where the eligible asset is not\nliquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear. We establish when the\nresulting risk measures are quasiconvex and show that cash subadditivity is\nonly compatible with continuous pricing rules. \n\n"}

IFD constructs an\nensemble of non-parametric sub-grid field configurations from the combination\nof the data in computer memory, representing constraints on possible field\nconfigurations, and prior assumptions on the sub-grid field statistics. Each of\nthese field configurations can formally be evolved to a later moment since any\ndifferential operator of the dynamics can act on fields living in continuous\nspace. However, these virtually evolved fields need again a representation by\ndata in computer memory. The maximum entropy principle of information theory\nguides the construction of updated datasets via entropic matching, optimally\nrepresenting these field configurations at the later time. The field dynamics\nthereby become represented by a finite set of evolution equations for the data\nthat can be solved numerically. The sub-grid dynamics is treated within an\nauxiliary analytic consideration and the resulting scheme acts solely on the\ndata space. It should provide a more accurate description of the physical field\ndynamics than simulation schemes constructed ad-hoc, due to the more rigorous\naccounting of sub-grid physics and the space discretization process.\nAssimilation of measurement data into an IFD simulation is conceptually\nstraightforward since measurement and simulation data can just be merged. The\nIFD approach is illustrated using the example of a coarsely discretized\nrepresentation of a thermally excited classical Klein-Gordon field. This should\npave the way towards the construction of schemes for more complex systems like\nturbulent hydrodynamics. \n\n"}

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM.

Stellar-mass black holes in the \"low/hard\" state are an\nexcellent laboratory in which to study disk-jet connections, but few\ncoordinated observations are made using spectrometers that can incisively probe\nthe inner disk. We report on a series of 20 Suzaku observations of Cygnus X-1\nmade in the jet-producing low/hard state.

Two important and\nsimple results are obtained: (1) the jet (as traced by radio flux) does not\nappear to be modulated by changes in the inner radius of the accretion disk;\nand (2) the jet is sensitive to disk properties, including its flux,\ntemperature, and ionization. Some more complex results may reveal aspects of a\ncoupled disk-corona-jet system. A positive correlation between the reflected\nX-ray flux and radio flux may represent specific support for a plasma ejection\nmodel of the corona, wherein the base of a jet produces hard X-ray emission.\nWithin the framework of the plasma ejection model, the spectra suggest a jet\nbase with v/c ~ 0.3, or the escape velocity for a vertical height of z ~ 20\nGM/c^2 above the black hole.

The motion of particles with trajectories close to\nthe curved magnetic lines is usually referred to the so-called curvature\nradiation. The latter is treated within the formalism of synchrotron radiation\nby replacing the particle Larmor radius with the curvature radius of the field\nlines. However, even at small pitch angles, the curvatures of the particle\ntrajectory and the field line may differ significantly. Moreover, as we show in\nthis paper the trajectory curvature varies with time, i.e. the process has a\nstochastic character. Therefore for calculations of observable characteristics\nof radiation by an ensemble of particles, the radiation intensities should be\naveraged over time.

A substantial misalignment angle (~15-20 degrees) between the\ninner-disk rotation axis and the compact-object spin axis is required for the\neffects of this precession to produce observable modulations in the X-ray light\ncurve. A consequence of this misalignment is that in high-inclination X-ray\nbinaries the precessing inner disk will quasi-periodically intercept our line\nof sight to the compact object.

We have considered\nbeta_0=10^2, 10^3 and 10^4 and in the first two cases the most unstable linear\nMRI modes are well resolved in the simulations. We find that the behavior of\nthe MRI turbulence strongly depends on beta_0: The radial transport of angular\nmomentum increases with net vertical flux, achieving alpha=0.08 for beta_0=10^4\nand alpha>1.0 for beta_0=100, where alpha is the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter. A\ncritical value lies at beta_0=10^3: For beta_0>10^3, the disk consists of a gas\npressure dominated midplane and a magnetically dominated corona. The turbulent\nstrength increases with net flux, and angular momentum transport is dominated\nby turbulent fluctuations. The magnetic dynamo that leads to cyclic flips of\nlarge-scale fields still exists, but becomes more sporadic as net flux\nincreases. For beta_0<10^3, the entire disk becomes magnetic dominated. The\nturbulent strength saturates, and the magnetic dynamo is quenched. Stronger\nlarge-scale fields are generated with increasing net flux, which dominates\nangular momentum transport. A strong outflow is launched from the disk by the\nmagnetocentrifugal mechanism, and the mass flux increases linearly with net\nvertical flux and shows sign of saturation at beta_0=10^2. However, the outflow\nis unlikely to be directly connected to a global wind: for beta_0>10^3, the\nlarge-scale field has no permanent bending direction due to dynamo activities,\nwhile for beta_0<10^3, the outflows from the top and bottom sides of the disk\nbend towards opposite directions, inconsistent with a physical disk wind\ngeometry.

Here, however, we explore the possibility of\nSMBH gravitational waves to leak to higher frequencies.

In\norder to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literature\nsearch for papers reporting the parameters of the soft X-ray warm absorbers\n(WAs) in 35 type 1 Seyferts and compared their properties to those of the\nultra-fast outflows (UFOs) detected in the same sample. The fraction of sources\nwith WAs is >60%, consistent with previous studies. The fraction of sources\nwith UFOs is >34%, >67% of which also show WAs. The large dynamic range\nobtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the first\ntime, to investigate general relations among them.

Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic\nbackground this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as\nthe Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of\nthe pulsars. If the background is anisotropic, the cross-correlation is\ndifferent, but predictable, and also depends on the absolute position of the\npulsars. By simulating datasets containing GWBs with various anisotropic\nconfigurations, we have explored the prospects for constraining anisotropy\nusing near future data. We find that at moderate to high signal to noise ratio\nthe assumption of isotropy is no longer an appropriate description of the\nsimulated background. Furthermore, we can recover the nature of the injected\nanisotropy in a Bayesian parameter-estimation search, and propose a prior on\nthe anisotropy search-space motivated by the physicality of the implied\ndistribution of sources. \n\n"}

Their persistent X-ray\nluminosity, as well as the bursts and flares typical of these sources, are\ninstead believed to be powered by the decay of their ultrastrong magnetic\nfield. SGRs/AXPs typically have a larger X-ray luminosity that can not be\nexplained by their spin-down luminosity ($L_X>\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}$), unlike\nrotation-powered pulsars.

Their properties\nsuggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to\nunderstand and study these events, more examples need to be found. Fortunately,\nthe recent boom in radio astronomy means many 'next-generation' radio\ntelescopes are set to begin observing in the near future. In this paper we\ndiscuss the prospects of detecting short extragalactic bursts, in both\nbeamformed and imaging data, using these instruments. We find that often the\nvolume of space probed by radio surveys of fast transients is limited by the\ndispersion measure (DM) of the source, rather than its physical distance\n(although the two quantities are related). This effect is larger for\nlow-frequency telescopes, where propagation effects are more prominent, but,\ntheir larger fields-of-view are often enough to compensate for this. Our\nsimulations suggest that the low-frequency component of SKA1 could find an\nextragalactic burst every hour.

Serendipitous ALMA observations of a strong\n  gamma-ray flare Abstract: The launching mechanism of the jets of active galactic nuclei is\nobservationally poorly constrained, due to the large distances to these objects\nand the very small scales (sub-parsec) involved. In order to better constrain\ntheoretical models, it is especially important to get information from the\nregion close to the physical base of the jet, where the plasma acceleration\ntakes place. In this paper, we report multi-epoch and multi-frequency continuum\nobservations of the z=2.5 blazar PKS1830-211 with ALMA, serendipitously\ncoincident with a strong $\\gamma$-ray flare reported by Fermi-LAT. The blazar\nis lensed by a foreground z=0.89 galaxy, with two bright images of the compact\ncore separated by 1\". Our ALMA observations individually resolve these two\nimages (although not any of their substructures), and we study the change of\ntheir relative flux ratio with time (four epochs spread over nearly three times\nthe time delay between the two lensed images) and frequency (between 350 and\n1050 GHz, rest-frame of the blazar), during the $\\gamma$-ray flare. In\nparticular, we detect a remarkable frequency-dependent behaviour of the flux\nratio, which implies the presence of a chromatic structure in the blazar (i.e.,\na core-shift effect).

We study nucleosynthesis in the\noutflows launched from these disks by using an adiabatic, spherically expanding\noutflow model, to understand which of these elements thus synthesized in the\ndisk survive in the outflow.

Depending on\nthe structure of the stellar progenitor, each of these instabilities can\ndominate the evolution of the gain region prior to the onset of explosion, with\nimplications for the ensuing asymmetries. Here we examine the flow dynamics in\nthe neighborhood of explosion by means of parametric two-dimensional,\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic simulations for which the linear stability\nproperties are well understood. We find that systems for which the convection\nparameter is sub-critical (SASI-dominated) develop explosions once large-scale,\nhigh-entropy bubbles are able to survive for several SASI oscillation cycles.\nThese long-lived structures are seeded by the SASI during shock expansions.\nFinite-amplitude initial perturbations do not alter this outcome qualitatively,\nthough they can lead to significant differences in explosion times.\nSupercritical systems (convection-dominated) also explode by developing\nlarge-scale bubbles, though the formation of these structures is due to buoyant\nactivity.

However, Swift\nobservations suggest that many GRBs have extended central engine activities\nmanifested as flares and internal plateaus in X-rays. We perform a\ncomprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs with XRT observations to\ninvestigate GRB central engine activity duration and to determine whether\nultra-long GRBs are unusual events. We define burst duration t_burst based on\nboth gamma-ray and X-ray light curves rather than using gamma-ray observations\nalone. We find that t_burst can be reliably measured in 343 GRBs. Within this\n\"good\" sample, 21.9% GRBs have t_burst >=10^3 s and 11.5% GRBs have t_burst\n>=10^4 s. There is an apparent bimodal distribution of t_burst in this sample.\nHowever, when we consider an \"undetermined\" sample (304 GRBs) with t_burst\npossibly falling in the gap between GRB duration T_90 and the first X-ray\nobservational time, as well as a selection effect against t_burst falling into\nthe first Swift orbital \"dead zone\" due to observation constraints, the\nintrinsic underlying t_burst distribution is consistent with being a single\ncomponent distribution. We found that the existing evidence for a separate\nultra-long GRB population is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength\nobservations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion. We also discuss the\ntheoretical implications of our results. In particular, the central engine\nactivity duration of GRBs is generally much longer than the gamma-ray T90\nduration and it does not even correlate with T90.

The high\nratio of the early optical to late radio flux requires that the ambient medium\nis a wind and that the forward-shock synchrotron spectrum peaks in the optical\nat about 10 ks.

Such a\npossibility has often been put forward in the past. We developed a Monte Carlo\nGalactic propagation code for ~MeV positrons in which the Galactic interstellar\nmedium, the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and the propagation are finely\ndescribed. This code allows us to simulate the spatial distribution of the 511\nkeV annihilation emission. We test several GMFs models and several positron\nescape fractions from type-Ia supernova for 56Ni positrons. We consider the\ncollisional ballistic transport mode and then compare the simulated 511 keV\nintensity spatial distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI data. Whatever the GMF\nconfiguration and the escape fraction chosen for 56Ni positrons, the 511 keV\nintensity distributions are very similar. The main reason is that ~MeV\npositrons do not propagate very far away from their birth sites in our model.\nThe direct comparison to the data does not allow us to constrain the GMF\nconfiguration and the escape fraction for 56Ni positrons. In any case,\nnucleosynthesis positrons produced in steady state cannot explain the full\nannihilation emission. The comparison to the data shows that: (a) the\nannihilation emission from the Galactic disk can be accounted for; (b) the\nstrongly peaked annihilation emission from the inner Galactic bulge can be\nexplained by positrons annihilating in the central molecular zone but this\nseems to require more positron sources than the population of massive stars and\ntype Ia supernovae usually assumed for this region; (c) the more extended\nemission from the Galactic bulge cannot be explained.

In this sense, the behaviour of an ISCO\naround a rotating oblate neutron star is formed by the interplay between\nrelativistic and Newtonian effects. Here we briefly explore the consequences of\nthis interplay using a straightforward analytic approach as well as numerical\nmodels that involve modern NS equations of state. We examine the ratio K\nbetween the ISCO radius and the radius of the neutron star. We find that, with\ngrowing NS spin, the ratio K first decreases, but then starts to increase. This\nnon-monotonic behaviour of K can give rise to a neutron star spin interval in\nwhich ISCO appears for two very different ranges of NS mass. This may strongly\naffect the distribution of neutron stars that have an ISCO (ISCO-NS). When\n(all) neutron stars are distributed around a high mass M0, the ISCO-NS spin\ndistribution is roughly the same as the spin distribution corresponding to all\nneutron stars. In contrast, if M0 is low, the ISCO-NS distribution can only\nhave a peak around a high value of spin. Finally, an intermediate value of M0\ncan imply an ISCO-NS distribution divided into two distinct groups of slow and\nfast rotators. Our findings have immediate astrophysical applications.

In this work, we simulate accretion flows having\ninjection parameters from the inviscid shock parameter space, and study the\nresponse of viscosity on them.

As a result, the in falling matter inside the post-shock region\nexhibits quasi-periodic variations and causes periodic ejection of matter from\nthe inner disc as outflows.

The cluster is a highly massive, strong cool core\ncluster. We find that the ICM entropy around the quasar is significantly lower\nthan that of other similarly massive strong cool core clusters within the\ncentral 80 kpc, and that the entropy lies significantly below the extrapolated\nbaseline entropy profile from hierarchical structure formation. By comparing\nthe scaled temperature profile with those of other strong cool core clusters of\nsimilar total mass, we see that the entropy deficiency is due to the central\ntemperature being significantly lower. This suggests that the presence of the\nquasar in the core of H1821+643 has had a dramatic cooling effect on the\nintracluster medium around it. We find that, if the quasar was brighter in the\npast, Compton cooling by radiation from the quasar may have caused the low\nentropy and temperature levels in the ICM around the quasar.

We performed exploratory high-resolution simulations of cold fronts\narising from subsonic gas sloshing in cluster cores using the grid-based Athena\nMHD code, comparing the effects of isotropic Spitzer and anisotropic Braginskii\nviscosity (expected in a magnetized plasma). Magnetized simulations with full\nBraginskii viscosity or isotropic Spitzer viscosity reduced by a factor f ~ 0.1\nare both in qualitative agreement with observations in terms of suppressing K-H\ninstabilities.

Particle Energy Spectra and Acceleration Mechanism Abstract: Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies in low Mach number (M<5) shocks\nis revealed by radio and X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and solar\nflares, but the electron acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood.\nDiffusive shock acceleration, also known as first-order Fermi acceleration,\ncannot be directly invoked to explain the acceleration of electrons. Rather, an\nadditional mechanism is required to pre-accelerate the electrons from thermal\nto supra-thermal energies, so they can then participate in the Fermi process.\nIn this work, we use two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma\nsimulations to study electron acceleration in low Mach number shocks. We focus\non the particle energy spectra and the acceleration mechanism in a reference\nrun with M=3 and a quasi-perpendicular pre-shock magnetic field. We find that\nabout 15 percent of the electrons can be efficiently accelerated, forming a\nnon-thermal power-law tail in the energy spectrum with a slope of p~2.4.\nInitially, thermal electrons are energized at the shock front via shock drift\nacceleration. The accelerated electrons are then reflected back upstream, where\ntheir interaction with the incoming flow generates magnetic waves. In turn, the\nwaves scatter the electrons propagating upstream back toward the shock, for\nfurther energization via shock drift acceleration. In summary, the\nself-generated waves allow for repeated cycles of shock drift acceleration,\nsimilarly to a sustained Fermi-like process. This mechanism offers a natural\nsolution to the conflict between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed\nfrom the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration\nefficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks. \n\n"}

However, their\nrest-frame 2 keV luminosities are 14 to >330 times weaker than expected for\ntypical quasars. Our results from a pilot NuSTAR study of two low-redshift BAL\nquasars, a Chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift BAL quasars,\nand a NuSTAR spectral analysis of the local BAL quasar Mrk 231 have already\nsuggested the existence of intrinsically X-ray weak BAL quasars, i.e., quasars\nnot emitting X-rays at the level expected from their optical/UV emission. The\naim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinary\nobjects. Three of the six new targets are weakly detected by NuSTAR with <45\ncounts in the 3-24 keV band, and the other three are not detected. The hard\nX-ray (8-24 keV) weakness observed by NuSTAR requires Compton-thick absorption\nif these objects have nominal underlying X-ray emission. However, a soft\nstacked effective photon index ({\\Gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavors\nCompton-thick absorption in general.

The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data.

However, very little is known about the\ndevelopment of the instability and whether its nonlinear time evolution accords\nto the linear intuition. For the first time, we attack this problem by studying\nthe impact of gravitational-wave emission and gas accretion on the evolution of\nthe instability. Our quasi-adiabatic, fully-relativistic analysis shows that:\n(i) gravitational-wave emission does not have a significant effect on the\nevolution of the black hole, (ii) accretion plays an important role and (iii)\nalthough the mass of the scalar cloud developed through superradiance can be a\nsizeable fraction of the black-hole mass, its energy-density is very low and\nbackreaction is negligible. Thus, massive black holes are well described by the\nKerr geometry even if they develop bosonic clouds through superradiance.

The first, detailed analysis of the peculiar behavior of the\nunique, Blazhko RRd stars is given. While the P1/P0 period ratio is normal, and\nthe overtone mode is dominant in the other RRd stars of the cluster, the period\nratio is anomalous and the fundamental mode has a larger (or similar) mean\namplitude than the overtone has in Blazhko RRd stars. The modulations of the\nfundamental and overtone modes are synchronized only in one of the Blazhko RRd\nstars.

Previously it has been shown\nthat conversion of this primordially-generated background of relativistic\nALPs---a cosmic ALP background (CAB)---can explain the observed soft X-ray\nexcess in both the centre and the outskirts of the Coma cluster. Here we extend\nthis work to the three clusters A665, A2199 and A2255. We use a stochastic\nmodel of the cluster magnetic field to numerically calculate ALP-photon\nconversion probabilities to predict the CAB-generated soft X-ray flux in these\nclusters. We compare this flux to ROSAT PSPC observations of the three\nclusters, and use these observations to constrain the CAB parameter space. We\nfind the CAB can reproduce the magnitude of the observed excess in A2199 and\nA2255 for the same CAB parameters that match the observed soft excess in the\nComa cluster. We also find good fit to the morphology of the excesses in these\nclusters. Simulation of CAB conversion in the cluster A665 is in mild tension\nwith the other clusters due to producing a small but observable excess at large\nradii where none is observed. This tension is alleviated considering the\nuncertainty on predicting the count rate in the ROSAT detector, and on the\nsystematics affecting the magnetic field determination.

No published model with a single lens can account\nfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system.

Two large gamma-ray\nflares of PKS 1830-211 have been detected by the LAT in the considered period\nand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. This allows\nus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between the\ntwo lensed images.

For this aim, we make use of a three dimensional\nGRMHD simulation of hot accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. The\nsimulation is designed so that the magnetic flux is not accumulated\nsignificantly around the black hole. To distinguish real wind from turbulent\noutflows, we track the trajectories of the virtual Largrangian particles from\nsimulation data. We find two types of real outflows, i.e., a quasi-relativistic\njet close to the axis and a sub-relativistic wind subtending a much larger\nsolid angle. Most of the wind originates from the surface layer of the\naccretion flow. The poloidal wind speed almost remains constant once they are\nproduced, but the flux-weighted wind speed roughly follows $v_{\\rm p,\nwind}(r)\\approx 0.25 v_k(r)$. The mass flux of jet is much lower but the speed\nis much higher, $v_{\\rm p,jet}\\sim (0.3-0.4) c$.

All of these stars have infrared (IR) excesses\nthat are consistent with their having inner disk walls near the Keplerian\nco-rotation radius. The repeating photometric dips have FWHM generally less\nthan one day, depths almost always less than 15%, and periods (3<P<11 days)\nconsistent with dust near the Keplerian co-rotation period. The flux dips vary\nconsiderably in their depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist for\nseveral weeks and, in two cases, were present in data collected on successive\nyears. For several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotation\nperiod and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted by\nstandard \"disk-locking\" models.

These relativistic electrons should also emit X-rays through\ninverse-Compton scattering off of cosmic microwave background photons. The\ndetection of such a non-thermal X-ray component, together with the radio\nmeasurement, would permit to clearly separate the magnetic field from the\nrelativistic electron distribution as the inverse-Compton emission is\nindependent from the magnetic field in the cluster. However, non-thermal X-rays\nhave not been conclusively detected from any cluster of galaxies so far.

The structure\nof the outer disk may be altered due to the presence of X-ray irradiation and\nwe discuss the physical regimes where this may occur and point out certain\nX-ray binaries where this effect may be important. The long term X-ray\nvariability of these sources is believed to be due to stochastic fluctuations\nin the outer disk, which propagate inwards giving rise to accretion rate\nvariation in the X-ray producing inner regions. The X-ray variability will\ninduce structural variations in the outer disk which in turn may affect the\ninner accretion rate.

Current investigations concentrate on\nfinding possible mechanisms to inhibit accretion in SFXTs and explain their\nunusually low average X-ray luminosity.

Since N-body simulations are\ncomputationally expensive, it is common to use faster methods that approximate\nthe dark matter field as a set of halos. In this approximation, we replace mass\nconcentrations in N-body simulations by a spherically symmetric\nNavarro-Frenk-White halo density profile. We also consider the full mass field\nas the sum of two distinct fields: dark matter halos ($M>9\\times\n10^{12}~M_{\\odot}$/h) and particles not included into halos. Mock halos\nreproduce well the matter power spectrum, but underestimate the lensing power\nspectrum on large and small scales. For sources at $z_{\\rm s}=1$ the lensing\npower spectrum is underestimated by up to 40% at $\\ell\\approx 10^4$ with\nrespect to the simulated halos. The large scale effect can be alleviated by\ncombining the mock catalogue with the dark matter distribution outside the\nhalos. In addition, to evaluate the contribution of substructures we have\nsmeared out the intra-halo substructures in a N-body simulation while keeping\nthe halo density profiles unchanged.

We also aim to assess deviations from the linearity of galaxy bias\nindependently from a previously performed analysis of our survey (Di Porto et\nal. 2014).

In this framework, deaths are driven by common latent stochastic\nrisk factors which may be interpreted as death causes like neoplasms,\ncirculatory diseases or idiosyncratic components. These common factors\nintroduce dependence between policyholders in annuity portfolios or between\ndeath events in population. This framework can be used to construct life tables\nbased on mortality rate forecast. Moreover this framework allows stress testing\nand, therefore, offers insight into how certain health scenarios influence\nannuity payments of an insurer. Such scenarios may include improvement in\nhealth treatments or better medication. In this paper, using publicly available\ndata for Australia, we estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo method\nto identify leading death causes across all age groups including long term\nforecast for 2031 and 2051. On top of general reduced mortality, the proportion\nof deaths for certain certain causes has changed massively over the period 1987\nto 2011. Our model forecasts suggest that if these trends persist, then the\nfuture gives a whole new picture of mortality for people aged above 40 years.\nNeoplasms will become the overall number-one death cause. Moreover, deaths due\nto mental and behavioural disorders are very likely to surge whilst deaths due\nto circulatory diseases will tend to decrease. This potential increase in\ndeaths due to mental and behavioural disorders for older ages will have a\nmassive impact on social systems as, typically, such patients need long-term\ngeriatric care. \n\n"}

The sample consists of nearly 340 sources with\neither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.\nThe combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminosity\nbaseline of three orders of magnitude, Lx(2-10keV)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z>3.

We demonstrate that the latter is essential for\nunbiased measurement of space densities. We find that the AGN X-ray luminosity\nfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. There\nis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity\ndependent. The space density of AGN with Lx<1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5\nbetween the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN\nappears to be milder. Comparison of our X-ray luminosity function with that of\nUV/optical selected QSOs at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at bright\nluminosities, Lx>1e45erg/s. The faint-end slope of UV/optical luminosity\nfunctions however, is steeper than for X-ray selected AGN.

Our\nsimulations, in contrast, exhibit a stronger relationship, and show that\nprevious work was box-size limited: turbulent `eddies' were artificially\nrestricted by the numerical domain rather than by the scale height.\nZero-net-flux runs without physical diffusion coefficients yield a stress\nproportional to $P^{0.5}$, where P is pressure.

Without reference to any\nspecific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is\nthat it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members\ndue to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties.

The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of\ngiant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth\nrates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk\naccretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with\nthe rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the\noutside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.\nOur model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole\nfor a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of\nour solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a\nfew or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture\nbecause of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient\nsolid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially\n$\\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition.

A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path\nwhere type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly. In\nparticular, we also show that the type II migration of Jupiter-size planets\nbecomes inefficient because of the additional gas depletion due to the rapid\ngas capture by themselves. \n\n"}

Abstract: Singleton et al (2009) have argued that the flux of pulsars measured at 1400\nMHz shows an apparent violation of the inverse-square law with distance ($r$),\nand it is consistent with $1/r$ scaling. They deduced this from the fact that\nthe convergence error obtained in reconstructing the luminosity function of\npulsars using an iterative maximum likelihood procedure is about $10^5$ times\nlarger for a distance exponent of two (corresponding to the inverse-square law)\ncompared to an exponent of one. When we applied the same technique to this\npulsar dataset with two different values for the trial luminosity function in\nthe zeroth iteration, we find that neither of them can reproduce a value of\n$10^5$ for the ratio of the convergence error between these distance exponents.\nWe then reconstruct the differential pulsar luminosity function using\nLynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method after positing both an inverse-linear and an\ninverse-square scalings with distance.

Finally, when we tried to estimate the\npower law exponent with a Bayesian regression procedure, we do not get a\nbest-fit value of one for the distance exponent.

These relations become\nexact for stationary black holes in General Relativity as shown by the no-hair\ntheorems. In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the\napproximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars\nbecome black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible\nstars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium\nsequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit\narbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing\nsuch a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations. We find\nthat the I-Love-Q relations approach the black hole limit in a nontrivial way,\nwith the quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability changing sign as the\ncompactness and the amount of anisotropy are increased. Generalizing Maclaurin\nspheroids to anisotropic stars, we show that the multipole moments also change\nsign in the Newtonian limit as the amount of anisotropy is increased.

More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as the potential signature of an\nextragalactic cataclysmic radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs.\nClusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo\n327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327).

The new\npulsars have DMs in the range $23.6 - 133.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the\nrange $1.249 - 5.012$ s, and include two nullers and a mode-switching object.\nWe estimate an upper limit on the all-sky FRB rate of $10^5$ day$^{-1}$ for\nbursts with a width of 10 ms and flux density $\\gtrsim 83$ mJy. The DMs of all\nnew discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin.

On the one hand, a backtesting procedure is\ndesirable for assessing the accuracy of such an estimation and this can be\nnaturally achieved by elicitable risk measures. For the same objective, an\nalternative approach has been introduced by Davis (2016) through the so-called\nconsistency property.

A new risk measure, the Lambda value at risk (Lambda\nVaR), has been recently proposed by Frittelli et al.

We find that, somewhat surprisingly, building the tree from more\nsnapshots does not generally produce more complete trees; instead, it tends to\nshort- en them. Significant improvements are seen for patching schemes which\nattempt to bridge over occasional dropouts in the underlying halo catalogues or\nschemes which combine the halo-finding and tree-building steps seamlessly.

In fact, the spreading and\namplification of financial distress in capital markets is strongly affected by\nthe interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the aggregate\nbalance sheets of institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single\npositions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches\nto reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically\ndense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover,\nreconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of\nbilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing\nbipartite networks of security holdings (\\eg, investment portfolios).

The active region emergence was detected in deep layers of\nthe convection zone about 12 hours before the first bipolar magnetic structure\nappeared on the surface, and 2 days before the emergence of most of the\nmagnetic flux. The speed of emergence determined by tracking the flow\ndivergence with depth is about 1.4 km/s, very close to the emergence speed in\nthe deep layers. As the emerging magnetic flux becomes concentrated in sunspots\nlocal converging flows are observed beneath the forming sunspots. These flows\nare most prominent in the depth range 1-3 Mm, and remain converging after the\nformation process is completed. On the larger scale converging flows around\nactive region appear as a diversion of the zonal shearing flows towards the\nactive region, accompanied by formation of a large-scale vortex structure. This\nprocess occurs when a substantial amount of the magnetic flux emerged on the\nsurface, and the converging flow pattern remains stable during the following\nevolution of the active region.

Despite its theoretical appeal, the\nimplementation of a convex risk function remains difficult, as there is little\nguidance regarding how a convex risk function should be chosen so that it also\nwell represents one's own risk preferences. In this paper, we address this\nissue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution\ndata from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an\ninverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the\nsolutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable.

This paper attempts to reconcile some apparently\ndifferent views emerged after the 2008 crisis regarding the nature and the\nrelevance of contagion in financial networks. We develop a common framework\nencompassing several network contagion models and show that, regardless of the\nshock distribution and the network topology, precise ordering relationships on\nthe level of aggregate systemic losses hold among models. We argue that the\nextent of contagion crucially depends on the amount of information that each\nmodel assumes to be available to market players. Under no uncertainty about the\nnetwork structure and values of external assets, the well-known Eisenberg and\nNoe (2001) model applies, which delivers the lowest level of contagion. This is\ndue to a property of loss conservation: aggregate losses after contagion are\nequal to the losses incurred by those institutions initially hit by a shock.\nThis property implies that many contagion analyses rule out by construction any\nloss amplification, treating de facto an interconnected system as a single\naggregate entity, where losses are simply mutualised. Under higher levels of\nuncertainty, as captured for instance by the DebtRank model, losses become\nnon-conservative and get compounded through the network. This has important\npolicy implications: by reducing the levels of uncertainty in times of distress\n(e.g. by obtaining specific data on the network) policymakers would be able to\nmove towards more conservative scenarios. Empirically, we compare the magnitude\nof contagion across models on a sample of the largest European banks during the\nyears 2006-2016.

We recover them with the\nBayesWave (BW) pipeline to study its accuracy in sky localization, waveform\nreconstruction, and estimation of model-independent waveform parameters. BW\nlocalizes sources with a level of accuracy comparable for all four\nmorphologies, with the median separation of actual and estimated sky locations\nranging from 25.1$^{\\circ}$ to 30.3$^{\\circ}$. This is a reasonable accuracy in\nthe two-detector case, and is comparable to accuracies of other localization\nmethods studied previously. As BW reconstructs generic transient signals with\nsine-Gaussian wavelets, it is unsurprising that BW performs the best in\nreconstructing sine-Gaussian and Gaussian waveforms.

The distinctive spectral states are not strongly\nrelated to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use\nexhaustive photoionization modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud\nproperties that yield (e.g.) a He-overbright state where a large\nHeII(4686A)/H$\\alpha$ line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment.\nAlthough observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like\nillumination can not reproduce the observed equivalent widths.

The\nX-ray (0.3-10 keV) spectra are well fitted by a thermally Comptonized primary\ncontinuum with two (blurred and distant) reflection components and an optically\nthick, warm Comptonization component for the soft X-ray excess emission below\n~2 keV. During the first and third observations, the fractional X-ray\nvariability amplitude decreases with energy while for second and fourth\nobservations, X-ray variability spectra are found to be inverted-crescent and\ncrescent shaped respectively.

The\ndata reveal high gas and dust temperatures (T > 100 K) extending out to about\n5000 AU from each of these sources.

If the number of\nparticles starting acceleration was varying during early times after the\nsupernova explosion then this variation should be reflected in the shape of the\ngamma-ray spectrum. We use the solution of the non-stationary equation for\nparticle acceleration in order to analyze this effect. As a test case, we apply\nour method to describe gamma-rays from IC443. As a proxy of the IC443 parent\nsupernova we consider SN1987A. First, we infer the time dependence of injection\nefficiency from evolution of the radio spectral index in SN1987A. Then, we use\nthe inferred injection behavior to fit the gamma-ray spectrum of IC443. We show\nthat the break in the proton spectrum needed to explain the gamma-ray emission\nis a natural consequence of the early variation of the cosmic ray injection,\nand that the very-high energy gamma-rays originate from particles which began\nacceleration during the first months after the supernova explosion. We conclude\nthat the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum observed today in SNRs critically\ndepends on the time variation of the cosmic ray injection process in the\nimmediate post explosion phases.

The inconsistency suggests that the free escape boundary adopted\nin the escaping model is not a good approximation, which challenges our\nunderstanding of cosmic ray (CR) escaping in SNRs. In addition, we show that\nambient CRs is potentially important for the $\\gamma$-ray emission of\nilluminated MCs external to W28 and W44. In direct interaction scenario, the\nmodel involving re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs and adiabatic compression\nis able to explain the emission from most SNRs.

Widespread circular polarisation Abstract: We analyse the circular polarisation data accumulated in the first 7 years of\nthe POLAMI project introduced in an accompanying paper (Agudo et al.). In the\n3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one\nof our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most\nsources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is\nbroader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)\ncircular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about\none year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the\nsignal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the\nsign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,\nincluding 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees\nof circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We\ndo find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in\nsynchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel\nmethod for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations. \n\n"}

However,\nit is still unclear which astrophysical site between core-collapse supernovae\nand neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process\nelements in the universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test\nthese scenarios by quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce\nthe amount of europium (Eu) observed in galaxies. Although NS-NS mergers have\nbecome popular candidates, their required frequency (or rate) needs to be\nconsistent with that obtained from gravitational wave measurements. Here we\naddress the first NS-NS merger detected by LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its\nassociated Gamma-ray burst and analyze their implication on the origin of\nr-process elements. The range of NS-NS merger rate densities of 320-4740\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ provided by LIGO/Virgo is remarkably consistent with the\nrange required by GCE to explain the Eu abundances in the Milky Way with NS-NS\nmergers, assuming the solar r-process abundance pattern for the ejecta.

Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising\nsources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger\nresults because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this\nwork, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the\nsources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear\ncomposition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the\nnuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the\nmass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the\nconnection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider\nthe hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR\nnuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is\neasier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically\npropagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models\nand compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results\nshow that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the\nAuger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in\nfitting the spectrum. We argue that our model is consistent with the newly\nreported cross correlation between the UHECRs and starburst galaxies, since\nboth LL GRBs and hypernovae are expected to be tracers of the star-formation\nactivity. LL GRBs have also been suggested as the dominant origin of IceCube\nneutrinos in the PeV range, and the LL GRB origin of UHECRs can be critically\ntested by near-future multimessenger observations. \n\n"}

Our results confirm the earlier\ntheoretical predictions of how the efficiency of injection depends on the shock\nMach number $M.$ Its increase with the charge-to-mass ratio saturates at a\nlevel that grows with $M.$ We have convolved the time-dependent injection rates\nof protons and helium ions, obtained from the simulations, with a decreasing\nshock strength over the active life of SNRs. The integrated SNR rigidity\nspectrum for $p$/He ratio compares well with the AMS-02 and PAMELA data. \n\n"}

Gravitational waves (GWs) from\ntheir mergers with other IMBHs or with stellar BHs in the cluster are mostly\nemitted in frequencies <10 Hz, which unfortunately is out of reach for current\nground-based observatories such as advanced LIGO (aLIGO). Nevertheless, we show\nthat aLIGO measurements can be used to efficiently probe one of the possible\nformation mechanisms of IMBHs in GCs, namely a runaway merger process of\nstellar seed BHs. In this case, aLIGO will be sensitive to the lower-mass rungs\nof the merger ladder, ranging from the seed BH mass to masses >~50-300 Msun,\nwhere the background from standard mergers is expected to be very low. Assuming\nthis generic IMBH formation scenario, we calculate the mass functions that\ncorrespond to the limiting cases of possible merger trees. Based on estimates\nfor the number density of GCs and taking into account the instrumental\nsensitivity, we show that current observations do not effectively limit the\noccupation fraction f_occ of IMBHs formed by runaway mergers of stellar BHs in\nGCs. However, we find that a six-year run of aLIGO at design sensitivity will\nbe able to probe down to f_occ<3% at a 99.9% confidence level, either finding\nevidence for this formation mechanism, or necessitating others if the fraction\nof GCs that harbor IMBHs is higher. \n\n"}

Approximately after half of the\nlight curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nlag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is\naccompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to\nunderstand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby\nincreasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet\ncontinua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet\nvariations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling\ncorona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational\nfacts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and\nionization energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the\nX-ray and the ultraviolet variations change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous\nbehavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the expectation from disk\nreprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the\nanomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk\nreprocessing albeit with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time\nlag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing of the broad line region gas.\nAs NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad line\nregion gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing.

In the non-shadowed\nregion, our measurements are consistent with the bulk propagation ray-bending\nmode both in timing and in amplitude.

Bright optical transient emission can\nbe produced by the ejecta due to heating by radioactivities and particularly by\nenergy injection from the NS.

The hydrodynamic\nsimulations use a nested grid method to follow the evolution of explosive\nmulti-SN events operating on the characteristic timescale of a few x 10^7 yr,\nthe lifetime of massive stars. The results confirm that, if the star formation\nefficiency of subgalactic halos is close to 10%, a significant fraction of the\nhalo gas will be lifted out of the potential well (`blow-away'), shock the\nintergalactic medium, and pollute it with metal-enriched material, a scenario\nrecently advocated by Madau, Ferrara & Rees (2001). The volume filling factor\nof the ejecta is close to unity. Depending on the stellar distribution, we find\nthat less than 30% of the available SN energy is converted into kinetic energy\nof the blown away material, the remainder being radiated away. It appears that\nmechanical feedback is less efficient than expected from simple energetic\narguments, as off-nuclear SN explosions drive inward-propagating shocks that\ntend to collect and pile up cold gas in the central regions of the host halo.\nLow-mass galaxies at early epochs may survive multiple SN events and continue\nforming stars. \n\n"}

It is shown that the total force on this body can be separated into two\nindependent parts, one of which is the slowly varying influence of the\naggregate stellar system, and the other being the rapidly fluctuating\nstochastic force due to discrete encounters with individual stars. For the\nparticular example of a stellar system distributed according to a Plummer\nmodel, it is shown that the motion of the black hole is then similar to that of\na Brownian particle in a harmonic potential, and we analyze its dynamics using\nan approach akin to Langevin's solution of the Brownian motion problem. The\nequations are solved to obtain the average values, time-autocorrelation\nfunctions, and probability distributions of the black hole's position and\nvelocity. By comparing these results to N-body simulations, we demonstrate that\nthis model provides a very good statistical description of the actual black\nhole dynamics.

Predictions of Lyman-alpha forest\nabsorption are almost unaffected by changes of Omega_b provided that the UV\nbackground intensity is adjusted so that the mean opacity of the forest matches\nthe observed value. The required UV background intensity scales as Omega_b^1.7,\nand the higher photoionization rate increases the gas temperature in low\ndensity regions. Damped Lyman-alpha absorption and Lyman limit absorption both\nincrease with increasing Omega_b, though the impact is stronger for damped\nabsorption and is weaker at z=4 than at z=2-3. The mass of cold gas and stars\nin high-redshift galaxies increases faster than Omega_b but slower than\nOmega_b^2, and the global star formation rate scales approximately as\nOmega_b^1.5.

The most direct test of this hypothesis\nconsists in testing Gaussianity of the CMB maps.

Other usually more\ncomplex tests of Gaussianity generally use a great deal of the information\nalready contained in the probability function. However, the most interesting\noutcome of such a test would be the signal of non-Gaussianity independent of\nthe probability function. It is shown that the independent information has\npurely morphological character i.e. it depends on the geometry and topology of\nthe level contours only. As an example we discuss in detail the quadratic model\n$v=u+\\alpha (u^2-1)$ ($u$ is a Gaussian field with $\\bar{u}=0$ and $<u^2>=1$,\n$\\alpha$ is a parameter) which may arise in slow-roll or two-field inflation\nmodels.

In contrast with Sazonov, who infers strong effects only\nin cases where the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency is much\nlarger than the square of the characteristic electron Lorentz factor, nu_p/nu_B\n>> gamma^2, we find strong effects also for 1 << nu_p/nu_B << gamma^2.

Application of this spectral\nmodel to an ASCA \"long-look\" observation of NGC 4151 reveals a partial\ncorrelation between the underlying continuum flux and the ionization state of\nthe warm absorber. Such a correlation is an intrinsic property of a warm\nabsorber and argues strongly in favour of this interpretation for the complex\nabsorbing column over alternative partial covering models.

Starting with a slowly rotating white dwarf,\nwe simulate the accretion of matter and angular momentum from a quasi-Keplerian\naccretion disk. The role of the various rotationally induced hydrodynamic\ninstabilities for the transport of angular momentum inside the white dwarf is\ninvestigated. We find that the dynamical shear instability is the most\nimportant one in the highly degenerate core. Our results imply that accreting\nwhite dwarfs rotate differentially throughout,with a shear rate close to the\nthreshold value for the onset of the dynamical shear instability. As the latter\ndepends on the temperature of the white dwarf, the thermal evolution of the\nwhite dwarf core is found to be relevant for the angular momentum\nredistribution. As found previously, significant rotation is shown to lead to\ncarbon ignition masses well above 1.4 Msun. Our models suggest a wide range of\nwhite dwarf explosion masses, which could be responsible for some aspects of\nthe diversity observed in SNe Ia.

The two most promising explanations are that these 'outer edges'\neither trace the maximum angular momentum during the galaxy formation epoch, or\nare associated with global star formation thresholds.

We address this primary challenge for the\nhierarchical formation scenario for the stellar halo by combining chemical\nevolution modelling with cosmologically-motivated mass accretion histories for\nthe Milky Way dark halo and its satellites.

Abstract: The gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060218 has ~ 10^5 times lower luminosity than\ntypical long GRBs, and is associated with a supernova (SN). The radio afterglow\ndisplays no jet break, so that this burst might arise from a\nmildly-relativistic spherical outflow produced by the SN shock sweeping the\nstellar surface. Since this model is energetically difficult, we propose that\nthe radio afterglow is produced by a non-relativistic phase of an initially\ncollimated outflow (jet). Our jet model is supported by the detection of\noptical linear polarization in the SN component. We also show analytically that\nthe jet can penetrate a progenitor star. We analyzed the observational data of\nthe prompt emission of this burst and obtained a smooth power-law light curve\nwhich might last longer than 10^6s. This behavior contrasts with the long\nintermittent activities with the X-ray flares of typical GRBs, implying that\nthe central engine of this burst is different from those of typical GRBs. This\nargument is consistent with the analysis of the SN component of this burst,\nwhich suggests that the progenitor star was less massive and collapsed to a\nneutron star instead of a black hole. The collimation-corrected event rate of\nsuch low-luminosity GRBs is estimated to be ~ 10 times higher than that of\ntypical long GRBs, and they might form a different GRB population:\nlow-luminosity GRBs are produced by mildly-relativistic jets from neutron stars\nat the collapses of massive stars, while typical long GRBs by\nhighly-relativistic jets from black holes.

Boundary conditions (BC's)\nemploying regulatory branes or demanding that the bulk metric be nonsingular\nhave yet to be implemented in full generality. In this paper, we take a\ndifferent route and specify boundary conditions directly on the brane thereby\narriving at a local and closed system of equations (on the brane). We consider\na one-parameter family of boundary conditions involving the anisotropic stress\nof the projection of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane and derive an exact\nsystem of equations describing scalar cosmological perturbations on a generic\nbraneworld with induced gravity. Depending upon our choice of boundary\nconditions, perturbations on the brane either grow moderately (region of\nstability) or rapidly (instability). In the instability region, the evolution\nof perturbations usually depends upon the scale: small scale perturbations grow\nmuch more rapidly than those on larger scales. This instability is caused by a\npeculiar gravitational interaction between dark radiation and matter on the\nbrane. Generalizing the boundary conditions obtained by Koyama and Maartens, we\nfind for the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model an instability, which leads to a\ndramatic scale-dependence of the evolution of density perturbations in matter\nand dark radiation.

Instead of an event horizon, the\nholographic solution has a real spherical boundary membrane, situated roughly\ntwo Planck distances outside of the object's gravitational radius. The interior\nmatter-state is singularity free. It consists out of string type matter, which\nis densely packed. Each string has a transverse extension of exactly one Planck\narea. This dense package of strings might be the reason, why the solution does\nnot collapse to a singularity. The local string tension is inverse proportional\nto the average string length. This purely classical result has its almost exact\ncorrespondence in a recent result in string theory. The holographic solution\nsuggest, that string theory is relevant also on cosmological scales. The large\nscale phenomena in the universe can be explained naturally in a string context.\nDue to the zero active gravitational mass-density of the strings the Hubble\nconstant in a string dominated universe is related to its age by H t = 1.

Abstract: Here we explore a novel approach in order to try to measure the\npost-Newtonian 1/c^2 Lense-Thirring secular effect induced by the\ngravitomagnetic field of the Sun on the planetary orbital motion. Due to the\nrelative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the\nplanetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic precessions, which affect the\nnodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^3, are of the\norder of 10^-3 arcseconds per century only for, e.g., Mercury. This value lies\njust at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing\nthe planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and\nBepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main\nsources of systematic errors. They are the aliasing classical precessions\ninduced by the multipolar expansion of the Sun's gravitational potential and\nthe classical secular N-body precessions which are of the same order of\nmagnitude or much larger than the Lense-Thirring precessions of interest. This\ndefinitely rules out the possibility of analyzing only one orbital element of,\ne.g., Mercury. In order to circumvent these problems, we propose a suitable\nlinear combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes of Mercury, Venus and\nMars which is, by construction, independent of such classical secular\nprecessions. A 1-sigma reasonable estimate of the obtainable accuracy yields a\n36% error. Since the major role in the proposed combination is played by the\nMercury's node, it could happen that the new, more accurate ephemerides\navailable in future thanks to the Messenger and BepiColombo missions will offer\nan opportunity to improve the present unfavorable situation. \n\n"}

These oscillations are triggered by\nthe running of soft $({\\rm mass})^2$ stemming from the nonzero energy density\nof the Universe. However, this is quite different from the standard $\\rm\nQ$-ball formation. The running in presence of gauge and Yukawa couplings\nbecomes strong if $m_{1/2}/m_0$ is sufficiently large. Moreover, the $\\rm\nQ$-balls which are formed during the early oscillations constantly evolve, due\nto the redshift of the Hubble-induced soft mass, until the low-energy\nsupersymmtery breaking becomes dominant. For smaller $m_{1/2}/m_0$, $\\rm\nQ$-balls are not formed during early oscillations because of the shrinking of\nthe instability band due to the Hubble expansion. In this case the $\\rm\nQ$-balls are formed only at the weak scale, but typically carry smaller\ncharges, as a result of their amplitude redshift.
