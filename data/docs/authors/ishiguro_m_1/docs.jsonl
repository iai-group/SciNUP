Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum).

We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so\ncalled GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the\noptimization algorithm. Our searches reveal only small regions of stable\nmotions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations. Most\nlikely, if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range, they may be\nstable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion\nresonances (MMRs).

For 45\ntransiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths\nforward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semi-major axes\nand eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the\nnumber of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many\nas 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to\nbe viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation.\nThis is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism\nto explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have\nto be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on\nthe eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario we match the\nextremely large radius of WASP-12b. (Abridged) \n\n"}

In particular, the power of\nthe quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low, and the\nquadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of\nthe Solar system. It has been suggested in the literature that microwave sky\npollution by an unidentified dust cloud in the vicinity of the Solar system may\nbe the cause for these anomalies. In this paper, we simulate the thermal\nemission by clouds of spherical homogeneous particles of several materials.\nSpectral constraints from the WMAP multi-wavelength data and earlier infrared\nobservations on the hypothetical dust cloud are used to determine the dust\ncloud's physical characteristics. In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a\nflat, CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14\nmm), and to be invisible in the infrared light, its particles must be\nmacroscopic.

To do so, we assume that they\nretain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with\na third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is\nthen required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this\nadditional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass\nof a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass\n$M_{\\rm core}$ and the heating $\\dot{E}_{\\rm heating}$. Therefore, in the case\nof tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of the couple $\\{M_{\\rm\ncore},e^2/Q'_p\\}$ that can lead to the same radius, where $Q'_p$ is the tidal\ndissipation factor and $e$ is the eccentricity.

We investigate possible explanations that could\naccount for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has\nsuggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense\ninterstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column\ndensity from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this\npossibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,\nlow-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.\nThis mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a\ntypical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow\ndirection--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generated\nby these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology.\nFuture observational studies constraining the direction of the relative\ninterstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future\nmodeling.

Several formation scenarios have\nbeen proposed, where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core\naccretion with type I migration (e.g. Terquem & Papaloizou 2007) and planetary\natmosphere physics (e.g. Alibert et al. 2006).

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating.

We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc.

We show that the cylinder-shaped accretion stream\ncan have an area (projected in the plane of the sky) comparable to that of the\nplanet and a significant optical depth to spectral line absorption. Such a\n\"transiting cylinder\" may produce an earlier ingress of the planet transit, as\nsuggested by recent HST observations of the WASP-12 system.

In such configuration, the system loses the axisymmetry\npresented in the aligned case, requiring a fully 3D approach.

Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet.

We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping.

We suggest that the resulting\nearly ingress is caused by a bow shock ahead of the planetary orbital motion.\nIn this Letter we investigate the conditions that might lead to the formation\nof such a bow shock. We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the\nplanet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed\nand hence on the plasma temperature. For higher wind temperatures, the shock\nforms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star. We\nconclude that shock formation leading to an observable early UV ingress is\nlikely to be a common feature of transiting systems and may prove to be a\nuseful tool in setting limits on planetary magnetic field strengths Bp.

The\nfixed point is characterized by a lack of oscillations in the eccentricities\nand apsidal alignment among the orbits. Quantitatively, the nature of the fixed\npoint is dictated by mutual interactions among the planets as well as\nnon-Keplerian effects. We show that if a roughly coplanar system hosts a hot,\nsub-Saturn mass planet, and is tidally relaxed, separation of planet-planet\ninteractions and non-Keplerian effects in the equations of motion leads to a\ndirect determination of the true masses of the planets. Consequently, a\n\"snap-shot\" observational determination of the orbital state resolves the\nsin(I) degeneracy, and opens up a direct avenue towards identification of the\ntrue lowest-mass exo-planets detected.

We\nfind that when such constraints are imposed, the new anomaly term plays a quite\nsimilar role as the vector interaction does on the phase diagram, which the\npresent authors clarified in a previous work. Thus, there appear several types\nof phase structures with multiple critical points at low temperature $T$,\nalthough the phase diagrams with intermediate-$T$ critical point(s) are never\nrealized without these constraints even within the same model Lagrangian. This\ndrastic change is attributed to an enhanced interplay between the chiral and\ndiquark condensates due to the anomaly term at finite temperature; the u-d\ndiquark coupling is strengthened by the relatively large chiral condensate of\nthe strange quark through the anomaly term, which in turn definitely leads to\nthe abnormal behavior of the diquark condensate at finite $T$, inherent to the\nasymmetric quark matter.

We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar\nbroadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent\nalbedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to\nmid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes\nemphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the\nmid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at\nshort wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor\nin the south polar observation.

This can be difficult for instruments that do not feature a\ncalibration plan for such high precision measurements. Here, it is not always\nobvious how to de-correlate the data using auxiliary information of the\ninstrument and it becomes paramount to know how well one can disentangle\ninstrument systematics from one's data, given nothing but the data itself. We\npropose a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, based on the concept of\nindependent component analysis, to de-convolve the systematic noise and all\nnon-Gaussian signals from the desired astrophysical signal. Such a `blind'\nsignal de-mixing is commonly known as the `Cocktail Party problem' in\nsignal-processing. Given multiple simultaneous observations of the same\nexoplanetary eclipse, as in the case of spectrophotometry, we show that we can\noften disentangle systematic noise from the original light curve signal without\nthe use of any complementary information of the instrument.

Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited and\nstrong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical\nbehaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause\nsignificant asymmetries in dusty disks around solar type stars which might be\ndetected by observations. However, the amount of orbital changes due to this\nnon--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime\nof dust particles. We show that for large values of the disk's optical depth\nthe influence of ISM flow on the disk shape is almost negligible because the\ngrains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital\nchanges due to the ISM perturbations. On the other hand, for values smaller\nthan $10^{-3}$, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of\nthe disk when we consider 1-10 mum grains, just above the blow-out threshold.\nThe extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the\noptical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which may prevent the formation of\nlarge clumps and warping in the disks is related to the fast inward migration\ndue to the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is\npumped up by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson and in\nparticular ISM drag) drive the disk particles on fast migrating tracks leading\nthem into the star on a short timescale. It is then expected that disks with\nsmall optical depth expand inside the parent body ring all the way towards the\nstar while disks with large optical depth would not significantly extend\ninside. \n\n"}

Using theoretical\nmodels of planet formation, evolution and structure, we explore the range of\nminimum plausible masses for low-density exo-Neptunes. We focus on highly\nirradiated planets with T_eq>=500K. We consider two separate formation pathways\nfor low-mass planets with voluminous atmospheres of light gases: core nucleated\naccretion and outgassing of hydrogen from dissociated ices. We show that\nNeptune-size planets at T_eq=500K with masses as small as a few times that of\nEarth can plausibly be formed core nucleated accretion coupled with subsequent\ninward migration. We also derive a limiting low-density mass-radius relation\nfor rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes but no surface water. Rocky\nplanets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes typically have computed radii well\nbelow 3 R_Earth. For both planets with H/He envelopes from core nucleated\naccretion and planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes, we employ planet\ninterior models to map the range of planet mass--envelope mass--equilibrium\ntemperature parameter space that is consistent with Neptune-size planet radii.\nAtmospheric mass loss mediates which corners of this parameter space are\npopulated by actual planets and ultimately governs the minimum plausible mass\nat a specified transit radius.

Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days.

Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits.

This has important\nramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar\nsystem may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were\nsignificantly different from its current local galactic environment. To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find\nits median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained\nduring the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar\ndependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar\nencounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of\nmagnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that\nassumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material\ntrapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits can be extremely low and may present\ndifficulties for models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet\nproduction. \n\n"}

We then combine this model with three annealing laws to\nexamine how the dynamic evolution of amorphous grains would have led to their\nphysical restructuring and their delivery to various regions of the disk. It is\nfound that \"sibling particles\"-- those particles that reside at the same\nlocation at a given period of time--take a wide range of unique and independent\npaths through the disk to arrive there.

We\ncompute model density functions of close-in exoplanets in the orbital\nsemi-major axis - stellar mass plane to represent planet migration that is\nhalted via several mechanisms, including the interior 1:2 resonance with the\nmagnetospheric disk truncation radius, the interior 1:2 resonance with the dust\nsublimation radius, and several scenarios for tidal halting. The models differ\nin the predicted power law dependence of the exoplanet orbital semi-major axis\nas a function stellar mass, and thus we also include a power law model with the\nexponent as a free parameter. We use a Bayesian analysis to assess the model\nsuccess in reproducing empirical distributions of confirmed exoplanets and\nKepler candidates that orbit interior to 0.1 AU. Our results confirm a\ncorrelation of the halting distance with stellar mass. Tidal halting provides\nthe best fit to the empirical distribution of confirmed Jovian exoplanets at a\nstatistically robust level, consistent with the Kozai mechanism and the\nspin-orbit misalignment of a substantial fraction of hot Jupiters.

Originally targeted with adaptive optics\nbecause it showed a long-term radial velocity acceleration (trend), we have\nmonitored this star with precise Doppler measurements and have now established\na 24 year time baseline. The radial velocity variations show significant\ncurvature (change in the acceleration) including an inflection point. We have\nalso obtained a recent image of HR7672B with NIRC2 at Keck.

The mass of the host star is determined using a direct radius\nmeasurement from CHARA interferometry in combination with high resolution\nspectroscopic modeling.

Since metal-poor planets are less dense and have larger radii than\nmetal-rich planets of the same mass, one might expect that metal-poor stars\nhost a higher proportion of gas giants with large radii than metal-rich stars.\nHere I present evidence for a negative correlation at the 2.3-sigma level\nbetween eclipse depth and stellar metallicity in the Kepler gas giant\ncandidates. Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse\ndepth depends on star metallicity is 0.981. The correlation is consistent with\nplanets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison\nwith their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars.

We reexamine\nthis problem by considering porosity evolution of dust aggregates. We apply a\nporosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,\nwhich allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of\nimpact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and\ninstead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation\nhas been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of\na high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can\nevolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than\n0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show\nthat the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth.\nThis acceleration is a natural consequence of particles' aerodynamical property\nat low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path\nof the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates\nare found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10 AU\n(assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model).

We use a global\nclimate model to simulate the thermal phase variations of Earth-analogs and\ntest whether these data could distinguish between planets with different heat\nstorage and heat transport characteristics. In particular, we consider a\ntemperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state\nwhere the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the\nperiodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,\nand eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause\nvariations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates\nto these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk\nheat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water\noceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based\non thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and\natmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat\ntransport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as\nheat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.\nFor an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of\nsignals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high\nthermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with\nsmall phase lag. We then simulate thermal lightcurves as they would appear to a\nhigh-contrast imaging mission (TPF-I/Darwin) and consider the inverse problem\nof estimating thermal inertia based solely on time-resolved photometry.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

The process of disintegration\nculminated with an outburst on December 17.6 (T+1.6 d) and this delayed\nresponse is inconsistent with the rubble pile model. Probable cause was thermal\nstress from the heat pulse into the nucleus after perihelion, which could also\nproduce fragmentation of sungrazers far from the Sun. The spine tail was a\nsynchronic feature, made up of dust released at <30 m/s. Since the nucleus\nwould have been located on the synchrone, we computed the astrometric positions\nof the missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the\nspine tail's axis with lines of forced orbital-period variation, derived from\norbital solutions based on preperihelion astrometry from the ground. The\nresulting osculating orbital period was 698+/-2 years, which proves that C/2011\nW3 is the first major member of the predicted new, 21st-century cluster of\nbright Kreutz-system sungrazers. The spine tail's tip contained dust 1-2 mm in\ndiameter. The bizarre appearance of the dust tail in images taken hours after\nperihelion with coronagraphs on SOHO and STEREO is readily understood.

This separation yields simple analytical formulae. The\nphase of the TTV depends sensitively on the presence of free eccentricity: if\nthe free eccentricity vanishes, the TTV will be in phase with the longitude of\nconjunctions. This effect is easily detectable in current TTV data. The\namplitude of the TTV depends on planet mass and free eccentricity, and it\ndetermines planet mass uniquely only when the free eccentricity is sufficiently\nsmall. We proceed to analyze the TTV signals of six short period Kepler pairs.\nWe find that three of these pairs (Kepler-18,24,25) have TTV phase consistent\nwith zero. The other three (Kepler-23,28,32) have small TTV phases, but ones\nthat are distinctly non-zero. We deduce that the free eccentricities of the\nplanets are small, < 0.01, but not always vanishing.

The outcome of such collisions\ndepends on the collision speed, so we need a solid understanding of the rate\nand velocity distribution of turbulence-induced dust grain collisions. The rate\nof the collisions depends both on the speed of the collisions and the degree of\nclustering experienced by the dust grains, which is a known outcome of\nturbulence. We evolve the motion of dust grains in simulated turbulence, an\napproach that allows a large turbulent inertial range making it possible to\ninvestigate the effect of turbulence on meso-scale grains (millimeter and\ncentimeter).

In non-isothermal discs, recent work has\nshown that a decreasing radial profile of the disc entropy can lead to a strong\npositive corotation torque which can significantly slow down or reverse Type I\nmigration in laminar viscous disc models. It is not clear however how this\npicture changes in turbulent disc models. The aim of this study is to examine\nthe impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a low-mass planet\nembedded in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. We particularly focus on the\nrole of turbulence on the corotation torque whose amplitude depends on the\nefficiency of diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe region. We\nperformed 2D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in\nwhich turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing. In order to provide\nestimations for the viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients as a function of\nthe amplitude of turbulence, we first set up non-isothermal disc models for\ndifferent values of the amplitude of the turbulent forcing. We then include a\nlow-mass planet and determine the evolution of its running time-averaged\ntorque. We show that in non-isothermal discs, the entropy-related corotation\ntorque can indeed remain unsaturated in the presence of turbulence. For\nturbulence amplitudes that do not strongly affect the disc temperature profile,\nwe find that the running time-averaged torque experienced by an embedded\nprotoplanet is in fairly good agreement with laminar disc models with\nappropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients. In discs\nwith turbulence driven by stochastic forcing, the corotation torque therefore\nbehaves similarly as in laminar viscous discs and can be responsible for\nsignificantly slowing down or reversing Type I migration. \n\n"}

However,\nrecent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such\nclassification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some datasets\nhave also indicated non-solar abundances. In hot hydrogen-dominated\natmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of\nseveral spectroscopically dominant molecules. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar\nvalue) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of\nmagnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN\nand C2H2 become prominent for C/O >= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost\nunchanged. Furthermore, a C/O >= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due\nto TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally\nunder-abundant for C/O >= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new two-dimensional\nclassification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with\nirradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions.

We compute the\nformation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the\nsolid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,\nexciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We\ncompute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by\nforming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of\ngiant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their\nrandom velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.\nMoreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also\nlarger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of\ndisc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their\nsurvival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,\nrapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass\nplanets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas.

The shape and amplitude of the\nthermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the\natmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the\nsystem geometry by fitting a lightcurve model to the data covering the\noccultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6\nmicron and 4.5 micron are in good agreement with previous measurements and\nimply a very low albedo for WASP-18b. The parameters of the system (masses,\nradii, etc.) derived from our analysis are in also good agreement with those\nfrom previous studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution\nimaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean radial velocity\nto check for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect our\nresults. We find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution to\nthe flux at Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18.

It is debated\nwhether the typical hot Jupiter smoothly migrated inward from its formation\nlocation through the proto-planetary disk or was perturbed by another body onto\na highly eccentric orbit, which tidal dissipation subsequently shrank and\ncircularized during close stellar passages. Socrates and collaborators\npredicted that the latter class of model should produce a population of\nsuper-eccentric proto-hot Jupiters readily observable by Kepler.

Our results may indicate that disk migration is the dominant\nchannel for producing hot Jupiters with P > 3 days. Alternatively, the typical\nhot Jupiter may have been perturbed to a high eccentricity by interactions with\na planetary rather than stellar companion and began tidal circularization much\ninterior to 1 AU after multiple scatterings.

Transit detection\ndepends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host\nstar properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are\nsmaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more\nmetal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii\nproduce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous\nfinding, that highly-irradiated giant are more likely to have \"inflated\" radii,\nremains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit\ndepth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of\nany intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation\nbetween giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an\nartifact. \n\n"}

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence\ndriven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in\nterms of Q and the cooling time. Cooling times >~50*t_dyn may be required to\ncompletely suppress fragmentation. These gravoturbulent events produce mass\nspectra peaked near ~M_disk*(Q*M_disk/M_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,\nincreasing with distance from the star).

The\npresence of disk changes the nodal precession rates and directions of the\nplanet orbits. At the place where the two planets achieve the same nodal\nprocessing rate, vertical secular resonance would occur so that mutual\ninclination of the two planets will be excited, which might trigger the Kozai\nresonance between the two planets further. However, in order to pump an inner\nJupiter-like planet, the conditions required for the disk and the outer planet\nare relatively strict. We develop a set of evolution equations, which can fit\nthe N-body simulation quite well but be integrated within a much shorter time.\nBy scanning the parameter spaces using the evolution equations, we find that, a\nmassive planet ($10M_J$) at 30AU with $6^o$ inclined to a massive disk\n($50M_J$) can finally enter the Kozai resonance with an inner Jupiter around\nthe snowline.

Massive cores make hot planets Abstract: The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet\nformation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important\nphysical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and\neven more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or\ngravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the\npost-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core\naccretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct\nself-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets\nwith masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120\nEarth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant\nplanets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a\nfactor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian\nmass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well\ndefined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For\nmassive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core\naccretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start\nscenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the\nmechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or\nduring gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make\nno claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets.\nBut if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation\nmechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more\nluminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational\ninstability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity\ncould also be caused simply by a more massive core. \n\n"}

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain\nexplicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and\ndelineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in\nsystems with massive (>10^{-2}M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is\nusually determined by the gravity of the eccentric disk alone, and is\ncomparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower\nlimit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.\nThis fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses\nor if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity. \n\n"}

Actually, it\nseems a difficult goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type satellite is as little as $0.5$\nmm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just $\\dot\\Omega_{\\rm\nLT}=2$ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr$^{-1}$). Some tesseral and sectorial\nocean tides such as $K_1,K_2$ induce long-period harmonic node perturbations\nwith frequencies which are integer multiples of the extremely slow Galileo's\nnode rate $\\dot\\Omega$ completing a full cycle in about 40 yr.

Since the coefficients of the $J_{\\ell}$-free multisatellite linear\ncombinations are determined only by the semimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity\n$e$ and the inclination $I$, which are nominally equal for all the Galileo\nsatellites, it is not possible to include all of them. Even by using only one\nGalileo spacecraft together with the LAGEOS family would be unfeasible because\nthe resulting Galileo coefficient would be $\\gtrsim 1$, thus enhancing the\naliasing impact of the uncancelled non-conservative and tidal perturbations. \n\n"}

Using a simple analytic\nmodel for the fluctuations predicted in simulations, we estimate the\nrate-of-formation and mass function of self-gravitating, rapidly-collapsing\nplanetesimal-mass bodies formed by this mechanism. The statistics of this\nprocess depend sensitively on the size/stopping time of the grains, disk\nsurface density, and turbulent Mach numbers.

Collapse to planetesimal through super-Earth\nmasses is possible. The key condition is that grain density fluctuations reach\nlarge amplitudes on large scales, where gravitational instability proceeds most\neasily (collapse of small grains is strongly suppressed by turbulent\nvorticity). We show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formation\nin terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop > f(Q,Z,alpha)).\nIn a MMSN, this requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au.\nAt small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders. However,\nbecause density fluctuations depend super-exponentially on tau_stop (inversely\nproportional to disk surface density), lower-density disks are more unstable.\nIn fact, we predict that cm-sized grains at ~1au will form pebble piles in a\ndisk with ~10% the MMSN density, so planet formation at ~au may generically\noccur late, as disks are evaporating.

Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates.

We have applied the model to the atmospheres of the hot Jupiters HD\n209458b and HD 189733b. The adopted eddy diffusion coefficients are calculated\nby following the behaviour of passive tracers in three-dimensional general\ncirculation models, which results in eddy values significantly below previous\nestimates. We find that the distribution of molecules with altitude and\nlongitude in the atmospheres of these two hot Jupiters is complex because of\nthe interplay of the various physical and chemical processes at work. Much of\nthe distribution of molecules is driven by the strong zonal wind and the\nlimited extent of vertical transport, resulting in an important homogenisation\nof the chemical composition with longitude. In general, molecular abundances\nare quenched horizontally to values typical of the hottest dayside regions, and\nthus the composition in the cooler nightside regions is highly contaminated by\nthat of warmer dayside regions. As a consequence, the abundance of methane\nremains low, even below the predictions of previous one-dimensional models,\nwhich is likely to be in conflict with the high CH4 content inferred from\nobservations of the dayside of HD 209458b. Another consequence of the important\nlongitudinal homogenisation of the abundances is that the variability of the\nchemical composition has little effect on the way the emission spectrum is\nmodified with phase and on the changes in the transmission spectrum from the\ntransit ingress to the egress, these variations in the spectra being mainly due\nto changes in the temperature rather than in the composition between the\ndifferent sides of the planet. \n\n"}

Recent\ndetections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets to\nbegin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, and\ninternal structures. The Kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be most\ncommon, as 26% of Sun-like stars have small, 1-2 R_e planets with orbital\nperiods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 R_e planets that receive 1-4x the\nincident stellar flux that warms our Earth. These Earth-size planets are\nsprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 AU, and\nprobably beyond. Mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 R_e show\nthat the smallest of them, R < 1.5 R_e, have the density expected for rocky\nplanets. Their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused by\ngravitational compression. Including solar system planets yields a relation:\nrho = 2.32 + 3.19 R/R_e [g/cc]. Larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0\nR_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasing\namounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core,\nbefitting the appellation \"mini-Neptunes.\" Planets of ~1.5 R_e have the highest\ndensities, averaging near 10 g/cc. The gas giant planets occur preferentially\naround stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur around\nstars having a range of heavy element abundances.

Our model\nis constructed as the combination of planet traps with the standard core\naccretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directly\nrelates to the dust density in disks or the metallicity ([Fe/H]). We\nstatistically compute planet formation frequencies (PFFs) as well as the\norbital radius ($<R_{rapid}>$) within which gas accretion becomes efficient\nenough to form Jovian planets. The three characteristic exoplanetary\npopulations are considered: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters densely populated around\n1 AU, and low-mass planets such as super-Earths. We explore the behavior of the\nPFFs as well as $<R_{rapid}>$ for the three different populations as a function\nof metallicity ($-2 \\leq$[Fe/H]$\\leq -0.6$). We show that the total PFFs\nincrease steadily with metallicity, which is the direct outcome of the core\naccretion picture. For the entire range of the metallicity considered here, the\npopulation of the low-mass planets dominates over the Jovian planets. The\nJovian planets contribute to the PFFs above [Fe/H]-1. We find that the hot\nJupiters form at lower metallcities than the exo-Jupiters. This arises from the\nradially inward transport of planetary cores by their host traps, which is more\neffective for lower metallicity disks due to the slower growth of the cores.\nThe PFFs for the exo-Jupiters exceed those for the hot Jupiters around\n[Fe/H]-0.7. Finally, we show that the critical metallicity for forming Jovian\nplanets is [Fe/H]-1.2, which is evaluated by comparing the values of\n$<R_{rapid}>$ between the hot Jupiters and the low-mass planets. The comparison\nintrinsically links to the different gas accretion efficiency between them. \n\n"}

We used the Kepler public data archive\ncombined with multicolor photometry from the Gran Telescopio de Canarias and\nradial velocity follow-up using FIES at the Nordic Optical Telescope for\nconfirmation. We report a confident detection of a transit color signature that\ncan only be explained by a compact occulting body, entirely ruling out a\ncontaminating eclipsing binary, a hierarchical triple, or a grazing eclipsing\nbinary. Those findings are corroborated by our radial velocity measurements,\nwhich put an upper limit of ~1 Mjup on the mass of Kepler-418b. We also report\nthat the host star is significantly blended, confirming the ~10% light\ncontamination suspected from the crowding metric in the Kepler light curve\nmeasured by the Kepler team. We report detection of an unresolved light source\nthat contributes an additional ~40% to the target star, which would not have\nbeen detected without multicolor photometric analysis.

The standard\ndescription, accounting for only gas drag and gravity of the companion star has\nbeen challenged recently, as the gravity of the protoplanetary disk was shown\nto play a crucial role in planetesimal dynamics. An added complication is the\ntendency of protoplanetary disks in binaries to become eccentric, giving rise\nto additional excitation of planetesimal eccentricity. Here, for the first\ntime, we analytically explore secular dynamics of planetesimals in binaries\nsuch as $\\alpha$ Cen and $\\gamma$ Cep under the combined action of (1) gravity\nof the eccentric protoplanetary disk, (2) perturbations due to the (coplanar)\neccentric companion, and (3) gas drag.

Three examples:\n  Mercury, Io, and Kepler-10 b Abstract: In Efroimsky & Makarov (2014), we derived from the first principles a formula\nfor the tidal heating rate in a tidally perturbed homogeneous sphere. We\ncompared it with the formulae used in the literature, and pointed out the\ndifferences. Using this result, we now present three case studies - Mercury,\nKepler-10b, and a triaxial Io. A very sharp frequency-dependence of k2/Q near\nspin-orbit resonances yields a similarly sharp dependence of k2/Q on the spin\nrate. This indicates that physical libration may play a major role in tidal\nheating of synchronously rotating bodies. The magnitude of libration in the\nspin rate being defined by the planet's triaxiality, the latter should be a\nfactor determining the dissipation rate. Other parameters equal, a\nsynchronously rotating body with a stronger triaxiality should generate more\nheat than a similar body of a more symmetrical shape. Further in the paper, we\ndiscuss scenarios where initially triaxial objects melt and lose their\ntriaxiality. Thereafter, dissipation in them becomes less intensive; so the\nbodies freeze. The tidal bulge becomes a new permanent figure, with a new\ntriaxiality lower than the original. In the paper, we also derive simplified,\napproximate expressions for dissipation rate in a rocky planet of the Maxwell\nrheology, with a not too small Maxwell time. The three expressions derived\npertain to the cases of a synchronous spin, a 3:2 resonance, and a nonresonant\nrotation; so they can be applied to most close-in super-Earth exoplanets\ndetected thus far. In such bodies, the rate of tidal heating outside of\nsynchronous rotation is weakly dependent on the eccentricity and obliquity,\nprovided both these parameters are small or moderate.

Such disks with barotropic equilibria can be\napproximately modeled using the shearing box framework, representing a small\ndisk volume with height-independent angular frequency. If the disk is in\nbaroclinic equilibrium, the angular frequency does generally depend on height,\nand it is thus necessary to go beyond the standard shearing box approach. In\nthis paper, we show that given a global disk model, it is possible to develop\napproximate models that are local in horizontal planes without an expansion in\nheight with shearing-periodic boundary conditions.

Adopting a coplanar analog of Kepler-16 as an example, we\nfind that circumbinary planets can transit the same star more than once during\na single planetary orbit, a phenomenon we call \"tight transits\". In certain\ngeometric, the projected orbital velocity of the planet and the secondary star\ncan approach zero and change sign, resulting in very long transits and/or 2-3\ntransits during a single binary orbit. Whether tight transits are possible for\na particular system depends primarily on the binary mass ratio and the orbital\narchitecture of both the binary and the planet. We derive a time-dependent\ncriterion to judge when tight transits are possible for any circumbinary\nsystem. These results are verified with full dynamical integrations that also\nreveal other tight transit characteristics, i.e., the transit durations and the\nintervals between tight transits. For the seven currently known circumbinary\nsystems, we estimate these critical parameters both analytically and\nnumerically. Due to the mutual inclination between the planet and the binary,\ntight transits can only occur across the less massive star B in Kepler-16, -34,\n-35, and -47 (for both planets). The long-term average frequency of tight\ntransits (compared to typical transits) for Kepler-16, -34, and -35 are\nestimated to be several percent. Using full numerical integrations, the next\ntight transit for each system is predicted and the soonest example appears to\nbe Kepler-47b and -47c, which are likely to have tight transits before 2025.\nThese unique and valuable events often deserve special observational scrutiny. \n\n"}

Moreover, the translation presented in Liu et al. is\nmisleading and inaccurate. We give the exact Chinese wordings and our English\ntranslations. According to the original sources, the Chinese observed a comet\nin mid January 773, but they report neither a collision nor a large coma, just\na long tail. Also, there is no report in any of the source texts about \"dust\nrain in the daytime\" as claimed by Liu et al. (2014), but simply a normal dust\nstorm. Ho (1962) reports sightings of this comet in China on AD 773 Jan 15\nand/or 17 and in Japan on AD 773 Jan 20 (Ho 1962). At the relevant historic\ntime, the Chinese held that comets were produced within the Earth's atmosphere,\nso that it would have been impossible for them to report a \"collision\" of a\ncomet with Earth's atmosphere. The translation and conclusions made by Liu et\nal. (2014) are not supported by the historical record. Therefore, postulating a\nsudden increase in 14C in corals off the Chinese coast precisely in mid January\n773 (Liu et al. 2014) is not justified given just the 230Th dating for AD 783\n\\pm 14. \n\n"}

Using detailed numerical calculations\nwe find that this evolution is quite rapid, potentially leading to complete\nremoval of the gaseous envelope in a few Gyr, and leaving behind an exposed\nrocky core (\"hot super-Earth\"). Final orbital periods are quite sensitive to\nthe details of the planet's mass-radius relation, and to the effects of\nirradiation and photo-evaporation, but could be as short as a few hours, or as\nlong as several days. Our scenario predicts the existence of planets with\nintermediate masses (\"hot Neptunes\") that should be found precisely at their\nRoche limit and in the process of losing mass through Roche lobe overflow. The\nobserved excess of small single-planet candidate systems observed by Kepler may\nalso be the result of this process.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity. HCN may become interesting in high gravity brown dwarfs with very\nstrong vertical mixing. Detailed analysis of the CO-CH4 reaction network\nreveals that the bottleneck to CO hydrogenation goes through methanol, in\npartial agreement with previous work. Simple, easy to use quenching relations\nare derived by fitting to the complete chemistry of the full ensemble of\nmodels. These relations are valid for determining CO, CH4, NH3, HCN, and CO2\nabundances in the range of self-luminous worlds we have studied but may not\napply if atmospheres are strongly heated at high altitudes by processes not\nconsidered here (e.g., wave breaking). \n\n"}

Full 3D\n  Simulations toward the Outer Disk Abstract: We perform 3D stratified shearing-box MHD simulations on the gas dynamics of\nprotoplanetary disks threaded by net vertical magnetic field Bz. All three\nnon-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar\ndiffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium\nchemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk. In addition, we find that the vertical magnetic flux\nis strongly concentrated into thin, azimuthally extended shells in most of our\nsimulations beyond 15AU. This is a generic phenomenon unrelated to the Hall\neffect, and leads to enhanced zonal flow. Observational and theoretical\nimplications, as well as future prospects are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart.

Using a prolate apodization, the current\nimplementations offer raw contrasts down to $10^{-7}$ at 0.2 arcsec from a star\nover a wide bandpass (20\\%), in the presence of central obstruction and struts,\nenabling the study of young or massive gaseous planets. Observations of older\nor lighter companions at smaller separations would require improvements in\nterms of inner working angle (IWA) and contrast, but the methods originally\nused for these designs were not able to fully explore the parameter space. We\nhere propose a novel approach to improve the APLC performance. Our method\nrelies on the linear properties of the coronagraphic electric field with the\napodization at any wavelength to develop numerical solutions producing\ncoronagraphic star images with high-contrast region in broadband light. We\nexplore the parameter space by considering different aperture geometries,\ncontrast levels, dark-zone sizes, bandpasses, and focal plane mask sizes.

The time-varying abundance of small grains in an\nevolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet photons, while\ndust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and\nresulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in\nturn, selectively carry small dust grains leaving the larger particles---which\ndecouple from the gas---behind in the disk. We study these effects by\ninvestigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by\nEUV, FUV and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a 1-D multi-fluid\napproach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface\ndensity distributions. The 1-D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models\nconstructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and\ndetermine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust\ncoagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk\nlifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is\nthus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find\nthat photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass\nratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result\nin a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen.\nWe discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet\nformation, including the formation of gas-poor giants.

Planet-metallicity correlations Abstract: Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation,\nrequires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gas\ngiant planets. The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling\nin the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around\nmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide\nrange of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these\nobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation\nhypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis\ncalculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations\nof the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and\nnot even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the\ninner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star\nmetallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these\nsmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around\nthe Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low\nmetallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,\nwhereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow\ncontract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally,\nsimulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity\npreference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known\ndirectly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor. \n\n"}

Here, we use\n$N$-body simulations to characterise close star-planet and planet-planet\nencounters and the dynamical fate of the FFP population in star clusters\ncontaining $500-2000$ single or binary star members. We find that FFPs ejected\nfrom their planetary system at low velocities typically leave the star cluster\n40% earlier than their host stars, and experience tens of close ($<1000$ AU)\nencounters with other stars and planets before they escape. The fraction of\nFFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and\nthe initial velocity distribution of the FFPs. Approximately half of the close\nencounters occur within the first 30 Myr, and only 10% occur after 100 Myr.

The\nsuccess or failure of resonant capture yields exceedingly different subsequent\nevolutions, and thus plays a central role in determining the ensuing orbital\narchitecture of planetary systems. In this work, we employ an integrable\nHamiltonian formalism for first order planetary resonances that allows both\nsecondary bodies to have finite masses and eccentricities, and construct a\ncomprehensive theory for resonant capture. Particularly, we derive conditions\nunder which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic regime, and provide a\ngeneralized criterion for guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure\nfor calculating capture probabilities when capture is not certain.\nSubsequently, we utilize the developed analytical model to examine the\nevolution of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula, and investigate\nthe origins of the dominantly non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian\nextrasolar planets.

The hydrodynamic escape rates of\nNeptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the\ndiffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily\naffected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere\nhas very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of\na hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission\nspectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon. With our\natmospheric evolution model, we find that if the mass of the initial atmosphere\nenvelope is 1E-3 planetary mass, hydrodynamic escape can reduce the hydrogen\nabundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude in ~10 billion\nyears. Observations of exoplanet transits may thus detect signatures of helium\natmospheres and probe the evolutionary history of small exoplanets. \n\n"}

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution. \n\n"}

As $Q$ increases, the fraction of stars in a galaxy that allow for\nhabitable planets decreases due to both orbital disruption and the intense\nbackground radiation.

We show in this paper that the classic processes\nof runaway and oligarchic growth from a disk of planetesimals cannot explain\nthis dichotomy, even if the original surface density of solids increased at the\nsnowline. Instead, the accretion of drifting pebbles by embryos and cores can\nexplain the dichotomy, provided that some assumptions hold true. We propose\nthat the mass-flow of pebbles is two-times lower and the characteristic size of\nthe pebbles is approximately ten times smaller within the snowline than beyond\nthe snowline (respectively at heliocentric distance $r<r_{ice}$ and\n$r>r_{ice}$, where $r_{ice}$ is the snowline heliocentric distance), due to ice\nsublimation and the splitting of icy pebbles into a collection of\nchondrule-size silicate grains.

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a\nmillion years after the disk disperses, we find a planet that has only about\nten percent of its original envelope, and a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much\nlonger than its actual age.

The amplitude of\nthe TTV depends on the mass of the perturbing planet, relative to the mass of\nthe star, and on both the eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter of each\nplanet. The TTVs of the two planets are approximated anti-correlated, with\nphases of $\\phi$ and $\\approx \\phi+\\pi$, where the phase $\\phi$ also depends on\nthe eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter.

The\npresence of a DZ naturally leads to conditions susceptible to the Rossby wave\ninstability (RWI), which produces vortices and spiral density waves that may\nrevive the DZ and be responsible for observed large-scale disc structures. We\npresent a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the\nrole of the RWI in DZs, including its impact on the long-term evolution of the\ndisc and its morphology. The nonlinear RWI can generate Reynolds stresses\n(effective $\\alpha$ parameter) as large as $0.01 - 0.05$ in the DZ, helping to\nsustain quasi-steady accretion throughout the disc. It also produces novel disc\nmorphologies, including azimuthal asymmetries with $m = 1, 2$, and atypical\nvortex shapes. The angular momentum transport strength and morphology are most\nsensitive to two parameters: the radial extent of the DZ and the disc\nviscosity. The largest Reynolds stresses are produced when the radial extent of\nthe DZ is less than its distance to the central star. Such narrow DZs lead to a\nsingle vortex or two coherent antipodal vortices in the quasi-steady state. The\nedges of wider DZs evolve separately, resulting in two independent vortices and\nreduced angular momentum transport efficiency. In either case, we find that,\nbecause of the Reynolds stresses generated by the nonlinear RWI, gravitational\ninstability is unlikely to play a role in angular momentum transport across the\nDZ, unless the accretion rate is sufficiently high. \n\n"}

By combining the new\nHerschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a\nparameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using\ntwo-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water\ndistribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and\nouter relative water abundance and a critical radius at which the surface water\nabundance is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii\nof $\\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5\norders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are\nconsistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted\nby the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp\ndrop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local\ngas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase\nchemical pathways to water below 300 K.

The LLSG algorithm Abstract: Data processing constitutes a critical component of high-contrast exoplanet\nimaging. Its role is almost as important as the choice of a coronagraph or a\nwavefront control system, and it is intertwined with the chosen observing\nstrategy. Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging\n(ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA)\nbased algorithms. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique\nfor constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted\nfrom the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions\npresent in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the\nscience data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity\nof the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise. Inspired by\nrecent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we aim to\npropose a localized subspace projection technique that surpasses current\nPCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of the detectability of\ncompanions at near real-time speed, a quality that will be useful for future\ndirect imaging surveys. We used randomized low-rank approximation methods\nrecently proposed in the machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise\nthresholding to decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse,\nand Gaussian noise components (LLSG). This local three-term decomposition\nseparates the starlight and the associated speckle noise from the planetary\nsignal, which mostly remains in the sparse term.

While 3D climate studies can calculate the water\nvapor, ice albedo, and cloud feedback self-consistently and therefore allow for\na deeper understanding and the identification of relevant climate processes, 1D\nmodel studies rely on fewer model assumptions and can be more easily applied to\nthe large parameter space possible for exoplanets. We evaluate the\napplicability of 1D climate models to estimate the potential habitability of\nEarth-like exoplanets by comparing our 1D model results to those of 3D climate\nstudies in the literature. We applied a cloud-free 1D radiative-convective\nclimate model to calculate the climate of Earth-like planets around different\ntypes of main-sequence stars with varying surface albedo and relative humidity\nprofile. These parameters depend on climate feedbacks that are not treated\nself-consistently in most 1D models.

Instead, smaller numbers are\nfavoured by nature in accordance with a logarithmic distribution law, which is\nreferred to as Benford's law.

Motivated by this fact, this paper investigates the\nexistence of Benford's distribution in the extrasolar world using Kepler data\nfor exoplanets. The investigation has revealed the presence of Benford's\ndistribution in various physical properties of these exoplanets.

Theoretical\nmodels predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency\nand temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent HST WASP-43b\nspectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions.\nUsing the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve\nobservations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6\nmicron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking\nunphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other\nvisits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST\ndata. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would\nneed to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal\nemission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly\nretrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high\naltitudes.

Imposing an informative prior on the period and phase, we do detect a\ncandidate signal with the expected depth. However, perturbing the phase prior\nacross 100 evenly spaced intervals reveals one strong false-positive and one\nweaker instance. We estimate a false-positive rate of at least a few percent\nand a much higher false-negative rate of 20-40%, likely caused by the very high\nflare rate of Proxima Centauri. Comparing our candidate signal to HATSouth\nground-based photometry reveals that the signal is somewhat, but not\nconclusively, disfavored (1-2 sigmas) leading us to argue that the signal is\nmost likely spurious. We expect that infrared photometric follow-up could more\nconclusively test the existence of this candidate signal, owing to the\nsuppression of flare activity and the impressive infrared brightness of the\nparent star. \n\n"}

We show that the\nevolution of the internal entropy depends on the contrast between the internal\nadiabat and the entropy of the accreted material, parametrized by the shock\ntemperature $T_0$ and pressure $P_0$. At low temperatures ($T_0\\lesssim\n300$--$1000\\ {\\rm K}$, depending on model parameters), the accreted material\nhas a lower entropy than the interior. The convection zone extends to the\nsurface and can drive a large luminosity, leading to rapid cooling and cold\nstarts.

The broad wavelength coverage and high sensitivity of its\ninstruments will allow us to extract far more information from exoplanet\nspectra than what has been possible with current observations. In this paper,\nwe investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era\nof JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission\nspectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to\nsimulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic\nobservations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these\nspectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one\nassuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parametrized temperature\nprofile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances.

In this paper, we perform inviscid\nthree-dimensional global hydrodynamic simulations to examine the growth and\nconsequence of this instability operating on the spiral waves driven by a\nJupiter-mass planet in a protoplanetary disk. We find that the spiral waves are\ndestabilized via the spiral wave instability (SWI), generating hydrodynamic\nturbulence and sustained radially-alternating vertical flows that appear to be\nassociated with long wavelength inertial modes. In the interval $0.3~R_p \\leq R\n\\leq 0.7~R_p$, where $R_p$ denotes the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit\n(assumed to be 5~au), the estimated vertical diffusion rate associated with the\nturbulence is characterized by $\\alpha_{\\rm diff} \\sim (0.2-1.2) \\times\n10^{-2}$.

Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar.

Abstract: Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely.

We consider a variant of\nthis model in which the companion is a giant planet with an orbital radius of a\nfew au. Guided by the results of published numerical simulations, we model the\ndynamical evolution of this system by dividing the disk into inner and outer\nparts---separated at the location of the planet---that behave as distinct,\nrigid disks. We show that the planet misaligns the inner disk even as the\norientation of the outer disk remains unchanged. In addition to the\noscillations induced by the precessional motion, whose amplitude is larger the\nsmaller the initial inner-disk-to-planet mass ratio, the spin--orbit angle also\nexhibits a secular growth in this case---driven by ongoing mass depletion from\nthe disk---that becomes significant when the inner disk's angular momentum\ndrops below that of the planet. Altogether, these two effects can produce\nsignificant misalignment angles for the inner disk, including retrograde\nconfigurations. We discuss these results within the framework of the Stranded\nHot Jupiter scenario and consider their implications, including to the\ninterpretation of the alignment properties of debris disks. \n\n"}

The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric\ndynamics (Simon et al. 2016), detecting its global acoustic oscillations (Rowe\net al., submitted), and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present\nthe first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements.\nBeyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see\na star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which\nconsists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude \"nu_max\"\nand the mean frequency separation between mode overtones \"Delta nu\", is\nsurprising as the nu_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the\naccepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu_max_sun = 3100 muHz, the\nasteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear\nlarger by 13.8 +/- 5.8 % and 4.3 +/- 1.9 % respectively. The higher nu_max is\ncaused by a combination of the value of nu_max_sun, being larger at the time of\nobservations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10\nmuHz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being ten times larger than\nVIRGO's.

Outline\n  of the magnetospheric rebound model Abstract: The Kepler mission has discovered that multiple close-in super-Earth planets\nare common around solar-type stars, but their period ratios do not show strong\npile-ups near mean motion resonances (MMRs). One scenario is that super-Earths\nform in a gas-rich disk, and they interact gravitationally with the surrounding\ngas, inducing their orbital migration. Disk migration theory predicts, however,\nthat planets would end up at resonant orbits due to their differential\nmigration speed. Motivated by the discrepancy between observation and theory,\nwe seek for a mechanism that moves planets out of resonances. We examine the\norbital evolution of planet pairs near the magnetospheric cavity during the gas\ndisk dispersal phase. Our study determines the conditions under which planets\ncan escape resonances. We perform two-planet N-body simulations, varying the\nplanet masses, stellar magnetic field strengths, disk accretion rates and gas\ndisk depletion timescales. As planets migrate outward with the expanding\nmagnetospheric cavity, their dynamical configurations can be rearranged.\nMigration of planets is substantial (minor) in a massive (light) disk. When the\nouter planet is more massive than the inner planet, the period ratio of two\nplanets increases through outward migration. On the other hand, when the inner\nplanet is more massive, the final period ratio tends to remain similar to the\ninitial one. Larger stellar magnetic field strengths result in planets stopping\ntheir migration at longer periods. We highlight \\textit{magnetospheric rebound}\nas an important ingredient able to reconcile disk migration theory with\nobservations. Even when planets are trapped into MMR during the early gas-rich\nstage, subsequent cavity expansion would induce substantial changes to their\norbits, moving them out of resonance. \n\n"}

Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model to\nsimulate the ability of frozen planets to escape from glaciation by\naccumulating enough gaseous CO$_2$.

The amount of CO$_2$ that can be trapped in the\npolar caps depends on the efficiency of CO$_2$ ice to flow laterally as well as\nits graviational stability relative to subsurface water ice. The flow of CO$_2$\nice from poles to equator is mostly controlled by the bottom temperature, and\nhence by the internal heat flux.

We now present the results of a\nglobal protoplanetary disk evolution model that incorporates planetesimal\nformation by the streaming instability, along with viscous accretion,\nphotoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-ray photons, dust evolution, the water ice\nline, and stratified turbulence. Our simulations produce massive (60-130\n$M_\\oplus$) planetesimal belts beyond 100 au and up to $\\sim 20 M_\\oplus$ of\nplanetesimals in the middle regions (3-100 au). Our most comprehensive model\nforms 8 $M_\\oplus$ of planetesimals inside 3 au, where they can give rise to\nterrestrial planets. The planetesimal mass formed in the inner disk depends\ncritically on the timing of the formation of an inner cavity in the disk by\nhigh-energy photons. Our results show that the combination of photoevaporation\nand the streaming instability are efficient at converting the solid component\nof protoplanetary disks into planetesimals. Our model, however, does not form\nenough early planetesimals in the inner and middle regions of the disk to give\nrise to giant planets and super-Earths with gaseous envelopes.

For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization.

Here we study disks\naround 1, 3, 5, 10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ planets with three dimensional, global\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations with sub-planet peak resolution, and various\nplanetary temperatures.

In the case of 3-10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$\nplanets a disk always forms. The temperature profile of the circumplanetary\ndisks is very steep, the inner 1/6th is over the silicate condensation\ntemperature and the entire disk is above water freezing point, making satellite\nformation impossible in this early stage ($<$1 Myr).

This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a\nplanetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of\nplanets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise\nsynchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin\nstate, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with\nfull surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in\nilluminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus\non habitability. We also find that the resultant spin state can be very\nsensitive to initial conditions due to the chaotic nature of the spin state at\nearly times within certain regimes.

To address this\nissue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering\nbetween a free-floating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound\nplanet.

The\nunprecedented, high spatial resolution ALMA observations taken toward HL Tau\nand subsequent radiative transfer modeling reveal that a high degree of dust\nsettling is currently achieved at the outer part of the HL Tau disk. Previous\nobservations however suggest a high disk accretion rate onto the central star.\nThis configuration is not necessarily intuitive in the framework of the\nconventional viscous disk model, since efficient accretion generally requires a\nhigh level of turbulence, which can suppress dust settling considerably. We\ndevelop a simplified, semi-analytical disk model to examine under what\ncondition these two properties can be realized in a single model. Recent,\nnon-ideal MHD simulations are utilized to realistically model the angular\nmomentum transport both radially via MHD turbulence and vertically via\nmagnetically induced disk winds. We find that the HL Tau disk configuration can\nbe reproduced well when disk winds are properly taken into account. While the\nresulting disk properties are likely consistent with other observational\nresults, such an ideal situation can be established only if the plasma $\\beta$\nat the disk midplane is $\\beta_0 \\simeq 2 \\times 10^4$ under the assumption of\nsteady accretion.

With net vertical field aligned with disk rotation, the Hall-shear\ninstability strongly amplifies horizontal magnetic field, making the overall\ndynamics dependent on initial field configuration. Following disk formation,\nthe disk likely relaxes into an inner zone characterized by asymmetric field\nconfiguration across the midplane that smoothly transitions to a more symmetric\nouter zone. Angular momentum transport is driven by both MHD winds and laminar\nMaxwell stress, with both accretion and decretion flows present at different\nheights, and modestly asymmetric winds from the two disk sides. With\nanti-aligned field polarity, weakly magnetized disks settle into an asymmetric\nfield configuration with supersonic accretion flow concentrated at one side of\ndisk surface, and highly asymmetric winds between the two disk sides. In all\ncases, the wind is magneto-thermal in nature characterized by mass loss rate\nexceeding the accretion rate. More strongly magnetized disks give more\nsymmetric field configuration and flow structures. Deeper far-UV penetration\nleads to stronger and less stable outflows.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

However, estimating masses of\nfield stars is often difficult. Over the past decade, a controversy has arisen\nabout the inferred occurrence rate of gas-giant planets around evolved\nintermediate-mass stars -- the so-called `retired A-stars'. The high masses of\nthese red-giant planet hosts, derived using spectroscopic information and\nstellar evolution models, have been called into question. Here we address the\ncontroversy by determining the masses of eight evolved planet-hosting stars\nusing asteroseismology. We compare the masses with spectroscopic-based masses\nfrom the Exoplanet Orbit Database that were previously adopted to infer\nproperties of the exoplanets and their hosts. We find a significant one-sided\noffset between the two sets of masses for stars with spectroscopic masses above\nroughly 1.6Msun, suggestive of an average 15--20% overestimate of the adopted\nspectroscopic-based masses. The only star in our sample well below this mass\nlimit is also the only one not showing this offset. Finally, we note that the\nscatter across literature values of spectroscopic-based masses often exceed\ntheir formal uncertainties, making it comparable to the offset we report here. \n\n"}

When the planet does not release energy into the ambient disc, the\nmain effect of thermal diffusion is the softening of the enthalpy peak near the\nplanet, which results in the appearance of two cold and dense lobes on either\nside of the orbit, of size smaller than the thickness of the disc. The lobes\nexert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to\nthe one-sided Lindblad torque. When the planet is offset from corotation, the\nlobes are asymmetric and the planet experiences a net torque, the `cold'\nthermal torque, which has a magnitude that depends on the relative value of the\ndistance to corotation to the size of the lobes $\\sim\\sqrt{\\chi/\\Omega_p}$,\n$\\chi$ being the thermal diffusivity and $\\Omega_p$ the orbital frequency. We\nbelieve that this effect corresponds to the phenomenon named `cold finger'\nrecently reported in numerical simulations, and we argue that it constitutes\nthe dominant mode of migration of sub-Earth-mass objects. When the planet is\nluminous, the heat released into the ambient disc results in an additional\ndisturbance that takes the form of hot, low-density lobes. They give a torque,\nnamed heating torque in previous work, that has an expression similar, but of\nopposite sign, to the cold thermal torque. \n\n"}

Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where\nthe transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the\nshape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings\ncover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect).\nThese line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity,\nobliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars,\nthis mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for\nfast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the line\ndistortion to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring\nparameters. We demonstrate that by modeling these distortions we can recover\nring system parameters (sky-projected angle, obliquity and size) using only a\nsmall part of the transit.

Previous analyses of the infrared eclipses of\nWASP-43b have assumed reflected light from the planet is negligible and can be\nignored.

However, the turbulent properties of protoplanetary disks\nare poorly constrained observationally. Recent studies have found turbulent\nspeeds smaller than what fully-developed MRI would produce (Flaherty et al.\n2015, 2017). However, existing studies assumed a constant CO/H2 ratio of 0.0001\nin locations where CO is not frozen-out or photo-dissociated. Our previous\nstudies of evolving disk chemistry indicate that CO is depleted by\nincorporation into complex organic molecules well inside the freeze-out radius\nof CO. We consider the effects of this chemical depletion on measurements of\nturbulence. Simon et al.

However, a decade of numerical studies in various areas of\ncomputational astrophysics has shown that the standard formulation of SPH\nsuffers from several shortcomings such as artificial surface tension and its\ntendency to promptly damp turbulent motions on scales much larger than the\nphysical dissipation scale, both resulting in the suppression of mixing.

Formation\n  mechanism Abstract: Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single planet can excite more\nthan one spiral arm, possibly explaining recent observations of multiple spiral\narms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet\nexcites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous\nspeculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be\nunderstood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A\nplanet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching\nspiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is\nin phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral\narm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference\ncan occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching\nposition of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk\ntemperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the\nplanet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus\nlarger pitch angles.

The duration and efficiency of exchange\nbetween the primitive massive atmosphere and the global impact-induced water\nocean likely play a key role in the chemical evolution of the early Titan's\natmosphere. To investigate the atmospheric composition of early Titan for a\nwide range of global (atmosphere + ocean) composition in volatils, we first\ndeveloped a gas-liquid equilibrium model of the NH3-CO2-H2O system, where the\nnon-ideal behavior of both gas and liquid phases, and the speciation of\nvolatiles dissolved in the aqueous phase are taken into account. We show that\nthe relative abundance of CO2 and NH3 determine the composition of Titan's\natmosphere. For CO2/NH3 < 1, CO2 is massively dissolved in the ocean.

Diameters and albedos\nwere obtained by fitting an empirically calibrated version of the standard\nthermal model to these data. After the publication of the flux catalogue in\nOctober 2016, our aim here is to present the AKARI IRC all-sky survey data and\ndiscuss valuable scientific applications in the field of small-body physical\nproperties studies. As an example, we update the catalogue of asteroid\ndiameters and albedos based on AKARI using the near-Earth asteroid thermal\nmodel (NEATM). We fit the NEATM to derive asteroid diameters and, whenever\npossible, infrared beaming parameters. We obtained a total of 8097 diameters\nand albedos for 5170 asteroids, and we fitted the beaming parameter for almost\ntwo thousand of them. When it was not possible to fit the beaming parameter, we\nused a straight line fit to our sample's beaming parameter-versus-phase angle\nplot to set the default value for each fit individually instead of using a\nsingle average value. Our diameters agree with stellar-occultation-based\ndiameters well within the accuracy expected for the model. They also match the\nprevious AKARI-based catalogue at phase angles lower than 50 degrees, but we\nfind a systematic deviation at higher phase angles, at which near-Earth and\nMars-crossing asteroids were observed. The AKARI IRC All-sky survey provides\nobservations at different observation geometries, rotational coverages and\naspect angles. For example, by comparing in more detail a few asteroids for\nwhich dimensions were derived from occultations, we discuss how the multiple\nobservations per object may already provide three-dimensional information about\nelongated objects even based on an idealised model like the NEATM. \n\n"}

We find extremely low strengths of around one Pa or less (one\nto five Pa, when scaled to a metre length). The presence of eroded material at\nthe base of most overhangs, as well as the observed collapse of two features\nand implied previous collapse of another, suggests that they are prone to\nfailure and that true material strengths are close to these lower limits\n(although we only consider static stresses and not dynamic stress from, for\nexample, cometary activity). Thus, a tensile strength of a few pascals is a\ngood approximation for the tensile strength of 67P's nucleus material, which is\nin agreement with previous work. We find no particular trends in overhang\nproperties with size, over the $\\sim10-100$ m range studied here, or location\non the nucleus. There are no obvious differences, in terms of strength, height\nor evidence of collapse, between the populations of overhangs on the two\ncometary lobes, suggesting that 67P is relatively homogenous in terms of\ntensile strength.

For rocky exoplanets with 10-1000x Earth's H2O\nbut without H2, we model the multi-Gyr evolution of ocean temperature and\nchemistry, taking into account C partitioning, high-pressure ice phases, and\natmosphere-lithosphere exchange. Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find\nthat: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean\nchemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many\nwaterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to\nprevious claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical\ncycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C\nexchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by\nseafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass\nand ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our\nmodel, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early\nwater-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of\nmagnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory\noverlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for\nwhich the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as\nwide as it can be. Because the width of the HZ in semimajor axis defines (for\nSun-like stars) the maximum possible time span of surface habitability, this\neffect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens. We illustrate our\nfindings by using the output of an ensemble of N-body simulations as input to\nour waterworld evolution code. Thus (for the first time in an end-to-end\ncalculation) we show that chance variation of initial conditions, with no need\nfor geochemical cycling, can yield multi-Gyr surface habitability on\nwaterworlds. \n\n"}

Its relatively high density in combination with the high radar\nalbedo, led to classify the asteroid as a metallic object, possibly a core of a\ndifferentiated body, remnant of \"hit-and-run\" collisions. The detection of\nhydration is, in principle, inconsistent with a pure metallic origin of this\nbody. Here we consider the scenario that the hydration on its surface is\nexogenous and was delivered by hydrated impactors.

How to use a Survey Simulator: Statistical Testing of\n  Dynamical Models Against the Real Kuiper Belt Abstract: All surveys include observational biases, which makes it impossible to\ndirectly compare properties of discovered trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) with\ndynamical models. However, by carefully keeping track of survey pointings on\nthe sky, detection limits, tracking fractions, and rate cuts, the biases from a\nsurvey can be modelled in Survey Simulator software. A Survey Simulator takes\nan intrinsic orbital model (from, for example, the output of a dynamical Kuiper\nbelt emplacement simulation) and applies the survey biases, so that the biased\nsimulated objects can be directly compared with real discoveries. This\nmethodology has been used with great success in the Outer Solar System Origins\nSurvey (OSSOS) and its predecessor surveys. In this chapter, we give four\nexamples of ways to use the OSSOS Survey Simulator to gain knowledge about the\ntrue structure of the Kuiper Belt.

Despite its young\nage ($<$1 Gyr), the star presents an anomalously low stellar activity level:\nthe measured logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ activity parameter lies slightly below the basal\nlevel; there is no significant time-variability in the logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ value;\nthere is no detection of the star in the X-rays. We present results of far-UV\nobservations of WASP-18 obtained with COS on board of Hubble Space Telescope\naimed at explaining this anomaly. From the star's spectral energy distribution,\nwe infer the extinction (E(B-V) $\\approx$ 0.01 mag) and then the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) column density for a number of ions, concluding that ISM\nabsorption is not the origin of the anomaly. We measure the flux of the four\nstellar emission features detected in the COS spectrum (CII, CIII, CIV, SiIV).\nComparing the CII/CIV flux ratio measured for WASP-18 with that derived from\nspectra of nearby stars with known age, we see that the far-UV spectrum of\nWASP-18 resembles that of old ($>$5 Gyr), inactive stars, in stark contrast\nwith its young age. We conclude that WASP-18 has an intrinsically low activity\nlevel, possibly caused by star-planet tidal interaction, as suggested by\nprevious studies. Re-scaling the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match\nthe flux of the SiIV line, yields an XUV integrated flux at the planet orbit of\n10.2 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.

The emergent polarization is sensitive to aspects of the\nplanet atmosphere such as the gas composition and the occurrence of condensates\nand their optical properties. Extracting this information will represent a\nmajor step in the characterization of exoplanets. The numerical simulations\npresented here show that the polarization of a spatially-unresolved exoplanet\nmay be detected by cross-correlating high-dispersion linear polarization and\nintensity (brightness) spectra of the planet-star system. The Doppler shift of\nthe planet-reflected starlight facilitates the separation of this signal from\nthe polarization introduced by the interstellar medium and the terrestrial\natmosphere. The selection of the orbital phases and wavelengths at which to\nstudy the planet is critical.

As shown in Paper I, a dynamical corotation torque arises due to the\nflow-induced asymmetric distortion of the corotation region and the evolving\nvortensity contrast between the librating horseshoe material and background\ndisc flow. Using simulations of laminar torqued discs containing migrating\nplanets, we demonstrate the existence of the four distinct migration regimes\npredicted in Paper I. In two regimes, the migration is approximately locked to\nthe inward or outward radial gas flow, and in the other regimes the planet\nundergoes outward runaway migration that eventually settles to fast steady\nmigration. In addition, we demonstrate torque and migration reversals induced\nby midplane magnetic stresses, with a bifurcation dependent on the disc surface\ndensity. We develop a model for fast migration, and show why the outward\nrunaway saturates to a steady speed, and examine phenomenologically its\ntermination due to changing local disc conditions.

The median period for brown dwarfs with disks is twice as long as\nfor those without (3.1 vs. 1.6 d), a signature of rotational braking by the\ndisk, albeit with small numbers. With an overall median period of 1.9 d, brown\ndwarfs in Taurus rotate slower than their counterparts in somewhat older (3-10\nMyr) star-forming regions, consistent with spin-up of the latter due to\ncontraction and angular momentum conservation, a clear sign that disk braking\noverall is inefficient and/or temporary in this mass domain.

Particularly, we find that the Na I\nlines core require a temperature of T=4210$\\pm$180K and that H$\\alpha$ requires\nT=4330$\\pm$520K. MASCARA-2b, like other planets orbiting A-type stars, receives\na large amount of UV energy from its host star.

This paper investigates the evolution\nof such discs if they are very massive, as may be the case if their progenitor\nwas a terrestrial planet, moon, or dwarf planet. Assuming the discs are\nphysically thin and flat, like Saturn's rings, their evolution is governed by\nPoynting-Robertson drag or viscous spreading, where the disc's effective\nviscosity is due to self-gravity wakes. For discs with masses >10^26 g, located\nin the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone, viscous spreading dominates\nthe evolution, and mass is transported both in- and outwards. When\noutwards-spreading material flows beyond the Roche limit, it coagulates into\nnew (minor) planets in a process analogous to the ongoing formation of moonlets\nat the outer edge of Saturn's rings. The newly formed bodies migrate outwards\nby exchanging angular momentum with the disc and coalesce into larger objects\nthrough mutual collisions. Eventually, the disc's Roche-limit overflow recycles\ntens of percent of the original disc mass; most ends up in a single large body\nnear 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the disc's outer edge. Hence, the recycling\nof a tidally disrupted super-Earth, for example, could yield an Earth-mass\nplanet on a ~10-h orbit, located in the habitable zone for 2-to-10-Gyr-old\nwhite dwarfs.

Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

The BVRI light curves all have the\nsame shape, with the slopes and amplitudes for VRI being systematically smaller\nthan in the B-band by factors of 0.77 +- 0.05, 0.50 +- 0.05, and 0.31 +- 0.05.\nWe rule out any hypothesis involving occultation of the primary star by any\nstar, planet, solid body, or optically thick cloud.

Many of the previous contributions assumed that their formation process\nproceeds similarly to rocky planet formation, via accretion of the satellite\nseeds, called satellitesimals. However, the satellitesimal formation itself\nposes a nontrivial problem as the dust evolution in the circumplanetary disk is\nheavily impacted by fast radial drift and thus dust growth to satellitesimals\nis hindered. To address this problem, we connected state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamical simulations of a circumplanetary disk around a Jupiter-mass\nplanet with dust growth and drift model in a post-processing step. We found\nthat there is an efficient pathway to satellitesimal formation if there is a\ndust trap forming within the disk. Thanks to the natural existence of an\noutward gas flow region in the hydrodynamical simulation, a significant dust\ntrap arises at the radial distance of 85~R$_{\\rm J}$ from the planet, where the\ndust-to-gas ratio becomes high enough to trigger streaming instability. The\nstreaming instability leads to the efficient formation of the satellite seeds.\nBecause of the constant infall of material from the circumstellar disk and the\nvery short timescale of dust evolution, the circumplanetary disk acts as a\nsatellitesimal factory, constantly processing the infalling dust to pebbles\nthat gather in the dust trap and undergo the streaming instability. \n\n"}

Fossilized Resonant Dropouts Tentatively Confirm Neptune's\n  Migration was Grainy and Slow Abstract: The migration of Neptune's resonances through the proto-Kuiper belt has been\nimprinted in the distribution of small bodies in the outer Solar System. Here\nwe analyze five published Neptune migration models in detail, focusing on the\nhigh pericenter distance (high-q) trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) near Neptune's\n5:2 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances, because they have large resonant\npopulations, are outside the main classical belt, and are relatively isolated\nfrom other strong resonances. We compare the observationally biased output from\nthese dynamical models with the detected TNOs from the Outer Solar System\nOrigins Survey, via its Survey Simulator. All of the four new OSSOS detections\nof high-q non-resonant TNOs are on the Sunward side of the 5:2 and 3:1\nresonances. We show that even after accounting for observation biases, this\nasymmetric distribution cannot be drawn from a uniform distribution of TNOs at\n2sigma confidence. As shown by previous work, our analysis here tentatively\nconfirms that the dynamical model that uses grainy slow Neptune migration\nprovides the best match to the real high-q TNO orbital data. However, due to\nextreme observational biases, we have very few high-q TNO discoveries with\nwhich to statistically constrain the models. Thus, this analysis provides a\nframework for future comparison between the output from detailed, dynamically\nclassified Neptune migration simulations and the TNO discoveries from future\nwell-characterized surveys. We show that a deeper survey (to a limiting\nr-magnitude of 26.0) with a similar survey area to OSSOS could statistically\ndistinguish between these five Neptune migration models. \n\n"}

We develop a simple model for planetary growth including pebble and\ngas accretion, and orbital migration in an evolving protoplanetary disk. The\nmodel is run for a population of 2000 stars with a range of disk masses and\nradii, and initial protoplanet orbits. The resulting planetary distribution is\ncompared with the observed population of extrasolar planets, and the model\nparameters are improved iteratively using a particle swarm optimization scheme.\nThe characteristics of the final planetary systems are mainly controlled by the\npebble isolation mass, which is the mass of a planet that perturbs nearby gas\nenough to halt the inward flux of drifting pebbles and stop growth. The pebble\nisolation mass increases with orbital distance so that giant planet cores can\nonly form in the outer disk. Giants migrate inwards, populating a wide range of\nfinal orbital distances. The best model fits have large initial protoplanet\nmasses, short pebble drift timescales, low disk viscosities, and short\natmospheric cooling times, all of which promote rapid growth. The model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed frequency and distribution of giant\nplanets and brown dwarfs. The fit for super Earths is poorer for single-planet\nsystems, but improves steadily when more protoplanets are included. Although\nthe study was designed to match the extrasolar planet distribution, analogs of\nthe Solar System form in 1-2% of systems that contain at least 4 protoplanets. \n\n"}

The aim of this paper is to determine the obliquity variations of Ceres\nand Vesta and to study their rotational stability.\n  Methods.

A\nlarge span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started\non its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can\ntrigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.\nThe outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a\nquality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the\nresonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality\nfactor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with\npost-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations\ncapable of reaching 11 degrees.

We also present various other models\nwhere we explore the effects of pebble accretion, the fragmentation velocity\nthreshold, the global metallicity of the disk, and a time-dependent gas\naccretion rate.

Host stellar\nabundances are good proxies of planetary abundances, but only for refractory\nelements. This is particularly true for terrestrial planets, as evidenced by\nthe relative differences in bulk chemical composition between the Sun and the\nEarth and other inner solar system bodies. The elemental abundances of a planet\nhost star must therefore be devolatilised in order to correctly represent the\nbulk chemical composition of its terrestrial planets. Furthermore, nickel and\nlight elements make an important contribution alongside iron to the core of\nterrestrial planets. We therefore adopt an extended chemical network of the\ncore, constrained by an Fe/Ni ratio of 18 $\\pm$ 4 (by number).

The supernova explosion\nof a nearby star, possibly but not necessarily the exploding Wolf-Rayet star,\nheated the disk to $\\apgt 1500$K, melting small dust grains and causing the\nencapsulation and preservation of $^{26}$Al into vitreous droplets. This\nsupernova, and possibly several others, caused a further abrasion of the disk\nand led to its observed tilt of $5.6\\pm1.2^\\circ$ with respect to the Sun's\nequatorial plane. The abundance of $^{60}$Fe originates from a supernova shell,\nbut its preservation results from a subsequent supernova. At least two\nsupernovae are needed (one to deliver $^{60}$Fe\\, and one to preserve it in the\ndisk) to explain the observed characteristics of the Solar system. The most\nprobable birth cluster then has $N = 2500\\pm300$ stars and a radius of $r_{\\rm\nvir} = 0.75\\pm0.25$ pc.

The majority of direct mass\nmeasurements for stellar and sub-stellar objects typically only come from\nobservations of binary systems. Hence microlensing provides an important\nchannel for direct mass measurements of single stars.

However,\nthe Gaia catalog is incomplete for nearby very-low-mass objects such as brown\ndwarfs for which mass measurements are most crucial. We employ a catalog of\nvery-low-mass objects from Pan-STARRS data release 1 (PDR1) as potential lens\nstars, and we use the objects from Gaia data release 2 (GDR2) as potential\nsource stars.

The mass determined from this orbit combined with the volume computed\nfrom the shape model implies a density for Daphne of 1.77+/-0.26 g/cm3 (3\n{\\sigma}). This density is consistent with a primordial CM-like homogeneous\ninternal structure with some level of macroporosity (~17%). Conclusions. Based\non our analysis of the density of Daphne and 75 other Ch/Cgh-type asteroids\ngathered from the literature, we conclude that the primordial internal\nstructure of the CM parent bodies was homogeneous. \n\n"}

The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt.

More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

Clear detection of still-forming planets\nembedded within gas-rich disks is rare. HD 169142 is a very young Herbig Ae-Be\nstar surrounded by a pre-transitional disk, composed of at least three rings.\nWhile claims of sub-stellar objects around this star have been made previously,\nfollow-up studies remain inconclusive. We used SPHERE at ESO VLT to obtain a\nsequence of high-contrast images of the immediate surroundings of this star\nover about three years.

While we were unable to definitively confirm the\nprevious claims of a massive sub-stellar object at 0.1-0.15 arcsec from the\nstar, we found both spirals and blobs within the disk. The spiral pattern may\nbe explained as due to the presence of a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary\narm excited by a planet of a few Jupiter masses lying along the primary arm,\nlikely in the cavities between the rings. The blobs orbit the star consistently\nwith Keplerian motion, allowing a dynamical determination of the mass of the\nstar. While most of these blobs are located within the rings, we found that one\nof them lies in the cavity between the rings, along the primary arm of the\nspiral design. This blob might be due to a planet that might also be\nresponsible for the spiral pattern observed within the rings and for the cavity\nbetween the two rings. The planet itself is not detected at short wavelengths,\nwhere we only see a dust cloud illuminated by stellar light, but the planetary\nphotosphere might be responsible for the emission observed in the K band.
