Above Q^2=1.5 GeV^2, the Fpi values are systematically\nbelow the monopole parameterization that describes the low Q^2 data used to\ndetermine the pion charge radius. The pion form factor can be calculated in a\nwide variety of theoretical approaches, and the experimental results are\ncompared to a number of calculations. This comparison is helpful in\nunderstanding the role of soft versus hard contributions to hadronic structure\nin the intermediate Q^2 regime. \n\n"}

Besides the change of\neccentricity due to distortion from gluon saturation or event-by-event\nfluctuation, we find that the $v_2$ is also sensitive to the centrality\ndependence of multiplicity and the relative size between the matter profile and\nthe jet profile.

Of particular interest in this context\nare the search for right-handed currents or for scalar and tensor interactions.\nPrecision measurements of neutron decay observables address important open\nquestions of particle physics and cosmology, and are generally complementary to\ndirect searches for new physics beyond the SM in high-energy physics.

According to the AMD, the Be-9 nucleus consists of\ntwo alpha-like clusters with a surrounding neutron. The clustering produces\nhigh-momentum components in nuclear wave functions, which affects nuclear\nmodifications of the structure functions. We investigated whether clustering\nfeatures could appear in the structure function F_2 of Be-9 along with studies\nfor other light nuclei. We found that nuclear modifications of F_2 are similar\nin both AMD and shell models within our simple convolution description although\nthere are slight differences in Be-9.

If nuclear-modification slopes d(F_2^A/F_2^D)/dx are shown by\nthe maximum local densities, the Be-9 anomaly can be explained by the AMD\npicture, namely by the clustering structure, whereas it certainly cannot be\ndescribed in the simple shell model.

Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays.

Several proposals have\nbeen made for new particles that account for both the Lamb shift and the muon\nanomalous moment discrepancies. Purpose: We explore the possibility that new\nparticles' couplings to the muon can be fine-tuned to account for all\nexperimental constraints. Method: We consider two fine-tuned models, the first\ninvolving new particles with scalar and pseudoscalar couplings, and the second\ninvolving new particles with vector and axial couplings. The couplings are\nconstrained by the Lamb shift and muon magnetic moments measurements while mass\nconstraints are obtained by kaon decay rate data. Results: For the\nscalar-pseudoscalar model, masses between 100 to 200 MeV are not allowed. For\nthe vector model, masses below about 200 MeV are not allowed. The strength of\nthe couplings for both models approach that of electrodynamics for particle\nmasses of about 2 GeV.

Large\nsuppression and azimuthal anisotropy of single electrons have been observed in\nAu+Au collisions at 200 GeV.

The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse\nshape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events. This\npaper documents the algorithms developed before the data of Phase I were\nunblinded. The double escape peak (DEP) and Compton edge events of 2.615 MeV\n\\gamma\\ rays from ^{208}Tl decays as well as 2\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decays of ^{76}Ge\nare used as proxies for 0\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decay. For BEGe detectors the chosen\nselection is based on a single pulse shape parameter. It accepts 0.92$\\pm$0.02\nof signal-like events while about 80% of the background events at\nQ_{\\beta\\beta}=2039 keV are rejected.\n  For semi-coaxial detectors three analyses are developed. The one based on an\nartificial neural network is used for the search of 0\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decay. It\nretains 90% of DEP events and rejects about half of the events around\nQ_{\\beta\\beta}. The 2\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ events have an efficiency of 0.85\\pm0.02\nand the one for 0\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decays is estimated to be 0.90^{+0.05}_{-0.09}.\nA second analysis uses a likelihood approach trained on Compton edge events.\nThe third approach uses two pulse shape parameters. The latter two methods\nconfirm the classification of the neural network since about 90% of the data\nevents rejected by the neural network are also removed by both of them. In\ngeneral, the selection efficiency extracted from DEP events agrees well with\nthose determined from Compton edge events or from 2\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decays. \n\n"}

The\n(anti)neutrino-nucleus cross sections for $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{56}$Fe and\n$^{208}$Pb are calculated in the framework of relativistic nuclear energy\ndensity functional and weak Hamiltonian, while the cross sections for inelastic\nscattering on free protons, $p(\\bar{\\nu}_{e},e^{+})n$, are obtained using\nheavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory.

This approach provides new\ninsights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying\nconfinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a\nrelativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective\nconfinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS\nspace. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron\nspectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods\ndescribed here gives a precise interpretation of holographic variables and\nquantities in AdS in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This\nleads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant\nlight-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound\nstates in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the\nexcitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states\nlie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and\norbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here\ncurrents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a\nproduct of poles. At large $q^2$ the form factor incorporates the correct\npower-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and\nis dictated by the twist. At low $q^2$ the form factor leads to vector\ndominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses. We\nbriefly review in this report other holographic approaches to QCD, in\nparticular top-down and bottom-up models based on chiral symmetry breaking.

The comparison emphasises\nthat experiment is sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running\ncouplings and masses in the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model and\nhighlights that the key to describing hadron properties is a veracious\nexpression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the bound-state problem.\nAmongst the results we describe, the following are of particular interest:\n$G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ possesses a zero at $Q^2=9.5GeV^2$; any change in the\ninteraction which shifts a zero in the proton ratio to larger $Q^2$ relocates a\nzero in $G_E^n(Q^2)/G_M^n(Q^2)$ to smaller $Q^2$; and there is likely a value\nof momentum transfer above which $G_E^n>G_E^p$.

We fill this gap by\nperforming an optimization and statistical analysis of all the low-energy\nconstants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Our optimization protocol\ncorresponds to a simultaneous fit to scattering and bound-state observables in\nthe pion-nucleon, nucleon-nucleon, and few-nucleon sectors, thereby utilizing\nthe full model capabilities of chiEFT. We study the effect on other observables\nby demonstrating error-propagation methods that can easily be adopted by future\nworks.

QCD is characterised by two emergent\nphenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are\nexpressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion\nproperties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a\nNambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in\nNature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to\nrevealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental\nprogress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting\nboth improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved\nin the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.\nBoth challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a\ntheoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB\nworks to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,\nensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all\nthe mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and\nneutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton\ndistribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form\nfactor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions\nfor the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by\nexperiments planned at JLab 12.

The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer\n(SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach - up to the anticipated\n11-GeV beam energy in Hall C - and coincidence capability with the\nwell-understood High Momentum Spectrometer, will allow for probes of such\nhadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to\ndate. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has\nbeen constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray\nfollowed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive\nindices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray\ncombination will allow for identification of kaons from 1 GeV/c up to 7.2\nGeV/c, reaching 10^-2 proton and 10^-3 pion rejection, with kaon detection\nefficiency better than 95%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with\n14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes.

The spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented with\ndoublets, triplets and bidoublet scalars. The fermion sector is extended with\nan extra sterile neutrino per generation that helps in implementing the seesaw\nmechanism. The presence of extra particles in the model exactly cancels type-I\nseesaw and allows large value for Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$.

In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted.

The dependence\nof the kurtosis (of the event-by-event distribution of the number of protons)\non rapidity near mid-rapidity will change qualitatively if a critical point is\npassed in the scan.

The purpose of this experiment is to extract the\ncarbon-12 elastic cross section around the first diffraction minimum, where the\nBorn term contributions to the cross section are small to maximize the\nsensitivity to dispersive effects. The analysis uses the LEDEX data from the\nhigh resolution Jefferson Lab Hall A spectrometers to extract the cross\nsections near the first diffraction minimum of 12C at beam energies of 362 MeV\nand 685 MeV.

A set of realistic models of the equation of\nstate that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and\nsupport neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal\npolarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a\nuniversal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness\nparameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS.

The total conservative (optimistic) composition uncertainty in the\npredicted 8B neutrino flux is 11.6% (5.0%) when sensitivities to individual\nelement abundances are used.

{"id": "astro-ph/9811350", "contents": "Title: Can a supernova be located by its neutrinos? Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

By studying these fluctuations as a function of varying control\nparameters, such as the collision energy, it is possible to learn much about\nthe phase diagram of QCD. As a timely example, we stress the methods by which\npresent experiments at the CERN SPS can locate the second order critical point\nat which a line of first order phase transitions ends.

We\nfocus on observables constructed from the multiplicity and transverse momenta\nof charged pions.

Isotopically resolved yield distributions of projectile fragments in\nthe range Z=10-36 from these reaction pairs were measured with the MARS recoil\nseparator in the angular range 2.7-5.3 degrees. The velocities of the residues,\nmonotonically decreasing with Z down to Z~26-28, are employed to characterize\nthe excitation energy. The yield ratios R21(N,Z) for each pair of systems are\nfound to exhibit isotopic scaling (isoscaling), namely, an exponential\ndependence on the fragment atomic number Z and neutron number N. The isoscaling\nis found to occur in the residue Z range corresponding to the maximum observed\nexcitation energies. The corresponding isoscaling parameters are alpha=0.43 and\nbeta=-0.50 for the Kr+Sn system and alpha=0.27 and beta=-0.34 for the Kr+Ni\nsystem. For the Kr+Sn system, for which the experimental angular acceptance\nrange lies inside the grazing angle, isoscaling was found to occur for Z<26 and\nN<34.
