We address this issue in a lattice QCD with\nthe use of a dimensional reduction formula of the fermion determinant.\n  We investigate spectral properties of a reduced matrix of the reduction\nformula. Lattice simulations with different lattice sizes show that the\neigenvalues of the reduced matrix follow a scaling law for the temporal size\n$N_t$. The properties of the fermion determinant are examined using the\nreduction formula. We find that as a consequence of the $N_t$ scaling law, the\nfermion determinant becomes insensitive to $\\mu$ as $T$ decreases, and\n$\\mu$-independent at T=0 for $\\mu<m_\\pi/2$.\n  The $N_t$ scaling law provides two types of the low temperature limit of the\nfermion determinant: (i) for low density and (ii) for high-density. The fermion\ndeterminant becomes real and the theory is free from the sign problem in both\ncases. In case of (ii), QCD approaches to a theory, where quarks interact only\nin spatial directions, and gluons interact via the ordinary Yang-Mills action.\nThe partition function becomes exactly $Z_3$ invariant even in the presence of\ndynamical quarks because of the absence of the temporal interaction of quarks.\n  The reduction formula is also applied to the canonical formalism and Lee-Yang\nzero theorem. We find characteristic temperature dependences of the canonical\ndistribution and of Lee-Yang zero trajectory. Using an assumption on the\ncanonical partition function, we discuss physical meaning of those temperature\ndependences and show that the change of the canonical distribution and Lee-Yang\nzero trajectory are related to the existence/absence of $\\mu$-induced phase\ntransitions. \n\n"}

The d-dimensional boundaries\nof (d+1)-dimensional topological phases of matter such as quantum Hall systems\nand topological insulators provide new types of many-fermion systems that are\ntopologically distinct from conventional d-dimensional many-fermion systems.

In addition to power-law finite volume effects, the\nstandard lattice gauge theory approach introduces non-locality through removal\nof photon zero-momentum modes. The resulting finite volume effects must be\nquantitatively understood; and, to this end, non-relativistic effective field\ntheories are an efficient tool, especially in the case of composite particles.\nRecently an oddity related to non-locality of the standard lattice approach was\nuncovered by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal collaboration. Explicit\ncontributions from antiparticles appear to be required so that finite volume\nQED results for a point-like fermion can be reproduced in the effective field\ntheory description. We provide transparency for this argument by considering\npoint-like scalars and spinors in finite volume QED using the method of\nregions. For the more germane case of composite particles, we determine that\nantiparticle modes contribute to the finite-volume electromagnetic mass of\ncomposite spinors through terms proportional to the squares of time-like form\nfactors evaluated at threshold. We extend existing finite volume calculations\nto one order higher, which is particularly relevant for the electromagnetic\nmass of light nuclei.

Due to the vast number of environmental degrees of freedom, it is\nchallenging to accurately calculate decoherence times $T_2$, especially when\nthe qubit and environment are highly correlated.\n  Hybrid or mixed electron-nuclear spin qubits, such as donors in silicon,\npossess 'optimal working points' (OWPs) which are sweet-spots for reduced\ndecoherence in magnetic fields. Analysis of sharp variations of $T_2$ near OWPs\nwas previously based on insensitivity to classical noise, even though hybrid\nqubits are situated in highly correlated quantum environments, such as the\nnuclear spin bath of $^{29}$Si impurities. This presented limited understanding\nof the decoherence mechanism and gave unreliable predictions for $T_2$.\n  I present quantum many-body calculations of the qubit-bath dynamics, which\n(i) yield $T_2$ for hybrid qubits in excellent agreement with experiments in\nmultiple regimes, (ii) elucidate the many-body nature of the nuclear spin bath\nand (iii) expose significant differences between quantum-bath and\nclassical-field decoherence.

The Banks-Casher relation\nties the chiral condensate to the density of low lying modes; thus, it is\nplausible that removal of such modes could lead to a regime where spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking does not occur. Surprising, a pattern of identical\ncorrelation functions was observed that is larger than can be explained by a\nrestoration of chiral symmetry. This suggests that a larger symmetry---one that\nis not present in the QCD lagrangian---emerges when these modes are removed.\nPreviously it was argued that this emergent symmetry was SU(4). However, when\nthe low-lying modes are removed, the correlation functions of sources in the\nSU(4) 15-plet of spin-1 mesons appear to coincide with the correlation function\nof the SU(4) singlet. A natural explanation for this is an emergent symmetry\nlarger than SU(4).

We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor\ndynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also\noptimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is\nknown that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the\nscaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region.

{"id": "1603.05988", "contents": "Title: Deflation as a Method of Variance Reduction for Estimating the Trace of\n  a Matrix Inverse Abstract: Many fields require computing the trace of the inverse of a large, sparse\nmatrix. The typical method used for such computations is the Hutchinson method\nwhich is a Monte Carlo (MC) averaging over matrix quadratures. To improve its\nconvergence, several variance reductions techniques have been proposed. In this\npaper, we study the effects of deflating the near null singular value space. We\nmake two main contributions.\n  First, we analyze the variance of the Hutchinson method as a function of the\ndeflated singular values and vectors. Although this provides good intuition in\ngeneral, by assuming additionally that the singular vectors are random unitary\nmatrices, we arrive at concise formulas for the deflated variance that include\nonly the variance and mean of the singular values. We make the remarkable\nobservation that deflation may increase variance for Hermitian matrices but not\nfor non-Hermitian ones. This is a rare, if not unique, property where\nnon-Hermitian matrices outperform Hermitian ones. The theory can be used as a\nmodel for predicting the benefits of deflation.\n  Second, we use deflation in the context of a large scale application of\n\"disconnected diagrams\" in Lattice QCD. On lattices, Hierarchical Probing (HP)\nhas previously provided an order of magnitude of variance reduction over MC by\nremoving \"error\" from neighboring nodes of increasing distance in the lattice.\nAlthough deflation used directly on MC yields a limited improvement of 30% in\nour problem, when combined with HP they reduce variance by a factor of over 60\ncompared to MC. For this, we pre-computated 1000 smallest singular values of an\nill-conditioned matrix of size 25 million. Using PRIMME and a domain-specific\nAlgebraic Multigrid preconditioner, we perform one of the largest eigenvalue\ncomputations in Lattice QCD at a fraction of the cost of our trace computation. \n\n"}

This smallness\ncomplicates determining isospin breaking from lattice QCD computations that\ninclude electromagnetism. One solution to this problem consists of performing\ncomputations using larger-than-physical values of the electric charge, and\nsubsequently extrapolating (or interpolating) to the physical value of the\nfine-structure constant. Motivated by recent lattice QCD + QED computations of\nelectromagnetic masses employing this setup, we consider finite-volume effects\narising from the use of larger-than-physical electric charges. A modified\npower-counting scheme, which is based on treating the fine-structure constant\nas larger than its physical value, is explored.

The FFs are expressed as dispersive\nintegrals over the two-pion cut at $t > 4 M_\\pi^2$. The spectral functions are\nobtained from the elastic unitarity condition and expressed as products of the\ncomplex $\\pi\\pi \\rightarrow N\\bar N$ partial-wave amplitudes and the timelike\npion FF. $\\chi$EFT is used to calculate the ratio of the partial-wave\namplitudes and the pion FF, which is real and free of $\\pi\\pi$ rescattering in\nthe $t$-channel ($N/D$ method). The rescattering effects are then incorporated\nby multiplying with the squared modulus of the empirical pion FF. The procedure\nresults in a marked improvement compared to conventional $\\chi$EFT calculations\nof the spectral functions. We apply the method to the nucleon scalar FF and\ncompute the scalar spectral function, the scalar radius, the $t$-dependent FF,\nand the Cheng-Dashen discrepancy. Higher-order chiral corrections are estimated\nthrough the $\\pi N$ low-energy constants. Results are in excellent agreement\nwith dispersion-theoretical calculations. We elaborate several other\ninteresting aspects of our method. The results show proper scaling behavior in\nthe large-$N_c$ limit of QCD because the $\\chi$EFT calculation includes $N$ and\n$\\Delta$ intermediate states. The squared modulus of the timelike pion FF\nrequired by our method can be extracted from Lattice QCD calculations of vacuum\ncorrelation functions of the operator at large Euclidean distances.

However, these calculations\nsuffer from an exponentially bad signal-to-noise problem which has prevented a\ncontrolled extrapolation to the physical point. The variational method has been\napplied very successfully to two-meson systems, allowing for the extraction of\nthe two-meson states very early in Euclidean time through the use of improved\nsingle hadron operators. The sheer numerical cost of using the same techniques\nin two-baryon systems has been prohibitive. We present an alternate strategy\nwhich offers some of the same advantages as the variational method while being\nsignificantly less numerically expensive. We first use the Matrix Prony method\nto form an optimal linear combination of single baryon interpolating fields\ngenerated from the same source and different sink interpolators. Very early in\nEuclidean time this linear combination is numerically free of excited state\ncontamination, so we coin it a calm baryon. This calm baryon operator is then\nused in the construction of the two-baryon correlation functions.\n  To test this method, we perform calculations on the WM/JLab iso-clover gauge\nconfigurations at the SU(3) flavor symmetric point with m{\\pi} $\\sim$ 800 MeV\n--- the same configurations we have previously used for the calculation of\ntwo-nucleon correlation functions.

For the local two-nucleon correlation function\n(where both nucleons are created from the same space-time location) there is\nstill improvement, but there is significant excited state contamination in the\nregion the single calm baryon displays no excited state contamination. \n\n"}

In particular,\nthe binary pulsar observation of heavy neutron stars requires appropriately\nstiff dense matter in order to counter gravitational collapse, at variance with\nthe predictions of many phenomenological quark models. On the other side, the\nLIGO observations favor a softer EoS therefore providing a lower bound to the\nequation stiffness. We introduce a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) description of\nthe neutron star's high baryon density regime where the pressure and energy\ndensity distributions are directly obtained from the matrix elements of the QCD\nenergy momentum tensor. Recent ab initio calculations allow us to evaluate the\nenergy-momentum tensor in a model independent way including both quark and\ngluon degrees of freedom. Our approach is a first effort to replace quark\nmodels and effective gluon interactions with a first principles, fully\nQCD-based description.

Our framework\nincorporates four major components. (i) The recently established existence of\nspace-time order at all scales (fundamental structure) observed directly in\ntypical configurations of regularized path-integral ensembles. (ii) The notion\nof scale-dependent vacuum structure (effective structure) providing the means\nfor representing and quantifying the influence of fluctuations at various\nscales on physical observables (phenomena). (iii) The unified description of\ngauge and fermionic aspects of the theory which facilitates a high level of\nspace-time order in the path-integral ensembles. (iv) The strict ``Bottom-Up''\napproach wherein the process of identifying the vacuum structure proceeds\ninductively, using the information from valid lattice QCD ensembles as the only\ninput. In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of\nspace-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of\nthe path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the\nalgorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained\ndescriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure. The\ncorresponding ensemble averages define the ranking of different lattice\ntheories at given cutoff by the degree of space-time order generated via their\ndynamics. We then introduce the set of local transformations of a\nconfiguration, chiral orderings, in which the transformed gauge connection\nrepresents an effective matrix phase acquired by chiral fermion when hopping\nover a given link. It is proposed that chiral orderings facilitate the\nevolution in the set of actions which increases the degree of space-time order\nwhile preserving the physical content of the theory, and should thus be used in\nthe search for the fundamental QCD vacuum structure. The relation to\nrenormalization group ideas is discussed, and the first step in general\nformulation of effective lattice QCD realizing the notion of scale-dependent\nvacuum structure is given. \n\n"}
