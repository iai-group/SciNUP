It\nrelies on the method developed by Ren\\'e Garnier and published in 1928 in a\npaper which seems today to be totally forgotten. Garnier's approach is more\ngeometrical and constructive than the variational one, and it provides minimal\ndisks without branch point. However, it is sometimes really complicated, and\neven obscure or incomplete. Following Garnier's initial ideas, we propose a new\nproof, which intends not only to be complete, but also simpler and moderner\nthan his one. This work mainly relies on a systematic use of Fuchsian systems\nand on the relation that we establish between the reality of such systems and\ntheir monodromy. Garnier's method is based on the following fact: using the\nspinor Weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces, we can associate a real\nFuchsian second-order equation, defined on the Riemann sphere, with each\nminimal disk with a polygonal boundary curve. The monodromy of the equation is\ndetermined by the oriented directions of the edges of the boundary. To solve\nthe Plateau problem, we are thus led to solve a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We\nthen proceed in two steps: first, by means of isomonodromic deformations, we\nconstruct and describe the family of all minimal disks with a polygonal\nboundary curve of given oriented directions. Then we use this description to\nstudy the edges's lengths of their boundary curves, and we show that every\npolygon is the boundary of a minimal disk. \n\n"}

This polynomial closure is typical for 2nd order\nsuperintegrable systems in 2D and for 2nd order systems in 3D with\nnondegenerate (4-parameter) potentials. However the degenerate 3-parameter\npotential for the 3D extended Kepler-Coulomb system (also 2nd order\nsuperintegrable) is an exception, as its quadratic symmetry algebra doesn't\nclose polynomially.

Their investigation over the finite fields has not been\ndone thoroughly, partly because of the indeterminacies that appear in defining\nthe equations. In this paper we introduce two methods to well-define the\nequations over the finite fields and apply the methods to several classes of\ndiscrete integrable equations. One method is to extend the space of initial\nconditions through blowing-up at the singular points.

As\nillustrative examples, we consider generalizations of the NLS and DNLS\nequations, as well as a PT-symmetric version of the NLS equation. It is\ndemonstrated that the techniques yield Lax- or S-integrable NLPDEs with both\ntime- AND space-dependent coefficients which are thus more general than almost\nall cases considered earlier via other methods such as the Painleve Test, Bell\nPolynomials, and various similarity methods. However, this technique, although\noperationally effective, has the significant disadvantage that, for any\nintegrable system with spatiotemporally varying coefficients, one must 'guess'\na generaliza- tion of the structure of the known Lax Pair for the corresponding\nsystem with constant coefficients.

They are subalgebras of\nLie algebras over a ring of rational functions, defined by invariance under the\naction of a finite group, the reduction group. Since their introduction in 2005\na classification is pursued. Past work shows remarkable uniformity between the\nLie algebras associated to different reduction groups. That is, many\nAutomorphic Lie Algebras with nonisomorphic reduction groups are isomorphic. In\nthis thesis we set out to find the origin of these observations by searching\nfor properties that are independent of the reduction group, called invariants\nof Automorphic Lie Algebras.\n  Several invariants are obtained and used to set up a structure theory for\nAutomorphic Lie Algebras. This naturally leads to a cohomology theory for root\nsystems. A first exploration of this structure theory narrows down the search\nfor Automorphic Lie Algebras significantly. Various particular cases are fully\ndetermined by their invariants, including most of the previously studied\nAutomorphic Lie Algebras, thereby providing an explanation for their\nuniformity. In addition, the structure theory advances the classification\nproject. For example, it clarifies the effect of a change in pole orbit\nresulting in various new Cartan-Weyl normal form generators for Automorphic Lie\nAlgebras. From a more general perspective, the success of the structure theory\nand root cohomology in absence of a field promises interesting theoretical\ndevelopments for Lie algebras over a graded ring. \n\n"}

The partition function $Z(\\mathbf{t})$ deformed by an\ninfinite number of external potentials is a tau function of the KP hierarchy\nwith respect to the coupling constants $\\mathbf{t} = (t_1,t_2,\\ldots)$. A\nsingle-variate specialization $Z(x)$ of $Z(\\mathbf{t})$ satisfies a\n$q$-difference equation representing the quantum spectral curve of the melting\ncrystal model.

The\nfusion relations for the transfer matrix, stemming from the Yang-Baxter algebra\nproperties, provide the necessary closure relations to define the action of the\ntransfer matrix on such a basis in terms of elementary local shifts, leading to\na separate transfer matrix spectral problem. Hence our scheme extends to the\nquantum case a key feature of Liouville-Arnold classical integrability\nframework where the complete set of conserved charges defines both the level\nmanifold and the flows on it leading to the construction of action-angle\nvariables.

As\nfor the previous case of the STR, the Z-invariance property is shown through\nthe use of local cubic-type deformations of a 2-dimensional surface associated\nto the models, which allow an extension of the models onto a subset of next\nnearest neighbour vertices of $\\mathbb{Z}^3$, while leaving the partition\nfunctions invariant. These deformations are permitted as a consequence of the\nrespective YBE's satisfied by the models. The quasi-classical limit is also\nconsidered, and it is shown that an analogous Z-invariance property holds for\nthe variational formulation of classical discrete Laplace equations which arise\nin this limit. From this limit, new integrable 3D-consistent multi-component\nquad equations are proposed, which are constructed from a degeneration of the\nequations of motion for IRF Boltzmann weights. \n\n"}

EPDiff admits a remarkable ansatz for its singular solutions,\ncalled ``diffeons,'' whose momenta are supported on embedded subspaces of the\nambient space. Diffeons are true solitons for some choices of the norm. The\ndiffeon solution ansatz is a momentum map. Consequently. the diffeons evolve\naccording to canonical Hamiltonian equations. We examine diffeon solutions on\nEinstein spaces that are \"mostly\" symmetric, i.e., whose quotient by a subgroup\nof the isometry group is 1-dimensional. An example is the two-sphere, whose\nisometry group $\\SO{3}$ contains $S^1$. In this situation, the singular\ndiffeons (called ``Puckons'') are supported on latitudes (``girdles'') of the\nsphere. For this $S^1$ symmetry of the two-sphere, the canonical Hamiltonian\ndynamics for Puckons reduces from integral partial differential equations to a\ndynamical system of ordinary differential equations for their colatitudes.\nExplicit examples are computed numerically for the motion and interaction of\nthe Puckons on the sphere with respect to the $H^1$ norm.

{"id": "solv-int/9801017", "contents": "Title: The classical r-matrix in a geometric framework Abstract: We use a Riemannian (or pseudo-Riemannian) geometric framework to formulate\nthe theory of the classical r-matrix for integrable systems. In this picture\nthe r-matrix is related to a fourth rank tensor, named the r-tensor, on the\nconfiguration space. The r-matrix itself carries one connection type index and\nthree tensorial indices. Being defined on the configuration space it has no\nmomentum dependence but is dynamical in the sense of depending on the\nconfiguration variables. The tensorial nature of the r-matrix is used to derive\nits transformation properties. The resulting transformation formula turns out\nto be valid for a general r-matrix structure independently of the geometric\nframework. Moreover, the entire structure of the r-matrix equation follows\ndirectly from a simple covariant expression involving the Lax matrix and its\ncovariant derivative. Therefore it is argued that the geometric formulation\nproposed here helps to improve the understanding of general r-matrix\nstructures. It is also shown how the Jacobi identity gives rise to a\ngeneralized dynamical classical Yang-Baxter equation involving the Riemannian\ncurvature. \n\n"}
