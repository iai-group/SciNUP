In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the\nB-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending\non whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be\novercome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian\nitself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal\nfooting and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling.

We\nfocus on the regime where the initial inter-atomic interactions dominate over\nthe kinetic energy and the disorder. At equilibrium in a trapping potential and\nfor small disorder, the condensate shows a Thomas-Fermi shape modified by the\ndisorder. When the condensate is released from the trap, a strong suppression\nof the expansion is obtained in contrast to the situation in a periodic\npotential with similar characteristics. This effect crucially depends on both\nthe momentum distribution of the expanding BEC and the strength of the\ndisorder. For strong disorder, the suppression of the expansion results from\nthe fragmentation of the core of the condensate and from classical reflections\nfrom large modulations of the disordered potential in the tails of the\ncondensate. We identify the corresponding disorder-induced trapping scenario\nfor which large atom-atom interactions and strong reflections from single\nmodulations of the disordered potential play central roles.

Our new approach consists in replacing, where appropriate in the\nChapman-Enskog procedure, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution weight function\n(used in the standard first Sonine approximation) by the homogeneous cooling\nstate distribution for each species. The rationale for doing this lies in the\nfact that, as it is well known, the non-Maxwellian contributions to the\ndistribution function of the granular mixture become more important in the\nrange of strong dissipation we are interested in.

The mathematical model we apply is based on a\ntubular description of double helices assuming hard walls. When the base-pairs\nof the linker-DNA is included the estimate of the size of an ideal nucleosome\nis in close agreement with the experimental numbers. Interestingly, the size of\nthe nucleosome is shown to be a consequence of intrinsic properties of the DNA\ndouble helix. \n\n"}

Abstract: The interplay between superconducting fluctuations and inhomogeneities\npresents a renewed interest due to recent works supporting an anomalous [beyond\nthe conventional Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau (GGL) scenario] diamagnetism above Tc\nin underdoped cuprates. This conclusion, mainly based in the observation of new\nanomalies in the low-field isothermal magnetization curves, is in contradiction\nwith our earlier results in the underdoped La(1.9)Sr(0.1)CuO(4) [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 84, 3157 (2000)]. These seemingly intrinsic anomalies are being presented\nin various influential works as a 'thermodynamic evidence' for phase incoherent\nsuperconductivity in the pseudogap regime, this last being at present a central\nand debated issue of the cuprate superconductors' physics. Here we have\nextended our magnetization measurements in La(1.9)Sr(0.1)CuO(4) to two samples\nwith different chemical disorder, in one of them close to the one associated\nwith the random distribution of Sr ions. For this sample, the corresponding\nTc-distribution may be approximated as symmetric around the average Tc, while\nin the most disordered sample is strongly asymmetric. The comparison between\nthe magnetization measured in both samples provides a crucial check of the\nchemical disorder origin of the observed diamagnetism anomalies, which are\nsimilar to those claimed as due to phase fluctuations by other authors. This\nconclusion applies also to the sample affected only by the intrinsic-like\nchemical disorder, providing then a further check that the intrinsic\ndiamagnetism above the superconducting transition of underdoped cuprates is not\naffected by the opening of a pseudogap in the normal state. It is also shown\nhere that once these disorder effects are overcome, the remaining precursor\ndiamagnetism may be accounted at a quantitative level in terms of the GGL\napproach under a total energy cutoff. \n\n"}

For non-degenerate\nmulti-orbital models, our U(1) approach is advantageous in that it captures the\nnon-interacting limit at the mean-field level. For systems with either a single\norbital or degenerate multiple orbitals, the U(1) and $Z_2$ slave-spin\napproachs yield the same results in the slave-spin-condensed phase.

In atomic systems, where interactions\nrequire wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be\nrealized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to\nnearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist in the\nabsence of tunneling and extend beyond nearest neighbors. This allows coherent\nspin dynamics to persist even at high entropy and low lattice filling. Effects\nof dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have so far been limited\nto the modification of chemical reactions. We now report the observation of\ndipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a 3D optical lattice.

Although\nseveral exotic physical properties have been predicted theoretically, the\nexperimental realization of such an unusual superconducting state has not been\nachieved so far. Here we show that pure single crystals of superconducting FeSe\noffer the possibility to enter the previously unexplored realm where the three\nenergies, Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$, superconducting gap $\\Delta$ and\nZeeman energy, become comparable. Through the superfluid response, transport,\nthermoelectric response, and spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy, we demonstrate that $\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$ of FeSe is extremely\nsmall, with the ratio $\\Delta/\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}\\sim1 (\\sim0.3)$ in the\nelectron (hole) band. Moreover, thermal-conductivity measurements give evidence\nof a distinct phase line below the upper critical field, where the Zeeman\nenergy becomes comparable to $\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$ and $\\Delta$. The\nobservation of this field-induced phase provides insights into previously\npoorly understood aspects of the highly spin-polarized Fermi liquid in the\nBCS-BEC crossover regime. \n\n"}

Motivated by a growing mosaic of materials, we\nespecially consider a broad range of nearest-neighbour interactions consisting\nof Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya as well as anisotropic ferro$-$ and antiferromagnetic\ncoupling.

The mapping is exact for\nclassical and quantum spins alike, i.e. it preserves the energy spectrum of the\noriginal Heisenberg and XXZ models. As a consequence, at the classical level,\nall phases have an extensive ground-state degeneracy.

If it is\nodd under time-reversal, the Cooper channel of the interaction will be fully\nrepulsive leading to sign changes of the gap and making spontaneous\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking possible. To discuss topological properties, we\nfocus on fully gapped time-reversal symmetric superconductors and derive\nconstraints on possible pairing states that yield necessary conditions for the\nemergence of topologically nontrivial superconductivity. These conditions might\nserve as a tool in the search for topological superconductors. We also discuss\nimplications for oxides heterostructures and single-layer FeSe. \n\n"}

In contrast with the one-dimensional L\\'evy distribution and the\nCLT this distribution does not have universal shape.

In dense suspensions most of the stress comes\nfrom short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,\nso a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)\nof the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether a closed\ntime-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian\nhard spheres in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations\nfor the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for\nFEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)\nconstrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural\nanisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively\nconsider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no\nclosed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal. We attribute\nthis to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure during\nlarge parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal.\nSpecifically, the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes\ntwo-lobed distributions of near-contact orientations, whereas on reversal we\nobserve distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover dP/dt (p) has\noblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane.

In this case, it has been proven beneficial to employ\nthermoelectric measurements which are sensitive to the first derivative of the\ndensity of states with respect to energy, rather than to its value itself. Due\nto the large interest in topological effects these days, it is important to\nidentify a similar concept for detecting the Berry curvature in a band\nstructure. Nowadays, the common way to access the Berry curvature directly via\nmeasurements is the anomalous Hall effect, but the corresponding signal can be\ntoo small to be detected when the topological features of the band structure\nlie too far off the Fermi level.

In\nsuccessful models of such complex behaviour, its origin lies within\nnon-convexity of the governing free energy functional. A common approach to\nsolve such non-convex problems numerically is by regularisation through a\nviscous formulation. This, however, may require the system to be overdamped and\nhence potentially has a strong impact on the obtained results. To avoid this\nside-effect, this paper addresses the treatment of the full non-convexity by an\nappropriate numerical solution algorithm -- the truncated Newton method. The\npresented method is a double iterative approach which successively generates\nquadratic approximations of the energy landscape and minimises these by an\ninner iterative scheme, based on the conjugate gradient method. The inner\niterations are terminated when either a sufficient energy decrease is achieved\nor, to incorporate the treatment of non-convexity, a direction of negative\ncurvature is encountered. If the latter never happens, the method reduces to\nNewton--Raphson iterations, solved by the conjugate gradient method, with a\nsubsequent line search. However, in the case of a non-convex energy it avoids\nconvergence to a saddle point and adds robustness. The stability of the\ntruncated Newton method is demonstrated for the, highly non-convex,\nPeierls-Nabarro model, solved within a Finite Element framework. A potential\ndrop in efficiency due to an occasional near singular Hessian is remedied by a\ntrust region like extension, which is physically based on the Peierls-Nabarro\ndisregistry profile. The result is an efficient numerical scheme with a high\nstability that is independent of any regularisation. \n\n"}

In this context, we address the underdoped cuprates.\nOur premise is that just as Fermi liquid theory is failing above Tc, BCS theory\nis failing below.

We show that,\nin contrast to a homogeneous superfluid, an off-axis vortex corresponds to an\nanisotropic superflow whose profile strongly depends on the distance to the\ntrap axis. One consequence of this superflow anisotropy is vortex precession\nabout the trap axis in the absence of an imposed rotation. In the complementary\nregime of a finite prescribed rotation, we compute the minimum-energy vortex\ndensity, showing that in the rapid-rotation limit it is extremely uniform,\ndespite a strongly inhomogeneous (nearly) Thomas-Fermi condensate density\n$\\rho_s(r)$. The weak radially-dependent contribution ($\\propto\n\\nabla^2\\ln\\rho_s(r)$) to the vortex distribution, that vanishes with the\nnumber of vortices $N_v$ as $\\frac{1}{N_v}$, arises from the interplay between\nvortex quantum discretness (namely their inability to faithfully support the\nimposed rigid-body rotation) and the inhomogeneous superfluid density.

To make contact\nwith Cooper theory and with earlier Hubbard model cluster studies, we first use\na perturbative canonical transformation, to generate a two-body Hamiltonian.\nThen, we extend the results to all orders. The approach is exact in principle,\nand we obtain a close analytic expression including explicitly the effects of\nall virtual transitions to 4-body intermediate states. Our scheme naturally\nlends itself to embody off-site, inter-planar, phonon-mediated and other\ninteractions which are not considered in the Hubbard model but may well be\nimportant. The result depends qualitatively on the symmetry of the two-hole\nstate: $^{1}B_{2}$ and $ ^{1}A_{2}$ pairs are special, because the bare holes\ndo not interact by the on-site repulsion (W=0 pairs). The effective interaction\nin these channels is attractive and leads to a Cooper-like instability of the\nFermi liquid; however $W_{eff}$ is repulsive for Triplet pairs.

This formulation exhibits a\nhidden local gauge symmetry related to the arbitrariness of the phase choice of\nthe complete orthonormal basis set. By using this second quantized formulation,\nwhich does not assume adiabatic approximation, a convenient exact formula for\nthe geometric terms including off-diagonal geometric terms is derived. The\nanalysis of geometric phases is then reduced to a simple diagonalization of the\nHamiltonian, and it is analyzed both in the operator and path integral\nformulations. If one diagonalizes the geometric terms in the infinitesimal\nneighborhood of level crossing, the geometric phases become trivial (and thus\nno monopole singularity) for arbitrarily large but finite time interval $T$.\nThe integrability of Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and the appearance of the\nseemingly non-integrable phases are thus consistent. The topological proof of\nthe Longuet-Higgins' phase-change rule, for example, fails in the practical\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation where a large but finite ratio of two time\nscales is involved and $T$ is identified with the period of the slower system.\nThe difference and similarity between the geometric phases associated with\nlevel crossing and the exact topological object such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase\nbecome clear in the present formulation. A crucial difference between the\nquantum anomaly and the geometric phases is also noted. \n\n"}

A generalised Dyson boson-fermion mapping is\na one-to-one linear but non-unitary operator that can be applied to vectors\nrepresenting the states of a many-fermion system. A vector representing a\nfermion system maps onto a vector that represents a state of a many-body system\nthat contains both bosons and fermions. The motivation for doing such a mapping\nis the hope that it will reveal some property of the system that simplifies its\nanalysis and that was hidden in the original form. The aims of this text are to\nreview the theory of generalized Dyson boson-fermion mappings and to find a\nuseful application for a generalized Dyson boson-fermion mapping, by\nconsidering a non-trivial model, namely the Richardson model for\nsuperconductivity.

It may be realized in\nthe co-transmission of fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH)\nwaves in a planar optical waveguide via a long-period modulation of the usual\nquasi-phase-matching pattern of ferroelectric domains. The MM may also be\nimplemented by dint of the Feshbach resonance in a harmonically-modulated\nmagnetic field in a hybrid atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC),\nwith the atomic and molecular mean fields (MFs) playing the roles of the FF and\nSH, respectively. The problem is analyzed by two methods. First, we identify\nstability regions for spatial solitons in the MM system, in terms of the MM\namplitude and period, using the MF equations for spatially-inhomogeneous\nconfigurations. In particular, an instability enclave is found inside the\nstability area.The robustness of the solitons is also tested against variation\nof the shape of the input pulse, and a threshold for the formation of stable\nsolitons is found in terms of its power. Interactions between solitons are\nvirtually unaffected by the MM. The second method (\\textit{parametric\napproximation}), going beyond the MF description, is developed for\nspatially-homogeneous states.
