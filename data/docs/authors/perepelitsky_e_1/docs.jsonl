Depending on the field strength the superconductor is\neither in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS), or in the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state of the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) type.\nThe strong correlations are accounted for by means of the Gutzwiller method\nwhat leads naturally to the emergence of the spin-dependent masses (SDM) of\nquasiparticles when the system is spin-polarized. The case without strong\ncorrelations (with the spin-independent masses, SIM) is analyzed for\ncomparison. We consider both the s-wave and the d-wave symmetries of the\nsuperconducting gap and concentrate on the parallel orientation of the Cooper\npair momentum Q with respect to the junction interface. The junction\nconductance is presented for selected barrier strengths (i.e., in the contact,\nintermediate, and tunneling limits). The conductance spectra in the cases with\nand without strong correlations differ essentially. Our analysis provides thus\nan experimentally accessible test for the presence of strong-correlations in\nthe superconducting state. Namely, correlations alter the distance between the\nconductance peaks (or related conductance features) for carriers with spin-up\nand spin-down. In the uncorrelated case, this distance is twice the Zeeman\nenergy. In the correlated case, the corresponding distance is about 30-50%\nsmaller, but other models may provide even stronger difference, depending on\ndetails of the system electronic structure. It turns out that the strong\ncorrelations manifest themselves most clearly in the case of the junction with\nthe BCS, rather than the FFLO superconductor, what should make the experimental\nverification of the present results simpler. \n\n"}

For small\nsystems, where the edge states are massive Dirac fermions, we use the\ninhomogeneous dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) combined with iterative\nperturbation theory as an impurity solver to study interaction effects. We show\nthat the finite size gap in the edge states is renormalized for weak\ninteractions, which is consistent with a Fermi-liquid picture for small size\nTIs. In the second part, we investigate phase transitions in finite size TIs at\nzero temperature focusing on the effects of possible inter-edge Umklapp\nscattering for the edge states within the inhomogeneous DMFT using the\nnumerical renormalization group. We show that correlation effects are\neffectively stronger near the edge sites because the coordination number is\nsmaller than in the bulk. Therefore, the localization of the edge states around\nthe edge sites, which is a fundamental property in TIs, is weakened for strong\ncoupling strengths. However, we find no signs for \"edge Mott insulating states\"\nand the system stays in the topological insulating state, which is\nadiabatically connected to the non-interacting state, for all interaction\nstrengths smaller than the critical value. Increasing the interaction further,\na nearly homogeneous Mott insulating state is stabilized. \n\n"}

For non-degenerate\nmulti-orbital models, our U(1) approach is advantageous in that it captures the\nnon-interacting limit at the mean-field level. For systems with either a single\norbital or degenerate multiple orbitals, the U(1) and $Z_2$ slave-spin\napproachs yield the same results in the slave-spin-condensed phase. In general,\nthe U(1) slave-spin approach contains a U(1) gauge redundancy, and properly\ndescribes a Mott insulating phase. We apply the U(1) slave-spin approach to\nstudy the metal-to-insulator transition in a five-orbital model for parent iron\npnictides.

Here, we make\nthe connection between Abelian as well as non-Abelian FQH states and FCIs more\nprecise. Using a gauge-fixed version of Qi's Wannier basis representation of a\nChern band, we demonstrate that the interpolation between several FCI states,\nobtained by short-range lattice interactions in a spin-orbit-coupled kagome\nlattice model, and the corresponding continuum FQH states is smooth: the gap\nremains approximately constant and extrapolates to a finite value in the\nthermodynamic limit, while the low-lying part of the orbital entanglement\nspectrum remains qualitatively unaltered. The orbital entanglement spectra also\nprovide a first glimpse of the edge physics of FCIs via the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence.

The full Fermi surface is described by a direct sum of chiral patch\ntheories, which are decoupled from each other in the low energy limit. Each\npatch includes low energy excitations near a set of points on the Fermi surface\nwith a common tangent vector. General patch theories are classified by the\nlocal shape of the Fermi surface, the dispersion of the critical boson, and the\nsymmetry group, which form the data for distinct universality classes. We prove\nthat a large class of chiral non-Fermi liquid states exist as stable critical\nstates of matter. For this, we use a renormalization group scheme where low\nenergy excitations of the Fermi surface are interpreted as a collection of\n(1+1)-dimensional chiral fermions with a continuous flavor labelling the\nmomentum along the Fermi surface. Due to chirality, the Wilsonian effective\naction is strictly UV finite. This allows one to extract the exact scaling\nexponents although the theories flow to strongly interacting field theories at\nlow energies. In general, the low energy effective theory of the full Fermi\nsurface includes patch theories of more than one universality classes. As a\nresult, physical responses include multiple universal components at low\ntemperatures. We also point out that, in quantum field theories with extended\nFermi surface, a non-commutative structure naturally emerges between a\ncoordinate and a momentum which are orthogonal to each other. We show that the\ninvalidity of patch description for Fermi liquid states is tied with the\npresence of UV/IR mixing associated with the emergent non-commutativity. On the\nother hand, UV/IR mixing is suppressed in non-Fermi liquid states due to UV\ninsensitivity, and the patch description is valid. \n\n"}

The connection between the\nprobability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global\nHamiltonians will depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these\ntwo Hamiltonians.

Lett. {\\bf 108}, 240505 (2012)] where it was shown that the\nground-state form of spin-1 chains protected by $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times\n\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry supports perfect operation of the identity gate,\nimportant also for long-distance transmission of quantum information. We\ndevelop a formalism to constrain the ground-state form of SPT phases protected\nby any arbitrary finite symmetry group and use it to examine examples of ground\nstates of SPT phases protected by various finite groups for similar gate\nprotections. We construct a particular Hamiltonian invariant under $A_4$\nsymmetry transformation which is one of the groups that allows protected\nidentity operation and examine its ground states. We find that there is an\nextended region where the ground state is the AKLT state, which not only\nsupports the identity gate but also arbitrary single-qubit gates. \n\n"}

The\neffective field theory in the functional bosonization is written in terms of a\ntwo-form gauge field, which couples to a $U(1)$ gauge field that arises by\ngauging the continuous symmetry of the target system (the $U(1)$ particle\nnumber conservation). Integrating over the $U(1)$ gauge field by using the\nelectromagnetic duality, the resulting theory describes topological band\ninsulators as a condensation phase of the $U(1)$ gauge theory (or as a monopole\ncondensation phase of the dual gauge field). The hydrodynamic description, and\nthe implication of its duality, of the surface of topological insulators are\nalso discussed. We also touch upon the hydrodynamic theory of fractional\ntopological insulators by using the parton construction. \n\n"}

They work by gluing together states of overlapping clusters of\nsites on the lattice, called correlators. Recently Carleo and Troyer Science\n355, 602 (2017) introduced a new type sampleable ansatz called neural-network\nquantum states (NQS) that are inspired by the restricted Boltzmann model used\nin machine learning. By employing the formalism of tensor networks we show that\nNQS are a special form of CPS with novel properties. Diagramatically a number\nof simple observations become transparent. Namely, that NQS are CPS built from\nextensively sized GHZ-form correlators, which are related to a canonical\npolyadic decomposition of a tensor, making them uniquely unbiased\ngeometrically. Another immediate implication of the equivalence to CPS is that\nwe are able to formulate exact NQS representations for a wide range of\nparadigmatic states, including superposition of weighed-graph states, the\nLaughlin state, toric code states, and the resonating valence bond state. These\nexamples reveal the potential of using higher dimensional hidden units and a\nsecond hidden layer in NQS.

A topological phase transition may occur when there\nare two topologically distinct phases, and it is usually defined by a gap\nclosing point where the topologically invariant quantity is ill-defined.

When spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) is neglected (i.e. no Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), we\nshow that all three magnon branches are dispersive with no flat band, and there\nexists a critical point where tilted Dirac and semi-Dirac point coexist in the\nmagnon spectra.

Since the current injection may have components in both the\ndirection parallel and perpendicular to the [(Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$)$^{-}$]$_\\infty$\nchains in the PCAR measurements, it naturally explains the two-component\nfeature observed in this multi-band superconductor. Detailed analysis shows\nthat the larger gap may have an $s$-wave nature. We then carry out the\nsingle-particle tunneling measurements based on a scanning tunneling\nspectroscope by using the needle-like sample as the tip, and in this case the\nmeasured current is mainly parallel to the [(Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$)$^{-}$]$_\\infty$\nchains.

The coupling together\nof these two subsystems via a charge exchange term induces electron pairing\nbelow a certain T^* (showing up in form of a pseudogap) and ultimately\nsuperconductivity in the Fermionic subsystem.
