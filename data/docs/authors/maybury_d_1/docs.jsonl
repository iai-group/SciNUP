It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential.

The\nsoft-wall model also predicts the form of the non-perturbative effective\ncoupling $\\alpha_s^{AdS}(Q)$ which agrees with the effective coupling extracted\nfrom the Bjorken sum rule. The AdS/QCD model can be systematically improved by\nusing its complete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full QCD\nlight-front Hamiltonian or by applying the Lippmann-Schwinger method in order\nto systematically include the QCD interaction terms. A new perspective on quark\nand gluon condensates is also reviewed. \n\n"}

In frequentist\nparameter estimation, a central requirement for properly constructed confidence\nintervals is that they cover true parameter values, preferably at exactly the\nstated confidence level when experiments are repeated infinitely many times.\nSince most widely-used scanning techniques are optimised for Bayesian\nstatistics, one needs to assess their abilities in providing correct confidence\nintervals in terms of the statistical coverage.

Electric and magnetic\nscreening masses are calculated through an Ansatz from the zero-temperature\ncase, based on complex-conjugate poles for the momentum-space propagators. As\nrecently reported in [1], we find good fits to the proposed form at all\ntemperatures considered, with different ratios of real to imaginary part of the\npole masses for the longitudinal (electric) and transverse (magnetic)\npropagators. The behavior of the magnetic propagator D_T(p) is in agreement\nwith the dimensional-reduction picture, showing infrared suppression (with a\nturnover in momentum) and violation of spectral positivity at all nonzero\ntemperatures considered. The longitudinal propagator D_L(p) appears to reach a\nplateau at small momenta and is subject to severe finite-Nt effects around the\ncritical temperature Tc. As a consequence, only lattices with temporal extent\nNt > 8 seem to be free from systematic errors.

Without\ntuning, the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs is peaked towards the\nIR tip of the space and hence such a scenario still offers a potential\nresolution to the gauge-hierarchy problem. When the exponent of the Higgs VEV\nis approximately two and one assumes order one Yukawa couplings, then the\nfermion Dirac mass term is found to range from $\\sim 10^{-5}$ eV to $\\sim 200$\nGeV in approximate agreement with the observed fermion masses. However, this\nresult is sensitive to the exponent of the Higgs VEV, which is a free\nparameter. This paper offers a number of phenomenological and theoretical\nmotivations for considering an exponent of two to be the optimal value.

These are often referred to as \"penguin pollution\" (PP)\nbecause their inclusion in the amplitude leads to a theoretical error in the\nextraction of 2beta_s from the data. In the standard model (SM), it is\nestimated that the PP is negligible, but there is some uncertainty as to its\nexact size. Now, phi_s^{c\\bar{c}s} (the measured value of 2beta_s) is small, in\nagreement with the SM, but still has significant experimental errors.

Resulting domain walls have asymmetric profile of $l(x)$ (under\nreflection $x \\rightarrow -x$ for a domain wall centered at the origin).

The same result, including spin terms, is\nobtained using light-front holography if one modifies the AdS$_5$ action by the\ndilaton $e^{\\kappa^2 z^2}$ in the fifth dimension $z$. When one generalizes\nthis procedure using superconformal algebra, the resulting light-front\neigensolutions provide a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and\ntetraquarks, including remarkable supersymmetric relations between the masses\nof mesons and baryons and a universal Regge slope.

The mass\nscale underlying hadron masses can be connected to the mass parameter in the\nQCD running coupling. The result is an effective coupling $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$\ndefined at all momenta.

This scenario encompasses, but is more general than, the\ncases where dark matter decays or annihilates into these states.

We\ndiscuss in detail, both from a Bayesian and frequentist point of view, in which\nsense adding large-scale structure observations may even provide a certain\npreference for a conversion of dark matter to radiation at late times.

In particular, the D- and B-meson measurements of LHCb at forward\ndirection are sensitive to gluon dynamics at small $x$ and are one of the few\nperturbative small-$x$ probes before the next generation\ndeep-inelastic-scattering experiments. In this talk, we will concentrate on the\ncollinear-factorization approach to inclusive D-meson production and describe a\nnovel implementation - SACOT-$m_{\\rm T}$ - of the general-mass variable flavour\nnumber scheme (GM-VFNS). In the GM-VFNS framework the cross sections retain the\nfull heavy-quark mass dependence at $p_{\\rm T}=0$, but gradually reduce to the\nordinary zero-mass results towards asymptotically high $p_{\\rm T}$. However,\nthe region of small (but non-zero) $p_{\\rm T}$ has been somewhat problematic in\nthe previous implementations of GM-VFNS, leading to divergent cross sections\ntowards $p_{\\rm T} \\rightarrow 0$, unless the QCD scales are set in a\nparticular way.

In\nparticular, it is very interesting that the RSF-induced\n$\\nu_\\rme\\to\\bar\\nu_\\rme$ transition occurs, if the following conditions are\nall satisfied: the value of $\\mu_\\nu B$ ($\\mu_\\nu$ is the neutrino magnetic\nmoment, and $B$ is the magnetic field strength) is sufficiently strong, the\nneutrino mass hierarchy is inverted, and the value of $\\theta_{13}$ is large\nenough to induce adiabatic MSW resonance. In this case, the strong peak due to\noriginal $\\nu_\\rme$ emitted from neutronization burst would exist in time\nprofile of the neutrino events detected at the Super-Kamiokande detector. If\nthis peak were observed in reality, it would provide fruitful information on\nthe neutrino properties. On the other hand, characters of the neutrino spectra\nare also different between the neutrino models, but we find that there remains\ndegeneracy among several models.

The appeal of this\nproposal is that these features are a manifestation of the non-perturbative\nsector of the SM, requiring no assumptions about new physics beyond presently\nattainable experimental limits. In this thesis we apply non-perturbative\ntechniques to two complementary models: a toy 4-fermion model containing\nexplicit chiral symmetry-breaking terms and the quenched hypercharge gauge\ninteraction. Understanding of how fermion mass, generations and CP-violation\nmight arise is first investigated in the toy 4-fermion model. It is shown that\ndifferent scale-invariant 4-fermion operators are present for the three\nsubspaces of the full theory, enabling self-consistent introduction of three\nfermion generations.

Lattice simulations of fully nonlinear preheating dynamics show\nspecific features of this intermediate stage: occupation numbers of the scalar\nparticles are peaked, scalar fields become significantly non-gaussian and the\nfield dynamics become chaotic and irreversible. Visualization of the field\ndynamics in configuration space reveals that nonlinear interactions generate\nnon-gaussian inflaton inhomogeneities with very fast growing amplitudes. The\npeaks of the inflaton inhomogeneities coincide with the peaks of the scalar\nfield(s) produced by parametric resonance.

Hence dark\nmatter is microphysically identical to ordinary matter; it can dissipate and\nclump possibly forming dark replicas of ordinary stars which are good MACHO\ncandidates. Its dissipation may lead to far more frequent occurrence of\ngravitational collapse and consequently to a significant enhancement in\ngravitational wave signals detectable by LIGO and LISA. Sterile neutrinos find\na natural home on the other folds. Since the folded brane is not a BPS state,\nit gives a new geometric means for supersymmetry breaking in our world. It may\nalso offer novel approach for the resolution of the cosmological horizon\nproblem, although it still requires additional dynamics to solve the flatness\nproblem. Although there are constraints from BBN, structure formation, the\nenormity of galactic halos and the absence of stars and globular clusters with\na discernible dark matter component, we show that the model is consistent with\ncurrent observational limits.

{"id": "hep-th/0510113", "contents": "Title: The Throat as a Randall-Sundrum Model with Goldberger-Wise Stabilization Abstract: An interesting feature of type IIB flux compactifications is the natural\npresence of strongly warped regions or `throats'. These regions allow for a 5d\nRandall-Sundrum model interpretation with a large hierarchy between the UV and\nIR brane. We show that, in the 5d description, the flux stabilization of this\nhierarchy (or, equivalently, of the brane-to-brane distance) can be understood\nas an implementation of the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. This mechanism relies on\nthe non-trivial bulk profile of the so-called Goldberger-Wise scalar, which in\naddition has fixed expectation values at the boundaries and thereby stabilizes\nthe size of the 5d interval. The Goldberger-Wise scalar is realized\nmicroscopically by the continuously varying flux of the Neveu-Schwarz 2-form\npotential B_2 on the S^2 cycle in the throat. Its back-reaction on the 5d\ngeometry leads to a significant departure from a pure AdS_5 background. We also\nfind that, for a wide range of parameters, the universal Kaehler modulus of the\n10d compactification plays the role of a UV-brane field in the equivalent 5d\nmodel. It governs the size of a large 4d curvature term localized at the UV\nbrane.

The relevant\nHamiltonian perturbation, describing the interaction of the meson with the foam\nmedium, consists of off-diagonal stochastic metric fluctuations, connecting\ndistinct mass eigenstates (or the appropriate generalisation thereof in the\ncase of K-mesons), and it is proportional to the relevant momentum transfer\n(along the direction of motion of the meson pair). There are two kinds of\nCPT-violating effects in this case, which can be experimentally disentangled:\none (termed ``omega-effect'') is associated with the failure of the\nindistinguishability between the neutral meson and its antiparticle, and\naffects certain symmetry properties of the initial state of the two-meson\nsystem; the second effect is generated by the time evolution of the system in\nthe medium of the space-time foam, and can result in time-dependent\ncontributions of the $omega-effect type in the time profile of the two meson\nstate. Estimates of both effects are given, which show that, at least in\ncertain models, such effects are not far from the sensitivity of experimental\nfacilities available currently or in the near future.
