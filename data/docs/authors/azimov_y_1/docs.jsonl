If correct, this\nimplies that mass generation mechanisms and physics in excited hadrons is very\ndifferent as compared to the lowest states. One needs an alternative and\nindependent experimental information to confirm this conjecture. Using very\ngeneral chiral symmetry arguments it is shown that strict chiral restoration in\na given excited nucleon forbids its decay into the N \\pi channel. Hence those\nexcited nucleons which are assumed from the spectroscopic patterns to be in\napproximate chiral multiplets must only \"weakly\" decay into the N \\pi channel,\n(f_{N^*N\\pi}/f_{NN\\pi})^2 << 1. However, those baryons which have no chiral\npartner must decay strongly with a decay constant comparable with f_{NN\\pi}.\nDecay constants can be extracted from the existing decay widths and branching\nratios. It turnes out that for all those well established excited nucleons\nwhich can be classified into chiral doublets N_+(1440) - N_-(1535), N_+(1710) -\nN_-(1650), N_+(1720) - N_-(1700), N_+(1680) - N_-(1675), N_+(2220) - N_-(2250),\nN_+(?) - N_-(2190), N_+(?) - N_-(2600), the ratio is (f_{N^*N\\pi}/f_{NN\\pi})^2\n~ 0.1 or much smaller for the high-spin states.

In particular, we\nexplore the theoretical uncertainties associated with modeling contributions of\nhadronic intermediate states. Taking into account constraints from low- and\nhigh-energy, parity-conserving electroproduction measurements, choosing\ndifferent models for contributions from the non-resonant processes, and\nperforming the corresponding flavor rotations to obtain the electroweak\namplitude, we arrive at an estimate of the uncertainty in the total\ncontribution to the parity-violating asymmetry. At the kinematics of the Q-Weak\nexperiment, we obtain a correction to the asymmetry equivalent to a shift in\nthe proton weak charge of $(0.0054\\pm0.0020)$. This should be compared to the\nvalue of the proton's weak charge of $\\qwp=0.0713\\pm0.0008$ that includes SM\ncontributions at tree level and one-loop radiative corrections. Therefore, we\nobtain a new Standard Model prediction for the parity-violating asymmetry in\nthe kinematics of the Q-Weak experiment of $(0.0767\\pm0.0008\\pm0.0020_{\\gamma\nZ})$. The latter error leads to a relative uncertainty of 2.8% in the\ndetermination of the proton's weak charge, and is dominated by the uncertainty\nin the isospin structure of the inclusive cross section. We argue that future\nparity-violating inelastic $ep$ asymmetry measurements at low-to-moderate $Q^2$\nand $W^2$ could be exploited to reduce the uncertainty associated with the\ndispersion correction. Because the corresponding shift and error bar decrease\nmonotonically with decreasing beam energy, a determination of the proton's weak\ncharge with a lower-energy experiment or measurements of \"isotope ratios\" in\natomic parity-violation could provide a useful cross check on any implications\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model derived from the Q-Weak measurement. \n\n"}

These include the implications of a\nperturbative connection to a large scale; Yukawa couplings, which must be\ngenerated from higher-dimensional operators in many constructions; anomaly\ncancellation, in particular the implications of the required exotics for the\naxigluon width, perturbativity, and the signatures from exotic decays; the\npossibility of family nonuniversality via mirror representations, mixing with\nexotics, or additional SU(3) factors; the additional constraints from anomalous\nU(1) factors in the string constructions; tadpole cancellation, which implies\nnew uncolored matter; the prevention of string-scale masses for vector pairs;\nand various phenomenological issues involving FCNC, CKM constraints, and the\naxigluon coupling strength. It is concluded that the construction of viable\naxigluon models from type IIa or similar constructions is problematic and would\nrequire considerable fine tuning, but is not entirely excluded. These\nconsiderations illustrate the importance of top-down constraints on possible\nTeV-scale physics, independent of the ultimate explanation of the t-tbar\nasymmetry. \n\n"}

A crucial step toward verifying such evidence is the measurement of the\nwould-be dark matter mass. If, for example, the invisible particles are found\nto have masses consistent with zero, it may prove very challenging to ascertain\nwhether light dark matter or neutrinos are being observed. We assume that new\ninvisible particles are pair-produced in a ttbar-like topology and use two\nMT2-based methods to measure the masses of the particles associated with the\nmissing energy. Instead of simulating events and backgrounds, we estimate the\nuncertainty associated with measuring the mass of the invisible particle by\nassuming a fixed value of the uncertainty associated with the location of the\nMT2 endpoint.

Kinematically, superfast quarks can be identified through\ndirectly measurable jet kinematics. Dynamically, their description requires\nunderstanding several elusive properties of nuclear QCD, such as nuclear forces\nat very short distances, as well as medium modification of parton distributions\nin nuclei. In the present work, we develop a model for nuclear parton\ndistributions at large $x$ in which the nuclear dynamics at short distance\nscales are described by two- and three-nucleon short range correlations (SRCs).\nNuclear modifications are accounted for using the color screening model, and an\nimproved description of the EMC effect is reached by using a structure function\nparametrization that includes higher-twist contributions. We apply QCD\nevolution at the leading order to obtain nuclear parton distributions in the\nkinematic regime of the LHC, and based on the obtained distributions calculate\nthe cross section for dijet production.

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

These models have the novel feature\nthat in the four-dimensional theory, the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is\nmuch smaller than the Planck density and in fact accumulates at $\\Lambda=0$.\nHere we show that while these are very interesting models, they do not properly\naddress the real cosmological constant problem. As we explain, the real problem\nis not simply to obtain $\\Lambda$ that is small in Planck units in a toy model,\nbut to explain why $\\Lambda$ is much smaller than other mass scales (and\ncombinations of scales) in the theory. Instead, in these toy models, all other\nparticle mass scales have been either removed or sent to zero, thus ignoring\nthe real problem. To this end, we provide a general argument that the included\nmoduli masses are generically of order Hubble, so sending them to zero\ntrivially sends the cosmological constant to zero. We also show that the\nfundamental Planck mass is being sent to zero, and so the central problem is\ntrivially avoided by removing high energy physics altogether. On the other\nhand, by including various large mass scales from particle physics with a high\nfundamental Planck mass, one is faced with a real problem, whose only known\nsolution involves accidental cancellations in a landscape. \n\n"}

They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation.

In a previous analysis of type II MSSM D-brane quivers we\nsystematically added up to five exotics for the sake of satisfying string\nconsistency conditions. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that 89780 of the\n89964 quivers have exotics, 78155 of which include singlets that may couple to\nMSSM or exotic multiplets with coupling structures governed by $U(1)$\nsymmetries that are often anomalous. We demonstrate that certain sets of\nexotics are far preferred over others and study the structure of singlet\ncouplings to heavy exotics carrying standard model charges. Typical\npossibilities include singlets that may decay to vector-like quarks and / or\nvector-like leptons and subsequently to two photons. We show that a narrow\nwidth diphoton excess can be accounted for while evading existing bounds if\nmultiple exotics are added, with vector-like leptons of mass $M_L\\lesssim 375$\nGeV and vector-like quarks with masses up to $\\simeq 3$ TeV.

Usually, the\ndifferential nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections are described by\nan exponential expression. Corresponding experimental data on $pp$ interactions\nat $|t|>$ 0.005 (GeV/c)$^2$ and $|t|\\leq$ 0.125 (GeV/c)$^2$ have been fit. We\npropose formulae to approximate the beam momentum dependence of these\nparameters in the momentum range considered. The same was done for $np$\ninteractions at $|t|\\leq$ 0.5 (GeV/c)$^2$. Expressions for the momentum\ndependence of the total and elastic cross sections, and the ratio of real to\nimaginary parts of the amplitude at zero momentum transfer are also given for\n$pp$ and $np$ collisions. These results are sufficient for a first\napproximation of the Glauber calculations.

Since the classically conformal symmetry forbids all dimensional\nparameters in the model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry is broken by the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass terms of the U(1)' gauge boson\n($Z$' boson) and the right-handed neutrinos. Through a mixing quartic coupling\nbetween the U(1)' Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet field, the radiative\nU(1)' gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the breaking of the electroweak\nsymmetry. In this model context, we first investigate the electroweak vacuum\ninstability problem in the SM. Employing the renormalization group equations at\nthe two-loop level and the central values for the world average masses of the\ntop quark ($m_t=173.34$ GeV) and the Higgs boson ($m_h=125.09$ GeV), we perform\nparameter scans to identify the parameter region for resolving the electroweak\nvacuum instability problem.

Abstract: Electroweak baryogenesis is severely challenged in its traditional settings:\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and in more general two Higgs\ndoublet models.

The\nsituation is somewhat better in models with a singlet scalar coupling to the\nHiggs so as to give a strongly first order phase transition due to a tree-level\nbarrier, but even in this case no UV complete models had been demonstrated to\ngive successful baryogenesis.

Dark matter at the keV scale carrying\nkinetic energy as small as a few meV can scatter and excite an electron across\nthe gap. Alternatively, bosonic dark matter as light as a few meV can be\nabsorbed by the electrons in the target.

One\nof the spin observables is the Sivers weighted asymmetry, another one is the\nCollins weighted asymmetry.

In this\npaper we derive factorization formulae for groomed multi-prong substructure\nobservables, focusing in particular on the groomed $D_2$ observable, which is\nused to identify boosted hadronic decays of electroweak bosons at the LHC.

Recent experimental searches for this DiFF via\nazimuthal asymmetries in back-to-back hadron pair production in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation by the ${\\tt BELLE}$ Collaboration did not yield a signal. Here we\npropose a new way to access this DiFF in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, motivated by\nthe recently recalculated cross section of this reaction, which explains why\nthere was in fact no signal for the ${\\tt BELLE}$ Collaboration to see. In this\nnew approach the azimuthal asymmetry is weighted by the virtual photon's\ntransverse momentum square multiplying sine and cosine functions of difference\nof azimuthal angles of relative and total momentum for each pair. The\nintegration over the virtual photon's transverse momentum has the effect of\nseparating the convolution between the helicity-dependent DiFFs in the quark\nand antiquark jets and results in a nonzero collinear expression containing\nFourier moments of helicity-dependent DiFFs. A second new measurement is also\nproposed for two-hadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering,\nwhere the asymmetry is weighted in a similar way for a single pair. This\nresults in a collinear factorized form of the asymmetry, which includes the\nquark helicity parton distribution function and the same helicity-dependent\nDiFF as in $e^+e^-$ production and will allow us to check the universality of\nthis DiFF. \n\n"}

Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

From the effective potential for the Polyakov loop, its mass\njust below the confinement temperature T_c is in between the vacuum masses of\nthe pion and that of the kaon. Therefore, due to phase-space restrictions the\nnumber of produced kaons is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than that of\nproduced pions, in agreement with recent results from collisions of gold ions\nat the BNL-RHIC.

It\nis based on the different behavior of the neutral current pion production off\nthe nucleon, depending on whether it is induced by neutrinos or antineutrinos.\nThis procedure for distinguishing tau-neutrinos from antineutrinos neither\nrelies on any nuclear model, nor it is affected by any nuclear effect\n(distortion of the outgoing nucleon waves, etc...). We show that\nneutrino-antineutrino asymmetries occur both in the totally integrated cross\nsections and in the pion azimuthal differential distributions. To define the\nasymmetries for the latter distributions we just rely on Lorentz-invariance.\nAll these asymmetries are independent of the lepton family and can be\nexperimentally measured by using electron or muon neutrinos, due to the lepton\nfamily universality of the neutral current neutrino interaction. Nevertheless\nand to estimate their size, we have also used the chiral model of\nhep-ph/0701149 at intermediate energies.

The\nmodel, albeit non-minimal, remains very rigid due to the requirement of\nfiniteness. It is based on the $SU(5)$ gauge group and is UV finite to all\norders of perturbation theory. It contains three generations of the matter\nfields together with four pairs of Higgses. The requirement of UV finiteness\nfixes all the Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale. Imposing the condition of\nuniversality on the soft couplings at the Planck scale and then extending the\ncondition of finiteness to them, one gets a completely finite unified theory\nabove $M_{GUT}.$ This makes the fine-tuning procedure more meaningful and leads\nto the usual Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model below $M_{GUT}$. All the\nmasses of the ordinary particles including Higgses are obtained due to the\nHiggs mechanism at the electro-weak scale. The hierarchy of quark and lepton\nmasses is related to that of v.e.v.'s of the Higgs fields and is governed by\nthe Higgs mixing matrix in the generation space.

Our model for the\nneutrino-nucleus collisions includes in-medium effects such as Fermi motion,\nPauli blocking, nuclear binding, and final-state interactions.

Because of\nthis, $v_2$ fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the\nsystem produced at RHIC.
