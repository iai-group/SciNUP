Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

Similar to SN 1987A and to Type IIP SNe, a\nsharp increase in the degree of the polarization (~1%) is observed when the\nouter hydrogen layer becomes optically thin by day 31; only at this epoch is\nthe polarization well described by a ``dominant axis.''

Chance superpositions produce only small biases\nwhen the number of superimposed stars is low but, once a certain number\nthreshold is reached, they can affect both the observed slope and the apparent\nstellar upper mass limit. I apply those experiments to two well known massive\nyoung clusters in the Local Group, NGC 3603 and R136.

We also use UBVIJHK+IRAC band photometry to determine a\nstellar photometric mass. Results. We find that F257 is indistinguishable from\nlocal late type galaxies in many respects: it has a regular velocity field,\nincreasing velocity disperion towards its center, its rotation curve flattens\nat 1-2 disk scale lengths, it has the same specific angular momentum as local\ndisks, its properties are consistent with the local K band TFR. Although mainly\nrotationally supported, its gas component is dynamically heated with respect to\nlocal galaxies (V/sigma_z ~ 4) and it is offset from the local stellar mass TFR\nat the 2sigma level. But, this offset depends on the SED modeling parameters.\nIn particular, for a 2-component star formation history (SFH), F257 is in\nagreement with the local stellar mass TFR. F257 is then a nearly (~75%) maximum\ndisk. The dynamical properties of F257 are more like those of local galaxies\nthan those of any other galaxy at similar redshift observed to date. However,\nthe gas-to-stellar mass ratio is unusally large: 2.5. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that rapid (\\Delta\nz< 0.1-0.2), strong (\\Delta T > 10^4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve\nacross the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than\nimplied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic\nquasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess\nenergy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and\nlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals\nshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons\nresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy\ninside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and\nmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating\nrates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and\nweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be\nreionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest\nheating rates (\\Delta T < 10^4 K). The repeated ionisation of fossil quasar\nHeIII regions does not increase the net heating because the recombination times\nin these regions typically exceed the IGM cooling times and the average time\nlag between successive rounds of quasar activity. Detailed line-of-sight\nradiative transfer simulations confirm these expectations and predict a rich\nthermal structure in the IGM during HeII reionisation. [Abridged] \n\n"}

Abstract: A number of recent numerical investigations concluded that the remnants of\nrare structures formed at very high redshift, such as the very first stars and\nbright redshift z~6 QSOs, are preferentially located at the center of the most\nmassive galaxy clusters at redshift z=0. In this paper we readdress this\nquestion using a combination of cosmological simulations of structure formation\nand extended Press-Schechter formalism and we show that the typical remnants of\nPopulation III stars are instead more likely to be found in a group\nenvironment, that is in dark matter halos of mass ~2x10^{13} h^{-1}M_sun.\nSimilarly, the descendants of the brightest z~6 QSOs are expected to be in\nmedium-sized clusters (mass of a few 10^{14} h^{-1}M_sun), rather than in the\nmost massive superclusters (M>10^{15} h^{-1}M_sun) found within the typical 1\nGpc^3 cosmic volume where a bright z~6 QSO lives. The origin of past claims\nthat the most massive clusters preferentially host these remnants is rooted in\nthe numerical method used to initialize their numerical simulations: Only a\nsmall region of the cosmological volume of interest was simulated with\nsufficient resolution to identify low-mass halos at early times, and this\nregion was chosen to host the most massive halo in the cosmological volume at\nlate times. The conclusion that the earliest structures formed in the entire\ncosmological volume evolve into the most massive halo at late times was thus\narrived at by construction. We demonstrate that, to the contrary, the first\nstructures to form in a cosmological region evolve into relatively typical\nobjects at later times.

METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude\nbetween the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R.\nWe compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set\nII has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous\nsegments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we\nfind that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the\ntwo twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow\ninterval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources\nto explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II.\nThere is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four\nsources.

The absence of evolution in the bTFR over the\npast 6 Gyr implies that no external gas accretion is required for distant\nrotating disks to sustain star formation until z=0 and convert most of their\ngas into stars.

The models can thus be\ndifferentiated by measuring dynamically (within Newtonian dynamics) the disk\nsurface density at the solar radius, the radial mass gradient within the disk,\nor the velocity ellipsoid tilt angle above the Galactic plane. Using the most\nrealistic possible baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we predict that, if\nMOND applies, the local surface density measured by a Newtonist will be\napproximately 78 Msun/pc2 within 1.1 kpc of the Galactic plane, the dynamically\nmeasured disk scale-length will be enhanced by a factor of 1.25 with respect to\nthe visible disk scale-length, and the local vertical tilt of the velocity\nellipsoid at 1 kpc above the plane will be approximately 6 degrees. None of\nthese tests can be conclusive for the present-day accuracy of Milky Way data,\nbut they will be of prime interest with the advent of large surveys such as\nGAIA. \n\n"}

Abstract: We have observed the hard X-ray selected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy SWIFT\nJ2127.4+5654 with Suzaku. We report the detection of a broad relativistic iron\nemission line from the inner accretion disc. By assuming that the inner edge of\nthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of the\nblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spin\na= 0.6\\pm0.2. However, a non-rotating Schwarzschild spacetime is excluded at\njust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning Kerr black hole is\nexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. The intermediate spin we measure may indicate\nthat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds through\nshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the disc\nand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. The measured steep emissivity\nindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating X-ray source to be very centrally\nconcentrated. Light bending may help focus the primary emission towards the\ninnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. On the other\nhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the hole\nrotational energy is at work. If this is the case, the interplay between\naccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction\n(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,\nunder standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.\nRotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account for\nthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral\nanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

The GeV emission has three main properties: (i) its duration is\noften longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma\nBurst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the\nEnergetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is\nconsistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;\n(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power\nlaw with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux\ncan be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the\nprompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies.

We use the broad-band data to test whether the most popular\ntheoretical models for gamma-ray burst emission can accommodate the\nobservations for this burst. We first attempt to explain the soft-to-hard\nspectral evolution associated with the delayed onset of a GeV tail with the\nhypothesis that the prompt burst and the high energy tail both originate from a\nsingle process, namely synchrotron emission from internal shocks.\nConsiderations on the compactness of the source imply that the high-energy tail\nshould be produced in a late-emitted shell, characterized by a Lorentz factor\ngreater than the one generating the prompt burst. However, in this hypothesis,\nthe predicted evolution of the synchrotron peak frequency does not agree with\nthe observed soft-to-hard evolution. Given the difficulties of a\nsingle-mechanism hypothesis, we test two alternative double-component\nscenarios. In the first, the prompt burst is explained as synchrotron radiation\nfrom internal shocks, and the high energy emission (up to about 1 s following\nthe trigger) as internal shock synchrotron-self-Compton. In the second\nscenario, in view of its long duration (\\sim 100 s), the high energy tail is\ndecoupled from the prompt burst and has an external shock origin. In this case,\nwe show that a reasonable choice of parameters does indeed exist to accommodate\nthe optical-to-GeV data, provided the Lorentz factor of the shocked shell is\nsufficiently high. Finally, we attempt to explain the chromatic break observed\naround \\sim 1e3 s with a structured jet model.

We use the\nrenormalization-group equations of the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT to\nevaluate their evolutions down to $\\mgut$, studying their dependences on the\nunknown parameters of the SU(5) superpotential. After displaying some generic\nexamples of the evolutions of the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters, we\ndiscuss the effects on physical sparticle masses in some specific examples.

As the first application of this method,\nwe study how the bimodality in galaxy colour distribution (u-r) depends on\nmultiscale density. The u-r galaxy colour distribution is described as the sum\nof two gaussians (red and blue) with five parameters: the fraction of red\ngalaxies (f_r) and the position and width of the red and blue peaks (mu_r,\nmu_b, sigma_r and sigma_b). Galaxies mostly react to their smallest scale (<\n0.5 Mpc) environments: in denser environments red galaxies are more common\n(larger f_r), redder (larger mu_r) and with a narrower distribution (smaller\nsigma_r), while blue galaxies are redder (larger mu_b) but with a broader\ndistribution (larger sigma_b). There are residual correlations of f_r and mu_b\nwith 0.5 - 1 Mpc scale density, which imply that total or partial truncation of\nstar formation can relate to a galaxy's environment on these scales.

H I\nresponse is detected over the range 0-15 days, with the response confined\nwithin the virial envelope. The Balmer-line maps have similar morphologies but\nexhibit radial stratification, with progressively longer delays for Hgamma to\nHbeta to Halpha. The He I and He II response is confined within 1-2 days. There\nis a deficit of prompt response in the Balmer-line cores but strong prompt\nresponse in the red wings.

In such configuration, the system loses the axisymmetry\npresented in the aligned case, requiring a fully 3D approach. We perform 3D\nnumerical MHD simulations of stellar winds and study the effects caused by\ndifferent model parameters. The system reaches a periodic behavior with the\nsame rotational period of the star. We show that the magnetic field lines\npresent an oscillatory pattern and that by increasing the misalignment angle,\nthe wind velocity increases. Our wind models allow us to study the interaction\nof a magnetized wind with a magnetized extra-solar planet. Such interaction\ngives rise to reconnection, generating electrons that propagate along the\nplanet's magnetic field lines and produce electron cyclotron radiation at radio\nwavelengths.

Secondly, the onset of a secular bar-mode instability, associated\nwith the long lived plateau observed in the X-ray afterglows of many gamma-ray\nbursts (Corsi & Meszaros 2009a). With regards to detectability, we find that\nthe onset of a secular instability is the most optimistic scenario: under the\nhypothesis that SL-GRBs associated with secularly unstable magnetars occur at a\nrate of (48; 80)Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} or greater, cross-correlation of data from two\nEinstein Telescopes (ETs) could detect the GW background associated to this\nsignal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 or greater after 1 year of\nobservation.

Combining results from spectroscopy\nand imaging allows us to study four MBH scaling relations: MBH-sigma,\nMBH-L(sph), MBH-M(sph,*), MBH-M(sph,dyn). We find the following results. First,\nstellar-velocity dispersions determined from aperture spectra (e.g. SDSS fiber\nspectra or unresolved data from distant galaxies) can be biased, depending on\naperture size, AGN contamination, and host-galaxy morphology.

Along the way, we also discuss in detail the evolution of dark\nenergy perturbations in the linear regime. We find that the introduction of a\nfinite sound speed into the picture necessarily induces a scale-dependence in\nthe dark energy clustering, which in turn affects the dynamics of the spherical\ncollapse in a scale-dependent way. As with other, more conventional fluids, we\ncan define a Jeans scale for the dark energy clustering, and hence a Jeans mass\nM_J for the dark matter which feels the effect of dark energy clustering via\ngravitational interactions. For bound objects (halos) with masses M >> M_J, the\neffect of dark energy clustering is maximal.

In addition, the preferred\nselection of lensed galaxies in a flux- and size-limited sample leads to\nfluctuations in the apparent source density which correlate with the lensing\nfield (lensing bias). In this paper, we investigate these issues for two\ndifferent choices of shear estimators which are commonly in use today:\nglobally-normalized and locally-normalized estimators. While in principle\nequivalent, in practice these estimators respond differently to systematic\neffects such as lensing bias and cluster member dilution. Furthermore, we find\nthat which estimator is statistically superior depends on the specific shape of\nthe filter employed for peak finding; suboptimal choices of the\nestimator+filter combination can result in a suppression of the number of high\npeaks by orders of magnitude.

One of the\nappealing models is the late internal dissipation model, where X-ray emission\nduring the shallow-decay phase is attributed to internal dissipation, analogous\nto the prompt gamma-ray emission. We discuss possible scenarios of the late\nprompt emission, such as late internal shocks, magnetic reconnection, and\nphotospheric dissipation. We also consider the consequences of late dissipation\nand a two-component (early and late) jet model for the high-energy (GeV-TeV)\nemission. We study not only synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the\nearly and late jets but also external inverse-Compton (EIC) emission, which is\nnaturally predicted in the late dissipation model. For the latter, we perform\nnumerical calculations taking into account the equal-arrival-time surface of\nEIC photons and show that the EIC component typically has a peak at ~1-100 GeV\nwhich may dominate over the SSC components.

Our six targets were specifically\nselected because they have optical emission-line properties that are\nintermediate between starbursts and Type 2 (obscured) AGN. Our new X-ray data\nprovide an important diagnostic of the presence of an AGN. We find X-ray\nluminosities of order 10^{42} erg/s and ratios of X-ray to far-IR luminosities\nthat are higher than values in pure starburst galaxies by factors ranging from\n~ 3 to 30.

The Physical Characteristics that Determine\n  the X factor in Galactic Molecular Clouds Abstract: We investigate how the X factor, the ratio of H_2 column density (NH2) to\nvelocity-integrated CO intensity (W), is determined by the physical properties\nof gas in model molecular clouds (MCs). We perform radiative transfer\ncalculations on chemical-MHD models to compute X. Using integrated NH2 and W\nreproduces the limited range in X found in observations, resulting in a mean\nvalue X=2\\times10^20 s/cm^2/K^1/km^1 from the Galactic MC model. However, in\nlimited velocity intervals, X can take on a much larger range due to CO line\nsaturation. Thus, X strongly depends on both the range in gas velocities and\nvolume densities. The temperature (T) variations within individual MCs do not\nstrongly affect X, as dense gas contributes most to setting X. For fixed\nvelocity and density structure, gas with higher T has higher W, yielding X ~\nT^-1/2 for T~20-100 K. We demonstrate that the linewidth-size scaling relation\ndoes not influence the X factor - only the range in velocities is important.\nClouds with larger linewidths, regardless of the linewidth-size relation, have\na higher W, corresponding to a lower value of X, scaling roughly as X ~\nsigma^-1/2. The \"mist\" model, consisting of optically thick cloudlets with\nwell-separated velocities, does not accurately reflect the conditions in a\nturbulent MC. We propose that the observed cloud-average values of X ~ XGal is\nsimply a result of the limited range in NH2, temperatures, and velocities found\nin Galactic MCs - a ~constant value of X therefore does not require any\nlinewidth-size relation, or that MCs are virialized objects. Since gas\nproperties likely differ (slightly) between clouds, masses derived through a\nstandard X should only be considered as a rough first estimate.

Aspherical ejecta are produced by prescribing a latitudinal scaling or\nstretching of SN ejecta inputs obtained from 1-D non-LTE time-dependent\ncalculations. We study polarisation signatures as a function of inclination,\nshape factor, wavelength, line identity, post-explosion time. At early times,\ncancellation and optical-depth effects make the polarisation intrinsically low,\ncausing complicated sign reversals with inclination or continuum wavelength,\nand across line profiles. While the line polarisation is positive (negative)\nfor an oblate (prolate) morphology at the peak and in the red wing, the\ncontinuum polarisation may be of any sign. These complex polarisation\nvariations are produced not just by the asymmetric distribution of scatterers\nbut also of the flux. Our early-time signatures are in contradiction with\npredictions for a centrally illuminated aspherical nebula, although this\nbecomes a better approximation at nebular times. For a fixed asymmetry, our\nsynthetic continuum polarisation is generally low, may evolve non-monotonically\nduring the plateau phase, but it systematically rises as the ejecta become\noptically thin. Changes in polarization over time do not necessarily imply a\nchange in the asymmetry of the ejecta. The SN structure (e.g.,\ndensity/ionization) critically influences the level of polarisation.\nImportantly, a low polarisation (<0.5%) at early times does not necessarily\nimply a low degree of asymmetry as usually assumed. Asphericity influences\nline-profile morphology and the luminosity, which may compromise the accuracy\nof SN characteristics inferred from these. \n\n"}

In galaxies\nwith sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for\nthe gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower\nthan this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow\nstatus; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for\ninfall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be\ndominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV.

Over the past decade, the standard paradigm\nthat has developed is that all/most stars are formed in clusters and that the\nvast majority of these groups are disrupted over short timescales (< 10 Myr).\nThis is thought to be due to the removal of the left over gas from the\nstar-formation process, known as infant mortality.

Abstract: Recent detections of GeV photons in a few GRBs by Fermi-LAT imply huge bulk\nLorentz factors to avoid a large gamma gamma optical depth at high energy.\nEstimates can be as high as Gamma ~ 1000 in the most extreme cases. This puts\nsevere constraints on models of the central engine and the jet acceleration in\nGRBs. These estimates are however obtained from a simplified single zone model.\nWe present here a more realistic calculation which takes into account the time,\nspace and direction dependent photon field existing in an outflow with several\nrelativistically moving emitting zones. The formalism is general and can be\napplied to many models of the prompt GRB emission. We present results obtained\nfor a numerical implementation in the framework of the internal shock model. We\nshow that (i) the minimum Lorentz factor Gamma_min in bright LAT GRBs is\nreduced by a factor ~ 2-3 compared to previous estimates if the GeV and MeV\nemission are produced in the same region, and by an additional factor ~ 2-8 if\nthe GeV emission is produced at larger radii. We provide an improved\napproximate formula for Gamma_min which is in good agreement with our numerical\nresults and can be directly applied to LAT GRB data; (ii) a delayed GeV onset\ncan be due to the time evolution of the opacity. As an illustration of these\ntwo first results, we present a synthetic GRB that reproduces most features of\nGRB 080916C with a mean Lorentz factor of ~ 340, an optically thin regime for\ngamma gamma opacity at 3GeV in bin 'b', a variability timescale of 0.5s in the\nMeV lightcurve and a delayed onset of ~ 5s of the GeV emission; (iii) the gamma\ngamma opacity can smooth the short timescale variability in the GeV lightcurve.\nThis last result implies that the observed variability at high energy is not\nnecessarily a good test to distinguish between an internal and an external\norigin for the GeV emission in GRBs.

During high\nstate phases, the high-frequency SSC component often dominates the\nlow-frequency synchrotron component, implying that the inverse Compton SSC\nlosses of electrons are at least equal to or greater than the synchrotron\nlosses of electrons.

The\nradial temperature profile is flatter than the average profile for other\nclusters until the radius reaches the northwest radio relic. The temperature\ndrops sharply from 5 keV to about 2 keV at the northwest radio relic region.\nThe sharp changes of the temperature can be interpreted as a shock with a Mach\nnumber of about 2.5. The entropy slope becomes flatter in the outer region and\nnegative around the radio relic region.

We\npresent a nonlinear study of the collisionless MRI using first-principles\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. In this initial study we focus on\nlocal two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations, deferring more realistic\nthree-dimensional simulations to future work. For simulations with net vertical\nmagnetic flux, the MRI continuously amplifies the magnetic field until the\nAlfv\\'en velocity, v_A, is comparable to the speed of light, c (independent of\nthe initial value of v_A/c). This is consistent with the lack of saturation of\nMRI channel modes in analogous axisymmetric MHD simulations.

We give a complete presentation of the analytical\napproximations for the Compton scattering of synchrotron emission with both\nweak and strong synchrotron self-absorption. All possible orders of the\ncharacteristic synchrotron spectral breaks ($\\nu_{\\rm a}$, $\\nu_{\\rm m}$, and\n$\\nu_{\\rm c}$) are studied. In the weak self-absorption regime, i.e., $\\nu_{\\rm\na} < \\nu_c$, the electron energy distribution is not modified by the\nself-absorption process. The shape of the SSC component broadly resembles that\nof synchrotron, but with the following features: The SSC flux increases\nlinearly with frequency up to the SSC break frequency corresponding to the\nself-absorption frequency $\\nu_{\\rm a}$; and the presence of a logarithmic term\nin the high-frequency range of the SSC spectra makes it harder than the\npower-law approximation. In the strong absorption regime, i.e. $\\nu_{\\rm a} >\n\\nu_{\\rm c}$, heating of low energy electrons due to synchrotron absorption\nleads to pile-up of electrons, and form a thermal component besides the broken\npower-law component. This leads to two-component (thermal + non-thermal)\nspectra for both the synchrotron and SSC spectral components. For $\\nu_{\\rm c}\n< \\nu_{\\rm a} < \\nu_{\\rm m}$, the spectrum is thermal (non-thermal) -dominated\nif $\\nu_a > \\sqrt{\\nu_m \\nu_c}$ ($\\nu_a < \\sqrt{\\nu_m \\nu_c}$). Similar to the\nweak-absorption regime, the SSC spectral component is broader than the simple\nbroken power law approximation. We derive the critical condition for strong\nabsorption (electron pile-up), and discuss a case of GRB reverse shock emission\nin a wind medium, which invokes $\\nu_{\\rm a} > {\\rm max} (\\nu_{\\rm m}, \\nu_{\\rm\nc})$. \n\n"}

This birth of a relativistic jet may have\nbeen observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs), which\nwere discovered in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet no transient radio emission has\nbeen detected from the tens of TDF candidates that were discovered at optical\nto soft X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up at radio\nfrequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by Doppler boosting,\nwhich reduces the jet flux for off-axis observers. And since the existing\nfollow-up observation are mostly within ~10 months of the discovery, the\nnon-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with respect to\nthe time of disruption. To test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets, we\nobtained 5 GHz follow-up observations with the Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs.\nTo avoid missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8 years since\nthe estimated time of disruption. None of the sources are detected, with very\ndeep upper limits at the 10 micro Jansky level. These observations rule out the\nhypothesis that these TDFs launched jets similar to radio-loud quasars.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored.

We include these higher opacities in time dependent,\nmulti-wavelength radiative transport calculations to predict the broadband\nlight curves of one-dimensional models over a range of parameters (ejecta\nmasses from 0.001 to 0.1 solar masses and velocities from 0.1 to 0.3c). We find\nthat the higher opacities lead to much longer duration light curves which can\nlast a week or more. The emission is shifted toward the infrared bands due to\nstrong optical line blanketing, and the colors at later times are\nrepresentative of a blackbody near the recombination temperature of the\nlanthanides (T ~ 2500K). We further consider the case in which a second mass\noutflow, composed of 56Ni, is ejected from a disk wind, and show that the net\nresult is a distinctive two component spectral energy distribution, with a\nbright optical peak due to 56Ni and an infrared peak due to r-process ejecta.\nWe briefly consider the prospects for detection and identification of these\ntransients. \n\n"}

This\nemission constitutes a significant fraction of the pulsar spin-down luminosity.\nIt is not clear however, how the highly magnetized pulsar wind could convert\nits mainly electromagnetic energy into the particles with such high efficiency.\nHere we investigate a scenario in which a pulsar striped wind converts into a\nstrong electromagnetic wave before reaching the shock. This mode can be thought\nof as a shock precursor that is able to accelerate particles to\nultrarelativistic energies at the expense of the electromagnetic energy it\ncarries. Radiation of the particles leads to damping of the wave. The\nefficiency of this process depends on the physical conditions imposed by the\nexternal medium.

The source has large fractional circular polarization, m_c \\equiv |V|/I,\ndetected at high significance across the entire band (from 15 to 90\\sigma per\n128 MHz sub-band).

We use a\nsemi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy evolution to build the theoretical\nTF relation.

We provide a theoretical framework to calculate such measurable\nquantities from semi-analytic models. We establish the morphology dependence of\nthe TF relation in both model and data. We analyse the dynamical properties of\nthe model galaxies and determine that the parameter 'sigma/Vc', i.e. the ratio\nbetween random and total motions defined by velocity dispersion and circular\nvelocity, accurately characterises the varying slope of the TF relation for\ndifferent model galaxy types. We apply these dynamical cuts to the observed\ngalaxies and find that such selection produces a differential slope of the TF\nrelation. The TF slope in different ranges of 'sigma/Vc' is consistent with\nthat for the photometric classification in Sa, Sb, Sc.

We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta.

If correct, this result has important\nconsequences: objects with a light ring are black holes. In other words, the\nnonlinear instability of ultracompact stars would provide a strong argument in\nfavor of the \"black hole hypothesis,\" once electromagnetic or\ngravitational-wave observations confirm the existence of light rings.

In earlier work, it has been\nsuggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the\nmagnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines\nanchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles\nand produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity\nAGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation\nbetween the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$\norders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above.

It is the decay of quantum vacuum into\nparticle anti-particle pairs near the black hole surface. However, in a\nreference frame undergoing an uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat\nMinkowski space-time geometry, in the non-relativistic approximation, the\nparticle production near the event horizon of a black hole may be treated as a\nkind of Fowler-Nordheim field emission, which is the typical electron emission\nprocess from a metal surface under the action of an external electrostatic\nfield.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

In the early and\nadvanced stages of galaxy merging, observations of the triggering of accretion\nonto one or both BHs inform us about feedback processes and BH growth.\nIdentification of the compact binary SMBHs at parsec and sub-parsec scales\nprovides us with important constraints on the interaction processes that govern\nthe shrinkage of the binary beyond the \"final parsec\". Coalescing binary SMBHs\nare among the most powerful sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the\nuniverse.

Since redshifts are usually measured from the optical spectrum of the\nafterglow, correlations between prompt and afterglow emissions may introduce\nbiases in the distribution of rest-frame properties of the prompt emission,\nespecially considering that we measure the redshift of only one third of Swift\nGRBs.\n  In this paper we study the brightness of optical GRB afterglows and the role\nof optical selection effects in the distribution of various intrinsic\nproperties of GRBs and on the Epi - Eiso relation discovered by Amati et al.\n(2002). Our analysis is based on a sample of 85 GRBs with good optical\nfollow-up and well measured prompt emission. 71 of them have a measure of\nredshift and 14 have no redshift. We discuss the connection between the\nlocation of GRBs in the Epi-Eiso plane and their optical brightness measured\ntwo hours after the trigger in the GRB rest frame. We show that the brightness\nof GRBs in our sample is mainly driven by their intrinsic luminosity and\ndepends only slightly on their redshift.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission. \n\n"}

The first method is the simultaneous fitting method. The\nextrinsic scatter $\\sigma_{\\rm ext}$ is taken into account and assigned to the\nparameter $E_{\\rm iso}$. The best-fitting values are $a=49.15\\pm0.26$,\n$b=1.42\\pm0.11$, $\\sigma_{\\rm ext}=0.34\\pm0.03$ and $\\Omega_m=0.79$ in the flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. The constraint on $\\Omega_m$ is $0.55<\\Omega_m<1$ at the\n1$\\sigma$ confidence level. If reduced $\\chi^2$ method is used, the best-fit\nresults are $a=48.96\\pm0.18$, $b=1.52\\pm0.08$ and $\\Omega_m=0.50\\pm0.12$. The\nsecond method is using type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to calibrate the $E_{\\rm\niso}-E_{\\rm p}$ correlation. We calibrate 90 high-redshift GRBs in the redshift\nrange from 1.44 to 8.1. The cosmological constraints from these 90 GRBs are\n$\\Omega_m=0.23^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ for flat $\\Lambda$CDM, and\n$\\Omega_m=0.18\\pm0.11$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.46\\pm0.51$ for non-flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM. For the combination of GRB and SNe Ia sample, we obtain\n$\\Omega_m=0.271\\pm0.019$ and $h=0.701\\pm0.002$ for the flat $\\Lambda$CDM, and\nfor the non-flat $\\Lambda$CDM, the results are $\\Omega_m=0.225\\pm0.044$,\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.640\\pm0.082$ and $h=0.698\\pm0.004$. These results from\ncalibrated GRBs are consistent with that of SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the combined\ndata can improve cosmological constraints significantly, comparing to SNe Ia\nalone.

Actually what all happens in that scenario is that in such a\nuniverse, whose evolutionary behaviour is described by a single scale factor,\nwhich may be time dependent but is otherwise independent of spatial\ncoordinates, the light signals in a finite time might not be covering all the\navailable space. Further, the flatness problem, as it is posed, is not even\nfalsifiable. The usual argument offered in the literature is that the present\ndensity of the universe is very close to the critical density value and that\nthe universe must be flat since otherwise in past at $\\sim10^{-35}$ second\n(near the epoch of inflation) there will be extremely low departures of density\nfrom the critical density value (of the order $\\sim10^{-53}$), requiring a sort\nof fine tuning.

The observed\nhigh-energy electromagnetic radiation (above 50 keV) originated from a weak\ntransient source and lasted for about 1 second. Its localization is consistent\nwith the direction to GW150914. We speculate about the possible scenario for\nthe formation of a gamma-ray burst accompanied by the gravitational-wave\nsignal. Our model invokes a tight binary system consisting of a massive star\nand a black hole which leads to the triggering of a collapse of the star's\nnucleus, the formation of a second black hole, and finally to the binary black\nhole merger. For the most-likely configuration of the binary spin vectors with\nrespect to the orbital angular momentum in the GW150914 event, the recoil speed\n(kick velocity) acquired by the final black hole through gravitational wave\nemission is of the order of a few hundred km/s and this might be sufficient to\nget it closer to the envelope of surrounding material and capture a small\nfraction of matter from the remnant of the host star.

In this work, we gain insights into the\nrelative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet\nfeedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the\nproperties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary.

The transient shows\nsignificant polarization at both the observed epochs: one 24 days before\nmaximum light in the rest-frame, and the subsequent at 27 days after peak\nluminosity. Analysis of the Q-U plane suggests the presence of a dominant axis\nand no physical departure from the main axis at either epoch. The polarization\nspectrum along the dominant axis is characterized by a strong wavelength\ndependence and an increase in the signal from the first to the second epoch. We\nuse a Monte Carlo code to demonstrate that these properties are consistent with\na simple toy model that adopts an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal configuration for\nthe ejecta. We find that the wavelength dependence of the polarisation is\npossibly due to a strong wavelength dependence in the line opacity, while the\nhigher level of polarisation at the second epoch is a consequence of the\nincrease in the asphericity of the inner layers of the ejecta or the fact that\nthe photosphere recedes into less spherical layers.

Abstract: We consider some general implications of bright gamma-ray counterparts to\nfast radio bursts (FRBs). We show that even if these manifest in only a\nfraction of FRBs, gamma-ray detections with current satellites (including\nSwift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the\nenergy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a\nmagnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the\nintergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the\nrequired gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or\nextended emission of short gamma-ray bursts. While this can be reconciled with\nthe rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios,\nthe prompt outflow that yields the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to\nescape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a\nwind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB\nemission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio\nafterglow emission from gamma-ray bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated.\nGravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests. \n\n"}

We discuss its\njustification from experimental studies of cold atoms as well as from\ntheoretical studies of neutron matter. We demonstrate that this bound results\nin limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference\nbetween the energies of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this\nbound leads to a lower limit to the volume symmetry energy parameter $S_0$. In\naddition, for assumed values of $S_0$ above this minimum, this bound implies\nboth upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$, which\ndescribes the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower\nbound on the neutron-matter incompressibility is also obtained. These bounds\nare found to be consistent with both recent calculations of the energies of PNM\nand constraints from nuclear experiments. Our results are significant because\nseveral equations of state that are currently used in astrophysical simulations\nof supernovae and neutron star mergers, as well as in nuclear physics\nsimulations of heavy-ion collisions, have symmetry energy parameters that\nviolate these bounds.

Our results indicate that\nsmall-scale dissipation effects near the protostellar surface provide a\nfeedback loop for stabilizing the star formation efficiency. This is true\nregardless of whether the balance is maintained by input of energy from large\nscale forcing or by strong magnetic fields that inhibit collapse.

By exploiting the better\nstatistics of the new sample, we confirm the results of Magliocchetti et al.\n(2014): the probability for a radio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR\nwavelengths is both a function of radio luminosity and redshift, whereby\npowerful sources are more likely FIR emitters at earlier epochs. Such an\nemission is due to star-forming processes within the host galaxy. FIR emitters\nand non-FIR emitters only differentiate in the z<1 universe.

One possible\nmodification to General Relativity is the gravitational parity violation that\ngives rise to the amplitude birefringence in gravitational waves, where one of\nthe circularly-polarized mode is amplified while the other one is suppressed\nduring their propagation. In this paper, we study how well one can measure\ngravitational parity violation via the amplitude birefringence of gravitational\nwaves from stellar-mass black hole binaries. We choose Chern-Simons gravity as\nan example and work within an effective field theory formalism. We consider\ngravitational waves from both individual sources and stochastic gravitational\nwave backgrounds. Regarding bounds from individual sources, we estimate them\nusing a Fisher analysis and carry out Monte Carlo simulations by randomly\ndistributing sources over their sky location and binary orientation. We find\nthat the bounds on the scalar field evolution in Chern-Simons gravity from\nGW150914 are too weak to satisfy the weak Chern-Simons approximation, while\naLIGO with its design sensitivity can place meaningful bounds. Regarding bounds\nfrom stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, we set the threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio for detection of the parity-violation mode as 5 and\nestimate projected bounds with future detectors assuming that signals are\nconsistent with no parity violation. We find that a network of two\nthird-generation detectors is able to place bounds that are slightly stronger\nthan current binary pulsar bounds. Since gravitational wave observations probe\neither the difference in parity violation between the source and the detector\nor the line-of-sight integration of the scalar field, such bounds are\ncomplementary to local measurements from solar system experiments and binary\npulsar observations. \n\n"}

An alternative to new elementary particles\npostulates DM as made of macroscopic compact halo objects (MACHO) such as black\nholes formed in the very early universe. Stellar-mass primordial black holes\n(PBHs) are subject to less robust constraints than other mass ranges and might\nbe connected to gravitational-wave signals detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). New methods are therefore necessary to\nconstrain the viability of compact objects as a DM candidate.

Current SNe datasets constrain compact objects to\nrepresent less than 35.2% (Joint Lightcurve Analisis) and 37.2% (Union 2.1) of\nthe total matter content in the universe, at 95% confidence-level. The results\nare valid for masses larger than $\\sim 0.01M_\\odot$ (solar-masses), limited by\nthe size SNe relative to the lens Einstein radius.

The spectral properties of hard state black hole binary\nsystems and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei are regularly attributed to\ntruncated accretion disks, but a detailed understanding of the flow dynamics is\nlacking.

Different from the radio and optical emission from the\ncore, it is found that the gamma-ray emission is steady without detection of\nflux variation over 2 sigma confidence level. This likely implies that the\ngamma-ray emission is from its knots. We collect the radio, optical, and X-ray\ndata of knot-A, the closest knot from the core at 1 arcsec, and compile its\nspectral energy distribution (SED). Although the single-zone\nsynchrotron+SSC+IC/CMB model by assuming knot-A at rest can reproduce the SED\nin the radio-optical-X-ray band, the predicted gamma-ray flux is lower than the\nLAT observations and the derived magnetic field strength deviates the\nequipartition condition with 3 orders of magnitude. Assuming that knot-A is\nrelativistically moving, its SED from radio to gamma-ray bands would be well\nrepresented with the single-zone synchrotron+SSC+IC/CMB model under the\nequipartition condition.

While the\nTeV-detected radio galaxies (TeVRad) only form a small fraction of the\n\\gamma-ray detected AGN, their multi-wavelength study offers a unique\nopportunity to probe and pinpoint the high-energy emission processes and sites.\nEven in the absence of substantial Doppler beaming TeVRad are extremely bright\nobjects in the TeV sky (luminosities detected up to 10^{45} erg/s), and exhibit\nflux variations on timescales shorter than the event-horizon scales (flux\ndoubling timescale less than 5 minutes). Thanks to the recent advancement in\nthe imaging capabilities of high-resolution radio interferometry (millimeter\nvery long baseline interferometry, mm-VLBI), one can probe the scales down to\nless than 10 gravitational radii in TeVRad, making it possible not only to test\njet launching models but also to pinpoint the high-energy emission sites and to\nunravel the emission mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the\nhigh-energy observations of TeVRad with a focus on the emitting sites and\nradiation processes. Some recent approaches in simulations are also sketched.\nObservations by the near-future facilities like Cherenkov Telescope Array,\nshort millimeter-VLBI, and high-energy polarimetry instruments will be crucial\nfor discriminating the competing high-energy emission models. \n\n"}

We then compute the gas flow velocities with a 2-D gas\ndynamical code, and compare the model flow patterns to a 2-D velocity field\nderived from Fabry-Perot observations. The strong shocks and non-circular\nmotions in the observed gas flow require a high stellar M/L and a fast-rotating\nbar. Models with I-band disk M/L of 2.0 -- 2.5 h_75, or 80 -- 100% of the\nmaximum disk value, are highly favored. The corotation radius of the bar must\nbe <= 1.5 times the bar semi-major axis. These results contradict some recent\nclaimed ``universal'' galaxy disk/halo relations, since NGC 4123 is of modest\nsize (rotation curve maximum 145 km/sec, and V_flat = 130 km/sec) yet is quite\ndisk-dominated. The dark halo of NGC 4123 is less concentrated than favored by\ncurrent models of dark halos based on cosmological simulations. Since some 30%\nof bright disk galaxies are strongly barred and have dust lanes indicating\nshock morphology similar to that of NGC 4123, it is likely that they also have\nhigh stellar M/L and low density halos.

To develop the method, we focus on a specific\nstatistical property of the intrinsic Gaussian CMB field; a field point in the\nmap that has a larger absolute value of the temperature threshold tends to have\na larger absolute value of the curvature parameter defined by a trace of second\nderivative matrix of the temperature field, while the ellipticity parameter\nsimilarly defined is uniformly distributed independently of the threshold\nbecause of the isotropic nature of the Gaussian field. The weak lensing then\ncauses a stronger distortion effect on the isotemperature contours with higher\nthreshold and especially induces a coherent distribution of the ellipticity\nparameter correlated with the threshold as a result of the coupling between the\nCMB curvature parameter and the gravitational tidal shear in the observed map.\nThese characteristic patterns can be statistically picked up by considering\nthree independent characteristic functions, which are obtained from the\naverages of quadratic combinations of the second derivative fields of CMB over\nisotemperature contours with each threshold.

Similarly to what shown in Del\nPopolo & Gambera (1999, 2000) (hereafter DG99, DG00), Del Popolo et al.

This so-called cold dark matter (CDM) crisis has\nbeen addressed in several ways, ranging from a change in fundamental physics by\nintroducing self-interacting cold dark matter particles to a tuning of complex\nastrophysical processes such as global and/or local feedback. All these efforts\nattempt to soften density profiles and reduce the abundance of satellites in\nsimulated galaxy halos. In this paper, we explore a somewhat different approach\nwhich consists of filtering the dark matter power spectrum on small scales,\nthereby altering the formation history of low mass objects. The physical\nmotivation for damping these fluctuations lies in the possibility that the dark\nmatter particles have a different nature i.e. are warm (WDM) rather than cold.\nWe show that this leads to some interesting new results in terms of the merger\nhistory and large-scale distribution of low mass halos, as compared to the\nstandard CDM scenario. However, WDM does not appear to be the ultimate\nsolution, in the sense that it is not able to fully solve the CDM crisis, even\nthough one of the main drawbacks, namely the abundance of satellites, can be\nremedied. Indeed, the cuspiness of the halo profiles still persists, at all\nredshifts, and for all halos and sub-halos that we investigated. Despite the\npersistence of the cuspiness problem of DM halos, WDM seems to be still worth\ntaking seriously, as it alleviates the problems of overabundant sub-structures\nin galactic halos and possibly the lack of angular momentum of simulated disk\ngalaxies. WDM also lessens the need to invoke strong feedback to solve these\nproblems, and may provide a natural explanation of the clustering properties\nand ages of dwarfs. \n\n"}

Several ULXs have been seen\nto vary, and to make a transition at their lowest luminosity to a spectrum\nwhich looks more like a power law. These have been previously interpreted as\nthe analogue of the power law dominated low/hard state in Galactic BHBs.\nHowever, the ULX luminosity at which the transition occurs must be at least\n10--50 per cent of the Eddington limit assuming that their highest luminosity\nphase corresponds to the Eddington limit, while for the Galactic BHBs the\nhigh/soft--low/hard transition occurs at a few per cent of the Eddington limit.\nHere we show that the apparently power law spectrum in a ULX in IC342 can be\nequally well fit over the ASCA bandpass by a strongly Comptonised optically\nthick accretion disk with the maximum temperature of ~1 keV. Recent work on the\nGalactic BHBs has increasingly shown that such components are common at high\nmass accretion rates, and that this often characterises the very high (or\nanomalous) state.

Such shocks conserve flow temperature by the\ndissipation of energy at the shock location.Unlike previous works in this\nfield, our calculation is {\\it not} restricted to any particular kind of\npost-Newtonian gravitational potentials, rather we use {\\it all} available\npseudo-Schwarzschild potentials to formulate and solve the equations governing\nthe accretion and wind only in terms of flow temperature $T$ and specific\nangular momentum $\\lambda$ of the flow.

In addition, during the epochs prior to maximum light, the\nCaII IR triplet absorption is seen distinctly and separately at both normal\nphotospheric velocities and at very high velocities. The high-velocity triplet\nabsorption is highly polarized, with a different polarization angle than the\nrest of the spectrum. The unique observation allows us to construct a\nrelatively detailed picture of the layered geometrical structure of the\nsupernova ejecta: in our interpretation, the ejecta layers near the photosphere\n(v \\approx 10,000 km/s) obey a near axial symmetry, while a detached,\nhigh-velocity structure (v \\approx 18,000-25,000 km/s) with high CaII line\nopacity deviates from the photospheric axisymmetry. By partially obscuring the\nunderlying photosphere, the high-velocity structure causes a more incomplete\ncancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light, and so gives rise\nto the polarization peak and rotated polarization angle of the high-velocity IR\ntriplet feature. In an effort to constrain the ejecta geometry, we develop a\ntechnique for calculating 3-D synthetic polarization spectra and use it to\ngenerate polarization profiles for several parameterized configurations.

The\nsynthetic spectra rule out the spherical shell model, disfavor a toroid, and\nfind a best fit with the clumped shell.

The local BH mass\nfunction (BHMF) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH\nmass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and\nvelocity functions. The density of BH's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;\n+1.9) (h/0.7)^2 10^5 Msun Mpc^-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity\nequation with the only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion onto\nmassive BH's and that merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at\nz=0 is generated mainly at z<3. Moreover, the BH growth is anti-hierarchical in\nthe sense that smaller BH's (MBH< 10^7 Msun) grow at lower redshifts (z<1) with\nrespect to more massive one's (z~1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the\nBHMF of AGN relics is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF indicating the\nlocal BH's were mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained\nwhile satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray\nbackground.

Two patterns of correlated X-ray-optical/nIR behavior were found. During\nthe hard state the optical/nIR and X-ray fluxes correlated well, with a nIR vs.\nX-ray flux relation similar to the relation between X-ray and radio fluxes\nfound in previous studies of GX 339-4 and other black hole binaries. As GX\n339-4 went through an intermediate state the optical/nIR fluxes decreased\nrapidly and once it had entered the spectrally soft state, the optical/nIR\nspectrum was much bluer and the ratio of X-ray to nIR flux was higher by a\nfactor of more than 10 compared to the hard state.

Using data from the Burst Alert and X-Ray Telescopes, we show that the\nX-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into a\npower law, often with flares superimposed. The transition time between the\nexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for the\nburst duration. In most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay within\nthe first hour, and a late emission \"hump\" is observed which can last for many\nhours. In other GRBs the hump is weak or absent. The observed variety in the\nshape of the early X-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of three\ncomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the late\nhump. In this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after the\nburst and the observed shape of the X-ray light curve depends on the relative\nstrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.\nThere is a strong correlation such that those GRBs with stronger afterglow\ncomponents have brighter early optical emission.

Given the observed temporal overlapping between the flares and\nafterglows, there must be inverse Compton (IC) emission arising from such flare\nphotons scattered by forward shock afterglow electrons. We find that this IC\nemission produces GeV-TeV flares, which may be detected by GLAST and\nground-based TeV telescopes.

Five out of six well studied RL NLS1 share\nthis dual classification (optically defined as a NLS1 with radio definition of\na CSS or giga-hertz peaked spectrum (GPS) source). The SED is created from\nsimultaneous observations at radio (ATCA), optical/NIR (Siding Spring) and\nUV/X-ray (XMM-Newton) wavelengths. The X-ray data show evidence of short-term\nvariability, a possible soft excess, and negligible absorption. Together with\nthe rest of the SED, the X-ray emission is excessive in comparison to\nsynchrotron plus synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models. The SED can be\ndescribed with a two component model consisting of extended synchrotron/SSC\nemission with Comptonisation in the X-rays, though SSC models with a very high\nelectron-to-magnetic energy density ratio cannot be excluded either. The peak\nemission in the SED appears to be in the near infrared, which can be attributed\nto thermal emission from a dusty torus.

Longer exposures, which we\napproximate by combining multiple (N) images from uncorrelated atmospheric\nrealizations, yield progressively lower ellipticity (as 1 / sqrt(N)). We also\nverify that the measured ellipticity does not depend on the sampling interval\nin the pupil plane using the Fourier method.

Therefore, ray tracing is generally not an accurate method of\nmodeling PSF ellipticity induced by atmospheric turbulence unless some\nadditional procedure is implemented to correctly account for the effects of\nhigh spatial frequency aberrations. The Fourier method, however, can be used\ndirectly to accurately model PSF ellipticity, which can give insights into\nerrors in the statistics of field galaxy shapes used in studies of weak\ngravitational lensing. \n\n"}

Estimating the luminosity\nfunction from magnitude limited samples is relatively straightforward, provided\nthat the distances to the objects in the sample are known accurately;\ntechniques for doing this have been available for about thirty years. However,\ndistances are usually known accurately for only a small subset of the sample.\nThis is true of the objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will be\nincreasingly true of the next generation of deep multi-color photometric\nsurveys. Estimating the luminosity function when distances are only known\napproximately (e.g., photometric redshifts are available, but spectroscopic\nredshifts are not) is more difficult. I describe two algorithms which can\nhandle this complication: one is a generalization of the V_max algorithm, and\nthe other is a maximum likelihood approach. Because these methods account for\nuncertainties in the distance estimate, they impact a broader range of studies.\nFor example, they are useful for studying the abundances of galaxies which are\nsufficiently nearby that the contribution of peculiar velocity to the\nspectroscopic redshift is not negligible, so only a noisy estimate of the true\ndistance is available. In this respect, peculiar velocities and photometric\nredshift errors have similar effects.

Extreme conditions in gamma ray bursters lead to\nhighly relativistic motions (bulk Lorentz factors Gamma > 100).

We now wish to address the second uncertainty. Afterglows allow a\nstatistical test of beaming, described in an earlier paper. In this paper, we\nmodify a standard fireball afterglow model to explore the effects of beaming on\nburst remnant dynamics and afterglow emission. If the burst ejecta are beamed\ninto angle zeta, the burst remnant's evolution changes qualitatively once its\nbulk Lorentz factor Gamma < 1/zeta: Before this, Gamma declines as a power law\nof radius, while afterwards, it declines exponentially.

The radio morphology of Centaurus A and, in particular,\nits NML could be the result of a precessing jet that has undergone a strong\ninteraction with the environment at least in the northern side. The very big\ndrop in intensity between the inner jet and the large-scale jet can be\nexplained with a sequence of bursts of activity at different epochs in the life\nof the source.

Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not\nnecessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is\nstationary axisymmetric,described by a metric which deviates slightly from the\nKerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a `quasi-Kerr'\nmetric by adding to the Kerr metric the deviation in the value of the\nquadrupole moment.

We show that, for the M-theory motivated potentials,\nthe cosmic acceleration of the universe can be eternal if the spatial curvature\nof the 4d spacetime is negative, while the acceleration is only transient for a\nspatially flat universe. We also comment on the size of the internal space and\nits associated geometric bounds on massive Kaluza-Klein excitations. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0409124", "contents": "Title: Phases of massive gravity Abstract: We systematically study the most general Lorentz-violating graviton mass\ninvariant under three-dimensional Eucledian group using the explicitly\ncovariant language. We find that at general values of mass parameters the\nmassive graviton has six propagating degrees of freedom, and some of them are\nghosts or lead to rapid classical instabilities. However, there is a number of\ndifferent regions in the mass parameter space where massive gravity can be\ndescribed by a consistent low-energy effective theory with cutoff\n$\\sim\\sqrt{mM_{Pl}}$ free of rapid instabilities and vDVZ discontinuity. Each\nof these regions is characterized by certain fine-tuning relations between mass\nparameters, generalizing the Fierz--Pauli condition. In some cases the required\nfine-tunings are consequences of the existence of the subgroups of the\ndiffeomorphism group that are left unbroken by the graviton mass. We found two\nnew cases, when the resulting theories have a property of UV insensitivity,\ni.e. remain well behaved after inclusion of arbitrary higher dimension\noperators without assuming any fine-tunings among the coefficients of these\noperators, besides those enforced by the symmetries. These theories can be\nthought of as generalizations of the ghost condensate model with a smaller\nresidual symmetry group. We briefly discuss what kind of cosmology can one\nexpect in massive gravity and argue that the allowed values of the graviton\nmass may be quite large, affecting growth of primordial perturbations,\nstructure formation and, perhaps, enhancing the backreaction of inhomogeneities\non the expansion rate of the Universe. \n\n"}

However, as has been known for a long time,\nin many string-based models, the axion coupling parameter F_a is several orders\nof magnitude higher than the standard cosmological bounds. We re-examine this\nproblem in a variety of models, showing that F_a is close to the GUT scale or\nabove in many models that have GUT-like phenomenology, as well as some that do\nnot. On the other hand, in some models with Standard Model gauge fields\nsupported on vanishing cycles, it is possible for F_a to be well below the GUT\nscale. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0611048", "contents": "Title: Notes on the Area Theorem Abstract: Hawking's area theorem can be understood from a quasi-stationary process in\nwhich a black hole accretes $positive$ energy matter, ``independent of the\ndetails of the gravity action''. I use this process to study the dynamics of\nthe ``inner'' as well as the outer horizons for various black holes which\ninclude the recently discovered exotic black holes and three-dimensional black\nholes in higher derivative gravities as well as the usual BTZ black hole and\nthe Kerr black hole in four dimensions. I find that the area for the inner\nhorizon ``can decrease'', rather than increase, with the quasi-stationary\nprocess. However, I find that the area for the outer horizon ``never decrease''\nsuch as the usual area theorem still works in our examples, though this is\nquite non-trivial in general. There exist the instability of the inner horizons\nand the connected effects of ``mass inflation'' but, according to more detailed\nanalysis, it seems that the instability is not important in my analysis. I also\nfind a ``generalized'' area theorem by combining those of the outer and inner\nhorizons. \n\n"}

Abstract: We argue that four-dimensional quantum gravity may be essentially\nrenormalizable if one relaxes the assumption of metricity of the theory. We\nwork with Plebanski formulation of general relativity in which the metric\n(tetrad), the connection, and the curvature are all independent variables and\nthe usual relations among these quantities are valid only on-shell. One of the\nEuler-Lagrange equations of this theory ensures its metricity. We show that\nquantum corrected action contains a counterterm that destroys this metricity\nproperty, and that no other counterterms appear, at least, at the one-loop\nlevel. The new term in the action is akin to a curvature-dependent cosmological\n``constant''. \n\n"}
