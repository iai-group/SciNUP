Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

Observations indicate a strong link between star formation and black\nhole (BH) growth, but some questions remain unanswered: whether both activities\nare coeval or whether one precedes the other, what their characteristic\ntimescales are, and what kinds of physical processes are responsible for this\ninterplay.\n  Aims. We examine stellar and BH masses (M_star and M_BH) in z~2 active\nsystems at the peak of their AGN or star formation activity to investigate how\nthey are linked and whether AGN radiative or else radio power provides a\nfeedback mechanism that regulates the stellar growth in these systems.\n  Methods. We analyze the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions of radio,\nsub-millimeter and mid-IR selected AGNs at z~1-3 and constrain their stellar\nand AGN luminosities using AGN and host-galaxy templates.\n  Results. We find evidence of increasing stellar light, thereby decreasing the\nAGN mid-IR power going from mid-IR selected AGNs, to radio galaxies, and to\nsub-millimeter AGNs. This trend can be explained by either decreasing Eddington\nratios or increasing offsets from the local M_BH-M_star relation. All systems\nare characterized by high star formation rates regardless of their different\nAGN powers, thus neither AGN radiative power nor AGN-driven radio activity\nseems to influence the star formation rate in the selected AGNs.

The\nprincipal motivation is in connecting quantum registers without resorting to\noptics. A spin chain is a permanently coupled 1D system of spins. When one\nplaces a quantum state on one end of it, the state will be dynamically\ntransmitted to the other end with some efficiency if the spins are coupled by\nan exchange interaction. No external modulations or measurements on the body of\nthe chain, except perhaps at the very ends, is required for this purpose. For\nthe simplest (uniformly coupled) chain and the simplest encoding (single qubit\nencoding), however, dispersion reduces the quality of transfer. We present a\nvariety of alternatives proposed by various groups to achieve perfect quantum\nstate transfer through spin chains. We conclude with a brief discussion of the\nvarious directions in which the topic is developing. \n\n"}

Very different areas of physics such as, for example, electrodynamics\nand quantum transport, can profit from this Green's function formalism. The\nfundamental homogeneous-medium Green's tensor of electrodynamics is deduced\nfrom the field of a dipole. Based upon that a numerical procedure is presented\nto solve the wave-equation for the near-field in a scattering setup for\narbitrary material distributions.

The first subsystem, at galactocentric distances r<3.5 kpc, rotates in\nthe plane of the stellar disk. The inner part of the ionized-gas disk (r<1.5-2\nkpc) exactly coincides with the previously known disk consisting of molecular\ngas. The second subsystem of ionized gas is located at galactocentric distances\n2-6 kpc. This subsystem rotates in a plane tilted by a significant angle to the\nstellar disk.

The spectrum of\neach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from\n0.3-0.7 keV and subsolar elemental abundances. In four of the five knots,\nnon-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling out\nsynchrotron or IC/CMB mechanisms for their emission. The internal pressures of\nthe knots exceed that of the ambient ISM or the equipartition pressure of the\nNML by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be short\nlived ($\\sim3\\times10^6$ yrs). Based on energetic arguments, it is implausible\nthat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galactic\nnucleus of Cen A or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation of\nthe NML.

The regions have overdensities that\ndeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the\nrms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass\nresolution of up to 10^6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale\nenvironments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h)^3\nMillennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising\nbackground, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR\ndensity at z <~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an\norder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces\nobservational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the\nGOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear\nin the underdense regions until z~3. These environmental variations are not\ncaused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but\nrather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to\nanother, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.\nAt all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250\nkm/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of \"downsizing\" (even\nin the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have\nmostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form\nat later times. However, additional feedback is required to limit star\nformation in massive galaxies at late times. \n\n"}

The conical winds\nappear in cases where the magnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the disk\ninto an X-type configuration. The winds have the shape of a thin conical shell\nwith a half-opening angle 30-40 degrees. The conical winds may be responsible\nfor episodic as well as long-lasting outflows in different types of stars. (2)\nIn the case of rapidly rotating stars (the \"propeller regime\"), a two-component\noutflow is observed. One component is similar to the conical winds.

A second\ncomponent is a high-velocity, low-density magnetically dominated axial jet\nwhere matter flows along the opened polar field lines of the star. The jet has\na mass flux about 10% that of the conical wind, but its energy flux (dominantly\nmagnetic) can be larger than the energy flux of the conical wind.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail.

It is shown that even without a detailed calculation of the\npressure anisotropy or the heat fluxes, one finds the macroscale dynamics to be\ngenerically unstable to microscale Alfvenically polarized fluctuations. Two\ninstabilities are considered in detail: the parallel firehose instability\n(including the finite-Larmor-radius effects that determine the fastest growing\nmode) and the gyrothermal instability (GTI).

This is an\nexhaustive classification.

{"id": "1001.2446", "contents": "Title: The mode of gas accretion onto star-forming galaxies Abstract: It is argued that galaxies like ours sustain their star formation by\ntransferring gas from an extensive corona to the star-forming disc. The\ntransfer is effected by the galactic fountain -- cool clouds that are shot up\nfrom the plane to kiloparsec heights above the plane. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds. In external galaxies trails of HI behind individual\nclouds will not be detectable, although the integrated emission from all such\ntrails should be significant.

This challenges the paradigm that\nmost galaxies form through hierarchical mergers, yet retain supermassive black\nholes at their centers despite having escape velocities much less than v_max.\nInteraction with a circumbinary disk can align the binary black hole spins with\ntheir orbital angular momentum, reducing the recoil velocity of the final black\nhole produced in the subsequent merger. However, the effectiveness of this\nalignment depends on highly uncertain accretion flows near the binary black\nholes. In this Letter, we show that if the spin S_1 of the more massive binary\nblack hole is even partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum L,\nrelativistic spin precession on sub-parsec scales can align the binary black\nhole spins with each other. This alignment significantly reduces the recoil\nvelocity even in the absence of gas. For example, if the angle between S_1 and\nL at large separations is 10 degrees while the second spin S_2 is isotropically\ndistributed, the spin alignment discussed in this paper reduces the median\nrecoil from 864 km/s to 273 km/s for maximally spinning black holes with a mass\nratio of 9/11. This reduction will greatly increase the fraction of galaxies\nretaining their supermassive black holes. \n\n"}

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

At equilibrium the system exhibits a double well structure:\nthe polymer lies(essentially) either above or below the repulsive line. As a\nconsequence one expects a metastable behavior with rare jumps between the two\nphases combined with a fast thermalization inside each phase. However the\nenergy barrier between these two phases is only logarithmic in the system size\nL and therefore the two relevant time scales are only polynomial in L with no\nclear-cut separation between them. The whole evolution is governed by a subtle\ncompetition between the diffusive behavior inside one phase and the jumps\nacross the energy barriers. In particular the usual scenario in which the\ntunneling time coincides with the exponential of the energy barrier breaks\ndown. Our main results are: (i) a proof that the mixing time of the system lies\nbetween L^{5/2} and L^{5/2+2}; (ii) the identification of two regions\nassociated with the positive and negative phase of the polymer together with\nthe proof of the asymptotic exponentiality of the tunneling time between them\nwith rate equal to a half of the spectral gap. \n\n"}

Motivated by coarse-graining and the\nKochen-Specker theorem, the contravariant approach uses the topos of presheaves\non a specific context category, defined as the poset of commutative von Neumann\nsubalgebras of some given von Neumann algebra. In particular, the approach uses\nthe spectral presheaf. The intuitionistic logic of this approach is given by\nthe (complete) Heyting algebra of closed open subob jects of the spectral\npresheaf.

We show that formerly used expressions for the particle\ndistributions in the beam as seen by the observer are in error, differences\nbeing strongly dependent on the viewing angle.

Seven of\nthe clusters feature main sequence turnoff (MSTO) regions that are wider than\ncan be accounted for by a simple stellar population, whereas their red giant\nbranches indicate a single value of [Fe/H].

In the inner region of the ADAF, the flow is\nsignificantly pressured in the vertical direction by the magnetic field, and\ntherefore its gas pressure can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in\nthe ADAF without magnetic fields. This means that the magnetic field strength\nnear the black hole is underestimated by assuming equipartition between\nmagnetic and gas pressure with the conventional ADAF model. Our results show\nthat the magnetic field strength of the flow near the black hole horizon can be\nmore than one order of magnitude higher than that in the ADAF at 6GM/c^2, which\nimplies the Blandford-Znajek mechanism could be more important than the\nBlandford-Payne mechanism for ADAFs.

We find that flare\ncandidates appear in different types of SGRB host galaxy environments and show\nno clear correlation with the X-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates are\ndetected both in SGRBs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-rays\nand in SGRBs which do not show such component. We furthermore show that SGRB\nX-ray flare candidates only partially share the set of observational properties\nof long GRB (LGRB) flares. In particular,the main parameter driving the\nduration evolution of X-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to be\nthe elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on the\ndifferent progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, prompt\nvariability time-scales and energy budgets. On the contrary, SGRB flare\ncandidates significantly differ from LGRB flares in terms of peak luminosity,\nisotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variability\nflux. However, these differences disappear when the central engine time-scales\nand energy budget are accounted for, suggesting that (i) flare candidates and\nprompt pulses in SGRBs likely have a common origin; (ii) similar dissipation\nand/or emission mechanisms are responsible for the prompt and flare emission in\nlong and short GRBs, with SGRBs being less energetic albeit faster evolving\nversions of the long class.

Here we further explore this\nscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (CR)\ndiffusion on the morphology and CR distribution of the bubbles. We show that\neven a relatively low level of viscosity (\\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or\n~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,\nresulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces\ncirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the\nCR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus\nviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important\ningredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness\ndistribution.

These halos are naturally modelled as ensembles of clouds\ndriven up by supernova bubbles. These models can fit the data successfully only\nif clouds exchange mass and momentum with the corona. As a cloud orbits, it is\nablated and forms a turbulent wake where cold high-metallicity gas mixes with\nhot coronal gas causing the prompt cooling of the latter. As a consequence the\ntotal mass of HI increases. This model has recently been used to model the\nLeiden-Argentina-Bonn survey of Galactic HI.

The ankle structure is clearly\nfound at $10^{18.7}$ eV. The second bending point is also identified, at which\nthe flux of cosmic rays begins to decrease and the spectral index changes from\n$E^{-2.68}$ to $E^{-4.2}$. The study of shower development using the\nfluorescence detector data shows that proton is dominant in cosmic rays above\n$10^{18.2}$ eV.

For a jet with an ultrarelativistic equation of state\nand external pressure that decreases as a power of spherical radius, p \\propto\nr^(-eta), the jet interior will lose causal contact when eta > 2. However, the\nouter layers of the jet gradually collimate toward the jet axis as long as eta\n< 4, leading to the formation of a shocked boundary layer. Assuming that\npressure-matching across the shock front determines the shape of the shock, we\nstudy the resulting structure of the jet in two ways: first by assuming that\nthe pressure remains constant across the shocked boundary layer and looking for\nsolutions to the shock jump equations, and then by constructing self-similar\nboundary-layer solutions that allow for a pressure gradient across the shocked\nlayer. We demonstrate that the constant-pressure solutions can be characterized\nby four initial parameters that determine the jet shape and whether the shock\ncloses to the axis. We show that self-similar solutions for the boundary layer\ncan be constructed that exhibit a monotonic decrease in pressure across the\nboundary layer from the contact discontinuity to the shock front, and that the\naddition of this pressure gradient in our initial model generally causes the\nshock front to move outwards, creating a thinner boundary layer and decreasing\nthe tendency of the shock to close.

Such a trend requires neutron fluences larger than\nthose so far assumed, as these last would have too few neutrons per iron seed.\nWe suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in\nAGB stars of low mass (M < 1.5M\\odot), if they release neutrons from the\n^{13}C({\\alpha},n)^{16}O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of 4 than\nassumed in more massive AGBs (M > 1.5M\\odot).

The\nV-H colors show marginal evidence for bimodality, consistent with bimodality in\nV-I and unimodality in I-H. If bimodality is imposed for I-H with a double\nGaussian model, the preferred blue/red split differs from that for optical\ncolors; these \"differing bimodalities\" mean that the optical and optical-IR\ncolors cannot both be linearly proportional to metallicity.

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains. \n\n"}

In each simulation all the compact\nsatellite galaxies have merged into the central galaxy by redshift 0 (with the\nexception of one simulation where one of such satellite galaxy survives).\nSatellites of similar mass at z = 0 are all less compact than their high\nredshift counterparts.

It has been proposed that the relativistic electrons responsible\nfor the emission have been reaccelerated by turbulence generated by the\nsloshing of the cool core gas. We present a high-resolution MHD simulation of\ngas sloshing in a galaxy cluster coupled with subgrid simulations of\nrelativistic electron acceleration to test this hypothesis. Our simulation\nshows that the sloshing motions generate turbulence on the order of $\\delta{v}\n\\sim$ 50-200 km s$^{-1}$ on spatial scales of $\\sim$50-100 kpc and below in the\ncool core region within the envelope of the sloshing cold fronts, whereas\noutside the cold fronts, there is negligible turbulence. This turbulence is\npotentially strong enough to reaccelerate relativistic electron seeds (with\ninitial $\\gamma \\sim 100-500$) to $\\gamma \\sim 10^4$ via damping of\nmagnetosonic waves and non-resonant compression. The seed electrons could\nremain in the cluster from, e.g., past AGN activity. In combination with the\nmagnetic field amplification in the core, these electrons then produce diffuse\nradio synchrotron emission that is coincident with the region bounded by the\nsloshing cold fronts, as indeed observed in X-rays and the radio. The result\nholds for different initial spatial distributions of preexisting relativistic\nelectrons. The power and the steep spectral index ($\\alpha \\approx 1-2$) of the\nresulting radio emission are consistent with observations of minihalos, though\nthe theoretical uncertainties of the acceleration mechanisms are high. We also\nproduce simulated maps of inverse-Compton hard X-ray emission from the same\npopulation of relativistic electrons. \n\n"}

It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and\nintense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus\nmaking the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the\nenergy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor\n~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of\nthe swept-up material.

We assume an analytic reionization model and an\nionization fraction with $f_{\\rm NL}$ induced scale dependent bias.

In\norder to evaluate the detectability, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for only a\nsingle redshift slice is also calculated for current and future observations,\nsuch as CMB observations by Planck satellite and 21 cm observations by\nOmniscope. The existence of the $f_{\\rm NL}$ increases the signal of the\ncross-correlation at large scales and the amplification does not depend on the\nreionization parameters in our reionization model. However the cosmic variance\nis significant on such scales and the S/N ratio is suppressed. The obtained S/N\nratio is 2.8 (2.4) for $f_{\\rm NL}=10$ (100) in our fiducial reionization\nmodel.

While there are empirical\nsuggestions of particular increasing length scales that accompany such\ntransitions, this identification is not universal. To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the\nabsence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible\nlattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point \"quantum dynamical\nheterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially\nnon-uniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not\nexhibit a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale\nof the dynamical heterogeneities can increase dramatically. We study \"quantum\njamming\" and illustrate how a hard core bosonic system may undergo a zero\ntemperature quantum critical metal-to-insulator-type transition with an\nextremely large effective dynamical exponent z>4 consistent with length scales\nthat increase far more slowly than the relaxation time as a putative critical\ntransition is approached.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling.

In this paper, we study the hot\nX-ray coronae beyond the optical disks of two normal massive spirals, NGC1961\nand NGC6753. Based on XMM-Newton X-ray observations, hot gaseous emission is\ndetected to ~60 kpc - well beyond their optical radii. The hot gas has a\nbest-fit temperature of kT~0.6 keV and an abundance of ~0.1 Solar, and exhibits\na fairly uniform distribution, suggesting that the quasi-static gas resides in\nhydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well of the galaxies.

Low-efficiency star formation in early-type\n  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations Abstract: We study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type and\nspiral galaxies. Despite using a universal local law to form stars in the\nsimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spirals\non the large-scale Kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times less\nefficiently. This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological\nquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in\nearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As\na result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as\nhigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. Even if some molecular gas is\npresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantly\nreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. We also\nanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their CO\nand HI surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by their\nnon-stellar 8um emission. As predicted by the simulations, we find that the\nearly-type galaxies are offset from the Kennicutt relation compared to the\nspirals, with a twice lower efficiency.

In the nonlinear regime of structure formation, this challenge can\nonly be overcome by developing a large-scale, multi-physics simulation\ncapability covering a range of cosmological models and astrophysical processes.\nAs a first step to achieving this goal, we have recently developed a prediction\nscheme for the matter power spectrum (a so-called emulator), accurate at the 1%\nlevel out to k~1/Mpc and z=1 for wCDM cosmologies based on a set of\nhigh-accuracy N-body simulations.

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps.

For these planetary nebulae the ionizing component is the hot and\nluminous remnant of a giant which had its envelope ejected by a companion in\nthe process of spiralling-in to its current short-period orbit. A large\nfraction of CE phases which end with ejection of the envelope are thought to be\ninitiated by low-mass red giants, giants with inert, degenerate helium cores.\nWe discuss the possible end-of-CE structures of such stars and their subsequent\nevolution to investigate for which structures planetary nebulae are formed. We\nassume that a planetary nebula forms if the remnant reaches an effective\ntemperature greater than 30 kK within 10^4 yr of ejecting its envelope.

The X-shape is caused by the 2:1 vertical\nLindblad resonance with the bar, with two vertical oscillation periods per\norbital period in the bar frame. We examine N-body simulations and find that\ndue to the bar slowing down and disk thickening during bar buckling, the\nresonance and associated peanut-shape moves outward. The peanut-shape is\nconsistent with the location of the vertical resonance, independent of whether\nthe bar buckled or not. We estimate the resonance width from the potential m=4\nFourier component and find that the resonance is narrow, affecting orbits over\na narrow range in the angular momentum distribution, dL/L ~ 0.05. As the\nresonance moves outward, stars originally in the mid plane are forced out of\nthe mid plane into orbits just within the resonance separatrix. The height of\nthe separatrix orbits, estimated from the Hamiltonian model, is approximately\nconsistent with the peanut-shape height. The X-shape is comprised of stars in\nthe vicinity of the resonance separatrix. The velocity distributions from the\nsimulations illustrate that low inclination orbits are depleted within\nresonance. Within resonance, the vertical velocity distribution is broad,\nconsistent with resonant heating caused by the passage of the resonance through\nthe disk. In the Milky Way bulge we relate the azimuthally averaged mid-plane\nmass density near the vertical resonance to the rotation curve and bar pattern\nspeed.

After a general overview we\ndiscuss the importance of a fast orbital decay regime dominated by global disk\ntorques rather than by the local dynamical friction wake. This regime can\ndominate at BH binary separations of a few tens of parsecs and below, following\na phase of orbital circularization dominated by local dynamical friction. It is\nsimilar to Type-I migration in planetary evolution. It can bring the black\nholes to separations small enough for gravitational waves to take over on a\ntimescale ranging from less than $\\sim 10^7$ yr to up to $10^8$ yr, depending\non whether the interstellar medium is smooth or clumpy. Eventual gap opening at\nsub-pc scale separations slows down but does not interrupt the orbital\ndecay.Subsequently, we discuss a new intriguing connection between the\nconditions required for rapid orbital decay of massive BH binaries and those\nrequired for prominent gas inflows in gas-rich galaxies.

The light curve is\nde-correlated (white noise) on very long (month to year) times.

The models allow a\nquantitative estimate of this physical characteristic time-scale of 8-4+3 hours\nat 230 GHz at 95% confidence, with consistent results at 345 and 690 GHz.

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions. This may be due\nto the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism. \n\n"}

Diffuse shock-acceleration fails to explain\nthe flares because particle acceleration and emission occur during a single or\neven sub-Larmor timescale. In this regime, the synchrotron energy losses induce\na drag force on the particle motion that balances the electric acceleration and\nprevents the emission of synchrotron radiation above 160 MeV. Previous\nanalytical studies and 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations indicate that\nrelativistic reconnection is a viable mechanism to circumvent the above\ndifficulties. The reconnection electric field localized at X-points linearly\naccelerates particles with little radiative energy losses.

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise. It has been\nproposed, however, that secondary positrons could be produced and then\naccelerated in nearby supernova remnants, potentially explaining the observed\nrise, without the need of primary positron sources. Yet, if secondary positrons\nare accelerated in such shocks, other secondary cosmic ray species (such as\nboron nuclei, and antiprotons) will also be accelerated, leading to rises in\nthe boron-to-carbon and antiproton-to-proton ratios. The measurements of the\nboron-to-carbon ratio by the PAMELA and AMS collaborations, however, show no\nsign of such a rise. With this new data in hand, we revisit the secondary\nacceleration scenario for the rising positron fraction. Assuming that the same\nsupernova remnants accelerate both light nuclei (protons, helium) and heavier\ncosmic ray species, we find that no more than ~25% of the observed rise in the\npositron fraction can result from this mechanism (at the 95% confidence level) \n\n"}

It has\npreviously been classified as a low-peaked BL Lac object based on its broadband\nemission and the absence of optical emission lines. Optical measurements,\nhowever, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronounced\nshort-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for a\nblazar. We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to\nreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For\nthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its\nspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations\nfrom the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength\ndata in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far. Sparse (u, v)-coverage at 22.3GHz prevents an\nunambiguous modeling of the source morphology. IR measurements reveal an excess\nin the spectral energy distribution (SED), which can be modeled with a\nblackbody with a temperature of about 1600K, and which is usually not present\nin blazar SEDs. The VLBI data and the shape of the SED challenge the current\nblazar classification. PMNJ1603-4904 seems to be either a highly peculiar BL\nLac object or a misaligned jet source. In the latter case, the intriguing VLBI\nstructure opens room for a possible classification as a gamma-ray bright CSO. \n\n"}

Considering all three areas, a survey must have sufficient spatial\nresolution to study the tailed galaxies which trace the cluster weather as well\nas the radio lobes driving energy into the cluster from the central AGN.

Generally, pulsation on the Sgr dSph giant branches\nappears to be excited by the internal kappa mechanism. Pulsation amplitudes\nappear identical between red and asymptotic (RGB/AGB) giant stars, and between\nunreddened carbon and oxygen-rich stars at the same luminosity. The lack of\ncorrelation between infrared excess and variability among oxygen-rich stars\nindicates pulsations do not contribute significantly to wind driving in\noxygen-rich stars in the Sgr dSph, though the low amplitudes of these stars\nmean this may not apply elsewhere. The dust-enshrouded carbon stars have the\nhighest amplitudes of the stars we observe.

During quiescence, magnetic\nfield loops are generated by the magnetorotational instability at the interface\nbetween the inner hot flow and outer thin disk.

The dynamical effects of such ultramassive\ncentral black holes is unclear. Here, we perform direct N-body simulations of\nmergers of galactic nuclei where one black hole is ultramassive to study the\nevolution of the remnant and the black hole dynamics in this extreme regime. We\nfind that the merger remnant is axisymmetric near the center, while near the\nlarge SMBH influence radius, the galaxy is triaxial. The SMBH separation\nshrinks rapidly due to dynamical friction, and quickly forms a binary black\nhole; if we scale our model to the most massive estimate for the NGC1277 black\nhole, for example, the timescale for the SMBH separation to shrink from nearly\na kiloparsec to less than a parsec is roughly 10 Myr. By the time the SMBHs\nform a hard binary, gravitational wave emission dominates, and the black holes\ncoalesce in a mere few Myr. Curiously, these extremely massive binaries appear\nto nearly bypass the 3-body scattering evolutionary phase. Our study suggests\nthat in this extreme case, SMBH coalescence is governed by dynamical friction\nfollowed nearly directly by gravitational wave emission, resulting in an rapid\nand efficient SMBH coalescence timescale.

We highlight that in the interesting scenario\nwhere this particle has a weak scale mass, this out-of-equilibrium condition\nrequires a proper decay length larger than O(1) mm. Such new fields are within\nreach of the LHC, at which they can be pair produced leaving a distinctive,\ndisplaced-vertex signature. This scenario is realized in the recently proposed\nmechanism of baryogenesis where the baryon asymmetry is produced through the\nfreeze-out and subsequent decay of a meta-stable weakly interacting massive\nparticle (\"WIMP baryogenesis\"). In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP\ndark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles\nresponsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.\nIn our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP\nbaryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS\nwith 8 TeV LHC data.

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples.

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic\nray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the\ncomplexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it\ndifficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the\npossibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark\nmatter.

We study\nthe case in which tidal heating drives mass loss from a low mass satellite.

Low orbital eccentricity streams are smoother and have\nless differential motion than high eccentricity streams. The tail of a high\neccentricity stream can develop a fan of particles which wraps around at\napocenter in a shell feature. We show that scaling the essentially stationary\naction-angle variables with the cube root of the satellite mass allows a low\nmass satellite stream to accurately predict the features in the stream from a\nsatellite a thousand times more massive. As a practical astrophysical\napplication, we demonstrate that narrow gaps in a moderate eccentricity stream,\nsuch as GD-1, blur out to 50\\% contrast over approximately 6 radial periods.

Red timing noise - the stochastic wandering of\npulse arrival times with a red spectrum - is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars\nand has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by\ncalculating minimum observation times, $T_{\\rm min}(f_c)$, over which the\ngravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau.

Such a\nconvolution also yields a natural solution to the Fokker-Planck equations in\nthe energy space. Our mathematical formalism can be generalized to potentials\nwith a time-varying symmetry, where diffusion extends over multiple dimensions\nof the integral-of-motion space.

Abstract: The origin of cosmic rays is one of the long-standing mysteries in physics\nand astrophysics. Simple arguments suggest that a scenario of supernova\nremnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way as the dominant sources for the cosmic ray\npopulation below the knee could work: in a generic calculation, it can be shown\nthat these objects can provide the energy budget necessary to explain the\nobserved flux of cosmic rays. However, this argument is based on the assumption\nthat all sources behave in the same way, i.e.\\ they all have the same energy\nbudget, spectral behavior and maximum energy. In this paper, we investigate if\na realistic population of SNRs is capable of producing the cosmic ray flux as\nit is observed below the knee. We use 21 SNRs that are well-studied from radio\nwavelengths up to gamma-ray energies. It could be shown previously (Mandelartz\n& Becker Tjus 2015) that the high-energy bump in the energy spectrum of these\n21 sources can be dominated by hadronic emission. Here, gamma-rays are produced\nvia $\\pi^{0}-$decays from cosmic ray interactions in molecular clouds near the\nsupernova remnant, which serves as the cosmic ray accelerator. The cosmic ray\nspectra show a large variety in their energy budget, spectral behavior and\nmaximum energy. These sources are assumed to be representative for the total\nclass of SNRs, where we assume that about 100 - 200 cosmic ray emitting SNRs\nshould be present today. Finally, we use these source spectra to simulate the\ncosmic ray transport from individual SNRs in the Galaxy with the GALPROP code\nfor cosmic ray propagation. We find that the cosmic ray budget can be matched\nwell for a diffusion coefficient that is close to $D\\propto E^{0.3}$. A\nstronger dependence on the energy, e.g. $E^{0.5}$, would lead to a spectrum at\nEarth that is too steep when compared to what is detected and the energy budget\ncannot be matched, in particular toward high energies. \n\n"}

In this paper, through a comparison of five fitting functions\n(Gaussian, von Mises, hyperbolic secant, square hyperbolic secant, and\nLorentz), it is found that the square hyperbolic secant function can best\nreproduce the profile, yielding an improved fit. Moreover, a symmetric 2D\nradiation beam function, instead of a simple 1D Gaussian function, is used to\nfit the profile. Each profile with either well-resolved or not-so-well-resolved\npeaks could be fitted adequately using this beam function, and the bridge\nemission between the two peaks does not need to be a new component.

We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses.

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally.

We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective\nfield theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as\nsmall perturbations from general relativity. We perturb about the\nmaximally-rotating Kerr solution, the so-called extremal limit, and develop\nmathematical insight into the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions\nfor generic spin.

For\nMbh<10^7Msun, the typical TDE is due to a M*~0.3Msun M-dwarf, although the mass\nfunction is relatively flat for $M*<Msun. The contribution from older main\nsequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From\nMbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a\nlarger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved\nstars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which\nis largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in\nany observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun\nBHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates. The typical fall back time is\nrelatively long, with 16% having Tfb<10^(-1) years (37 days), and 84% having\nlonger time scales. Many residual rate discrepancies can be explained if\nsurveys are biased against TDEs with these longer Tfb, which seems very\nplausible if Tfb has any relation to the transient rise time. For almost any BH\nmass function, systematic searches for fainter, faster time scale TDEs in\nsmaller galaxies, and longer time scale TDEs in more massive galaxies are\nlikely to be rewarded. \n\n"}

We find that disk winds are the dominant feedback mechanism setting star\nformation efficiencies (SFEs) from initial cores of ~0.3-0.5. However,\nradiation pressure is also significant to widen the outflow cavity causing\nreductions of SFE compared to the disk-wind only case, especially for >100Msun\nstar formation at clump mass surface densities Sigma<0.3g/cm2. Photoevaporation\nis of relatively minor importance due to dust attenuation of ionizing photons.\nStellar winds have even smaller effects during the accretion stage.

We show that this segregated hybrid\nstructure becomes unstable to rapid mixing within 2,000 years of the onset of\nWD cooling. Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons,\nresulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{\\rm e}$) in the regions\nprocessed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne\nmantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools. This is unstable to efficient\nmixing. We use the results of $\\texttt{MESA}$ models with different size C/O\ncores to quantify the rate at which the cores mix with the mantle as they cool.\nIn all cases, we find that the WDs undergo significant core/mantle mixing on\ntimescales shorter than the time available to grow the WD to the Chandrasekhar\nmass ($M_{\\rm Ch}$) by accretion. As a result, hybrid WDs that reach $M_{\\rm\nCh}$ due to later accretion will have lower central carbon fractions than\nassumed thus far.

This model\nconsists of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce\nthe reverberation lags. These lags are due to the time delays between the\ndirectly observed and reflection photons and are associated with the\nlight-travel time between the source and the disc, so they allow us to probe\nthe disc-corona geometry. We assume the variations of two X-ray sources are\ntriggered by the same primary variations, but allow the two sources to respond\nin different ways (i.e. having different source responses). The variations of\neach source induce a delayed accretion disc response and the total lags consist\nof a combination of both source and disc responses. We show that the extended\ncorona model can reproduce both the low-frequency hard and high-frequency soft\n(reverberation) lags.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints.

As a better measure\nof quantum chaos in such systems, we propose, and study, the density of the\nOTOC of extensive sums of local observables, which can exhibit indefinite\ngrowth in the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate this for the kicked quantum\nIsing model by using large-scale numerical results and an analytic solution in\nthe integrable regime. In a generic case, we observe the growth of the OTOC\ndensity to be linear in time.

Therefore, we considered\nalso a short Suzaku observation, which caught NGC7582 in a Compton thick state.\nThis allows us to determine the underlying continuum and the amount of\nabsorption ($N_H \\sim~1.2\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). A wealth of emission lines\nare detected in the Chandra data, which allow us to map the structure of the\ncircum-nuclear emitters. The high resolution spectrum reveals that the soft\nX-ray emission originates in a hybrid gas, which is ionized in part by the\nstarforming activity and in part by the central AGN. The high resolution images\nconfirm that the emitting region is inhomogeneous and extends up to a few\nhundred pc from the nuclear source. The X-ray images are more extended in the\nlower energy lines (Ne and Mg) than in the higher energy lines (Si, Fe), where\nthe former are dominated by the collisionally ionised gas and the latter by the\nphotoionized AGN emission.

Firstly, we consider BH\npopulations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from\nmodels with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass\nfunctions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low\nmetallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed. In this work, we\nconsider only binaries that are formed by three-body processes and ignore\nstellar evolution and primordial binaries for simplicity.

The average BHAR is\ncorrelated positively with both SFR and $M_*$, and the BHAR-SFR and BHAR-$M_*$\nrelations can both be described acceptably by linear models with a slope of\nunity. However, BHAR appears to be correlated more strongly with $M_*$ than\nSFR. This result indicates that $M_*$ is the primary host-galaxy property\nrelated to black-hole growth, and the apparent BHAR-SFR relation is largely a\nsecondary effect due to the star-forming main sequence.

In this paper, we implement a new jet feedback scheme into the\nmoving mesh-code arepo, contrast different jet injection techniques and\ndemonstrate the validity of our implementation by comparing against simple\nanalytical models.

To assess the\nrobustness of edge state transport, we analyze the DC conductance,\ntime-averaged current profile and local density of states. It is found that\nco-propagating chiral edge modes are more robust against disorder and defects\nas compared with the remarkable counter-propagating edge modes, as well as\ncertain symmetry-restricted Floquet edge modes.

It is\npossible that, at fixed stellar mass and galaxy colour, the halo mass is\ncorrelated with galaxy size.

An important difference between these two cases\nis the nucleosynthetic yield, which is altered by the increased neutron excess\nin Chandrasekhar progenitors due to their pre-explosion simmering and high\ncentral density.\n  From comparison with theoretical nucleosynthesis yields, we show that the\nchemical composition of the most metal-rich star in the Ursa Minor dwarf\ngalaxy, COS 171, is dominated by nucleosynthesis from a low-metallicity,\nlow-mass, sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Key diagnostic abundance ratios include\nC/Fe, {\\alpha}/Fe, Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios, which could not have been produced\nby Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia, Core-Collapse Type II supernovae or\nPair-Instsability supernovae. Strong deficiencies of Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe\nalso suggest the absence of alpha-rich freeze-out nucleosynthesis, favoring\nlow-mass WD progenitor SNe Ia. Based on comparisons of the measured Mn/Fe and\nSi/Fe ratios with detonation models, we estimate a WD mass near 0.95Msun. We\nalso compare Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios to the recent theoretical yields predicted\nby Shen et al., finding consistent results. To explain the COS 171 [Fe/H], at\n-1.35 dex, requires dilution of the ejecta from a single SNIa event with ~10^4\nMsun of material; this is expected for a SN Ia remnant expanding into a warm\ninterstellar medium with n~1 /cm^3.

While true, it is shown in this paper that a LIGO interferometric\ndetector also undergoes frequent and {\\it discrete} quantum interactions with\nan incident gravitational wave, in such a way as to allow the exchange of\nenergy and momentum between the wave and the detector. This opens the door to\nanother way of finding gravitons. The most basic form of an interaction is the\nfirst order Fermi acceleration (deceleration) of a laser photon as it is\nreflected by a test mass mirror oscillating in the gravitational wave,\nresulting in a frequency blueshift (redshift) of the photon depending on\nwhether the mirror is advancing towards (receding from) the photon before the\nreflection. If e.g. a blueshift occurred, wave energy is absorbed and the\noscillation will be damped. It is suggested that such energy exchanging\ninteractions are responsible for the observed radiation reaction noise of LIGO\n(although the more common way of calculating the same amplitude for this noise\nis based on momentum considerations). Most importantly, in each interaction the\ndetector absorbs or emits wave energy in amounts far smaller than the standard\ngraviton energy $\\hbar\\omega$ where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the\ngravitational wave.

Few observed HVSs show\napparent ages which are shorter than the flight time from the GC, thereby\nmaking the binary disruption scenario unlikely.

A triple disruption may also\nbe responsible for the presence of HVBs, of which one candidate has now been\nobserved.

The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex\nscaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other\nparameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important\nfact is that early-type galaxies can show both decreasing and increasing radial\ntemperature profiles. We have calculated the diffusion based on the observed\ngas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that\nbelonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray\nluminosities.

Deploying workloads to\nnew platforms -- such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators\n(e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) -- requires significant manual effort. We propose TVM, a\ncompiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide\nperformance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware\nback-ends.

Since ALPs only mix with the parallel mode of the photon, the\npolarization of the soft and hard X-ray spectra is predicted to have an O-mode\ncomponent, in addition to the mainly X-mode component given by most\nastrophysical models. The relative strength of the O-mode component depends on\nthe intensity of ALPs produced in the core and the probability of conversion.\nWe quantify our results by considering X-ray emission produced both by\nastrophysical processes and by ALP-photon conversion, in an uncorrelated\nfashion, and in different relative proportions, which we parametrize by the\nangle $\\chi_0$.

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus.

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.

The classification includes all possible magnetic\ntopological crystalline insulators protected by point group symmetry. Whereas\nthe classification of topological insulators is known to be given by the\n$K$-theory in the momentum space, computation of the $K$-theory has been a\ndifficult task in the presence of complicated crystallographic symmetry.

Proxies exist to evaluate the\nefficiency of mass and angular momentum accretion but they depend so\ndramatically on the wind speed that given the current uncertainties, they only\nset loose constrains. Furthermore, they often bypass the impact of orbital and\nshock effects on the flow structure. We study the wind dynamics and the angular\nmomentum gained as the flow is accreted. We identify the conditions for the\nformation of a disc-like structure around the accretor and the observational\nconsequences for SgXB. We use recent results on the wind launching mechanism to\ncompute 3D streamlines, accounting for the gravitational and X-ray ionizing\ninfluence of the compact companion on the wind. Once the flow enters the Roche\nlobe of the accretor, we solve the hydrodynamics equations with cooling. A\nshocked region forms around the accretor as the flow is beamed. For wind speeds\nof the order of the orbital speed, the shock is highly asymmetric compared to\nthe axisymmetric bow shock obtained for a purely planar homogeneous flow. With\nnet radiative cooling, the flow always circularizes for wind speeds low enough.\nAlthough the donor star does not fill its Roche lobe, the wind can be\nsignificantly beamed and bent by the orbital effects. The net angular momentum\nof the accreted flow is then sufficient to form a persistent disc-like\nstructure. This mechanism could explain the proposed limited outer extension of\nthe accretion disc in Cygnus X-1 and suggests the presence of a disc at the\nouter rim of the neutron star magnetosphere in Vela X-1, with dramatic\nconsequences on the spinning up of the accretor. \n\n"}

These degrees of freedom can be controlled or accessed\nindependently via either the spin polarization or the charge densities. To\nunderstand statistical properties and the phase diagram in the course of\ncooling under the controlled parameters, we present here an analytical\ntreatment supported by Monte Carlo simulations for a generic coarse-grained\ntwo-fields model of XY-Ising type. The degeneracies give rise to two coexisting\ntypes of topologically nontrivial configurations: phase vortices and amplitude\nkinks -- the solitons.

Using 1 kpc-scale spaxels, we compute the relationships between\nthe star formation rate and stellar mass surface densities, i.e. the spatially\nresolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS), and between the gas metallicity\nand the stellar mass surface density, i.e. the spatially resolved\nmass-metallicity relation (rMZR). We compare to observed relations derived from\nintegral field unit surveys and imaging of galaxies. EAGLE reproduces the slope\nof the local ($z\\approx0.1$) rSFMS well, but with a $\\approx-0.15$ dex offset,\nclose to that found for the galaxy-integrated relation. The shape of the rMZR\nagrees reasonably well with observations, replicating the characteristic\nturnover at high surface density, which we show is due to AGN feedback. The\nresiduals of the rSFMS and rMZR are negatively (positively) correlated at low\n(high) surface density. The rSFMS becomes shallower as the simulation evolves\nfrom $z=2$ to 0.1, a manifestation of inside-out galaxy formation.

For $N_f=2$ (i.e.\nspin degeneracy only) it is known that chiral $d+id$ superconductivity is the\nunambiguously leading weak coupling instability.

For most\nof the collapse time, when the evolution proceeds self-similarly, the\nluminosity slowly rises up to about 10^36 erg/s and is essentially due to H2 IR\nline emission. Later, continuum IR radiation provides an additional\ncontribution, which is mostly due to the accretion of an infalling envelope\nupon a small hydrostatic protostellar core which develops in the centre. We\nfollow the beginning of the accretion phase, when the enormous accretion rate\n(~ 0.1 Msun/yr) produces a very high continuum luminosity of about 10^36 erg/s.\nDespite the high luminosities, the radiation field is unable to affect the gas\ndynamics during the collapse and the first phases of accretion, because the\nopacity of the infalling gas is too small; this is quite different from\npresent-day star formation. We also find that the protostellar evolution is\nsimilar among clouds with different initial configurations, including those\nresulting from 3D cosmological simulations of primordial objects; in\nparticular, the shape of the molecular spectra is quite universal.

The removal of the centrifugal support\nprovided by differential rotation can lead to delayed collapse of the remnant\nto a black hole, accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation. Both\nmagnetic fields and viscosity alter the structure of differentially rotating\nstars on secular timescales, making numerical tracking of the evolution\ndifficult.

The efficiency\nof type II SNe in injecting energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) and in\nre-heating a fraction of the original star-forming cloud is estimated with the\naid of a two-phase model for the ISM of the cloud. We argue that when SNe\nexplode the star-forming cloud has already been partially destroyed by ionizing\nlight and winds from massive stars. SN remnants (SNRs) will first cause the\ncollapse of most of the cloud gas into cold fragments, until the diffuse hot\nphase has a low enough density to make further radiative losses negligible.\nThis is completed in ~3 Myr, with a modest energy loss of ~5 per cent of the\ntotal budget.

Abstract: We study regenerated high-energy emission from the gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nafterglows, and compare its flux with the direct component from the same\nafterglow. When the intrinsic emission spectrum extends to TeV region, these\nvery high-energy photons are significantly absorbed by the cosmic infrared\nbackground (CIB) radiation field, creating electron/positron pairs; since these\npairs are highly energetic, they can scatter the cosmic microwave background\nradiation up to GeV energies, which may change the intrinsic afterglow light\ncurve in the GeV region. Using the theoretical modeling given in literature and\nthe reasonable choice of relevant parameters, we calculate the expected light\ncurve due to the regeneration mechanism. As the result, we find that the\nregenerated emission could only slightly change the original light curve, even\nif we take a rather large value for the CIB density, independently of the\ndensity profile of surrounding medium, i.e., constant or wind-like profile.\nThis ensures us the reliable estimation of the intrinsic GRB parameters when\nthe high-energy observation is accessible, regardless of a large amount of\nuncertainty concerning the CIB density as well as extragalactic magnetic field\nstrength. \n\n"}

The lack of small-scale\nstructure in the broad emission-line profiles is consistent with a smooth gas\nflow, or a clumped flow with many small clouds. An attractive possibility for\nthe origin of many small clouds is the atmospheres of bloated stars, an origin\nwhich also provides a natural mechanism for the cloud confinement. Earlier\nstudies of the broad-line profiles have already put strong lower limits on the\nminimum number of such stars, but these limits are sensitive to the assumed\nwidth of the lines produced by each cloud. Here we revisit this problem using\nhigh-resolution Keck spectra of the H alpha line in NGC 4395, which has the\nsmallest known broad-line region (~10^14 cm). Only a handful of the required\nbloated stars (each having r~10^14 cm) could fit into the broad-line region of\nNGC 4395, yet the observed smoothness of the H alpha line implies a lower limit\nof ~10^4-10^5 on the number of discrete clouds. This rules out conclusively the\nbloated-stars scenario, regardless of any plausible line-broadening mechanisms.\nThe upper limit on the size of the clouds is ~10^12 cm, which is comparable to\nthe size implied by photoionization models. This strongly suggests that gas in\nthe broad-line region is structured as a smooth rather than a clumped flow,\nmost likely in a rotationally dominated thick disk-like configuration. However,\nit remains to be clarified why such a smooth, gravity-dominated flow generates\ndouble-peaked emission lines only in a small fraction of active galactic\nnuclei. \n\n"}

The density profiles of the simulated clusters\nclosely follow the NFW form, but we find that the recovered values of the inner\nslope are systematically underestimated, by about 0.4 in the mean, if the lens\nis assumed to be axially symmetric. However, if the ellipticity and orientation\nof the iso-contours of the cluster lensing potential are taken into account,\nthen the inner slopes can be recovered quite accurately for a significant\nsubset of the clusters whose central surface density profiles appear the most\nregular. These have lensing potentials with ellipticities in the range\n0.15-0.4. Further simulations projecting one cluster along many random\nlines-of-sight show that, even for lower ellipticities, the central slopes are\nunderestimated by $\\sim 10-35%$. These simulations closely mimic past\nobservations (see e.g. Sand et al., 2004), suggesting that existing estimates\nof the central slopes may be biased towards low values. For the remaining\nclusters, where the lensing potential is strongly perturbed by active merging\nor by substructure, the correct determination of the inner slope requires a\nmore accurate model for the lens. When the halo profile is modelled by a\ngeneralised NFW profile, we find that the inferred scale radius and\ncharacteristic density, unlike the inner slope, are generally poorly\nconstrained, since there is a strong degeneracy between these two parameters. \n\n"}

Spin is transferred from the spin-polarized device\ncurrent to the magnetization of the free layer by the mechanism of incoherent\nmagnon emission by electrons. Our approach is based on the rate equation for\nthe magnon occupation, using Fermi's golden rule for magnon emission and\nabsorption and the non-equilibrium electron distribution for a biased spin\nvalve. The magnon emission reduces the magnetization of the free layer. For\nanti-parallel alignment of the magnetizations of the layers and at a critical\nbias a magnon avalanche occurs, characterized by a diverging effective magnon\ntemperature. This critical behavior can result in magnetization reversal and\nconsequently to suppression of magnon emission. However, magnon-magnon\nscattering can lead to saturation of the magnon concentration at a large but\nfinite value. The further behavior depends on the parameters of the system. In\nparticular, gradual evolution of the magnon concentration followed by a\nmagnetization reversal is possible. Another scenario corresponds to a step-like\nincrease of the magnon concentration followed by a slow decrease.

We\nconcentrate on the U(N) singlet sector of these models. In the particular case\nof quadratic matrix potential, the singlet sector can be mapped by a similarity\ntransformation onto the two-dimensional Calogero-Marchioro-Sutherland model at\nspecific couplings. For this quadratic case we were able to solve the $N-$body\nSchr\\\"odinger equation and obtain infinite sets of singlet eigenstates of the\nmatrix model with given total angular momentum. Our main object in this paper\nis to study the singlet sector in the collective field formalism, in the\nlarge-N limit.
