Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

Redshift\ninformation is insufficient to determine whether a CG is roughly as dense in 3D\nas it appears in projection, or whether it is caused by a chance alignment (CA)\nalong the line of sight within a larger galaxy system. Recent precise distance\nmeasurements help probe the nature of the nearest CG, situated in the Virgo\ncluster, whose dominant member is M60. The isolated status of the CG is\nreassessed with recent photometry and a statistical analysis is performed on\nthe surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances measured by Mei et al. in\nVirgo, for 4 of the 5 CG members. The neighboring galaxy NGC 4606 appears (with\n80-90% confidence) to be too faint to affect the isolated status of the CG.\nTaken at face value, the SBF distances suggest that M59 and NGC 4660 lie\nroughly 2 Mpc to the foreground of M60, NGC 4638, and the bulk of the Virgo\ncluster. The statistical analysis confirms that the CG is, indeed, the result\nof a CA of its galaxies, with NGC 4638 lying at least 800 kpc further away\n(with 99% confidence) than either M59 or NGC 4660. The first two galaxy\ndistances are consistent with M59 and NGC 4660 constituting a tight pair.

Gaussian\n  fluctuations with non-markovian dependence on the smoothing scale Abstract: A classic method for computing the mass function of dark matter halos is\nprovided by excursion set theory, where density perturbations evolve\nstochastically with the smoothing scale, and the problem of computing the\nprobability of halo formation is mapped into the so-called first-passage time\nproblem in the presence of a barrier. While the full dynamical complexity of\nhalo formation can only be revealed through N-body simulations, excursion set\ntheory provides a simple analytic framework for understanding various aspects\nof this complex process. In this series of paper we propose improvements of\nboth technical and conceptual aspects of excursion set theory, and we explore\nup to which point the method can reproduce quantitatively the data from N-body\nsimulations. In paper I of the series we show how to derive excursion set\ntheory from a path integral formulation. This allows us both to derive\nrigorously the absorbing barrier boundary condition, that in the usual\nformulation is just postulated, and to deal analytically with the non-markovian\nnature of the random walk. Such a non-markovian dynamics inevitably enters when\neither the density is smoothed with filters such as the top-hat filter in\ncoordinate space (which is the only filter associated to a well defined halo\nmass) or when one considers non-Gaussian fluctuations. In these cases, beside\n``markovian'' terms, we find ``memory'' terms that reflect the non-markovianity\nof the evolution with the smoothing scale. We develop a general formalism for\nevaluating perturbatively these non-markovian corrections, and in this paper we\nperform explicitly the computation of the halo mass function for gaussian\nfluctuations, to first order in the non-markovian corrections due to the use of\na tophat filter in coordinate space. \n\n"}

Non-Gaussian\n  Fluctuations Abstract: We compute the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the halo mass\nfunction, using excursion set theory. In the presence of non-Gaussianity the\nstochastic evolution of the smoothed density field, as a function of the\nsmoothing scale, is non-markovian and beside \"local\" terms that generalize\nPress-Schechter (PS) theory, there are also \"memory\" terms, whose effect on the\nmass function can be computed using the formalism developed in the first paper\nof this series. We find that, when computing the effect of the three-point\ncorrelator on the mass function, a PS-like approach which consists in\nneglecting the cloud-in-cloud problem and in multiplying the final result by a\nfudge factor close to 2, is in principle not justified. When computed correctly\nin the framework of excursion set theory, in fact, the \"local\" contribution\nvanishes (for all odd-point correlators the contribution of the image gaussian\ncancels the Press-Schechter contribution rather than adding up), and the result\ncomes entirely from non-trivial memory terms which are absent in PS theory.\nHowever it turns out that, in the limit of large halo masses, where the effect\nof non-Gaussianity is more relevant, these memory terms give a contribution\nwhich is the the same as that computed naively with PS theory, plus subleading\nterms depending on derivatives of the three-point correlator.

In order to disentangle the evolution of galaxy\nkinematics from low resolution effects, we have used Fabry-Perot 3D Ha\ndata-cubes of 153 nearby isolated galaxies from the GHASP survey to simulate\ndata-cubes of galaxies at z=1.7. We show that the inner velocity gradient is\nlowered and is responsible for a peak in the velocity dispersion map.\nToy-models of rotating disks have been built to recover the parameters from low\nresolution data. The poor resolution makes the kinematical inclination\nuncertain and the center difficult to recover. The major axis is retrieved with\nan accuracy higher than 5deg for 70% of the sample. Toy-models also enable to\nretrieve statistically the maximum velocity and the mean velocity dispersion of\ngalaxies with a satisfying accuracy. This validates the use of the Tully-Fisher\nrelation for high-z galaxies but the loss of resolution induces a lower slope\nat high-z.

The initial condition\nis set by the requirement that the scalar field is initially in an adiabatic\nstate. In our case, such a vacuum state exists only for limited solutions of\nthe anisotropic Universe, whose spacetime structure is regular in the initial\ntimes. In this paper, we call our adiabatic vacuum state the anisotropic\nvacuum.

Our results for natural (O(1))\nvalues of parameters in the Lagrangian which lead to a background expansion\nsimilar to LCDM are summarized as follows: 1. Scalar-Tensor dark energy density\nperturbations are amplified by a factor of about 10^6 compared to minimally\ncoupled quintessence perturbations on scales less than about 100 h^{-1} Mpc. On\nthese scales dark energy perturbations constitute a fraction of about 10%\ncompared to matter density perturbations. 2.

Thus clusters of galaxies are predicted to overlap with\nvoids of dark energy. 3. This anti-correlation of matter with negative pressure\nperturbations induces a mild amplification of matter perturbations by about 10%\non sub-Hubble scales. 4.

First, we observe the late time behaviors after\nthe gravitational collapse, which include formations of a singularity and an\napparent horizon. Second, we observe the fully dynamical behaviors during the\ngravitational collapse and view the energy-momentum tensor components. For the\nlate time behaviors, if the Brans-Dicke coupling is greater (or smaller) than\n-1.5, the Brans-Dicke field decreases (or increases) during the gravitational\ncollapse.

Over the past years, observational evidence\nfor both old and young stellar populations, as well as individual H II regions,\nhas demonstrated that the outer disk is an actively evolving part of a galaxy.\nTo provide constraints on the origin of the aforementioned H-alpha truncation\nand the relation of H-alpha emission in the outer disk to the underlying\nstellar population, we measure the shape of the outer H-alpha surface\nbrightness profile of 15 isolated, edge-on late-type disk galaxies using deep,\nlong-slit spectroscopy. Tracing H-alpha emission up to 50% beyond the optical\nradius, R_25, we find a composite H-alpha surface brightness profile, well\ndescribed by a broken-exponential law, that drops more steeply in the outer\ndisk, but which is not truncated.

The results indicate that both the\nvolume-average shear and the variance of the expansion rate grow proportional\nto the sharpness of the transition and diverge in the limit of a step function,\nbut, for realistic-sized voids, are virtually independent of the size of the\nvoid. However, the backreaction, given by the difference of the variance and\nthe shear, has a finite value in the step-function limit. By comparing the\nexact result for the backreaction to the case where the shear is neglected by\ntreating the voids and walls as separate Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models, we\nfind that the shear suppresses the backreaction by a factor of (r_0/t_0)^2, the\nsquared ratio of the void size to the horizon size.

Our framework requires the\nmetric to be close to a \"background metric\", but allows arbitrarily large\nstress-energy fluctuations on small scales. We prove that, within our\nframework, if the matter stress-energy tensor satisfies the weak energy\ncondition (i.e., positivity of energy density in all frames), then the only\neffect that small scale inhomogeneities can have on the dynamics of the\nbackground metric is to provide an \"effective stress-energy tensor\" that is\ntraceless and has positive energy density---corresponding to the presence of\ngravitational radiation. In particular, nonlinear effects produced by small\nscale inhomogeneities cannot mimic the effects of dark energy. We also develop\n\"perturbation theory\" off of the background metric.

The quantitative impact of the proposed elastic collisions on\nstructure formation has been estimated previously by Monte Carlo N-body\nsimulations and by a conducting fluid model, with apparently diverging results.\nTo improve this situation, we make direct comparisons between new Monte Carlo\nN-body simulations and solutions of the conducting fluid model, for isolated\nSIDM haloes of fixed mass. This allows us to separate cleanly the effects of\ngravothermal relaxation from those of continuous mass accretion in an expanding\nbackground universe.

Simulated CMB maps with\nassigned type and amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity are important tools\nto determine the strength, sensitivity and limitations of non-Gaussian\nestimators.

We show that our\nindicators can be used to detect large-angle local-type non-Gaussianity only\nfor relatively large values of the non-linear parameter $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm\nlocal}$.

If\nthe universe today exists in a false vacuum, there will be a non-zero\nprobability to tunnel to the true vacuum state of the universe.

We perform controlled\nMonte Carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys in order to quantify the\nbias of lenses relative to parent galaxies in velocity dispersion, mass axis\nratio, and mass density profile. For parameters typical of the SLACS and BELLS\nsurveys, we find: (1) no significant mass axis ratio detection bias of lenses\nrelative to parent galaxies; (2) a very small detection bias toward shallow\nmass density profiles, which is likely negligible compared to other sources of\nuncertainty in this parameter; (3) a detection bias towards smaller Einstein\nradius for systems drawn from parent populations with group- and cluster-scale\nlensing masses; and (4) a lens-modeling bias towards larger velocity\ndispersions for systems drawn from parent samples with sub-arcsecond mean\nEinstein radii.

Avoiding biases in cosmological parameters due to\nthe resulting inevitable contamination from non-Ia supernovae can be achieved\nwith the BEAMS formalism, allowing for fully photometric supernova cosmology\nstudies. Here we extend BEAMS to deal with the case in which the supernovae are\ncorrelated by systematic uncertainties. The analytical form of the full BEAMS\nposterior requires evaluating 2^N terms, where N is the number of supernova\ncandidates. This `exponential catastrophe' is computationally unfeasible even\nfor N of order 100. We circumvent the exponential catastrophe by marginalising\nnumerically instead of analytically over the possible supernova types: we\naugment the cosmological parameters with nuisance parameters describing the\ncovariance matrix and the types of all the supernovae, \\tau_i, that we include\nin our MCMC analysis. We show that this method deals well even with large,\nunknown systematic uncertainties without a major increase in computational\ntime, whereas ignoring the correlations can lead to significant biases and\nincorrect credible contours. We then compare the numerical marginalisation\ntechnique with a perturbative expansion of the posterior based on the insight\nthat future surveys will have exquisite light curves and hence the probability\nthat a given candidate is a Type Ia will be close to unity or zero, for most\nobjects. Although this perturbative approach changes computation of the\nposterior from a 2^N problem into an N^2 or N^3 one, we show that it leads to\nbiases in general through a small number of misclassifications, implying that\nnumerical marginalisation is superior. \n\n"}

First, with standard star formation and supernova\nfeedback prescriptions, we find that the mean baryonic fraction value estimated\nat the virial radius of the two main central objects (i.e. the Milky Way and\nAndromeda) is decreasing over time, and is 10-15% lower than the universal\nvalue, 0.166, at z=0. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that the amount\nof accretion of dissipative gas onto the halo, especially at low redshift, is\nin general much lower than that of the dissipationless dark matter. Indeed, a\nsignificant part of the baryons does not collapse onto the haloes and remains\nin their outskirts, mainly in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).\nMoreover, during the formation of each object, some dark matter and baryons are\nalso expelled through merger events via tidal disruption. In contrast to\nbaryons, expelled dark matter can be more efficiently re-accreted onto the\nhalo, enhancing both the reduction of fb inside Rv, and the increase of the\nmass of WHIM outside Rv. Varying the efficiency of supernovae feedback at low\nredshift does not seem to significantly affect these trends. Alternatively,\nwhen a significant fraction of the initial gas in the main objects is released\nat high redshifts by more powerful sources of feedback, such as AGN from\nintermediate mass black holes in lower mass galaxies, the baryonic fraction at\nthe virial radius can have a lower value (fb~0.12) at low redshift. Hence\nphysical mechanisms able to drive the gas out of the virial radius at high\nredshifts will have a stronger impact on the deficit of baryons in the mass\nbudget of Milky Way type-galaxies at present times than those that expel the\ngas in the longer, late phases of galaxy formation. \n\n"}

Moreover, recent simulations suggest\nthat the torus, a keystone in the Unified Model, vanishes for nuclei with L_bol\n< 10^42 erg/s. However, the study of LLAGN is a complex task due to the\ncontribution of the host galaxy, which light swamps these faint nuclei.

This\nresults in a break in the mean M-sigma relation with Msigma^2.3 and M sigma^4.7\nat small and large sigma respectively; (ii) a mass M 2e11 Msun which separates\na population dominated by flat fast rotator with disks and spiral galaxies at\nlower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses;\n(iii) below that mass the distribution of ETGs properties tends to be constant\nalong lines of constant sigma; (iv) it forms a parallel sequence with the\ndistribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution of\nfast rotator ETGs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf ETGs\n(Sph) and dwarf irregulars (Im) respectively. We show via dynamical models that\nsigma traces the bulge fraction, which drives the observed trends in M/L,\nHbeta, colour, IMF and molecular gas fraction. We interpret this as due to a\ncombination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction which\nincreases sigma and greatly enhances the likelihood for a galaxy to have its\nstar formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass along\nlines of nearly constant sigma, while leaving the population unchanged.\n[Abriged] \n\n"}

Nevertheless, they generally lead to\nnonphysical mass distributions in some regions. In this paper we revisit the\nphysical limitations of the pseudo-elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White (PNFW) model,\nfor a broad range of the potential ellipticity parameter \\epsilon\\ and\ncharacteristic convergence \\kappa_s focusing on the behavior of the mass\ndistribution close to the tangential critical curve, where tangential arcs are\nexpected to be formed. We investigate the shape of the mass distribution on\nthis region and the presence of negative convergence. We obtain a mapping from\nthe PNFW to the NFW model with elliptical mass distribution (ENFW) and provide\nfitting formulae for connecting the parameters of both models. We compare the\narc cross section for these models using the \"infinitesimal circular source\napproximation\". We find that the PNFW model is well-suited to model an\nelliptical mass distribution on a larger \\epsilon\\ - \\kappa_s parameter space\nthan previously expected. In particular values as large as \\epsilon\\ ~ 0.65 are\nallowed for small \\kappa_s. However, if we require the PNFW model to reproduce\nthe arc cross section of the ENFW well, the ellipticity is more restricted. We\nalso find that the negative convergence regions occur far from the arc\nformation region and should therefore not be a problem for studies with\ngravitational arcs. The determination of a domain of validity for the PNFW\nmodel and the mapping to ENFW models could have implications for the use of\nPNFW models for the inverse modeling of lenses and for fast arc simulations. \n\n"}

Some notable facets of this thesis are the following. We\nstart by looking into the issue of generalized Smarr mass formula for arbitrary\ndimensional black holes in Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We derive this formula for\nthese black holes and also demonstrate that such a formula can be expressed in\nthe form of a dimension independent identity $K_{\\chi^{\\mu}}=2ST$ (where the\nl.h.s is the Komar conserved charge corresponding to the null Killing vector\n$\\chi^{\\mu}$ and in the r.h.s $S, T$ are the semi-classical entropy and\ntemperature of a black hole) defined at the black hole event horizon. We\nhighlight the role of exact differentials in computations involving black hole\nthermodynamics.

However, large\nN rescaling and the AMPS argument show that black hole complementarity is\ninconsistent.

To investigate this\nproposal, we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs, broad-lined Type Ic\n(Ic-bl) supernovae (SNe), and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity\ndistribution of star-forming galaxies using the SDSS to represent galaxies in\nthe local universe and the TKRS for galaxies at intermediate redshifts.\n  The differing metallicity distributions of the LGRB hosts and the star\nformation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity\npreference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between\nstar-formation and metallicity, but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the\nastrophysics of the LGRBs themselves. Three quarters of our LGRB sample are\nfound at metallicities below 12+log(O/H) < 8.6, while less than a tenth of\nlocal star-formation is at similarly low metallicities. However, our SN samples\nare statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the general\ngalaxy population. Using the TKRS population of galaxies, we are able to\nexclude the possibility that the LGRB host metallicity aversion is caused by\nthe decrease in galaxy metallicity with redshift. The presence of the strong\nmetallicity difference between LGRBs and Ic-bl SNe largely eliminates the\npossibility that the observed LGRB metallicity bias is a byproduct of a\ndifference in the initial mass functions of the galaxy populations. Rather,\nmetallicity below half-solar must be a fundamental component of the\nevolutionary process that separates LGRBs from the vast majority of Ic-bl SNe\nand from the bulk of local star-formation. \n\n"}

This comes in addition to the unexpected proximity of the\nMagellanic Clouds (MCs) to the Milky Way (MW), and to another vast polar\nstructure (VPOS), which is almost perpendicular to our Galaxy disk. We find\nthat the VTDS plane is coinciding with several stellar, tidally-induced streams\nin the outskirts of M31, and, that its velocity distribution is consistent with\nthat of the Giant Stream (GS). This is suggestive of a common physical\nmechanism, likely linked to merger tidal interactions, knowing that a similar\nargument may apply to the VPOS at the MW location. Furthermore, the VTDS is\npointing towards the MW, being almost perpendicular to the MW disk, as the VPOS\nis.\n  We compare these properties to the modelling of M31 as an ancient, gas-rich\nmajor merger, which has been successfully used to predict the M31 substructures\nand the GS origin.

This has motivated the\nproposal of a number statistical tools, including two large-angle indicators\nbased on skewness and kurtosis of spherical caps of CMB sky-sphere. Although\nsuitable to detect fairly large non-Gaussianity they are unable to detect\nnon-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds, and exhibit power spectra with\nundesirable oscillation pattern.

To obtain constraints on such an anisotropic model, we derive\naverage and late-time shear values that come from the anisotropy upper limits\nof the recent Planck data based on a model independent shear parameter of\nMaartens et al. (1995a,b) and from the theoretical consistency relation. These\nconstraints lead us to obtain a BI model which becomes an almost-FRW model in\ntime, and which is consistent with the latest observational data of the CMB. \n\n"}

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse.

Total\ncolumn densities for the outflows are $\\sim$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outflow\nvelocity (v$_{out}$) correlates only weakly with the galaxy stellar mass\n(M$_*$), or circular velocity (v$_{cir}$), but strongly with both SFR and\nSFR/area. The normalized outflow velocity (v$_{out}/v_{cir}$) correlates well\nwith both SFR/area and SFR/M$_*$. The estimated outflow rates of warm ionized\ngas ($\\dot{M}$) are $\\sim$ 1 to 4 times the SFR, and the ratio $\\dot{M}/SFR$\ndoes not correlate with v$_{out}$.\n  We show that a model of a population of clouds accelerated by the combined\nforces of gravity and the momentum flux from the starburst matches the data.

This component, often associated with the GRB\njet's photosphere, is usually subdominant compared to a much stronger\nnon-thermal one. The prompt emission of Fermi GRB 131014A provides a unique\nopportunity to study this thermal-like component. Indeed, the thermal emission\nin GRB 131014A is much more intense than in other GRBs and a pure thermal\nepisode is observed during the initial 0.16 s. The thermal-like component cools\nmonotonically during the first second while the non-thermal emission kicks off.\nThe intensity of the non-thermal component progressively increases until being\nenergetically dominant at late time. This is a perfect scenario to disentangle\nthe thermal component from the non-thermal one. A low-energy spectral index of\n+0.6 better fit the thermal component than the typical index value +1\ncorresponding to a pure Planck function. The non-thermal component is\nadequately fitted with a Band function whose low and high energy power law\nindices are ~-0.7 and <~-3, respectively; this is also statistically equivalent\nto a cutoff power law with a ~-0.7 index. This is in agreement with our\nprevious results. Finally, a strong correlation is observed between the\ntime-resolved luminosity of the non-thermal component, L$_i^{nTh}$, and its\ncorresponding rest frame spectral peak energy, E$_{peak,i}^{rest,nTh}$, with a\nslope similar to the one reported in our previous articles. Assuming this\nrelation to be universal for all GRBs we estimate a redshift of ~1.55 for GRB\n131014A that is a typical value for long GRBs. These observational results are\nconsistent with the models in which the non-thermal emission is produced well\nabove the GRB jet photosphere but they may also be compatible with other\nscenarios (e.g., dissipative photosphere) that are not discussed in this\narticle. \n\n"}

These lags\nare thought to be associated with the light travel time between the central\nX-ray emitting region and areas further out on the accretion disc. The computed\nlags support a thermal reprocessing scenario in which X-ray photons heat the\ndisc and are reprocessed into lower energy photons. Additionally, we fit the\nlightcurves using CREAM, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code for a standard disc.\nThe best-fitting standard disc model yields unreasonably high super-Eddington\naccretion rates.

The objective of our\npaper is to determine whether next generation telescopes will be capable of\nalbedo estimations for icy exomoons using their occultation light curves. The\nsuccess of the measurements depends on the depth of the moon's occultation in\nthe light curve and on the sensitivity of the used instruments. We applied\nsimple calculations for different stellar masses in the V and J photometric\nbands, and compared the flux drop caused by the moon's occultation and the\nestimated photon noise of next generation missions with 5 $\\sigma$ confidence.\nWe found that albedo estimation by this method is not feasible for moons of\nsolar-like stars, but small M dwarfs are better candidates for such\nmeasurements. Our calculations in the J photometric band show that E-ELT\nMICADO's photon noise is just about 4 ppm greater than the flux difference\ncaused by a 2 Earth-radii icy satellite in a circular orbit at the snowline of\nan 0.1 stellar mass star.

We derive a set of conditions on the\nfour free functions of the Horndeski action that examine whether a specific\nmodel embedded in the action possesses an Einstein gravity limit or not. For\nthis purpose, we develop a new and surprisingly simple scaling method that\nidentifies dominant terms in the equations of motion by considering formal\nlimits of the couplings that enter through the new terms in the modified\naction. This enables us to find regimes where nonlinear terms dominate and\nEinstein's field equations are recovered to leading order. Together with an\nefficient approximation of the scalar field profile, one can then further\nevaluate whether these limits can be attributed to a genuine screening effect.\nFor illustration, we apply the analysis to both a cubic galileon and a\nchameleon model as well as to Brans-Dicke theory.

It has been advocated, however, that the global\nmagnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity produce the environmental\ndisturbances at low-frequency bands, known as Schumann resonances, which\npotentially couple with GW detectors. In this paper, we present a simple\nanalytical model to estimate its impact on the detection of stochastic GWs. The\nmodel crucially depends on the geometry of the detector pair through the\ndirectional coupling, and we investigate the basic properties of the correlated\nmagnetic noise based on the analytic expressions. The model reproduces the\nmajor trend of the recently measured global correlation between the GW\ndetectors via magnetometer. The estimated values of the impact of correlated\nnoise also match those obtained from the measurement. Finally, we give an\nimplication to the detection of stochastic GWs including upcoming detectors,\nKAGRA and LIGO India. The model suggests that LIGO Hanford-Virgo and\nVirgo-KAGRA pairs are possibly less sensitive to the correlated noise, and can\nachieve a better sensitivity to the stochastic GW signal in the most\npessimistic case. \n\n"}

We consider such a coupling to SM gauge fields, of the\nform $\\phi F\\tilde{F}/f$, with sub-Planckian $f$. In this case gauge fields can\nbe exponentially produced already {\\it during inflation} and thermalize via\ninteractions with charged particles, as pointed out in previous work. This can\nlead to a plasma of temperature $T$ during inflation and the thermal masses\n$gT$ of the gauge bosons can equilibrate the system. In addition, inflaton\nperturbations $\\delta \\phi$ can also have a thermal spectrum if they have\nsufficiently large cross sections with the plasma.

In response to this situation, we revisit the decaying\ndark matter solution to the issues, discussing possible signatures to\ndiscriminate decaying dark matter from astrophysical processes as a solution to\nsmall-scale issues. We consider an axinolike particle (ALPino) decaying into an\naxionlike particle (ALP) and gravitino with the lifetime around the age of the\nUniverse. The ALPino mass is sub-PeV and slightly ($\\Delta m/m\\sim 10^{-4}$)\nlarger than the gravitino mass, and thus the dark matter abundance does not\nalter virtually after the ALPino decays. On the other hand, the gravitino\nproduced from the ALPino decay obtains a kick velocity of $\\sim 30 \\,{\\rm km /\ns}$, which is sufficiently larger than a circular velocity of dwarf galaxies to\nimpact their dark matter distributions. The Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest constraints\nare relieved since only a small fraction ($\\sim10$%) of dark matter experiences\nthe decay at that time.

The black hole shadow (the photon capture\ncross-section) would be viewed if there is a stationary luminous background.\nThe black hole event horizon is invisible directly (per se). Nevertheless, a\nmore compact (with respect to black hole shadow) projection of the black hole\nevent horizon on the celestial sphere may be reconstructed by detecting the\nhighly red-shifted photons emitted by the non-stationary luminous matter\nplunging into the black hole and approaching to the event horizon.

Detailed limits on\nresidual systematic errors are assigned based largely on analyses of the flight\ndata supplemented, where necessary, with results from ground tests. The data\nare calibrated in flight using the dipole modulation of the CMB due to the\nobservatory's motion around the Sun. This constitutes a full-beam calibration\nsource. An iterative algorithm simultaneously fits the time-ordered data to\nobtain calibration parameters and pixelized sky map temperatures. The noise\nproperties are determined by analyzing the time-ordered data with this sky\nsignal estimate subtracted. Based on this, we apply a pre-whitening filter to\nthe time-ordered data to remove a low level of 1/f noise.

The values we obtain are fortuitously almost\nindependent of the matter density of the Universe (sigma\\_8 ~ 0.6-0.63) with an\naccuracy better than 5%. Quite remarkably, the amplitude of matter fluctuations\ncan be also tightly constrained to similar accuracy from existing CMB\nmeasurements alone.

These motions are driven by bulk flows and cluster\nformation and are much smaller than the acoustic scale itself. We present a\nmodel for the non-linear evolution based on the distribution of pairwise\nLagrangian displacements that provides a quantitative model for the degradation\nof the acoustic signature, even for biased tracers in redshift space. The\nLagrangian displacement distribution can be calibrated with a significantly\nsmaller set of simulations than would be needed to construct a precise power\nspectrum. By connecting the acoustic signature in the Fourier basis with that\nin the configuration basis, we show that the acoustic signature is more robust\nthan the usual Fourier-space intuition would suggest because the beat frequency\nbetween the peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations is a very small\nwavenumber that is well inside the linear regime.

These regions show little\nextinction at optical wavelengths. The galaxy has a relatively low global dust\nmass (~2E5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 times\nlower than the Milky Way average). The off-nuclear dust emission appears to be\npowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for the\nexcitation of the observed H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated\nwith the SSC (though a contribution from embedded sources to the IR luminosity\nof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out).

A construction of these quantities has\nrecently been given by Brunetti, Fredenhagen, and Kohler, and by Brunetti and\nFredenhagen, but they did not impose any ``locality'' or ``covariance''\ncondition in their constructions. As a consequence, their construction of time\nordered products contained ambiguities involving arbitrary functions of\nspacetime point rather than arbitrary parameters. In this paper, we construct\nan ``extended Wick polynomial algebra''-large enough to contain the Wick\npolynomials and their time ordered products.

Indeed, linearization of\na classical field theory (a field theoretic ``normal mode analysis'') results\nin fluctuations whose propagation is governed by a Lorentzian-signature curved\nspacetime ``effective metric''. For a single scalar field, this procedure\nresults in a unique effective metric, which is quite sufficient for simulating\nkinematic aspects of general relativity (up to and including Hawking\nradiation). Quantizing the linearized fluctuations, the one-loop effective\naction contains a term proportional to the Einstein--Hilbert action, suggesting\nthat while classical physics is responsible for generating an ``effective\ngeometry'', quantum physics can be argued to induce an ``effective dynamics''.\nThe situation is strongly reminiscent of Sakharov's ``induced gravity''\nscenario, and suggests that Einstein gravity is an emergent low-energy\nlong-distance phenomenon that is insensitive to the details of the high-energy\nshort-distance physics.

Here we explore the constraints of WMAP and 2dFGRS data on the various\nbrane inflationary scenarios. Brane inflation naturally ends with the\nproduction of cosmic strings, which may provide a way to distinguish these\nmodels observationally. We argue that currently available data cannot exclude a\nnon-negligible contribution from cosmic strings definitively. We perform a\npartial statistical analysis of mixed models that include a sub-dominant\ncontribution from cosmic strings. Although the data favor models without cosmic\nstrings, we conclude that they cannot definitively rule out a\ncosmic-string-induced contribution of $\\sim 10 %$ to the observed temperature,\npolarization and galaxy density fluctuations. These results imply that $G\\mu\n\\lesssim 3.5\\times 10^{-7}(\\lambda/0.25)\\sqrt{B/0.1}$, where $\\lambda$ is a\ndimensionless parameter related to the interstring distance, and $B$ measures\nthe importance of perturbations induced by cosmic strings.

Accurate determinations of $n_s(k)$, the scalar fluctuation\nindex, could also distinguish among various brane inflation models. \n\n"}

This mechanism assumes that the Universe is a\ntwo-component gas. The first component is a gas of ultra-relativistic \"normal\"\nparticles described by an equation of state of an ideal quantum gas of massless\nparticles. The second component consist of \"unusual\" charged particles (namely,\neither with ultra-high charge or with ultra-high mass) that provide the\nimportant mechanism of expansion due to their interaction with the \"normal\"\ncomponent of the gas. This interaction is described by the\nReissner--Nordstr\\\"om metric purely geometrically -- the ``unusual'' particles\nare modeled as zero-dimensional naked singularities inside spheres of\ngravitational repulsion. The radius of a repulsive sphere is inversely\nproportional to the energy of an incoming particle or the temperature. The\nexpansion mechanism is based on the inflating of the \"unusual\" particles (of\ncharge $Q$) with the drop of the temperature -- this drives apart all neutral\nparticles and particles of specific charge $q/m$ such that ${sign}(Q) q/m \\ge -\n1$. The Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om expansion naturally ends at recombination.

However, these fluctuations occur on time\nscales which are typically of the order of the light travel time between the\natom and the plate. As a consequence, they will not be observed in an\nexperiment which measures the force averaged over a much longer time.
