The\nphoton-quark scattering amplitude can be explicitly calculated in the high\nenergy regime, whereas for $NN$ scattering one uses the fit of the available\nexperimental data. The HRM predicts several specific features for the hard\nbreakup reaction. First, the cross section will approximately scale as\n$s^{-11}$.

We therefore conclude that\nthe origin of the low viscosity matter at the RHIC must be in the partonic\nphase of the reaction. \n\n"}

The advantages of such a hybrid\napproach lie in the improved capability of handling large dissipative\ncorrections in the late dilute phase of the reaction, including a realistic\ntreatment of the non-equilibrium hadronic chemistry and kinetic freeze-out. By\nvarying the switching temperature at which the hydrodynamic output is converted\nto particles for further propagation with the Boltzmann cascade we test the\nability of the macroscopic hydrodynamic approach to emulate the microscopic\nevolution during the hadronic stage and extract the temperature dependence of\nthe effective shear viscosity of the hadron resonance gas produced in the\ncollision.

This underlying paradigm can be significantly improved by including\nquantum fluctuations around the classical background fields. One class of these\ncontributes to the energy evolution of multi-parton correlators in the nuclear\nwavefunctions. Another dominant class of unstable quantum fluctuations grow\nrapidly with proper time $\\tau$ after the collision. These secular terms appear\nat each loop order; the leading contributions can be resummed to all loop\norders to obtain expressions for final state observables. The all-order result\ncan be expressed in terms of the spectrum of fluctuations on the initial proper\ntime surface. We compute, in $A^\\tau=0$ gauge, the essential elements in this\nfluctuation spectrum--the small quantum fluctuation modes in the classical\nbackground field. With our derivation in QCD, we have all the ingredients to\ncompute inclusive quantities in heavy ion collisions at early times including\ni) all--order leading logs in Bjorken $x_{1,2}$ of the two nuclei, ii) all\nstrong multiple scattering contributions, and iii) all-order leading secular\nterms.

Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet.

Such collisions are used to produce super-strong electric fields by the\nhuge number of interacting protons to test spontaneous positron-electron pair\nemission (vacuum decay) predicted by the quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory.\nMulti-nucleon transfer in actinide collisions could also be used as an\nalternative way to fusion in order to produce neutron-rich heavy and superheavy\nelements thanks to inverse quasifission mechanisms. Actinide collisions are\nstudied in a dynamical quantum microscopic approach. The three-dimensional\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code {\\textsc{tdhf3d}} is used with a full\nSkyrme energy density functional to investigate the time evolution of\nexpectation values of one-body operators, such as fragment position and\nparticle number. This code is also used to compute the dispersion of the\nparticle numbers (e.g., widths of fragment mass and charge distributions) from\nTDHF transfer probabilities, on the one hand, and using the Balian-Veneroni\nvariational principle, on the other hand. A first application to test QED is\ndiscussed. Collision times in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U are computed to determine the\noptimum energy for the observation of the vacuum decay. It is shown that the\ninitial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction\nmechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are\nof the order of $\\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to\nmodern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at\n$E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair\nemission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second\napplication of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is\ndiscussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific\norientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$)\nin the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf.\nThe collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a\nnucleon flux toward the latter.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark\ndistribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and\nother process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide\ndijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one. Since the CDF anomaly was\nobserved in the shoulder region of the dijet-mass distribution, a slight\nmodification of the distribution shape could explain at least partially the CDF\nexcess. Therefore, it is important to consider such effects within the standard\nmodel for judging whether the CDF anomaly indicates new physics beyond the\nstandard model.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons.

While some studies have found a good overall\nagreement between the nuclear PDFs and the neutrino data, others have claimed\nfor an incompatibility.

Second, in light of current discussions on\npossible final state collective behavior in the high-multiplicity pPb and dAu\ncollisions, we examine the implication of final state jet attenuation in such\ncollisions, by applying the same model used in AA collisions and quantifying\nthe corresponding $R_{pA}$ and $R_{dA}$ and their azimuthal anisotropy. The\nhigh-$p_t$ $V_n$ provide a set of clean indicators of final state energy loss.\nIn particular we find in the most central pPb (5.02 TeV) and dAu (200 GeV)\ncollisions, $V_2$ is on the order of $0.01$ and $0.1$ respectively, measurable\nwith current experimental accuracy. In addition, our high-$p_t$ $R_{dA}$ is\naround $0.6$ which is compatible with preliminary dAu results from RHIC. \n\n"}

In recent years it has been revealed that if measuring\nrelative to higher order event planes $\\Psi_n$, higher order flow coefficients\n$v_n$ for $n>2$ can be measured. This is due to initial state fluctuations,\npreviously not described by analytic solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics.\nIn this paper we show the first solutions that utilize higher order asymmetries\nand thus yield realistic $v_n$ flow coefficients. It is a clear consequence of\nthis that different flow patterns may lead to the same observed flow\ncoefficients.

This cross-section can be expressed in terms of a novel gluon Transition\nGeneralized Parton Distribution (T-GPD); the hard scale in the final state\nmakes the T-GPD sensitive to the short distance nucleon-nucleon interaction. We\nperform a toy model computation of this process in a perturbative framework and\ndiscuss the time scales that allow the separation of initial and final state\ndynamics in the T-GPD. We outline the more general computation based on the\nfactorization suggested by the toy computation: in particular, we discuss the\nrelative role of \"point-like\" and \"geometric\" Fock configurations that control\nthe parton dynamics of short range nucleon-nucleon scattering.

While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated. In\nthis paper, we study four recently-constructed \"unified\" NS EoSs, as well as\nthree developed strange quark star (QS) EoSs within the new confinement\ndensity-dependent mass model. All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent\nobservational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely\nmeasured. We construct sequences of rigidly rotating NS/QS configurations with\nincreasing spinning frequency $f$, from non-rotating ($f = 0$) to the Keplerian\nfrequency ($f = f_{\\rm K}$), and provide convenient analytical parametrizations\nof the results.

As this QCD\ninterference does not depend on the strong coupling constant, it is part of the\nno-interaction baseline that needs to be controlled prior to searching for\nother manifestations of collective dynamics. Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

Written in\nthe canonical basis of the actual Bogolyubov transformation, the force takes\nthe form of an off-shell in-medium two-body matrix in the superfluid phase\nmultiplied by a BCS occupation number $2 \\rho_{m}$. This interaction is finite\nranged, non local, total-momentum dependent and density dependent.

This yields a\ngood representation of the electromagnetic response in both the quasielastic\nand $\\Delta$ regions. The scaling approach is then inverted and predictions are\nmade for charge-changing neutrino reactions at energies of a few GeV, with\nfocus placed on nuclei which are relevant for neutrino oscillation\nmeasurements. For this a relativistic treatment of the required weak\ninteraction vector and axial-vector currents for both quasielastic and\n$\\Delta$-excitation processes is presented. \n\n"}

The question of how this energy is degraded and\nwhether we can use this phenomenon to probe the properties of the produced\nmatter is now under active discussion. It has been proposed that if this\nmatter, which is now being referred to as a {\\em strongly coupled Quark-Gluon\nPlasma} (sQGP), may behave as a liquid with a very small viscosity.\n  In this case, a very specific collective excitation should be produced,\ncalled the ``conical flow'', similar e.g. to the sonic booms generated by the\nshock waves produced by supersonic planes.

The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved.

I argue that an\nunderstanding of this problem would lead to knowledge of the high energy\nasymptotics of hadronic processes. The high gluon density should allow a first\nprinciples computation of these asymptotics from QCD. This physics might be\nexperimentally probed in heavy ion colliders or in high energy electron-nuclear\ncollisions \n\n"}

Use of high current polarized\nelectron beams, polarized targets, and recoil polarimeters, in conjunction with\nmodern spectrometers and detector instrumentation allow much more detailed\nstudies of nucleon and nuclear structure than has been possible in the past.\nThe CEBAF accelerator at Jefferson Lab was build to study the internal\nstructure of hadrons in a regime where confinement is important and strong\ninteraction QCD is the relevant theory. I discuss how the first experiments\nalready make significant contributions towards an improved understanding of\nhadronic structure. \n\n"}

We\nemploy the three-fluid model with dynamical unification of kinetically\nequilibrated fluid elements. Within our model with first-order phase transition\nat high density, droplets of QGP coexisting with hadronic matter are produced\nalready at BNL-AGS energies, E(Lab)=10AGeV. A substantial decrease of the\nisentropic velocity of sound, however, requires higher energies, E(Lab)=40AGeV.\nWe show the effect on the flow of nucleons in the reaction plane. According to\nour model calculations, kinematic requirements and EoS effects work\nhand-in-hand at E(Lab)=40AGeV to allow the observation of the dropping velocity\nof sound via an increase of the directed flow around midrapidity as compared to\ntop BNL-AGS energy. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0511057", "contents": "Title: Casimir interaction between normal or superfluid grains in the Fermi sea Abstract: We report on a new force that acts on cavities (literally empty regions of\nspace) when they are immersed in a background of non-interacting fermionic\nmatter fields. The interaction follows from the obstructions to the (quantum\nmechanical) motions of the fermions caused by the presence of bubbles or other\n(heavy) particles in the Fermi sea, as, for example, nuclei in the neutron sea\nin the inner crust of a neutron star or superfluid grains in a normal Fermi\nliquid. The effect resembles the traditional Casimir interaction between\nmetallic mirrors in the vacuum. However, the fluctuating electromagnetic fields\nare replaced by fermionic matter fields. We show that the fermionic Casimir\nproblem for a system of spherical cavities can be solved exactly, since the\ncalculation can be mapped onto a quantum mechanical billiard problem of a\npoint-particle scattered off a finite number of non-overlapping spheres or\ndisks. Finally we generalize the map method to other Casimir systems,\nespecially to the case of a fluctuating scalar field between two spheres or a\nsphere and a plate under Dirichlet boundary conditions. \n\n"}
