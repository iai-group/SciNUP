Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The SMBHs in\nall three scenarios follow the same black hole fundamental plane (BHFP) and\ncorrelation with bulge binding energy seen in simulations of major mergers, and\nobserved locally. Furthermore, provided that the total gas supply is\nsignificantly larger than the mass of the SMBH, its limiting mass is not\ninfluenced by the amount of gas available or the efficiency of black hole\ngrowth. This supports the assertion that SMBHs accrete until they reach a\ncritical mass at which feedback is sufficient to unbind the gas locally,\nterminating the inflow and stalling further growth. At the same time, while\nminor and major mergers follow the same projected correlations (e.g., the\n$M_{BH}-\\sigma$ and Magorrian relations), SMBHs grown via disk instabilities do\nnot, owing to structural differences between the host bulges.

The total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (median\nz=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). For the\ncluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,\nrespectively. We find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in the\nfield and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the bar\nfraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%).

Simple arguments show that the location of the\nlength-scale r_c, marking the transition from positive to negative\ncorrelations, is the same for any class of objects as for the full matter\ndistribution, i.e. it is invariant under biasing.

In this paper we argue one may be able to considerably\nimprove upon this: in the halo picture of cosmological structure all of the\ndark matter is in halos of varying mass and galaxies are formed inside these\nhalos, but for the dark matter mass and momentum conservation guarantee that\nnonlinear effects cannot develop a white noise in the dark matter power\nspectrum on large scales. This suggests that with a suitable weighting a\nsimilar effect may be achieved for galaxies, suppressing their shot noise. We\nexplore this idea with N-body simulations by weighting central halo galaxies by\nhalo mass and find that the resulting shot noise can be reduced dramatically\nrelative to expectations, with a 10-30 suppression at the highest number\ndensity of n=4*10^-3 (Mpc/h)^3 resolved in our simulations.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous.

MOND, indeed, predicts a quasi-universal value of this quantity\nfor objects of all masses and of any internal structure, provided they are\nmostly in the Newtonian regime; i.e., that their mean acceleration is at or\nabove a0. The predicted value is qSm, with Sm= a0/2 pi G= 138 solar masses per\nsquare parsec for the nominal value of a0, and q a constant of order 1 that\ndepends only on the form of the MOND interpolating function. This gives in the\nabove units log(Sm)=2.14, which is consistent with that found by Doanato et al.\nof 2.15+-0.2. MOND predicts, on the other hand, that this quasi-universal value\nis not shared by objects with much lower mean accelerations. It permits halo\ncentral surface densities that are arbitrarily small, if the mean acceleration\ninside the object is small enough. However, for such low-surface-density\nobjects, MOND predicts a halo surface density that scales as the square root of\nthe baryonic one, and so the range of the former is much compressed relative to\nthe latter. This explains, in part, the finding of Donato et al. that the\nuniversal value applies to low acceleration systems as well. Looking at\nliterature results for a number of the lowest surface-density disk galaxies\nwith rotation-curve analysis, I find that, indeed, their halo surface densities\nare systematically lower then the above \"universal\" value. The prediction of Sm\nas an upper limit, and accumulation value, of halo central surface densities,\npertains, unlike most other MOND predictions, to a pure \"halo\" property, not to\na relation between baryonic and \"dark matter\" properties. \n\n"}

We consider the energy dissipation, that results if the recoiling\nblack hole is surrounded by a thin circumbinary disc. Our results differ\nsignificantly from those of previous investigations. We show analytically that\nthe dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in the\nouter disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii. Thus, dimensional\nestimates, that include only the kinetic energy gained by the disc gas,\nunderestimate the real energy loss. This underestimate can exceed an order of\nmagnitude, if the recoil is directed close to the disc plane. We use three\ndimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and two dimensional\nfinite difference simulations to verify our analytic estimates.

In addition to\nseveral X-ray sources, diffuse emission was significantly detected associated\nwith its west lobe, but the east lobe was contaminated by an unidentified X-ray\nsource WARP J1552.4+2007. After careful evaluation of the X-ray and Non X-ray\nbackground, the 0.4 -- 7 keV X-ray spectrum of the west lobe is described by a\npower-law model. The photon index and 1 keV flux density was derived as\n$1.82_{-0.24}^{+0.26}\\pm0.04$ and $19.4_{-3.2}^{+3.3}\\pm 3.0$ nJy,\nrespectively, where the first and second errors represent the statistical and\nsystematic ones.

Seemingly\nunrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk of\nunknown origin orbiting the BH in M31, and possibly many other systems. We show\nthat these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.\nMulti-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to BH scales show that when\nsufficient gas is driven towards a BH, gravitational instabilities form a\nlopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background. The stellar relic of this disk is long\nlived and retains the eccentric pattern. Simulations that yield quasar-level\naccretion rates produce relic stellar disks with kinematics, eccentric\npatterns, precession rates, and surface density profiles in reasonable\nagreement with observations of M31. The observed properties of nuclear stellar\ndisks can thus be used to constrain the formation history of super-massive BHs. \n\n"}

Previous attempts to\nrecover the DTD have used comparisons of mean SN rates vs. redshift to cosmic\nstar-formation history (SFH), or comparison of SN rates among galaxies of\ndifferent mean ages. We present an approach to recover the SN DTD that avoids\nsuch averaging. We compare the SFHs of individual galaxies to the numbers of\nSNe discovered in each galaxy (generally zero, sometimes one or a few SNe). We\napply the method to a subsample of 3505 galaxies, hosting 82 SNe Ia and 119\ncore-collapse SNe (CC SNe), from the Lick Observatory SN Search (LOSS), with\nSFHs reconstructed from SDSS spectra. We find a >2sigma SN Ia DTD signal in our\nshortest-delay, \"prompt\", bin at <420 Myr. Despite a systematic error, due to\nthe limited aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibres, which causes some of the\nprompt signal to leak to the later DTD bins, the data require prompt SNe Ia at\nthe >99% confidence. We further find, at 4sigma, SNe Ia that are \"delayed\" by >\n2.4 Gyr. Thus, the data support the existence of both prompt and delayed SNe\nIa. The time integral over the CC SN DTD is 0.010+/-0.002 SNe per Msun, as\nexpected if all stars of mass >8 Msun lead to visible SN explosions.

Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

Based on that, the equation\nof hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to\ntwo sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easily\nintegrated to set-up a stable disk. We call one approach `density method' and\nthe other one `potential method'. Gas disks in detailed balance are especially\nsuitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We\nrevisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully\nthree-dimensional disk simulations. The impact of disk thickness on the disk\ninstability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied\nsystematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our\nmodels, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disk\ninstability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks and\nto 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. The simulations also show\nthat self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right\nnumbers as predicted by the analytic theory. \n\n"}

First, we give an LTB model whose distance-redshift relation\nagrees with that of the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model in the whole redshift\ndomain and which is well approximated by the Einstein-de Sitter universe at and\nbefore decoupling. We determine the decoupling epoch in this LTB universe by\nGamow's criterion and then calculate the positions of acoustic peaks. Thus\nobtained results are not consistent with the WMAP data.

We conduct 2-D hydrodynamic simulations\nto study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the natural\nproducts of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by the\nthermal and ram pressures of the ICM. We find that the temperature of a\nsimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,\nconsistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas\ntemperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically\nrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a\nresult, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram\npressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the\ncoronae. The density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,\nif present, and hence the formation of stars. The increase also enhances\nradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black\nholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in\nclusters than in the field. The radiation enhancement is consistent with a\nsubstantially higher surface brightness of the X-ray emission detected from\ncoronae in cluster environment. The total X-ray luminosity of a corona,\nhowever, depends on the relative importance of the surrounding thermal and ram\npressures. These environment dependences should at least partly explain the\nlarge dispersion in the observed diffuse X-ray luminosities of spheroids with\nsimilar stellar properties. Furthermore, we show that an outflow powered by the\ndistributed feedback can naturally produce a positive radial gradient in the\nhot gas entropy, mimicking a cooling flow. \n\n"}

One method adopted in recent years to identify\nheavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs under such circumstances is to use the\nobserved mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio as a proxy for the column\ndensity. This is based on the supposition that the amount of energy lost by the\nilluminating X-ray continuum to the obscuring matter and reprocessed into\ninfrared emission is directly related to the column density and that the proxy\nis not sensitive to other physical parameters of the system (aside from\ncontamination by dust emission from, for example, star-forming regions).

Jet-driven molecular outflows play an\nimportant role in this scenario, and their study can help to understand the\nprocess of high-mass star formation and the different evolutionary phases\ninvolved. Observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour an\nevolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with Class 0 objects\nwhile more evolved Class I/II objects show less evidence of powerful jets. The\npresent study aims at checking whether an analogous picture can be found in the\nhigh-mass case. The IRAM 30-m telescope (Spain) has been used to perform\nsingle-pointing SiO(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57\nhigh-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. Continuum data at\ndifferent wavelengths, from mid-IR to 1.2 mm, have been gathered to build the\nspectral energy distributions of all the clumps and estimate their bolometric\nluminosities.

Measuring these populations is difficult, but important for\nunderstanding the assembly of the most massive galaxies. The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1. The fraction of red IGCs (20%), and the red\ncolor of those GCs, implies that IGCs can originate from the halos of\nrelatively massive, L* galaxies, and not solely from the disruption of dwarf\ngalaxies.

This is due\nto the large radial velocity of the ADAF.

In the inner region of the ADAF, the flow is\nsignificantly pressured in the vertical direction by the magnetic field, and\ntherefore its gas pressure can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in\nthe ADAF without magnetic fields. This means that the magnetic field strength\nnear the black hole is underestimated by assuming equipartition between\nmagnetic and gas pressure with the conventional ADAF model. Our results show\nthat the magnetic field strength of the flow near the black hole horizon can be\nmore than one order of magnitude higher than that in the ADAF at 6GM/c^2, which\nimplies the Blandford-Znajek mechanism could be more important than the\nBlandford-Payne mechanism for ADAFs.

The fundamental\nplane of our sample is offset from classical bulges and ellipticals in a way\nthat is consistent with the scaling relations of pseudobulges. The sample has\nsmaller velocity dispersion at fixed luminosity in the Faber-Jackson plane,\ncompared with classical bulges and elliptical galaxies. The galaxies without\ndisks are structurally more similar to spheroidals than to classical bulges\naccording to their positions in the fundamental plane, especially the\nFaber-Jackson projection. Overall, we suggest that BHs with mass < 10^6 solar\nmass live in galaxies that have evolved secularly over the majority of their\nhistory. A classical bulge is not a prerequisite to host a black hole. \n\n"}

We find that\nonly 48\\pm6 % of the C IV BLR emission is covered by the C I absorbing gas. We\nobserve residual light (~6 %) as well in the bottom of the O I {\\lambda}1302\nabsorption from the cloud, redshifted on top of the QSO Lyman-{\\alpha} emission\nline. Therefore the extent of the neutral phase of the absorbing cloud is not\nlarge enough to cover all of the background source. The most likely explanation\nfor this partial coverage is the small size of the intervening cloud, which is\ncomparable to the BLR size. We estimate the number densities in the cloud:\nn_H2~110 cm^{-3} for the H_2-bearing core and n_H ~30 cm^{-3} for the neutral\nenvelope. Given the column densities, N(H2)=(3.71\\pm0.97)\\times10^19 cm^{-2}\nand N(H I)=(7.94\\pm1.6)\\times10^20 cm^{-2}, we derive the linear size of the\nH_2-bearing core and the neutral envelope along the line of sight to be\nl_H2~0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.05} pc and l_HI~8.2^{+6.5}_{-4.1} pc, respectively.

Energetics, RM\nstatistics and magnetic power spectral analysis consistently show that the\neffects also correlate with the jets' power, and that the lightest, fastest\njets produce the strongest changes in their environment. We see jets distort\nand amplify the CMFs especially near the edges of the lobes and the jets'\nheads. This process leads to a flattening of the RM structure functions at\nscales comparable to the source size. The edge features we find are similar to\nones observed in Hydra A. The results show that jet-produced RM enhancements\nare more apparent in quasars than in radio galaxies.

We suggest that a significant or even\ndominant fraction of this signal may be produced by several thousand late-type\nmain-sequence stars that possibly hide in the central ~0.1 pc region of the\nGalaxy.

This captures the features of chameleon, symmetron, dilaton\nand $f(R)$ models. We find that the CMB peaks can be affected in three\nindependent ways provided the Compton radius of the massive scalar is not\nfar-off the sound horizon at last scattering. When the coupling of the massive\nscalar to Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is large, the anomalous growth of the CDM\nperturbation inside the Compton radius induces a change in the peak amplitudes.\nWhen the coupling to baryons is moderately large, the speed of sound is\nmodified and the peaks shifted to higher momenta. Finally when both couplings\nare non-vanishing, a new contribution proportional to the Newton potential\nappears in the Sachs-Wolfe temperature and increases the peak amplitudes. We\nalso show how, given any temporal evolution of the scalar field mass, one can\nengineer a corresponding modified gravity model of the chameleon type. This\nopens up the possibility of having independent constraints on modified gravity\nfrom the CMB peaks and large scale structures at low redshifts. \n\n"}

We use CMB, BAO and\nSNIa data to constrain a model where the energy transfer in the dark sector is\nproportional to the DE density. There are two subclasses, defined by the\nvanishing of momentum transfer either in the DM or the DE frame. We conduct a\nMarkov-Chain Monte-Carlo analysis to obtain best-fit parameters. The background\nevolution allows large interaction strengths, and the constraints from CMB\nanisotropies are weak.

Our model\nassumes that early superhumps are caused by the rotation effect of\nnon-axisymmetrically flaring disks. We have developed a Bayesian model for this\nreconstruction, in which a smoother disk-structure tends to have a higher prior\nprobability. We analyzed simultaneous optical and near-infrared photometric\ndata of early superhumps of the dwarf nova, V455 And using this technique. The\nreconstructed disk has two flaring parts in the outermost region of the disk.\nThese parts are responsible for the primary and secondary maxima of the light\ncurves. The height-to-radius ratio is h/r=0.20-0.25 in the outermost region. In\naddition to the outermost flaring structures, flaring arm-like patterns can be\nseen in an inner region of the reconstructed disk. The overall profile of the\nreconstructed disk is reminiscent of the disk structure that is deformed by the\ntidal effect. However, an inner arm-like pattern, which is responsible for the\nsecondary minimum in the light curve, cannot be reproduced only by the tidal\neffect. It implies the presence of another mechanism that deforms the disk\nstructure. Alternatively, the temperature distribution of the disk could be\nnon-axisymmetric. We demonstrate that the disk structure with weaker arm-like\npatterns is optimal in the model including the irradiation effect. However, the\nstrongly irradiated disk gives quite blue colors, which may conflict with the\nobservation.

We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the\nenergy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor\n~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of\nthe swept-up material.

A\nrange of interpolating functions are explored to test the validity of\nMOND/TeVeS in these systems.

For weak\nenough magnetic fields, leptonic models can reproduce the few seconds delay of\nthe onset of GeV photon emission observed by Fermi-LAT, due to the slow growth\nof the target photon field for inverse Compton scattering. However, even for\nstronger magnetic fields, the GeV delay can be explained with hadronic models,\ndue to the long acceleration timescale of protons and the continuous photopion\nproduction after the end of the particle injection. While the FWHMs of the MeV\nand GeV lightcurves are almost the same in one-zone leptonic models, the FWHM\nof the 1--30 GeV lightcurves in hadronic models are significantly wider than\nthose of the 0.1--1 MeV lightcurves. The amount of the GeV delay depends on the\nimportance of the Klein--Nishina effect in both the leptonic and hadronic\nmodels. In our examples of hadronic models the energies of the escaped neutrons\nare comparable to the gamma-ray energy, although their contribution to the\nultra high-energy cosmic rays is still subdominant.

Our results show that the\nmotion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the\nfarthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities. We confirm that\nthe observed wiggling of the jet and counterjet arises from the orbital motion\nof the jet source in a binary system. Precession is of secondary importance in\nshaping the jet.

Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in\nthese cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115. The winds of these high-velocity\nstars are shocked to temperatures above the virial temperature of the galaxy,\nleading to the formation of a hot bubble of size ~0.1-10 pc near the center.\nThis hot bubble can substantially reduce the mass accretion rate by the SMBH.\nIf the density of the hot bubble is lower than that of the interstellar medium\n(ISM), a density-inversion layer is formed. As the gas loses energy by X-ray\nradiation, eventually more mass of the cooling shocked stellar winds will be\naccreted to the SMBH. This accretion will be of cold clumps.

From the observed\nrotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nGalactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal\nsphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii. There are so many HCCs that they will make\nup all the missing Halo mass density if there is spherical symmetry and their\naverage mass is of order 15,000 Mo.

Although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of\n10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, \"subgrid\" scales.\nGreat care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for the\neffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. We investigate the momentum and\nenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and\nstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star\nforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern\ncosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid\nmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds\nfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young\nstar clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star\nforming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density\nmitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernova\nexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. The\ndetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation\nand choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations\nin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of global\nstar formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback\nimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal\nfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formal\ngas cooling time.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic.

Abstract: Using collisionless N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky\nWay (MW) we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of\nthe Local Group. The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar disks embedded in\ndark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an\neccentric orbit typical for MW subhaloes. After a few Gyr of evolution the\nstellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal\nforces. Observing the simulated dwarfs along three principal axes of the\nstellar component we create mock data sets and determine the their half-light\nradii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. Using the estimator proposed by\nWolf et al. we calculate masses within half-light radii. The masses obtained\nthis way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of two when the line of\nsight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. We then\ndivide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and\ntrace their evolution in time. The two populations, although affected by tidal\nforces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr. We measure the\nhalf-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations\nalong different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass\ndistribution in the dwarfs following the method proposed by Walker &\nPenarrubia. The inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated,\ndepending on the line of sight. In particular, when the dwarf is seen along the\nlongest axis of the stellar component, a significantly shallower density\nprofile is inferred than the real one measured from the simulations. Since most\ndSphs are non-spherical and their orientation with respect to our line of sight\nis unknown, the method can be reliably applied only to a large sample of dwarfs\nwhen these systematic errors are expected to be diminished. \n\n"}

In the present work, we track the H$_2$ mass fraction within our\ncosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3 using an\nequilibrium analytic model by Krumholz et al. This model allows us to regulate\nthe star formation in our simulation by the local abundance of H$_2$ rather\nthan the total cold gas density, and naturally introduce the dependence of star\nformation on metallicity. We investigate implications of the equilibrium\nH$_2$-based SF model on galaxy population properties, such as the\nstellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR), baryon fraction, cosmic star formation rate\ndensity (SFRD), galaxy specific SFR, galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF), and\nKennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relationship. The advantage of our work over the\nprevious ones is having a large sample of simulated galaxies in a cosmological\nvolume from high-redshift to $z=0$. We find that low-mass halos with\nM$_{DM}<10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$ are less efficient in producing stars in the\nH$_2$-based SF model at $z\\geq6$, which brings the simulations to a better\nagreement with observational estimates of SHMR and GSMF at the low-mass end.\nThis is particularly evident by a reduction in the number of low-mass galaxies\nat M$_\\star\\leq10^{8}$ M$_\\odot$ in the GSMF. The overall SFRD is also reduced\nat high-$z$ in the H$_2$ run, which results in slightly higher SFRD at\nlow-redshift due to more abundant gas available for star formation at later\ntimes.

From\nPRIMUS we construct an i<23 flux-limited sample of ~40,000 galaxies at\nz=0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ~5.5 deg^2, and from the SDSS we select\n~170,000 galaxies at z=0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to\nPRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored. The magnetic flux required\nto power Swift J1644+57 is too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it\ncould be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disk present in the\ngalactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disk\ncould be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful\njets.[abridged] \n\n"}

New Insights in Wide-Field\n  Near-IR Surface Photometry Abstract: We present wide-field near-infrared J and Ks images of the Andromeda Galaxy\ntaken with WIRCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) as part of the\nAndromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS). This data set allows\nsimultaneous observations of resolved stars and NIR surface brightness across\nM31's entire bulge and disk (within R=22 kpc). The primary concern of this work\nis the development of NIR observation and reduction methods to recover a\nuniform surface brightness map across the 3x1 degree disk of M31. This\nnecessitates sky-target nodding across 27 WIRCam fields. Two sky-target nodding\nstrategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling\nlatency does not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the\nsky level. The mean surface brightness difference between blocks in our mosaic\ncan be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing scalar sky\noffsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to\nwithin a statistical zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq.\nuncertainty at R=15 kpc). Surface brightness stability across individual WIRCam\nframes is limited by both WIRCam flat field evolution and residual sky\nbackground shapes. To overcome flat field variability of order 1% over 30\nminutes, we find that WIRCam data should be calibrated with real-time sky\nflats. Due either to atmospheric or instrumental variations, the individual\nWIRCam frames have typical residual shapes with amplitudes of 0.2% of the sky\nafter real-time flat fielding and median sky subtraction. We present our WIRCam\nreduction pipeline and performance analysis here as a template for future\nnear-infrared observers needing wide-area surface brightness maps with\nsky-target nodding, and give specific recommendations for improving photometry\nof all CFHT/WIRCam programs.

{"id": "1304.3899", "contents": "Title: Star Formation in Nuclear Rings of Barred Galaxies Abstract: Nuclear rings in barred galaxies are sites of active star formation. We use\nhydrodynamic simulations to study temporal and spatial behavior of star\nformation occurring in nuclear rings of barred galaxies where radial gas\ninflows are triggered solely by a bar potential. The star formation recipes\ninclude a density threshold, an efficiency, conversion of gas to star\nparticles, and delayed momentum feedback via supernova explosions. We find that\nstar formation rate (SFR) in a nuclear ring is roughly equal to the mass inflow\nrate to the ring, while it has a weak dependence on the total gas mass in the\nring. The SFR typically exhibits a strong primary burst followed by weak\nsecondary bursts before declining to very small values. The primary burst is\nassociated with the rapid gas infall to the ring due to the bar growth, while\nthe secondary bursts are caused by re-infall of the ejected gas from the\nprimary burst. While star formation in observed rings persists episodically\nover a few Gyr, the duration of active star formation in our models lasts for\nonly about a half of the bar growth time, suggesting that the bar potential\nalone is unlikely responsible for gas supply to the rings. When the SFR is low,\nmost star formation occurs at the contact points between the ring and the dust\nlanes, leading to an azimuthal age gradient of young star clusters. When the\nSFR is large, on the other hand, star formation is randomly distributed over\nthe whole circumference of the ring, resulting in no apparent azimuthal age\ngradient. Since the ring shrinks in size with time, star clusters also exhibit\na radial age gradient, with younger clusters found closer to the ring. The\ncluster mass function is well described by a power law, with a slope depending\non the SFR. Giant gas clouds in the rings have supersonic internal velocity\ndispersions and are gravitationally bound. \n\n"}

Denser starbursts are too overpressured for hot wind formation, but\nsupernovae still stir up the ISM. I argue that supernovae power ubiquitous\nturbulence through each of the starburst ISM phases, including the hot wind,\nand that a fluctuation dynamo amplifies magnetic fields until they are in\nequipartition with the turbulence. Supernovae can drive turbulence with speeds\nof ~1000 km/s in the hot wind and ~20 km/s in the cold molecular gas, depending\non the outer scale.

For each PDS\nwe derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with the\ntheoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the Kepler\nmeasurements. We derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma,\nwhich show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations.

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF.

An extra\ndeflection angle is induced by the plasma in addition to the deflection\ngenerated by gravity. An inhomogeneous plasma distribution generates a greater\neffect than a homogeneous one, and may cause significant effects to be detected\nin low frequency radio observations (a few hundred MHz). In particular, the\nlensed image positions will be different between optical and radio\nobservations. The change of position due to a plasma can reach a few tens of\nmilli-arcsec, which is readily detectable. One can use the position difference\nin different frequencies to estimate the density of plasma in the lens. The\nmagnification ratios between multiple images are mainly determined by other\nproperties of the lens, and are only weakly affected by the plasma.

From the continuum and CH_3CN\nresults, we infer fractional abundances from 10^{-9} to 10^{-7} toward the\ncompact inner components, that increase with the rotational temperature. Our\nresults agree with a chemical scenario in which the CH_3CN molecule is\nefficiently formed in the gas phase above 100-300 K, and its abundance\nincreases with temperature. \n\n"}

We use observations and simulations to demonstrate how LOS\ncontamination affects the column density probability distribution function\n(PDF).

In perfect agreement\nwith the simulations, we find that the PDFs become broader, the peak shifts to\nlower column densities, and the power-law tail of the PDF flattens after\ncorrection. All PDFs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peak\nat Av~2, a deviation point (DP) from the lognormal at Av(DP)~4-5, and a\npower-law tail for higher column densities. Assuming a density distribution\nrho~r^-alpha, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to alpha(PDF)=1.8,\n1.75, and 2.5 for Auriga, Carina, and NGC3603 (alpha~1.5-2 is consistent\ngravitational collapse).

However, for both\ncloud types, the transition of the PDF from lognormal shape into power-law tail\nis found at the same column density (at Av~4-5 mag). Low-mass and high-mass SF\nclouds then have the same low column density distribution, most likely\ndominated by supersonic turbulence. At higher column densities, collapse and\nexternal pressure can form the power-law tail. The relative importance of the\ntwo processes can vary between clouds and thus lead to the observed differences\nin PDF and column density structure. \n\n"}

We propose that the\nunderlying mechanisms shaping the number ratios of SNe types can be interpreted\nwithin the framework of interaction-induced star formation, in addition to the\nknown relations between morphologies and stellar populations. We find a strong\ntrend in behaviour of the NIa/NCC ratio depending on host morphology, such that\nearly spirals include more Type Ia SNe. The NIbc/NII ratio is higher in a broad\nbin of early-type hosts. The NIa/NCC ratio is nearly constant when changing\nfrom normal, perturbed to interacting galaxies, then declines in merging\ngalaxies, whereas it jumps to the highest value in post-merging/remnant\ngalaxies. In contrast, the NIbc/NII ratio jumps to the highest value in merging\ngalaxies and slightly declines in post-merging/remnant subsample. The\ninterpretation is that the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies,\nwhich are strongly affected in the final stages of interaction, have an impact\non the number ratios of SNe types. The NIa/NCC (NIbc/NII) ratio increases\n(decreases) from star-forming to active galactic nuclei (AGN) classes of\ngalaxies. These variations are consistent with the scenario of an\ninteraction-triggered starburst evolving into AGN during the later stages of\ninteraction, accompanied with the change of star formation and transformation\nof the galaxy morphology into an earlier type. \n\n"}

We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies.

We find\nthat on large scales (R>10 Mpc/h), the galaxy bias is roughly linear and\ndeterministic. On smaller scales (R<5 Mpc/h) the bias is a complicated function\nof scale and luminosity, determined by the different spatial distribution and\nabundance of satellite galaxies present when different magnitude cuts are\napplied, as well as by the mass dependence of the host haloes on magnitude.

The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among\nother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the\nseparation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and\nmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential\nincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. Here we report on the first\nSGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors and address the\ncomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated\nnoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO\nHanford detectors, H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run. At low\nfrequencies, 40 - 460 Hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlated\nnoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochastic\ngravitational-wave signal.

Extraplanar molecular gas has been detected in\nthe archetype starburst galaxy M82, but so far there has been no evidence that\nstarbursts can propel significant quantities of cold molecular gas to the same\ngalactocentric radius (~10 kpc) as the warmer gas traced by metal absorbers.\nHere we report observations of molecular gas in a compact (effective radius 100\npc) massive starburst galaxy at z=0.7, which is known to drive a fast outflow\nof ionized gas.

In this Thesis we\nperformed a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of this cluster to\ndetermine its formation and evolution. Form the photometric point of view we\nbuilt a high-resolution differential reddening map in the direction of the\nsystem and we measured relative proper motions to separate its member\npopulation from the contaminating bulge and disk stars. From the spectroscopic\npoint of view we measured abundances for more than 600 stars belonging to\nTerzan 5 and its surroundings in order to build the largest\nfield-decontaminated metallicity distribution for this system. We find that the\nmetallicity distribution is extremely broad (>1 dex) and we discovered a third,\nmetal-poor and alpha-enhanced population with average [Fe/H]=-0.8 dex. The\nstriking similarity between Terzan 5 and the bulge in terms of their chemical\nformation and evolution that is clearly revealed by this Thesis suggests that\nTerzan 5 formed in situ with the Galactic bulge. In particular its metal-poor\npopulations trace the early stages of the bulge formation, while its most\nmetal-rich component may contain crucial information on the bulge more recent\nevolution. \n\n"}

Total (relative) magnetic helicity is already recognized\nas an important topological constraint on magnetohydrodynamic processes. Field\nline helicity offers further advantages because it preserves all topological\ninformation and can distinguish between different magnetic fields with the same\ntotal helicity. Magnetic reconnection changes field connectivity and field line\nhelicity reflects these changes; the goal of this paper is to characterize that\nevolution. We start by deriving the evolution equation for field line helicity\nand examining its terms, also obtaining a simplified form for cases where\ndynamics are localized within the domain. The main result, which we support\nusing kinematic examples, is that during localized reconnection in a complex\nmagnetic field, the evolution of field line helicity is dominated by a\nwork-like term that is evaluated at the field line endpoints, namely the scalar\nproduct of the generalized field line velocity and the vector potential.\nFurthermore, the flux integral of this term over certain areas is very small\ncompared to the integral of the unsigned quantity, which indicates that changes\nof field line helicity happen in a well-organized pairwise manner. It follows\nthat reconnection is very efficient at redistributing helicity in complex\nmagnetic fields despite having little effect on the total helicity. \n\n"}

For the alternative gravitational theory of MOND the rotation curves\ncan be explained if the fundamental parameter associated with MOND is allowed\nas a free parameter.

The strong galactic gravitational field makes this impossible on\nenergetic grounds. It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable\nfield lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines\nwithout requiring much energy. This expulsion of only short lines of force can\nbe accomplished by a spike instability associated with gigantic astrophysical\nsuperbubbles.

Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'.

By means of high resolution numerical\nsimulations we detail the purely dynamical effects that a forming bar exerts on\nthe gas of an isolated disc galaxy. The galaxy is initially unstable to the\nformation of non-axisymmetric structures, and within 1 Gyr it develops spiral\narms that eventually evolve into a central stellar bar on kpc scale. A first\nmajor episode of gas inflow occurs during the formation of the spiral arms\nwhile at later times, when the stellar bar is establishing, a low density\nregion is carved between the bar co-rotational and inner Lindblad resonance\nradii. The development of such \"dead zone\" inhibits further massive gas\ninflows. Indeed, the gas inflow reaches its maximum during the relatively fast\nbar formation phase and not, as often assumed, when the bar is fully formed. We\nconclude that the low efficiency of long-lived, evolved bars in driving gas\ntoward galactic nuclei is the reason why observational studies have failed to\nestablish an indisputable link between bars and AGNs. On the other hand, the\nhigh efficiency in driving strong gas inflows of the intrinsically transient\nprocess of bar formation suggests that the importance of bars as drivers of AGN\nactivity in disc galaxies has been overlooked so far.

Photometric metallicity estimates are\nderived by interpolating isochrones for over seven million stars in the\nPanchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey. This is the first\nsystematic study of stellar metallicities over the inner 20 kpc of Andromeda's\ngalactic disk. We see a clear metallicity gradient of $-0.020\\pm0.004$ dex/kpc\nfrom $\\sim4-20$ kpc assuming a constant RGB age. This metallicity gradient is\nderived after correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completeness\nand dust extinction and is quite insensitive to these effects. The unknown age\ngradient in M31's disk creates the dominant systematic uncertainty in our\nderived metallicity gradient. However, spectroscopic analyses of galaxies\nsimilar to M31 show that they typically have small age gradients that make this\nsystematic error comparable to the 1$\\sigma$ error on our metallicity gradient\nmeasurement. In addition to the metallicity gradient, we observe an asymmetric\nlocal enhancement in metallicity at radii of 3-6 kpc that appears to be\nassociated with Andromeda's elongated bar.

We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses.

We combine stellar kinematics in the central regions with\nthe dynamics of 612 globular clusters out to 200 kpc and satellite galaxies\nextending to scales comparable with the virial radius.

In the recent Guo et\nal (2011) and Fu et al (2013) semi-analytic + N-body models, the gaseous\nenvironment of the satellite galaxy is governed by the properties of the dark\nmatter subhalo in which it resides. This quantity depends of the resolution of\nthe N-body simulation, leading to a divergent fraction of quenched satellites\nin high- and low-resolution simulations.

We demonstrate that we then\nobtain better converged results between the Millennium I and II simulations,\nespecially for the satellites in the massive haloes ($\\rm log\nM_{halo}=[14,15]$).

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures.

Without any additional contributions to the gas velocity field, a\nlarge fraction of the apparently supersonic (${\\cal M}\\sim$2-3) linewidths\nmeasured in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) lines can be explained by the\nsaturation of their corresponding sonic-like, optically-thin C$^{18}$O\ncounterparts assuming standard isotopic fractionation.

The amount of galaxies in the clusters is\nestimated by subtracting the predicted $\\kappa$-map from the $\\kappa$-map data.\nThe estimate for the Bullet Cluster is that $14.1\\%$ of the cluster is composed\nof galaxies. For the Train Wreck Cluster, if the Jee et al. data are used,\n$25.7\\%$ of the cluster is composed of galaxies. The baryon matter in the\ngalaxies and the enhanced strength of gravitation in MOG, shift the lensing\npeaks making them offset from the gas. The work demonstrates that this\ngeneralized gravitational theory can explain merging cluster dynamics without\ndark matter. \n\n"}

The\npresence of two stellar populations, the bimodal star formation history (SFH)\nand an unusual rotation velocity of And II put strong constrains on its\nformation and evolution. Following Lokas et al. (2014), we propose a detailed\nmodel to explain the main properties of And II involving (1) a gas-rich major\nmerger between two dwarf galaxies at high redshift in the field and (2) a close\ninteraction with M31 about 5 Gyr ago. The model is based on\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations including gas dynamics, star formation and\nfeedback. One simulation is designed to reproduce the gas-rich major merger\nexplaining the origin of stellar populations and the SFH. Other simulations are\nused to study the effects of tidal forces and the ram pressure stripping during\nthe interaction between And II and M31. The model successfully reproduces the\nSFH of And II including the properties of stellar populations, its morphology,\nkinematics and the lack of gas. Further improvements to the model are possible\nvia joint modelling of all processes and better treatment of baryonic physics. \n\n"}

After a short introduction to standard and inflationary\ncosmology, we present our research findings. On the one hand, we show that\nfocusing on universality properties of inflation can yield surprisingly\nstringent bounds on its dynamics. This approach allows us to identify the\nregime where the inflationary field range is uniquely determined by both the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index. Then, we derive a novel\nfield-range bound, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than the original\none derived by Lyth. On the other hand, we discuss the embedding of inflation\nin supergravity and prove that non-trivial hyperbolic K\\\"ahler geometries\ninduce an attractor for the inflationary observables: the spectral tilt tends\nautomatically to the center of the Planck dome whereas the amount of primordial\ngravitational waves is directly controlled by curvature of the internal\nmanifold. We identify the origin of this attractor mechanism in the so-called\n$\\alpha$-scale supergravity model. Finally, we show how the inclusion of a\nnilpotent sector, allowing for a unified description of inflation and dark\nenergy, implies an enhancement of the attractor nature of the theory.

Galaxies were therein\nseparated from stars and quasars through colour cuts, which may leave\nimperfections because of mixing different source types which overlap in colour\nspace. The aim of the present work is to identify galaxies in the\nWISExSuperCOSMOS catalogue through an alternative approach of machine learning.\nThis allows us to define more complex separations in the multi-colour space\nthan possible with simple colour cuts, and should provide more reliable source\nclassification. For the automatised classification we use the support vector\nmachines learning algorithm, employing SDSS spectroscopic sources cross-matched\nwith WISExSuperCOSMOS as the training and verification set. We perform a number\nof tests to examine the behaviour of the classifier (completeness, purity and\naccuracy) as a function of source apparent magnitude and Galactic latitude. We\nthen apply the classifier to the full-sky data and analyse the resulting\ncatalogue of candidate galaxies. We also compare thus produced dataset with the\none presented in B16. The tests indicate very high accuracy, completeness and\npurity (>95%) of the classifier at the bright end, deteriorating for the\nfaintest sources, but still retaining acceptable levels of 85%. No significant\nvariation of classification quality with Galactic latitude is observed.\nApplication of the classifier to all-sky WISExSuperCOSMOS data gives 15 million\ngalaxies after masking problematic areas. The resulting sample is purer than\nthe one in B16, at a price of lower completeness over the sky. The automatic\nclassification gives a successful alternative approach to defining a reliable\ngalaxy sample as compared to colour cuts. \n\n"}

Detailed simulation of massive star\nformation therefore requires an accurate treatment of radiation. However, all\npublished simulations have either used a diffusion approximation of limited\nvalidity; have only been able to simulate a single star fixed in space, thereby\nsuppressing potentially-important instabilities; or did not provide adequate\nresolution at locations where instabilities may develop. To remedy this we have\ndeveloped a new, highly accurate radiation algorithm that properly treats the\nabsorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and\nprocessing by interstellar dust. We use our new tool to perform\nthree-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive\npre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly\nresolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow. We find that mass is\nchanneled to the stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)\ninstabilities, in agreement with previous results using stars capable of\nmoving, but in disagreement with methods where the star is held fixed or with\nsimulations that do not adequately resolve the development of RT instabilities.\nFor laminar initial conditions, proper treatment of the direct radiation field\nproduces later onset of instability, but does not suppress it entirely provided\nthe edges of radiation-dominated bubbles are adequately resolved. Instabilities\narise immediately for turbulent pre-stellar cores because the initial\nturbulence seeds the instabilities.

The vast majority of cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations implement the UVB via a set of spatially uniform photoionization\nand photoheating rates derived from UVB synthesis models. We show that\nsimulations using canonical UVB rates reionize and, perhaps more importantly,\nspuriously heat the IGM, much earlier z ~ 15 than they should. This problem\narises because at z > 6, where observational constraints are nonexistent, the\nUVB amplitude is far too high. We introduce a new methodology to remedy this\nissue, and we generate self-consistent photoionization and photoheating rates\nto model any chosen reionization history. Following this approach, we run a\nsuite of hydrodynamical simulations of different reionization scenarios and\nexplore the impact of the timing of reionization and its concomitant heat\ninjection on the the thermal state of the IGM. We present a comprehensive study\nof the pressure smoothing scale of IGM gas, illustrating its dependence on the\ndetails of both hydrogen and helium reionization, and argue that it plays a\nfundamental role in interpreting Lyman-alpha forest statistics and the thermal\nevolution of the IGM. The premature IGM heating we have uncovered implies that\nprevious work has likely dramatically overestimated the impact of\nphotoionization feedback on galaxy formation, which sets the minimum halo mass\nable to form stars at high redshifts.

We obtained the first ever far-infrared\n(FIR) line observations of a GRB host, namely Herschel/PACS resolved [CII] 158\num and [OI] 63 um spectroscopy, as well as APEX CO(2-1) and ALMA CO(1-0)\nobservations of the GRB 980425 host. It has elevated [CII]/FIR and [OI]/FIR\nratios and higher values of star formation rate (SFR) derived from line ([CII],\n[OI], Ha) than from continuum (UV, IR, radio) indicators. [CII] emission\nexhibits a normal morphology, peaking at the galaxy center, whereas [OI] is\nconcentrated close to the GRB position and the nearby Wolf-Rayet region. The\nhigh [OI] flux indicates high radiation field and gas density. The [CII]/CO\nluminosity ratio of the GRB 980425 host is close to the highest values found\nfor local star-forming galaxies. Its CO-derived molecular gas mass is low given\nits SFR and metallicity, but the [CII]-derived molecular gas mass is close to\nthe expected value. The [OI] and HI concentrations, and the high radiation\nfield and density are consistent with the hypothesis of a very recent (at most\na few tens of Myr ago) inflow of atomic gas triggering star formation. Dust has\nnot had time to build up (explaining high line-to-continuum ratios). Such a\nrecent enhancement of star-formation would indeed manifest itself in high\nSFR_line/SFR_continuum ratios, because the line indicators are sensitive only\nto recent (<10 Myr) activity, whereas the continuum indicators measure the SFR\naveraged over much longer periods (~100 Myr). Other GRB hosts exhibit a mean\nSFR_line/SFR_continuum of 1.74+-0.32. This is consistent with a very recent\nenhancement of star formation being common among GRB hosts, so galaxies which\nhave recently experienced inflow of gas may preferentially host stars exploding\nas GRBs.

To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the\nmajor axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,\nleading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal. In order to relate that\nto a halo ellipticity, we have to adopt a model density profile.

Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12.

Our 3-D hydrodynamic AGN jet-ICM\n(intracluster medium) simulations, looking at the detailed angular momentum\ndistribution of cold gas and its time variability for the first time, show that\nthe angular momentum of the cold gas crossing $\\lesssim 1$ kpc is essentially\nisotropic.

We first show, by\nmeans of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations\nwith different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar.

Although previous numerical simulations have indicated\nthat most of the missing baryons reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nWarm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), it is generally very difficult to detect\nsignatures from such a diffuse gas. In this work, we focus on the hyperfine\ntransition of neutral hydrogen (HI) called 21-cm line as a tool to trace the\nWHIM. For the purpose, we first construct the map of the 21-cm signals by using\nthe data provided by the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation\nproject, Illustris, in which detailed processes affecting the dynamical and\nthermal evolution of the WHIM are implemented. From the comparison with the\nconstructed 21-cm signal map with the expected noise level of the Square\nKilometre Array phase 1 mid-frequency instrument (SKA1-mid), we find that the\n21-cm signals from the filamentary structures at redshifts z=0.5-3 are\ndetectable with the SKA1-mid if we assume the angular resolution of\n\\Delta\\theta > 10 arcmin and the observing time of t_obs > 100 hours.

We perform high-resolution, non-radiative simulations of the lobe\ncreation, expansion and disruption, and find that its dynamical evolution is in\nqualitative agreement with simulations of idealised low-density cavities that\nare dominated by a large-scale Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The buoyant rising\nof the lobe does not create energetically significant small-scale chaotic\nmotion in a volume-filling fashion, but rather a systematic upward motion in\nthe wake of the lobe and a corresponding back-flow perpendicular to it.

High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red\nsequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*>10^10.5 Mo.\nThe most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass\nvia dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold\ninflows more effectively penetrate hot halos.

Abstract: Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to trace merger shock fronts. If\ncosmological structure formation determines the luminosity, size and shape\ndistributions of radio relics then merger shocks need to be lighted up in a\nhomogeneous way. We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed\ngalaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured\nin the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known\nto date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply\nthe same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock\nrelic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,\nsuggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS\nand mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend\nto be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.\nBesides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio\nrelics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest\nlinear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are\nlargely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations. Mock relics show\na similar orientation with respect to the direction to the cluster centre as\nthe NVSS sample. Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly\ncorrelates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

In this paper we present a new method for light curve period estimation\nbased on the quadratic mutual information (QMI). The proposed method does not\nassume a particular model for the light curve nor its underlying probability\ndensity and it is robust to non-Gaussian noise and outliers.

Foreground contamination Abstract: Cross-correlation between the redshifted 21 cm signal and Lyman-{\\alpha}\nemitters (LAEs) is powerful tool to probe the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).\nAlthough the cross-power spectrum (PS) has an advantage of not correlating with\nforegrounds much brighter than the 21 cm signal, the galactic and\nextra-galactic foregrounds prevent detection since they contribute to the\nvariance of the cross PS. Therefore, strategies for mitigating foregrounds are\nrequired. In this work, we study the impact of foreground avoidance on the\nmeasurement of the 21 cm-LAE cross-correlation. We then simulate the 21 cm\nobservation as observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The point\nsource foreground is modelled from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky\nMurchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey catalogue, and the diffuse foreground\nis evaluated using a parametric model. For LAE observations, we assume a large\nsurvey of the Subaru Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC), with spectroscopic observations\nof the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). To predict the 21 cm signal, we employ a\nnumerical simulation combining post processed radiative transfer and radiation\nhydrodynamics. Using these models, the signal-to-noise ratio of 2D PS shows the\nforeground contamination dominates the error of cross-PS even in the so-called\n`EoR window'. We find that at least 99% of the point source foreground and 80%\nof the galactic diffuse foreground must be removed to measure the EoR signal at\nlarge scales $k<0.5 h \\rm Mpc^{-1}$.

Modern\ncosmological simulations can now obtain relatively realistic populations of\ndisc galaxies, but it still remains to be clarified how discs manage to survive\nmassive mergers. Here we use a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations set in a LambdaCDM cosmology to elucidate the fate of discs\nencountering massive mergers. We extract a sample of approximately 100 disc\ngalaxies and follow the changes in their post-merger morphologies, as tracked\nby their disc-to-total ratios (D/T). We also examine the relations between\ntheir present-day morphology, assembly history and gas fractions.

Since the low-mass stellar generation formed in this shell is made\nup of the material lost from the supergiant, its composition necessarily\nreflects the composition of the supergiant wind.

We present 3.3 and 5.5 cm images constructed using an innovative\nmethodology that yields a very high dynamic range, providing an unprecedentedly\nclear picture of the SgrAWF. While the physical association of the SgrAWF with\nSgrA* is not unambiguous, the images decidedly evoke this interesting\npossibility. Assuming that the SgrAWF bears a physical relationship to SgrA*,\nwe examine the potential implications. One is that SgrA* is a source of\nrelativistic particles constrained to diffuse along ordered local field lines.\nThe relativistic particles could also be fed into the local field by a\ncollimated outflow from SgrA*, perhaps driven by the Poynting flux accompanying\nthe black hole spin in the presence of a magnetic field threading the event\nhorizon. Second, we consider the possibility that the SgrAWF is the\nmanifestation of a low-mass-density cosmic string that has become anchored to\nthe black hole. The simplest form of these hypotheses would predict that the\nfilament be bi-directional, whereas the SgrAWF is only seen on one side of\nSgrA*, perhaps because of the dynamics of the local medium. \n\n"}

Morphological classifications provided by volunteers\nfor simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample\nof images drawn from the SDSS Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple\nmorphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth\nfrom featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images.\nDifferences are identified, which are likely due to the limited resolution of\nthe simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical\nevolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes.\nSpecifically, for stellar masses $M_{\\star}\\lesssim10^{11}M_{\\odot}$, a larger\nproportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible\nsubstructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses,\nsimulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar morphology\ndistributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior\nconfirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris\nsimulated images. When $M_{\\star}\\gtrsim10^{11}M_{\\odot}$, the Illustris\ndataset contains fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously\nfeatured. These results suggest that comparison between the detailed properties\nof observed and simulated galaxies, even when limited to reasonably massive\nsystems, may be misleading. \n\n"}

This is\nthe main question addressed in the present analysis. We also discuss the\nvalidity of Derrick's theorem when scalar fields are embedded in non-trivial\ngravitational backgrounds. In the context of the above question, we consider\nthree global defect configurations: a finite thickness spherical domain wall\nwith a central S-dS black hole, a global string loop with a S-dS black hole in\nthe center and a global monopole near a S-dS black hole. Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a\ncritical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the\nwall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it\ndevelops ghost instabilities. For smaller initial radius, tension dominates and\nthe wall contracts towards the black hole horizon where it also develops ghost\ninstabilities. We also show, using the same analytical model and energetic\narguments that a global monopole is gravitationally attracted by a black hole\nwhile a cosmological constant induces a repulsive gravitational potential as in\nthe case of test particles.

They are generally believed to be involved in a Galaxy-wide\nrecycling process, either through an accretion flow or a large-scale fountain\nflow, or both. We examine the evolution of these clouds in light of recent\nclaims that they may trigger condensation of gas from the Galactic corona as\nthey move through it. We measure condensation along a cloud's wake, with and\nwithout the presence of an ambient magnetic field, using two- (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D), high-resolution simulations. We find that 3D\nsimulations are essential to correctly capture the condensation in all cases.\nMagnetic fields significantly inhibit condensation in the wake of clouds at $t\n\\gtrsim 25$ Myr, preventing the sharp upturn in cold gas mass seen in previous\nnon-magnetic studies. The magnetic field suppresses the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability responsible for the ablation and consequent mixing of a cloud with\nhalo gas which drives the condensation. This effect is universal across\ndifferent cloud properties (density, metallicity, velocity) and magnetic field\nproperties (strength and orientation). Simple convergence tests demonstrate\nthat resolving the gas on progressively smaller scales leads to even less\ncondensation. While condensation still occurs in all cases, our results show\nthat an ambient magnetic field drastically lowers the efficiency of\nfountain-driven accretion and likely also accretion from condensation around\nhigh-velocity clouds. These lower specific accretion rates are in better\nagreement with observational constraints compared to 3D, non-magnetic\nsimulations. \n\n"}

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary\nsystems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those\nfound around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to\nbe extremely rare in such environments. \n\n"}

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.

First, we confirm that\nnonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate\nerrors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs\nrobustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of\nthe size and shape of the posterior star formation rate (SFR) as a function of\ntime is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise.

In this scenario, the\ntemporal component of the helicity-1 mode is an auxiliary field and can be\nintegrated out in terms of the time derivative of the helicity-0 mode, so that\nthe background dynamics effectively reduces to that in single-field inflation\nmodulated by a parameter $\\beta$ associated to the coupling between helicity-0\nand helicity-1 modes.

The model had involved only one parameter,\nviz. the scale associated with the bounce. For a suitable value of the\nparameter, the model had led to strictly scale invariant power spectra with a\nCOBE normalized scalar amplitude and a rather small tensor-to-scalar ratio.

As the new model does not seem to\npermit analytical evaluation of the scalar modes near the bounce, with the aid\nof techniques which we had used in our earlier work, we compute the scalar and\nthe tensor power spectra numerically.

Abstract: We present a new class of two-field inflationary attractor models, known as\n`shift-symmetric orbital inflation', whose behaviour is strongly multi-field\nbut whose predictions are remarkably close to those of single-field inflation.\nIn these models, the field space metric and potential are such that the\ninflaton trajectory is along an `angular' isometry direction whose `radius' is\nconstant but arbitrary. As a result, the radial (isocurvature) perturbations\naway from the trajectory are exactly massless and they freeze on superhorizon\nscales. These models are the first exact realization of the `ultra-light\nisocurvature' scenario, previously described in the literature, where a\ncombined shift symmetry emerges between the curvature and isocurvature\nperturbations and results in primordial perturbation spectra that are entirely\nconsistent with current observations. Due to the turning trajectory, the radial\nperturbation sources the tangential (curvature) perturbation and makes it grow\nlinearly in time. As a result, only one degree of freedom (i.e. the one from\nisocurvature modes) is responsible for the primordial observables at the end of\ninflation, which yields the same phenomenology as in single-field inflation. In\nparticular, isocurvature perturbations and local non-Gaussianity are highly\nsuppressed here, even if the inflationary dynamics is truly multi-field.

A negative detection in several\nall-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previous\nadditional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the GRB (as expected from\nthe jet effect). The existence of a second break might indicate a steepening in\nthe electron spectrum or the superposition of two events.

Abstract: (Abridged version) Mayall II = G1 is one of the brightest globular clusters\nbelonging to M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Our observations with HST/WFPC2 provide\ndata for the (I vs. V-I) and (V vs. V-I) color-magnitude diagrams. From model\nfitting, we determine a rather high mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = --0.95 +-\n0.09, somewhat similar to 47 Tucanae. We find a larger spread in V-I than can\nbe explained by the measurement errors, and we attribute this to an intrinsic\nmetallicity dispersion amongst the stars of G1. So far, only omega Centauri,\nthe giant Galactic globular cluster, has been known to exhibit such an\nintrinsic metallicity dispersion.\n  Three estimates of the total mass of this globular cluster can be obtained:\nKing mass = 15 x 10^6 with M/Lv ~ 7.5, Virial mass = 7.3 x 10^6 with M/Lv ~\n3.6, and King-Michie mass range from 14 to 17 x 10^6. Although uncertain, all\nof these mass estimates make G1 more than twice as massive as omega Centauri.\n  Such large masses relate to the metallicity spread whose origin is still\nunknown (either self-enrichment, an inhomogeneous proto-cluster cloud, or\nremaining core of a dwarf galaxy). When considering the positions of G1 in the\ndifferent diagrams defined by Kormendy (1985), G1 always appears on the\nsequence defined by globular clusters, and definitely away from the other\nsequences defined by elliptical galaxies, bulges, and dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies. The same is true for omega Centauri and for the nucleus of the dwarf\nelliptical NGC 205.

The second set of models is magnetohydrodynamical,\nusing an independent code framework, and examines a 200 pc cubed periodic\ndomain threaded by magnetic fields. Both of these models show broad pressure\ndistributions with roughly log-normal functional forms produced by both shocks\nand rarefaction waves, rather than the power-law distributions predicted by\nprevious work, with rather sharp thermal pressure gradients. The width of the\ndistribution of the logs of pressure in gas with log T < 3.9 is proportional to\nthe rms Mach number in that gas, while the distribution in hotter gas is\nbroader, but not so broad as would be predicted by the Mach numbers in that\ngas.

Furthermore, a\nsubstantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal equilibrium.\nOur results appear consistent with observations of interstellar pressures, and\nsuggest that the pressures observed in molecular clouds may be due to ram\npressure rather than gravitational confinement. \n\n"}

I: Conservative Mass\n  Transfer Abstract: We study the evolution of a low mass x-ray binary coupling a binary stellar\nevolution code with a general relativistic code that describes the behavior of\nthe neutron star. We assume the neutron star to be low--magnetized (B~10^8 G).\nIn the systems investigated in this paper, our computations show that during\nthe binary evolution the companion transfers as much as 1 solar mass to the\nneutron star, with an accretion rate of 10^-9 solar masses/yr. This is\nsufficient to keep the inner rim of the accretion disc in contact with the\nneutron star surface, thus preventing the onset of a propeller phase capable of\nejecting a significant fraction of the matter transferred by the companion. We\nfind that, for neutron stars governed by equations of state from soft up to\nmoderately stiff, an accretion induced collapse to a black hole is almost\nunavoidable. The collapse to a black hole can occur either during the accretion\nphase or after the end of the mass transfer when the neutron star is left in a\nsupramassive sequence. In this last case the collapse is driven by energy\nlosses of the fast spinning radio pulsar. For extremely supramassive neutron\nstars these energy losses cause a spin up. As a consequence the pulsar will\nhave a much shorter lifetime than that of a canonical radio pulsar. This\nbehavior depends on the equation of state for ultra-dense matter and therefore\ncould be used to constrain the internal structure of the neutron star. If the\nr-modes of the neutron star are excited during the accretion process, the\ngravitational waves emisson limits the maximum spin attainable by a NS to\nroughly 2 ms. In this case the collapse during the accretion phase is even more\ncommon since the maximum mass achievable before the collapse to a black hole\nduring accretion is smaller due to the limited spin frequency. \n\n"}

We find that at 90% confidence the fraction of stars with planets in\nthe two period ranges is (1/310)(1^{+1.39}_{-0.59}) for HJs and\n(1/690)(1^{+1.10}_{-0.54}) for VHJs. The HJ rate is statistically\nindistinguishable from that found in radial velocity (RV) studies. However, we\nnote that magnitude-limited RV samples are heavily biased toward metal-rich\n(hence, planet-bearing) stars, while transit surveys are not, and therefore we\nexpect that more sensitive transit surveys should find a deficit of HJs as\ncompared to RV surveys. The detection of 3 transiting VHJs, all with periods\nless than 2 days, is marginally consistent with the complete absence of such\ndetections in RV surveys. The planets detected are consistent with being\nuniformly distributed between 1.00 and 1.25 Jovian radii, but there are too few\nin the sample to map this distribution in detail. \n\n"}

The results show that the Milky Way has undergone fluctuations in the\nglobal star formation rate with amplitudes greater than a factor of 2-3 on\ntimescales less than 0.2-1 Gyr. The actual history is likely to be more bursty\nthan found here because of the smearing effect of age uncertainties. There is\nsome evidence for a slow secular increase in the star formation rate, perhaps a\nrecord of the accumulation history of our galaxy. A smooth nearly-constant star\nformation rate history is strongly ruled out, confirming the result first\ndiscovered by Barry (1988) using a smaller sample and a different age\ncalibration. This result suggests that galaxies can fluctuate coherently on\nlarge scales. \n\n"}

The sample\nprovides insight into the hitherto poorly sampled bright tail of the luminosity\nfunction, allowing to monitor its evolution with redshift up to $z\\approx 3$.\nThe slope increases significantly towards higher $z$, inconsistent with the\npredictions of pure luminosity evolution, but also with other recently proposed\nparameterisations.

The\nspace density of high-luminosity QSOs continues to increase up to the\nhigh-redshift limit of the survey, without indication of reduced evolution\nabove $z\\simeq 2$. The sample also permits an improved estimate of the local\n($z\\approx 0$) luminosity function of QSOs and bright Seyfert~1 nuclei, over\nthe luminosity range $-27\\la M_{B_J}\\la -20$.
