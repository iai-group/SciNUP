In this paper, we study the neutrino emission\nfrom early afterglows of GRBs, especially under the reverse-forward shock model\nand late prompt emission model. In the former model, the early afterglow\nemission occurs due to dissipation made by an external shock with the\ncircumburst medium (CBM). In the latter model, internal dissipation such as\ninternal shocks produces the shallow decay emission in early afterglows. We\nalso discuss implications of recent Swift observations for neutrino signals in\ndetail. Future neutrino detectors such as IceCube may detect neutrino signals\nfrom early afterglows, especially under the late prompt emission model, while\nthe detection would be difficult under the reverse-forward shock model.\nContribution to the neutrino background from the early afterglow emission may\nbe at most comparable to that from the prompt emission unless the outflow\nmaking the early afterglow emission loads more nonthermal protons, and it may\nbe important in the very high energies. Neutrino-detections are inviting\nbecause they could provide us with not only information on baryon acceleration\nbut also one of the clues to the model of early afterglows.

On average, a Milky Way-sized galaxy has 3 subhalos with\nvmax>80km/s; 7 with vmax>60km/s; and 15 with vmax>40km/s merge at redshift z>1.\nAssuming isotropic accretion, a third of these merge at an impact angle <20\ndegrees and are dragged into the disc plane by dynamical friction. Their\naccreted stars and dark matter settle into a thick disc. The stellar thick disc\nqualitatively reproduces the observed thick disc at the solar neighbourhood,\nbut is less massive by a factor ~2-10. The dark matter disc contributes 0.25-1\ntimes the halo density at the solar position. Although not likely to be\ndynamically interesting, the dark disc has important implications for the\ndirect detection of dark matter because of its low velocity with respect to the\nEarth. Higher inclination encounters (>20 degrees) are twice as likely as low\ninclination ones. These lead to structures that closely resemble the recently\ndiscovered inner/outer stellar halos.

A one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton origin of the entire SED,\nincluding the VHE gamma-ray emission can be ruled out. The VHE emission could,\nin principle, be interpreted as Compton upscattering of external radiation\n(e.g., from the broad-line regions). However, such an interpretation would\nrequire either an unusually low magnetic field of B ~ 0.03 G or an\nunrealistically high Doppler factor of Gamma ~ 140.

This is the most important energy range for absorbing $\\g$-rays from\ndistant sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts and producing electron\npositron pairs.

This technique is extended to include post-main\nsequence stars and reprocessing of starlight by dust.

Using slow-jet supernovae (SJS) as an example of such a source,\nwe study the detectability of high-energy neutrinos, paying particular\nattention to those produced from charmed-mesons.

Abstract: We have observed the hard X-ray selected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy SWIFT\nJ2127.4+5654 with Suzaku. We report the detection of a broad relativistic iron\nemission line from the inner accretion disc. By assuming that the inner edge of\nthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of the\nblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spin\na= 0.6\\pm0.2. However, a non-rotating Schwarzschild spacetime is excluded at\njust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning Kerr black hole is\nexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. The intermediate spin we measure may indicate\nthat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds through\nshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the disc\nand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. The measured steep emissivity\nindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating X-ray source to be very centrally\nconcentrated. Light bending may help focus the primary emission towards the\ninnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. On the other\nhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the hole\nrotational energy is at work. If this is the case, the interplay between\naccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction\n(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,\nunder standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.\nRotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account for\nthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral\nanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

In most models, the dark matter interacts\nweakly, but the possibility of a dark matter particle with a large cross\nsection for elastic scattering with itself has been proposed in several\ncontexts. I study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions for\nthe high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the Sun. The\nself-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within the\nSun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the Sun. This\neffect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of\ntens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in\nextreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the\ndark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v <~\n10^-27 cm^3/s. This phenomenology is interesting. First, self-capture is\nnegligible for the Earth, so dark matter self-interactions break the\ncorrespondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. Likewise,\nthe correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scattering\ncross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction. These broken\ncorrespondences may evince strong dark matter self-interactions. In some cases,\nself-capture can lead to observable indirect signals in regions of parameter\nspace where limits on dark matter-nucleon cross sections from direct detection\nwould indicate that no such signal should be observable. \n\n"}

We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

The theory gives a consistent description for all\nthe existing observational data, including the non-detection of thermal X-rays\nand the spatial correlation of the X-ray and gamma-ray emission in the remnant.\nSpecifically it is shown that an efficient production of nuclear CRs, leading\nto strong shock modification and a large downstream magnetic field strength B_d\n~140 mkG can reproduce in detail the observed synchrotron emission from radio\nto X-ray frequencies together with the gamma-ray spectral characteristics as\nobserved by the H.E.S.S. telescopes.

In such studies, it can be unclear whether evolution in the\nlow energy portion of the spectrum should be attributed to evolution in the\nsource, or instead to evolution in neutral photoelectric absorption.

This pulsar is most\nlikely associated with the bright Chandra X-ray point source lying at the\ncenter of G310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised Galactic composite supernova\nremnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and X-ray nebula, taken to be\nthe pulsar wind nebula (PWN). PSR J1400-6325 is amongst the most energetic\nrotation-powered pulsars in the Galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of Edot =\n5.1E+37 erg.s-1.

We show in this paper,\nanalytically and with one-dimensional numerical simulations, that this property\nis also shared by certain axisymmetric MRI modes in vertically-stratified\nshearing boxes. These channel flows rapidly capture significant amounts of\nmagnetic and kinetic energy, and thus are vulnerable to secondary shear\ninstabilities. We examine these parasites in the vertically stratified context,\nand estimate the maximum amplitudes that channels attain before they are\ndestroyed.

The prominence of these\nflows and their destruction place enormous demands on simulations, but channels\nin their initial stages also offer a useful check on numerical codes.

I consider here the implications of the\nheavier composition on the sources of UHECRs. The smaller magnetic rigidity\nimplies that nuclei UHECRs are: (i) More easily accelerated (ii) Local, as they\ncan diffuse only a few Mpc from their sources before disintegrating (iii)\nIsotropic, because large deflections in the extra galactic and the galactic\nmagnetic fields erase the directional information.

The two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and in\ngamma-ray data. Both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset far\nfrom the radio peak. The high dispersion measure for PSR J0248+6021 (DM = 370\npc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant HII region W5\nin the Perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the Galaxy as\nobtained from models of average electron distributions.

When can these\neffects be parametrised in an effective description in terms of quasiparticles?\nAnd what is the kinematic role of their thermal masses? We address these\nquestions in the framework of nonequilibrium quantum field theory and develop\nan intuitive picture in which contributions from higher order processes are\nparametrised by the widths of resonances in the plasma. In the narrow width\nlimit we recover the quasiparticle picture, with the additional processes\ngiving rise to off-shell parts of quasiparticle propagators that appear to\nviolate energy conservation. In this regime we give analytic expressions for\nthe scalar and fermion nonequilibrium propagators in a medium. We compare the\nefficiency of decays and scatterings involving real quasiparticles, computed\nfrom analytic expressions for the relaxation rates via trilinear scalar and\nYukawa interactions for all modes, to off-shell contributions and find that the\nlatter can be significant even for moderate widths. Our results apply to\nvarious processes including thermal production of particles from a plasma,\ndissipation of fields in a medium and particle propagation in dense matter.

We find the\noptical/IR time variability properties of these blazars to be remarkably\nsimilar to those at the gamma-ray energies. The power spectral density (PSD)\nfunctions of the R-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple\npower-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude\nvariability on longer timescales. No clear break is identified in the PSD of\nany of the sources. The average slope of the PSD of R-band variability of these\nblazars is similar to what was found by the Fermi team for the gamma-ray\nvariability of a larger sample of bright blazars. This is consistent with\nleptonic models where the optical-IR and gamma-ray emission is generated by the\nsame population of electrons through synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes,\nrespectively. The prominent flares present in the optical-IR as well as the\ngamma-ray light curves of these blazars are predominantly symmetric, i.e., have\nsimilar rise and decay timescales, indicating that the long-term variability is\ndominated by the crossing time of radiation or a disturbance through the\nemission region rather than by the acceleration or energy-loss timescales of\nthe radiating electrons.

These sources, powered by outflows from\nan AGN, allow the beam power and total outflow energy to be studied.

While galactic supernovae can be\nresolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains\nunconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to\nsupernova core collapse models.\n  The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect\nsupernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and\ntime. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented\ndetector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume\nfor such coincidental hits is much smaller ($\\gtrsim 35\\,$kton, about the scale\nof SuperK), a wealth of information is obtained due to the comparatively low\ncoincidental noise rate.

Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a jet\npointing at small angles towards the observer. The overall emitted spectrum is\ntypically non-thermal, and in some cases the emission and/or absorption lines\nare so faint as to prevent the determination of the redshift based on optical\nspectroscopy methods. PKS 0447-439 is a bright blazar recently detected at very\nhigh energy. The redshift of the source is still disputed: a recent spectral\nanalysis reports only a lower limit of z > 1.246, which contradicts the\nprevious measure of z = 0.205 reported in the literature. Aims. We aim to give\na redshift estimate of the blazar PKS 0447-439 based on combined GeV\n(Fermi/LAT) and TeV (H.E.S.S.) observations. Methods. Taking into account the\nabsorption of TeV photons by the interaction with the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL), we applied the method we developed in a previous work to derive\nthe redshift of PKS 0447-439. Moreover, we compiled the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) using optical-UV, soft X-ray, and -ray data, nearly\nsimultaneous to the H.E.S.S. observations at TeV energies. Finally we modelled\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) within the framework of a homogeneous,\nleptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Results. Using the recent TeV\nspectrum measured by H.E.S.S. we obtain for PKS 0447-439 a redshift of zrec =\n0.20 \\pm 0.05, which is our estimate on the source distance. This value agrees\nvery well with the value reported in the literature and confirms that our\nmethod can be successfully used to constrain blazars distances. Assuming this\ndistance, the SED can be well fitted with the above mentioned model. The\nphysical parameters that we find suggest a strongly matter-dominated jet.\nConclusions. Our analysis confirms that the redshift of PKS 0447-439 is likely\n0.2, and supports the result present in the literature. \n\n"}

We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark\nmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of\nhalos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction. The\nmain characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density\nwithin the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up\nto ~ 3-4 at M_vir = 10^{12} M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean\nof <alpha> ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of\nrms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10^{13-14} M_solar steeper\nthan the NFW profile (alpha=1).

Among 8 single-pulse long GRBs, 5 show\nhard-to-soft evolution, while 3 show intensity-tracking. The multi-pulse long\nGRBs have more complicated patterns. Among the GRBs whose time-resolved\nspectrum is available for the first pulse, almost half (15/32 GRBs) show clear\nhard-to-soft evolution, and the other half (17/32 GRBs) show clear\nintensity-tracking. Later pulses typically show the tracking behavior, although\na hard-to-soft evolution pattern was identified in the 2nd pulse of 2 GRBs\nwhose pulses are well separated.

Short GRBs have $E_{\\rm p}$ tracking\nintensity exclusively with the 16ms time resolution analysis.

We suggest that the GRB prompt emission is\nmainly a result of two upscattering processes. The first process is the\nComptonization of relatively cold soft photons of the star off electrons of a\nhot shell of plasma of temperature T_e of the order of 10^{9} K (or kT_e~100\nkeV) that moves sub-relativistically with the bulk velocity V_b substantially\nless than the speed of light c. In this phase, the Comptonization parameter Y\nis high and the interaction between a blackbody-like soft seed photon\npopulation and hot electrons leads to formation of a saturated Comptonization\nspectrum modified by the sub-relativistic bulk outflow. The second process is\nan upscattering of the previously Comptonized spectrum by the plasma outflow\nonce it becomes relativistic. This process gives rise to the high-energy\npower-law component above the peak in the EF(E)-diagram where F(E) is the\nenergy flux. The latter process can be described by a convolution of the\nComptonized spectrum with a broken-power-law Green function.

The optical light curve of some SNe may be powered by the outward\ndiffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock in optically thick\ncircumstellar matter (CSM). Recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediated\nand -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into a\ncollisionless shock and can produce hard X-rays. The X-rays are expected to\npeak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. Here we report on a\nsearch, using Swift and Chandra, for X-ray emission from 28 SNe that belong to\nclasses whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense CSM\n(IIn/Ibn/SLSN-I). Two SNe in our sample have X-ray properties that are roughly\nconsistent with the expectation for X-rays from a collisionless shock in\noptically thick CSM. Therefore, we suggest that their optical light curves are\npowered by shock breakout in CSM. We show that two other events were too X-ray\nbright during the SN maximum optical light to be explained by the shock\nbreakout model. We conclude that the light curves of some, but not all,\ntype-IIn/Ibn SNe are powered by shock breakout in CSM. For the rest of the SNe\nin our sample, including all the SLSN-I events, our X-ray limits are not deep\nenough and were typically obtained at too early times to conclude about their\nnature. We argue that the optical light curves of SNe, for which the X-ray\nemission peaks at late times, are likely powered by the diffusion of shock\nenergy from a dense CSM. We comment about the possibility to detect some of\nthese events in radio. \n\n"}

Optimistically,\nthe presence of dark matter substructures in galaxy clusters is predicted to\nenhance the signal by 2-3 orders of magnitude over the contribution from the\nsmooth component of the dark matter distribution. Optimizing for the angular\nsize of the region of interest for galaxy clusters, the sensitivity to the\nannihilation cross section of heavy DM with mass in the range 300 GeV - 100 TeV\nwill be of the order of 10^{-24} cm^3 s^{-1}, for full IceCube/KM3NeT live time\nof 10 years, which is about one order of magnitude better than the best limit\nthat can be obtained by observing the Milky Way halo.

Using a\nphysical-evolution model for blazars with a luminosity dependent evolution\n(LDDE) and an observationally-determined luminosity-dependent blazar spectral\nenergy distribution (SED), we find that blazars can account for the observed\nanisotropy of the DGRB consistent with their observed source-count\ndistribution, but are in turn constrained in contributing significantly to the\nobserved DGRB intensity.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$.

In this work, we\ninvestigate 14-195 keV spectra from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)\nall-sky survey for evidence of non-thermal excess emission above the\nexponentially decreasing tail of thermal emission in the flux-limited HIFLUGCS\nsample. To account for the thermal contribution at BAT energies, XMM-Newton\nEPIC spectra are extracted from coincident spatial regions so that both thermal\nand non-thermal spectral components can be determined simultaneously. We find\nmarginally significant IC components in six clusters, though after closer\ninspection and consideration of systematic errors we are unable to claim a\nclear detection in any of them. The spectra of all clusters are also summed to\nenhance a cumulative non-thermal signal not quite detectable in individual\nclusters. After constructing a model based on single-temperature fits to the\nXMM-Newton data alone, we see no significant excess emission above that\npredicted by the thermal model determined at soft energies.

Both antennas are equipped with cosmic ray shower\ndetectors: signals in the bar due to showers are continuously detected and used\nto characterize the antenna performances. The bar excitation mechanism is based\non the so called thermo-acoustic effect, studied on dedicated experiments that\nuse particle beams. This mechanism predicts that vibrations of bars are induced\nby the heat deposited in the bar from the particle.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\\gamma}$ depend weakly on the\nassumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current\nexperimental bounds on these quantities. We apply this method and ALP\nparameters found from fitting 3C454.3 data to another flat-spectrum radio\nquasar PKS1222+216 (4C+21.35) data up to 400 GeV, as a consistency check, and\nfound good fit.

As has been\nnoted previously, an incorrect assumption about the helium abundance will lead\nto an error in the iron abundance determined from X-ray spectroscopy.

An\nincorrectly assumed helium abundance will also lead to a systematic error in\nangular distance measurements based on X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)\nobservations of clusters of galaxies. Its magnitude is further amplified by the\nassociated error in the metal abundance determination, the impact being larger\nat lower ICM temperatures. Overall, a factor of 2-5 error in the helium\nabundance will lead to an ~ 10-25 % error in the angular distance.\n  We solve the full set of Burgers equations for a multi-component intracluster\nplasma to determine the maximal effect of diffusion on the interpretation of\nX-ray and microwave observations of clusters of galaxies.

For the fiducial case\nof a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we find that CTA will be able to probe\nannihilation cross sections well below the canonical thermal relic value for\ndark matter masses from a few tens of GeV up to $\\sim 5$ TeV for annihilation\nto $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, and will achieve only a slightly weaker sensitivity for\nannihilation to $b\\bar{b}$ or $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$.

Here we show that\nthe lifetime of the merger remnant may be directly imprinted in the\nradioactively powered kilonova emission following the merger. We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta. When BH formation is relatively\nprompt (~ 100 ms), outflows from the disk are sufficiently neutron rich to form\nheavy r-process elements, resulting in ~ week-long emission with a spectral\npeak in the near-infrared (NIR), similar to that produced by the dynamical\nejecta.

The\nsimilar behavior of the optical and X-ray light curves suggests that they maybe\nhave a common origin. The long plateau starts from several hundred seconds and\nends at tens of thousands seconds. The peak time of the late rebrightening is\nabout 30000 s.

We especially study the influence of the injection starting\ntime, ending time, stellar wind density (or density of the circumburst\nenvironment), and injection luminosity on the shape of the afterglow light\ncurves, respectively. We find that the light curve is largely affected by the\nparameters in the wind model. There is a \"bump\" at the late time only in the\nwind model too. In the wind case, it is interesting that the longer the energy\ninjected, the more obvious the rebrightening will be. We also find the peak\ntime of bump is determined by the stellar wind density.

The\nacceleration in the shocks, which is an unavoidable consequence of the\nefficient proton acceleration, requires efficient transport from the radiation\nback to the acceleration zone. On the other hand, stochastic acceleration in\nthe radiation zone can enhance the secondary spectra of muons and kaons\nsignificantly if there is a sufficiently large turbulent region.

In this picture, the detection\nof emission and/or absorption features is directly correlated to the\ninclination of the system.

Corrections,\nbased on the polarization of broad emission lines, are applied to the sample of\nSeyfert-2 AGN to remove dilution by starburst light and derive information\nabout the scattered continuum alone. The resulting compendium agrees with past\nempirical results, i.e. type-1 AGN show low polarization degrees (P < 1%)\npredominantly associated with a polarization position angle parallel to the\nprojected radio axis of the system, while type-2 objects show stronger\npolarization percentages (P > 7%) with perpendicular polarization angles. The\ntransition between type-1 and type-2 inclination occurs between 45 and 60\ndegrees without noticeable impact on P.

We show that these peculiar\nobservations can be explained independently of ongoing central engine activity\nif some sGRB progenitors are compact binaries hosting at least one pulsar. The\nPoynting flux emanating from the pulsar companion can excavate a bow-shock\ncavity surround- ing the binary. If this cavity is larger than the shock\ndeceleration length scale in the undisturbed interstellar medium, then the\nonset of the afterglow will be delayed.

We\nidentify two types of pulsar that can achieve the conditions necessary for\naltering the afterglow: low field, long lived pulsars, and high field pulsars.\nWe find that a sizable fraction (~20-50%) of low field pulsars are likely to\nreside in neutron star binaries based on observations, while their high field\ncounterparts are not. Hydrodynamical calculations motivated by this model are\nshown to be in good agreement with observations of sGRB afterglow lightcurves. \n\n"}

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents.

For the absolute orientation of the\nelectric vector position angles (EVPA) we used the D-terms method. We also used\ngamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope on weekly time bins\nthroughout 2011. The source shows polarized emission, and its properties vary\nwith time, frequency, and location along the jet. The core mean polarization\nfraction is generally between 1% and 2%, with a 4% peak at 43 GHz in March; the\npolarization angle is variable, mainly at 15 GHz, where it changes frequently,\nand less so at 43 GHz, where it oscillates in the range 114 - 173 deg. The jet\npolarization properties are more stable, with a fractional polarization of\naround 16% and a polarization angle nearly perpendicular to the jet axis. The\naverage flux and photon index at gamma-ray energies are (17.7+-0.5)x10^8 ph\ncm^-2 s^-1 and the photon index is 1.77+-0.02. The gamma-ray light curve shows\nvariability, with a main peak that appears to be associated with the peak in\nthe core polarized emission at 43 GHz, as well as with the total intensity\nlight curve.

However, EW-based\nclassification criteria are not physically motivated, and a few blazars have\npreviously 'transitioned' from one subclass to the other. We present the first\nsystematic search for these transition blazars in a sample of 602 unique pairs\nof repeat spectra of 354 blazars in SDSS, finding six clear cases. These\ntransition blazars have bolometric Eddington ratios of ~0.3 and low-frequency\nsynchrotron peaks, and are thus FSRQ-like. We show that the strong EW\nvariability (up to an unprecedented factor of >60) is due to swamping of the\nBELs from variability in jet continuum emission, which is stronger in amplitude\nand shorter in timescale than typical blazars. Although these transition\nblazars appear to switch between FSRQ and BLL according to the\nphenomenologically-based EW scheme, we show that they are most likely rare\ncases of FSRQs with radiatively efficient accretion flows and especially\nstrongly-beamed jets.

In earlier work, it has been\nsuggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the\nmagnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines\nanchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles\nand produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity\nAGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation\nbetween the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$\norders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but\nalso their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast\nreconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the\ncore region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model\nis able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the\nother hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend\nas that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray\nemission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another\npopulation of relativistic particles, as expected. \n\n"}

Raw count maps show a superposition\nof diffuse and point-like emission structures and are subject to shot noise and\ninstrumental artifacts. Using the D3PO inference algorithm, we model the\nobserved photon counts as the sum of a diffuse and a point-like photon flux,\nconvolved with the instrumental beam and subject to Poissonian shot noise. D3PO\nperforms a Bayesian inference in this setting without the use of spatial or\nspectral templates;i.e., it removes the shot noise, deconvolves the\ninstrumental response, and yields estimates for the two flux components\nseparately. The non-parametric reconstruction uncovers the morphology of the\ndiffuse photon flux up to several hundred GeV. We present an all-sky spectral\nindex map for the diffuse component.

Likewise, quasiperiodic\nvariability has been observed in several sources. Such measurements commonly\nmake the assumption that black holes are described by the Kerr metric, which\naccording to the no-hair theorem characterizes black holes uniquely in terms of\ntheir masses and spins. This fundamental property of black holes can be tested\nobservationally by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric\nintroduced by a parametrically deformed Kerr-like spacetime. Thermal spectra,\niron lines, and variability have already been studied extensively in several\nsuch metrics, which usually depend on only one particular type of deviation or\ncontain unphysical regions outside of the compact object.

We assume that the energy for\nre-acceleration in the halo is supplied by shocks generated by processes of\nstar accretion onto the central black hole. Numerical simulations show that\nregions with strong turbulence (places for electron re-acceleration) are\nlocated high up in the Galactic Halo about several kpc above the disk. The\nenergy of SNR electrons that reach these regions does not exceed several GeV\nbecause of synchrotron and inverse Compton energy losses.

At restframe g-band\n(4722A), we find a distribution of fast rise-times with median of (7.5+/-0.3)\ndays. Comparing these durations with analytical shock models of Rabinak and\nWaxman (2013); Nakar and Sari (2010) and hydrodynamical models of Tominaga et\nal.

It reviews broad\nclasses of dark matter candidates that result in detectable cosmic-ray\nantideuteron fluxes, as well as the status and prospects of current\nexperimental searches. The coalescence model of antideuteron production and the\ninfluence of antideuteron measurements at particle colliders are discussed.\nThis is followed by a review of the modeling of antideuteron propagation\nthrough the magnetic fields, plasma currents, and molecular material of our\nGalaxy, the solar system, the Earth's geomagnetic field, and the atmosphere.\nFinally, the three ongoing or planned experiments that are sensitive to\ncosmic-ray antideuterons, BESS, AMS-02, and GAPS, are detailed.

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate. These three-hair relations were found to hold in neutron stars that\nrotate rigidly, as is the case in old pulsars, but neutron stars can also\nrotate differentially, as is the case for proto-neutron stars and hypermassive\ntransient remnants of binary mergers. We here extend the three-hair relations\nto differentially rotating stars for the first time with a generic rotation law\nusing two approximations: a weak-field scheme (an expansion in powers of the\nneutron star compactness) and a perturbative differential rotation scheme (an\nexpansion about rigid rotation). These approximations allow us to analytically\nderive approximately universal relations that allow us to determine all of the\nmultipole moments of a (perturbative) differentially rotating star in terms of\nonly the first four moments. These new four-hair relations for differentially\nrotating neutron stars are found to be approximately independent of the\nequation of state to a higher degree than the three-hair relations for\nuniformly rotating stars. Our results can be instrumental in the development of\nfour-hair relations for rapidly differentially rotating stars in full General\nRelativity using numerical simulations. \n\n"}

This missing\ngalactic feedback problem is extremely prominent in early-type galaxy bulges\nwhere there is little cool gas to make the SNe ejecta radiate at lower\ntemperature beyond the X-ray domain. We herein present a deep Suzaku\nobservation of an S0 galaxy NGC5866, which is relatively rich in molecular gas\nas an S0 galaxy and shows significant evidence of cool-hot gas interaction. By\njointly analyzing the Suzaku and an archival Chandra data, we measure the Fe/O\nabundance ratio to be $7.63_{-5.52}^{+7.28}$ relative to solar values. This\nabundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among\nthe highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies. NGC5866 also simultaneously has\nthe highest Fe/O abundance ratio and molecular gas mass among a small sample of\ngas-poor early-type galaxies. An estimation of the Fe budget indicates that\nNGC5866 could preserve a larger than usual fraction, but far from the total\namount of Fe injected by Type Ia SNe. We also find that the hot gas temperature\nincreases from inner to outer halos, with the inner halo has a temperature of\n~0.25keV, clearly lower than that expected from Type Ia SNe heating.

We take the first steps towards a more realistic description\nof cosmic ray diffusion for such simulations, obtaining direct estimates of the\ndiffusion tensor from test particle simulations in random magnetic fields (with\nthe Larmor radius scale being fully resolved), for a range of particle energies\ncorresponding to $10^{-2}\\lesssim R_L/l_c \\lesssim 10^{3}$, where $l_c$ is the\nmagnetic correlation length. We obtain explicit expressions for the cosmic ray\ndiffusion tensor for $R_L/l_c \\ll 1$, that might be used in a sub-grid model of\ncosmic ray diffusion. The diffusion coefficients obtained are closely connected\nwith existing transport theories that include the random walk of magnetic\nlines. \n\n"}

Such an early switch-on time suggests a\ncombination of a very high velocity outflow and low ejected mass and, together\nwith the high effective temperature reached by the super-soft emission, a high\nmass white dwarf (>1.3 M_sun). The X-ray spectral evolution was followed from\nan early epoch where shocked emission was evident, through the entirety of the\nsuper-soft phase, showing evolving column density, emission lines, absorption\nedges and thermal continuum temperature.

[1], and a second method was later proposed by\nGross and Vitells [2] in the context of the \"look elsewhere effect\" and trial\nfactors. We show that, for relatively small sample sizes, the former leads to\nan artificial inflation of statistical power that stems from an increase in the\nfalse detection rate, whereas the two methods exhibit similar performance for\nlarge sample sizes. We apply the methods to realistic simulations of the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope data, in particular the search for dark matter\nannihilation lines. Further, we discuss the counter-intutive scenario where the\nlook-elsewhere corrections are more conservative than much more computationally\nefficient corrections for multiple hypothesis testing. Finally, we provide\ngeneral guidelines for navigating the tradeoffs between statistical and\ncomputational efficiency when selecting a statistical procedure for signal\ndetection. \n\n"}

This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where\nthe drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse\nprofile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population.\nVarious tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of\nperiodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and\npolarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the\nradio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the\nfluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly\ndemonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a\ncompletely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be\ndetermined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint\non the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission\nmodes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being\npresent only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation\ncycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for\nthe bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that\nthe variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking\nimplies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.\nPhase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically\nproposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown\nto be implausible. It is argued that within the framework of circulating\nbeamlets, bi-drifting could occur if the circulation were severely distorted,\npossibly by distortions in the magnetic field. \n\n"}

Then, the ejecta from AIC collide to the dense circumstellar\nmedium, making a strong shock. The strong shock can produce synchrotron\nemission which can be observed in radio frequencies.

The tMSPs have raised\nseveral questions related to the nature of accretion flow in their LMXB state\nand the mechanism that causes the state switch. The discovery of coherent X-ray\npulsations from PSR J1023+0038 (while in the LMXB state) provides us with the\nfirst opportunity to perform timing observations and to compare the neutron\nstar's spin variation during this state to the measured spin-down in the RMSP\nstate. Whereas the X-ray pulsations in the LMXB state likely indicate that some\nmaterial is accreting onto the neutron star's magnetic polar caps, radio\ncontinuum observations indicate the presence of an outflow. The fraction of the\ninflowing material being ejected is not clear, but it may be much larger than\nthat reaching the neutron star's surface. Timing observations can measure the\ntotal torque on the neutron star. We have phase-connected nine XMM-Newton\nobservations of PSR J1023+0038 over the last 2.5 years of the LMXB state to\nestablish a precise measurement of spin evolution. We find that the average\nspin-down rate as an LMXB is 26.8+/-0.4% faster than the rate (-2.39x10^-15 Hz\ns-1) determined during the RMSP state. This shows that negative angular\nmomentum contributions (dipolar magnetic braking and outflow) exceed positive\nones (accreted material), and suggests that the pulsar wind continues to\noperate at a largely unmodified level. We discuss implications of this tight\nobservational constraint in the context of possible accretion models. \n\n"}

We want to quantitatively establish that the 60Fe\nenhancement is the result of several supernovae which are also responsible for\nthe formation of the Local Bubble, our Galactic habitat. We performed\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations (with\nresolutions down to subparsec scale) of the Local Bubble and the neighbouring\nLoop I superbubble in different homogeneous, self-gravitating environments. For\nsetting up the Local and Loop I superbubble, we took into account the time\nsequence and locations of the generating core-collapse supernova explosions,\nwhich were derived from the mass spectrum of the perished members of certain\nstellar moving groups. The release of 60Fe and its subsequent turbulent mixing\nprocess inside the superbubble cavities was followed via passive scalars, where\nthe yields of the decaying radioisotope were adjusted according to recent\nstellar evolution calculations.

By preventing the formation of\nhighly elongated reconnection layers, it is crucial in enabling the rapid\nenergy conversion rates that are characteristic of many astrophysical\nphenomena. Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet is disrupted\nand fast reconnection can occur. The scaling laws of the plasmoid instability\nare \\emph{not} simple power laws, and depend on the Lundquist number ($S$), the\nmagnetic Prandtl number ($P_m$), the noise of the system ($\\psi_0$), the\ncharacteristic rate of current sheet evolution ($1/\\tau$), as well as the\nthinning process.

Assuming that\nthe event is a binary neutron star merger, we argue that blueness and\nbrightness of the light curve is the result of ejecta that contains an\nsubstantial amount of thermal energy. To achieve this, the ejecta must be\nreheated at a substantial distance (1 to 2000 solar radii) from the merger to\navoid losing the energy to adiabatic cooling. We show that this reheating can\noccur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star\nhas evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner\nbinary, forming a circumbinary disc, driving the inner binary to merge. Because\nthe outer star fills its Roche lobe, a substantial fraction of the dynamical\nejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process. We\nsuggest that the process of mass transfer in heirarchical triples tends to form\ncoplanar triple systems such as PSR J0337+1715, and may provide electromagnetic\ncounterparts to binary black hole mergers. \n\n"}

One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds. Second, we study the I-Q and Q-Love relations in this\ntheory by constructing slowly-rotating neutron star solutions to quadratic\norder in spin. We find that the approximate universality continues to hold in\ndynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and in fact, it becomes stronger than in\nGeneral Relativity, although its existence depends on the normalization of the\ndimensional coupling constant of the theory.

Here we present the first systematic\ncomparison of various recovery schemes used in different dynamical spacetime\nGRMHD codes for both analytic and tabulated microphysical EOSs. We assess the\nschemes in terms of (i) speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. We find\nlarge variations among the different schemes and that there is not a single\nideal scheme. While the computationally most efficient schemes are less robust,\nthe most robust schemes are computationally less efficient. More robust schemes\nmay require an order of magnitude more calls to the EOS, which are\ncomputationally expensive. We propose an optimal strategy of an efficient\nthree-dimensional Newton-Raphson scheme and a slower but more robust\none-dimensional scheme as a fall-back. \n\n"}

SENR provides the algorithmic framework that\ncombines the C codes generated by NRPy+ into a functioning numerical relativity\ncode. We validate against two other established, state-of-the-art codes, and\nachieve excellent agreement.

The fact\nthat the echo frequency is suppressed by $\\log M$ (in Planck units) puts it\nsquarely in the LIGO sensitivity window, allowing us to build an optimal\nmodel-agnostic search strategy via cross-correlating the two detectors in\nfrequency/time. We find a tentative detection of echoes at $f_{\\rm echo} \\simeq\n72$ Hz, around 1.0 sec after the BNS merger, consistent with a 2.6-2.7\n$M_\\odot$ \"black hole\" remnant with dimensionless spin $0.84-0.87$. Accounting\nfor all the \"look-elsewhere\" effects, we find a significance of $4.2 \\sigma$,\nor a false alarm probability of $1.6\\times 10^{-5}$, i.e. a similar\ncross-correlation within the expected frequency/time window after the merger\ncannot be found more than 4 times in 3 days. If confirmed, this finding will\nhave significant consequences for both physics of quantum black holes and\nastrophysics of binary neutron star mergers [Note added: This result is\nindependently confirmed by arXiv:1901.04138, who use the electromagnetic\nobservations to infer $t_{\\rm coll}=0.98^{+0.31}_{-0.26}$ sec for black hole\nformation]. \n\n"}

The post-peak optical light curves show a long,\nlinear decline with a steep slope of 2.5 mag/100 days (i.e., an exponential\ndecline in flux), through the end of observations at phase ~260 days.

The\nspectra of ASASSN-15nx do not exhibit the narrow emission-line features\ncharacteristic of Type IIn SNe, which can have a wide variety of light-curve\nshapes usually attributed to strong interactions with a dense circumstellar\nmedium (CSM).

Decay of a large amount of Ni56 (M_Ni56 =\n1.6 +/- 0.2 M_sun) can power the light curve of ASASSN-15nx, and the steep\nlight-curve slope requires substantial gamma-ray escape from the ejecta, which\nis possible given a low-mass hydrogen envelope for the progenitor.

Abstract: The groundbreaking discovery of the optical transient AT2017gfo associated\nwith GW170817 opens a unique opportunity to study the physics of double neutron\nstar (NS) mergers. We argue that the standard interpretation of AT2017gfo as\nbeing powered by radioactive decays of r-process elements faces the challenge\nof simultaneously accounting for the peak luminosity and peak time of the\nevent, as it is not easy to achieve the required high mass, and especially the\nlow opacity of the ejecta required to fit the data. A plausible solution would\nbe to invoke an additional energy source, which is probably provided by the\nmerger product. We consider energy injection from two types of the merger\nproducts: (1) a post-merger black hole powered by fallback accretion; and (2) a\nlong-lived NS remnant. The former case can only account for the early emission\nof AT2017gfo, with the late emission still powered by radioactive decay. In the\nlatter case, both early- and late-emission components can be well interpreted\nas due to energy injection from a spinning-down NS, with the required mass and\nopacity of the ejecta components well consistent with known numerical\nsimulation results.

In the binary star system of a white dwarf (WD) and\nits non-degenerate companion star, the WD accretes either H-rich matter or He\nand undergoes H and He shell-burning. We summarize how such shell-burning\ndepend on the accretion rate and the WD mass and how the WD blows strong wind.\nWe identify the following evolutionary routes for the accreting WD to trigger a\nthermonuclear explosion. With a decreasing rate with time, 5 phases are\nobserved: 1. The WD increases its mass by stable H burning and blows a strong\nwind, which strips a part of the companion star's envelope to control the\naccretion rate and forms circumstellar matter (CSM). The WD may explode within\nCSM as an \"SN Ia-CSM\". 2. The wind stops and an SN Ia is triggered under\nsteady-stable H shell-burning, which is observed as a super-soft X-ray source:\n\"SN Ia-SSXS\". 3. H shell-burning becomes unstable and many flashes recur. The\nWD undergoes recurrent nova (RN) whose mass ejection is smaller than the\naccreted matter, evolving to an \"SN Ia-RN\". 4. If the companion is a He star or\nWD, the accretion of He can trigger He and C double detonations at the\nsub-Chandrasekhar (sub-Chand) mass or the WD grows to the Chand mass while\nproducing and He-wind: \"SN Ia-He CSM\". 5. If the accreting WD rotates rapidly,\ndelayed trigger of an SN Ia beyond standard Chand mass can happen. The\n(super-Chand) WD contracts to become a delayed SN Ia after losing angular\nmomentum. The companion star has become a He WD and CSM has disappeared: \"SN\nIa-He WD\".

Recent observations of unexpected structures in the Galactic Cosmic\nRay (GCR) spectrum and composition, as well as growing evidence for episodes of\nintense dynamical activity in the inner regions of the Galaxy, call for an\nevaluation of the high-energy particle acceleration associated with such\nactivity and its potential impact on the global GCR phenomenology.\n  Aims. We investigate whether particles accelerated during high-power episodes\naround the Galactic center can account for a significant fraction of the\nobserved GCRs, or conversely what constraints can be derived regarding their\nGalactic transport if their contributions are negligible.\n  Methods. We address these questions by studying the contribution of a\ncontinuous source of energetic particles at the Galactic center to the local\nGCRs. Particle transport in the Galaxy is described with a two-zone analytical\nmodel. We solve for the contribution of a Galactic Center Cosmic-Ray (GCCR)\nsource using Green functions and Bessel expansion, and discuss the required\ninjection power for these GCCRs to influence the global GCR phenomenology at\nEarth.\n  Results. We find that, with standard parameters for particle propagation in\nthe galactic disk and halo, the GCCRs can make a significant or even dominant\ncontribution to the total CR flux observed at Earth. Depending on the\nparameters, such a source can account for both the observed proton flux and\nB-to-C ratio (in the case of a Kraichnan-like scaling of the diffusion\ncoefficient), or potentially produce spectral and composition features.\n  Conclusions. Our results show that the contribution of GCCRs cannot be\nneglected a priori, and that they can influence the global GCR phenomenology\nsignificantly, thereby calling for a reassessement of the standard inferences\nfrom a scenario where GCRs are entirely dominated by a single type of sources\ndistributed throughout the Galactic disk. \n\n"}

It is generally\nparameterized phenomenologically, but it can also be predicted from theoretical\nmodels of irradiated discs and their coronae/winds. We test these models using\nfive multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and quasi simultaneous Rossi\nX-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) datasets from the black-hole binary XTE\nJ1859$+$226.

It is caused by an asymmetry between the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions, which can be maintained at high energies when the\nchirality flipping rate can be neglected, for example in the early Universe.\nThe inclusion of the CME in the Maxwell equations leads to a modified set of\nMHD equations. We discuss how the CME is implemented in the PENCIL CODE. The\nCME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since it results in a\ndynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation.\nThis term is formally similar to the $\\alpha$ effect in classical mean-field\nMHD. However, the chiral dynamo can operate without turbulence and is\nassociated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case of the early\nUniverse, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius. A chiral $\\alpha_\\mu$\neffect has also been identified in mean-field theory. It occurs in the presence\nof turbulence but is not related to kinetic helicity. Depending on the plasma\nparameters, chiral dynamo instabilities can amplify magnetic fields over many\norders of magnitude. These instabilities can affect the propagation of MHD\nwaves, which is demonstrated by our DNS. We also study the coupling between the\nevolution of the chiral chemical potential and the ordinary chemical potential,\nwhich is proportional to the sum of the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions. An important consequence of this coupling is the\nemergence of chiral magnetic waves (CMWs). We confirm numerically that linear\nCMWs and MHD waves are not interacting. Our simulations suggest that the\nchemical potential has only a minor effect on the non-linear evolution of the\nchiral dynamo. \n\n"}

In this work, a sample of\ncontained neutrino interactions in IceCube is obtained from 5 years of data and\nclassified as 2650 tracks and 965 cascades.

After the star collapses, a\nstellar-mass black hole (BH) is formed, surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk\nwith outflows.

Furthermore, $\\rm ^{56}Ni$\nsynthesis should occur in the strong outflows from the accretion disk. The\ndecay of $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ is considered to be the possible origin of SN bumps in\nthe subsequent optical afterglows of LGRBs.

To do this, we first\nsummarise the observational evidence for the value of the dimensionless\naccretion disc viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, defined by Shakura & Sunyaev\n(1973, 1976). We find that, for fully ionized discs, the value of $\\alpha$ is\nreadily amenable to reliable estimation and that the observations are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that $\\alpha \\sim 0.2 - 0.3$. In contrast in\ndiscs that are not fully ionized, estimates of the value of $\\alpha$ are\ngenerally less direct and the values obtained are generally $ < 0.01$ and often\n$ \\ll 0.01$. We conclude that this gives us crucial information about the\nnature of viscosity in accretion discs. First, in fully ionized discs the\nstrength of the turbulence is always limited by being at most trans-sonic. This\nimplies that it is necessary that credible models of the turbulence reflect\nthis fact. Second, the smaller values of $\\alpha$ found for less ionized, and\ntherefore less strongly conducting, discs imply that magnetism plays a dominant\nrole.

The logarithmic slope of the\nspherically-averaged density profile, as measured by beta=-dln(rho)/dln(r),\ndecreases monotonically towards the center and becomes shallower than\nisothermal (beta<2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}. Although the\nfitting formula proposed by NFW provides a reasonably good approximation to the\ndensity and circular velocity profiles of individual halos, systematic\ndeviations from the best NFW fits are also noticeable. Inside r_{-2}, the\nprofile of simulated halos gets shallower with radius more gradually than\npredicted and, as a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the dark matter\ndensity in these regions.

The extra dimensional unification\nincludes 5D and 6D and universal extra dimensional (UED) models, and models\nbased on warped geometry. Proton stability in a wide array of string theory and\nM theory models is reviewed. These include Calabi-Yau models, grand unified\nmodels with Kac-Moody levels $k>1$, a new class of heterotic string models,\nmodels based on intersecting D branes, and string landscape models. The\ndestabilizing effect of quantum gravity on the proton is discussed. The\npossibility of testing grand unified models, models based on extra dimensions\nand string-M-theory models via their distinctive modes is investigated. The\nproposed next generation proton decay experiments, HyperK, UNO, MEMPHYS,\nICARUS, LANNDD (DUSEL), and LENA would shed significant light on the nature of\nunification complementary to the physics at the LHC. Mathematical tools for the\ncomputation of proton lifetime are given in the appendices. Prospects for the\nfuture are discussed. \n\n"}

The objective is to provide as accurate as possible a representation\nof event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the\nStandard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a role,\ndirectly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced.\nThe physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description;\ninstead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and\nvarious QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such\nas hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying\nevents and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore,\nextensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and\nfunctions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data. This should\nallow the user to tailor the generation task to the topics of interest. \n\n"}
