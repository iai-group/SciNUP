The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

III:\n  Results for the 2002--2007 data-taking period Abstract: The Russian-American experiment SAGE began to measure the solar neutrino\ncapture rate with a target of gallium metal in Dec. 1989. Measurements have\ncontinued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the\nexperimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.\n2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test\nof SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for\nneutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been\noverestimated. If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard\nsolar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga\nin the range of 63-66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4%, in good agreement\nwith experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in\nthe Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be (6.0 +/- 0.8) x\n10^(10)/(cm^2 s), which agrees well with the pp flux predicted by the standard\nsolar model.

Below a cutoff energy, the flux is\nexpected to have a universal power-law form with an index n ~ -2. The cutoff\nenergy and the behavior of the flux near the cutoff is model dependent.

We argue there is a very well motivated theoretical preexisting\nframework consistent with dark matter annihilation being observed by the PAMELA\nsatellite detector. The dark matter is (mainly) the neutral W boson\nsuperpartner, the wino with mass below 200 GeV. Using the program GALPROP we\nstudy the annihilation products and backgrounds together. Antimatter and gammas\nfrom annihilating winos contribute below this energy. We explain why PAMELA\ndata does not imply no antiproton signal was observed by PAMELA or earlier\nexperiments, and explain why the antiproton analysis was misunderstood by\nearlier papers. Wino annihilation does not describe the Fermi e+ + e- data\n(except partially below ~ 100 GeV). At higher energies we expect astrophysical\nmechanisms, and we simply parameterize them so the combination can describe all\nthe data. We emphasize several predictions for satellite data to test the wino\ninterpretation, particularly the turndown of the positron and antiproton\nspectra above 100 GeV. Most other interpretations require a large rise in the\npositron rates above 100 GeV. We focus on studying this well-motivated and long\npredicted wino interpretation, rather than comparisons with other\ninterpretations. We emphasize that interpretations also depend very strongly on\nassumptions about the cosmological history of the universe, and on propagation\nof antiprotons and positrons in the galaxy. The winos PAMELA is observing arose\nfrom some non-thermal sources such as moduli decay rather than a universe that\ncooled in thermal equilibrium after the big bang. Then it is appropriate to\nnormalize the wino density to the local relic density, and no \"boost factors\"\nare needed to obtain the reported PAMELA rates. \n\n"}

A recurring feature of these outflows is their broad\nionization distribution including essentially ions (e.g., of Fe) from neutral\nto fully ionized. The absorption measure distribution (AMD) is defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |d N_H/d (log xi)|.\nAMDs of Seyfert outflows can span up to five orders of magnitude in xi. We\npresent the AMD of five outflows and show that they are all rather flat,\nperhaps slightly rising towards high ionization. More quantitatively, a\npower-law fit for log AMD ~ (log xi)^a yields slopes of 0 < a < 0.4. These\nslopes tightly constrain the density profiles of the wind, which until now\ncould be addressed only by theory. If the wind is distributed on large scales,\nthe measured slopes imply a generic density radial profile of n ~ r^{-alpha}\nwith 1 < alpha < 1.3.

The hardness-intensity diagram of all RXTE/PCA data\ncombined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.\nThe evolution through the HID suggests that in the early phase of the outburst\nthe source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the soft\nstate, which is supported by our timing analysis. Broadband (4-200 keV)\nspectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard\nspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft\nstate. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during\nthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the\nsoftening in the hard intermediate state.

If the orientation of the deduced BDF represents the\norientation of the local interstellar magnetic field (LISMF), as indicated by\nbest-fitting a model to the data, the UDF deviating from the BDF orientation\nimplies a significant contribution from the streaming perpendicular to the\nLISMF. This perpendicular streaming is probably due to the drift anisotropy,\nbecause the contribution from the perpendicular diffusion is expected to be\nmuch smaller than the drift effect. The large amplitude deduced for the UDF\nindicates a large spatial gradient of the GCR density. We suggest that such a\ndensity gradient can be expected at the heliosphere sitting close to the\nboundary of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), if the LIC is expanding.

However, the likely thermal emission\ndetected from the millisecond pulsar J0437-4715, of spin-down age $t_s \\sim\n7\\times10^9$ yr, implies a temperature $T\\sim 10^5$ K. Thus, a heating\nmechanism needs to be added to the cooling models in order to obtain agreement\nbetween theory and observation. Aims: Several internal heating mechanisms could\nbe operating in neutron stars, such as magnetic field decay, dark matter\naccretion, crust cracking, superfluid vortex creep, and non-equilibrium\nreactions (\"rotochemical heating\"). We study these mechanisms in order to\nestablish which could be the dominant source of thermal emission from old\npulsars. Methods: We show by simple estimates that magnetic field decay, dark\nmatter accretion, and crust cracking mechanism are unlikely to have a\nsignificant effect on old neutron stars. The thermal evolution for the other\nmechanisms is computed using the code of Fern\\'andez and Reisenegger. Given the\ndependence of the heating mechanisms on the spin-down parameters, we study the\nthermal evolution for two types of pulsars: young, slowly rotating \"classical\"\npulsars and old, fast rotating millisecond pulsars. Results: We find that\nmagnetic field decay, dark matter accretion, and crust cracking do not produce\ndetectable heating of old pulsars. Rotochemical heating and vortex creep can be\nimportant both for classical pulsars and millisecond pulsars. More restrictive\nupper limits on the surface temperatures of classical pulsars could rule out\nvortex creep as the main source of thermal emission. Rotochemical heating in\nclassical pulsars is driven by the chemical imbalance built up during their\nearly spin-down, and therefore strongly sensitive to their initial rotation\nperiod. \n\n"}

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

This allows us to probe hitherto unexplored ranges of\nparameters for the above cases, for example lifetimes in the range $\n10^{-3}-10^{4} $ s/eV for the case of neutrino decay.

We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to\nassess the role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we\nconfirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e.g., there\nis no apparent color bimodality for AGN hosts from z~0-2, but non-AGN galaxy\ncolor bimodality exists up to z~3; most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the\nAGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~2-3; and the\ncolors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass\nincreases up to z~2-3. Second, we point out that it is critical to use\nmass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and\nnon-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z~2-3, AGN hosts\nlie in the same CMD region as non-AGN galaxies; i.e., there is no specific\nclustering of AGN hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or\nthe green valley in between. The AGN fraction (~10%) is mostly independent of\nhost-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of SMBH growth in\ntypical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with\nnon-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and\nthe AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find,\nfor mass-matched samples, that the SFRs of AGN hosts are typically a factor of\n~2-3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z~0-1, whereas this difference\ndiminishes at z~1-3. Our results can be reasonably explained by two main\ningredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution of\ngalaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN\nfeedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~80% of cosmic time. \n\n"}

Although the shock stays relatively\nspherical, standing accretion-shock and convective instabilities lead to a\nglobally asymmetric mass and energy distribution in the postshock layer. An\nanisotropic momentum distribution of the ejecta is built up only after the\nexplosion sets in. Total momentum conservation implies the acceleration of the\nNS on a timescale of 1-3 seconds, mediated mainly by long-lasting, asymmetric\naccretion downdrafts and the anisotropic gravitational pull of large\ninhomogeneities in the ejecta.

By solving for the early\nevolution of both an adiabatic and a radiative blastwave, we calculate the high\nenergy emission lightcurve in the LAT band and compare it with the observed one\nfor each burst. The late time LAT light curves after T90 can be well fit by the\nmodel. However, due to continuous energy injection into the blastwave during\nthe prompt emission phase, the early external shock emission cannot account for\nthe observed GeV flux level.

Our pointing\ndirection was centered on the gamma -ray emission peak recently discovered with\nFermi-LAT around the position of the north-west radio lobe 15 arcmin offset\nfrom the nucleus. After subtracting two \"off-source\" pointings adjacent to the\nradio lobe, and removing possible contaminants in the XIS field of view, we\nfound significant residual X-ray emission most likely diffuse in nature. The\nspectrum of the excess X-ray emission is well fit by a power law with photon\nindex \\Gamma = 1.90 +- 0.15 and a 0.5 - 8 keV flux of 4 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2}\ns^{-1}.

We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar.

We introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluate\nquantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsic\nsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray flux\ndensities of blazars. The novelty of the method lies in a combination of data\nrandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data are\nintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significance\nassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid Malmquist bias and automatically\naccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). The method is\napplicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statistical\ncriteria. For larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which the\nsample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each bin\nindividually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent to\nluminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of very\nlarge, statistically complete samples. We show that for a smaller number of\nredshift bins, the method yields a worse significance, and in this way it is\nconservative in that it does not assign a stronger, artificially enhanced\nsignificance. We demonstrate how our test performs as a function of number of\nsources, strength of correlation, and number of redshift bins used, and we show\nthat while our test is robust against common-distance biases and associated\nfalse positives for uncorrelated data, it retains the power of other methods in\nrejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation for correlated data. \n\n"}

However, there are very few observations of\ngalaxies in the MeV range, and other emission processes could be present.

We present here two serendipitous results from recent\nfar-ultraviolet spectroscopic observations by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph\nonboard the Hubble Space Telescope. First, during the course of our 7.3 hour\nHST observations, the blazar increased in flux rapidly by ~40% (-0.45 mag/h)\nfollowed by a slower decline (+0.36 mag/h) to previous far-UV flux levels. We\nmodel this flare using asymmetric flare templates and constrain the physical\nsize and energetics of the emitting region. Furthermore, the spectral index of\nthe object softens considerably during the course of the flare from\nalpha(nu)=-1.0 to alpha(nu)=-1.4.

This feature can be very useful to probe the superdense core\nmatter of neutron stars, and the strong gravity regime. However, although many\nmodels exist in the literature, the physical origin of kHz QPO is not known,\nand hence this feature cannot be used as a tool yet. The energy dependence of\nkHz QPO fractional rms amplitude is an important piece of the jigsaw puzzle to\nunderstand the physical origin of this timing feature. It is known that the\nfractional rms amplitude increases with energy at lower energies. At higher\nenergies, the amplitude is usually believed to saturate, although this is not\nestablished. We combine tens of lower kHz QPOs from a neutron star LMXB 4U\n1728-34 in order to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio. Consequently, we, for\nthe first time to the best of our knowledge, find a significant and systematic\ndecrease of the fractional rms amplitude with energy at higher photon energies.\nAssuming an energy spectrum model, blackbody+powerlaw, we explore if the\nsinusoidal variation of a single spectral parameter can reproduce the above\nmentioned fractional rms amplitude behavior. Our analysis suggests that the\noscillation of any single blackbody parameter is favored over the oscillation\nof any single powerlaw parameter, in order to explain the measured amplitude\nbehavior. We also find that the quality factor of a lower kHz QPO does not\nplausibly depend on photon energy. \n\n"}

This will happen if the time domain waveform or\nits derivative exhibits a discontinuity.

In this\nregime the accreting matter settles down subsonically onto the rotating\nmagnetosphere, forming an extended quasi-static shell.

In the\nlast case the differential rotation law in the shell is close to\niso-angular-momentum rotation. The accretion rate through the shell is\ndetermined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities while taking cooling into account. Measurements\nof spin-up/spin-down rates of quasi-spherically wind accreting XPSRs in\nequilibrium with known orbital periods (like e.g. GX 301-2 and Vela X-1) enable\ndetermination of the main dimensionless parameters of the model and the NS\nmagnetic field.

The interaction between an accretion disk and a strong magnetic\nfield is not well-understood, particularly at low accretion rates (the\nso-called ``propeller regime'). This is due in part to the lack of clear\nobservational diagnostics to constrain the physics of the disk-field\ninteraction. Here we associate the strong ~1 Hz modulation seen in the\naccreting millisecond X-ray pulsar NGC 6440 X-2 with an instability that arises\nwhen the inner edge of the accretion disk is close to the corotation radius\n(where the stellar rotation rate matches the Keplerian speed in the disk).

The absence of a Drude\npeak has been attributed to a pseudogap at the Fermi surface but a detailed\nexplanation of the linear behavior has not been found.

With the advent of\ngravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will\neventually have to be quantified. Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although\nthe vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the\nsystem, they still dominate the response at intermediate times. Our results\nstrongly suggest that both parametrized and ringdown searches should use at\nleast two-mode templates. Our analysis of compact binaries shows that\nenvironmental effects are typically negligible for most eLISA sources, with the\nexception of very few special extreme mass ratio inspirals. We show in\nparticular that accretion and hydrodynamic drag generically dominate over\nself-force effects for geometrically thin disks, whereas they can be safely\nneglected for geometrically thick disk environments, which are the most\nrelevant for eLISA. Finally, we discuss how our ignorance of the matter\nsurrounding compact objects implies intrinsic limits on the ability to\nconstrain strong-field deviations from General Relativity. \n\n"}

A\nSED fitting algorithm has found such evidence for seven objects and an\nuncertain indication for one more.

Our analysis shows that the torus can show up clearly only under\nquite special conditions: low luminosity and preferentially low peak frequency\nof the beamed synchrotron emission from the jet; high torus luminosity, close\nto that of the accretion disc. This implies that the inferred ratios of torus\nto disc luminosity are biased high.

This system has been shown\ntransiting between a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) state and a rotation-powered\nMSP state. The NuSTAR observations were taken in both LMXB state and\nrotation-powered state. The source is clearly seen in both states up to ~79\nkeV. During the LMXB state, the 3-79 keV flux is about a factor of 10 higher\nthat in the rotation-powered state.

For distances within a few\ngravitational radii, light paths are strongly bent by the strong gravity field\nof the central black hole. If the central black hole has nonzero angular\nmomentum (spin), a photon's polarization plane will be rotated by the\ngravitational Faraday effect.

We present simple algorithms computing strong lensing\neffects of Kerr black holes, including effects on polarization.

From these we measure the flux in the\n[Co III] 5892 A line and remove its well-behaved time dependence to infer the\ninitial mass of $^{56}$Ni ($M_{Ni}$) produced in the explosion. We then examine\n$^{56}$Ni yields for different SN Ia ejected masses ($M_{ej}$ - calculated\nusing the relation between light curve width and ejected mass) and find the\n$^{56}$Ni masses of SNe Ia fall into two regimes: for narrow light curves (low\nstretch s~0.7-0.9), $M_{Ni}$ is clustered near $M_{Ni}$ ~ 0.4$M_\\odot$ and\nshows a shallow increase as $M_{ej}$ increases from ~1-1.4$M_\\odot$; at high\nstretch, $M_{ej}$ clusters at the Chandrasekhar mass (1.4$M_\\odot$) while\n$M_{Ni}$ spans a broad range from 0.6-1.2$M_\\odot$.

Due to shock compression, PSC becomes hot and dense\nthat eventually deflects a part of the inflowing matter as bipolar outflows\nbecause of the presence of extra thermal gradient force. In our approach, we\nstudy the outflow properties in terms of the inflow parameters, namely specific\nenergy (${\\mathcal E}$) and specific angular momentum ($\\lambda$) considering\nthe realistic outflow geometry around the rotating black holes. We find that\nspin of the black hole ($a_k$) plays an important role in deciding the outflow\nrate $R_{\\dot m}$ (ratio of mass flux of outflow and inflow), in particular,\n$R_{\\dot m}$ is directly correlated with $a_k$ for the same set of inflow\nparameters.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission. \n\n"}

It turns out that, rather than towards the current target\nposition, the optimal policy trades towards a weighted average of expected\nfuture target positions. This generalizes an observation of Garleanu and\nPedersen from their homogenous Markovian optimal investment problem to a\ngeneral hedging problem. Our findings complement a number of previous studies\nin the literature on optimal strategies in illiquid markets where the\nfrictionless strategy is confined to diffusions. The consideration of general\npredictable reference strategies is made possible by the use of a convex\nanalysis approach instead of the more common dynamic programming methods. \n\n"}

The full evolution is\nfollowed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei. A novel\naspect of the survey is the use of a one-dimensional neutrino transport model\nfor the explosion. This explosion model has been calibrated to give the\nobserved energy for SN 1987A, using several standard progenitors, and for the\nCrab supernova using a 9.6 solar mass progenitor. As a result of using a\ncalibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the supernova is\nvariable and sensitive to the structure of the presupernova star. Many\nprogenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black\nholes, and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set.\nThe resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the sun provided that\na reasonable contribution from Type Ia supernovae is also allowed, but with a\ndeficiency of light s-process isotopes.

Their bright phases typically last\nfor 100~d or less, rather than persisting for several years. The transient\nobject UGC2773-OT had a similar peak absolute magnitude to other SN impostors,\nbut with a gradual 5-yr prediscovery rise. In the 6 yr since discovery, it has\nfaded very slowly (0.26 mag/yr). Overall, we suggest that its decade-long\neruption is so far the best known analog of eta Car's 19th century eruption. We\ndiscuss extensive spectroscopy of the ongoing eruption. The spectra show\ninteresting changes in velocity and line shape that we discuss in detail,\nincluding an asymmetric Halpha emission line that we show is consistent with\nthe ejection of a bipolar nebula that could be very much like the Homunculus of\neta Car. Moreover, changes in the line width, line profile, blue excess\nemission resembling that of Type IIn supernovae, and the intensity of Halpha\nsuggest the presence of strong circumstellar interaction in the eruption at\nlate times. This supports the hypothesis that the extended plateau of eta Car's\neruption may have been powered by shock interaction as well.

We\nfirst show that the Standard Model (SM) Higgs Lagrangian is equivalent to the\nscale-invariant nonlinear chiral Lagrangian, which is further gauge equivalent\nto the scale-invariant HLS model, with the scale symmetry realized nonlinearly\nvia SM Higgs as a (pseudo-) dilaton. The scale symmetry forbids the new vector\nboson decay to the 125 GeV Higgs plus W/Z boson, in sharp contrast to the\nconventional \"equivalence theorem\" which is invalidated by the conformality.\nThe HLS forbids mixing between the iso-triplet technirho's, rho_{Pi} and\nrho_{P}, of the one-family walking technicolor (with four doublets\nN_D=N_F/2=4), which, without the HLS, would be generated when switching on the\nstandard model gauging.

There have been previous claims of the detection of warm\nbaryons along the line of sight to distant blazars and of hot gas between\ninteracting clusters.

We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing\nmodel to simulate the UV/optical lightcurves of NGC 5548. We show that disc\nreprocessing of the observed hard X-ray lightcurve produces optical lightcurves\nwith too much fast variability as well as too short a lag time. Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to\natomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the\nscale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it\nradiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft\nX-ray excess.

X-ray polarimetry with the X-ray\nImaging Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE) will allow the understanding of the\nmagnetic field structure and intensity on different regions in SNRs and PWNe,\nhelping to unveil long-standing questions such as i.e. acceleration of cosmic\nrays in SNRs or magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer. SNRs and PWNe also\nrepresent the largest population of Galactic very-high energy gamma-ray\nsources, therefore the study of their magnetic distribution with XIPE will\nprovide fundamental ingredients on the investigation of those sources at very\nhigh energies.

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMS; ~ 10^5 M_sun) formed from metal-free gas in the\nearly Universe attract attention as progenitors of supermassive black holes\nobserved at high redshifts. To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very\nextended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are\ncalled super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes\nlocally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs\nwill grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as\nlong as the rapid accretion is maintained. \n\n"}

This suggests a correlation of the injected power with\nenhanced activity of the acceleration mechanism. The cooling likely takes place\nat a much smaller distance ($\\sim$0.03 pc) than the BLR radius. The emission at\na few hundred GeV can be reproduced with IC scattering of highly relativistic\nelectrons off FIR photons at $\\sim$0.2 pc, presumably in a dusty torus. DCF\nanalysis between the long-term optical and gamma-ray light curves yields a good\ncorrelation with no measurable delay.

In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine\nmust bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most\nof these jets do not break out, and are instead \"choked\" inside the star, as\nthe central-engine activity time, $t_{\\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling\nthe long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for\ntheir central-engine activity times, $\\propto t_{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha}$ for $t_{\\rm\ne}>t_{\\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\\alpha\\sim4$) and a typical GRB\njet breakout time of $t_{\\rm b}\\sim 60\\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The\nlatter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding\nthe progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity\nGRBs.

This\nnaturally makes the Cygnus X complex a highly interesting source in neutrino\nastronomy, in particular concerning a possible detection with the IceCube\nNeutrino Observatory, which has a good view of the northern hemisphere. In this\npaper, we model the multiwavelength spectrum of the Cygnus, for the first time\nusing a broad data set from radio, MeV (COMPTEL), GeV (Fermi), TeV (Argo) and\n10s of TeV (Milagro) energies. The modeling is performed assuming a\nleptohadronic model. We solve the steady-state transport equation for leptons\nand hadrons injected homogeneously in the region and test the role of diffusive\ntransport and energy loss by radiation and interaction. The result shows that\ndiffusion loss plays a significant role in Cygnus X and always exceeds the\nadvection loss as well as almost all other loss processes. The best-fit\nparameters we find are a magnetic field of $B=8.9\\times10^{-6}$ G, a target\ndensity of $N_t=19.4$ cm$^{-3}$, a cosmic ray spectral index of $\\alpha=2.37$\nand neutral gas distribution over a depth of 116 pc.

This transport model with a broad multiwavelength fit provides\na neutrino flux which approaches the sensitivity of IceCube at very high\nenergies ($>$ 50 TeV). In the future, the flux sensitivity of IceCube will be\nimproved. With this rather pessimistic model, leaving out the influence of\npossible strong, high-energy point sources, we already expect the flux in the\nCygnus X region to suffice for IceCube to measure a significant neutrino flux\nin the next decade. \n\n"}

However, this fundamental assumption needs to be\ntested with observations of high-z SNe Ia. To date, the majority of SNe Ia\nobserved at moderate to large redshifts (0.4 < z < 1.0) are faint, and the\nresultant analyses are based on observations with modest signal-to-noise ratios\nthat impart a degree of ambiguity in their determined properties. In rare cases\nhowever, the Universe offers a helping hand: to date a few SNe Ia have been\nobserved that have had their luminosities magnified by intervening galaxies and\ngalaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses. In this paper we present\nlong-slit spectroscopy of the lensed SNe Ia 2016geu, which occurred at a\nredshift of z=0.409, and was magnified by a factor of ~55 by a galaxy located\nat z=0.216. We compared our spectra, which were obtained a couple weeks to a\ncouple months past peak light, with the spectroscopic properties of\nwell-observed, nearby SNe Ia, finding that SN 2016geu's properties are\ncommensurate with those of SNe Ia in the local universe. Based primarily on the\nvelocity and strength of the Si II 6355 absorption feature, we find that SN\n2016geu can be classified as a high-velocity, high-velocity gradient and\n\"core-normal\" SN Ia. The strength of various features (measured though their\npseudo-equivalent widths) argue against SN 2016geu being a faint, broad-lined,\ncool or shallow-silicon SN Ia. We conclude that the spectroscopic properties of\nSN 2016geu imply that it is a normal SN Ia, and when taking previous results by\nother authors into consideration, there is very little, if any, evolution in\nthe observational properties of SNe Ia up to z~0.4.

Recent studies with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope have shown that many classical novae are accompanied\nby gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray emission. This emission likely originates from\nstrong shocks, providing new insights into the properties of nova outflows and\nallowing them to be used as laboratories to study the unknown efficiency of\nparticle acceleration in shocks. Here we report gamma-ray and optical\nobservations of the Milky Way nova ASASSN-16ma, which is among the brightest\nnovae ever detected in gamma-rays.

While any successful astrophysical jet harbored in a\nCCSN should produce high energy neutrinos, photons may be able to successfully\nescape the stellar envelope only for a fraction of progenitors, possibly\nleading to the existence of high-luminosity, low-luminosity and\nnot-electromagnetically bright (\"choked\") GRBs.

But in order for this to work, an\nexternal magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ must be present. In several cases ${\\bf B}$\nis modeled as a domain-like network with `sharp edges': all domains have the\nsame size $L_{\\rm dom}$ (set by the ${\\bf B}$ coherence length) and the same\nstrength B, but the direction of ${\\bf B}$ changes randomly and abruptly from\none domain to the next. It is obviously a highly mathematical idealization\nwherein the components of ${\\bf B}$ are discontinuous across the edges (whence\nthe name sharp edges). It is therefore highly desirable to go a step further,\nand to find out what happens when the edges are smoothed out, namely when the\nabrupt change of ${\\bf B}$ is replaced by a smooth one. Moreover, this step\nbecomes compelling when the photon-ALP oscillation length $l_{\\rm osc}$ turns\nout to be comparable to -- or smaller than -- $L_{\\rm dom}$, because in this\ncase the photon survival probability $P_{\\gamma \\to \\gamma} ({\\cal E})$\ncritically depends on the domain shape. In the present paper we propose a\nsmoothed out version of the previous domain-like structure of ${\\bf B}$ which\nincorporates the above changes, and we work out its implications.

Our results is of\nparticular importance in view of the new generation of gamma-ray detectors,\nsince in such a situation $l_{\\rm osc} \\lesssim L_{\\rm dom}$ occurs just above\nthe TeV scale. \n\n"}

An analysis of raw\nobservations of 2,333 type Ia supernovae light-curves shows that their widths,\nrelative to a standard template, have a power-law exponent as a function of\n${(1+z)}$, of (0.083 +/- 0.024) which is consistent with no time dilation and\ninconsistent with standard time dilation. In addition, it is shown that the\nstandard method for calibrating the type Ia supernovae light curves (SALT2) is\nflawed, which explains why this lack of time dilation has not been previously\nobserved. \\par Nearby observations show that the peak absolute magnitude of\ntype Ia supernovae is also constant.

We perform semi-analytical spectral fitting of the multi-wavelength\nemission to obtain estimates of the jet physical parameters, and find that the\nmulti-wavelength emission can be explained by either a proton synchrotron\nscenario or an electron inverse Compton scattering scenario. In the proton\nsynchrotron scenario, a strong magnetic field of $10-100$~G is required,\nimplying that the particle acceleration is likely driven by magnetic energy\ndissipation such as magnetic reconnection events. The inverse Compton scenario\nimplies a magnetic field of $0.1-1$~G. Thus the particle acceleration is likely\ndriven by the kinetic energy dissipation such as shocks. We also discuss the\nneutrino production in the context of single-zone and multi-zone models based\non the above two scenarios. We demonstrate that the variability and optical\npolarization signatures can be used to distinguish the two scenarios due to\ntheir drastically different magnetic field.

We probe that scenario by performing general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of differentially rotating massive stars\nsupported by thermal radiation pressure plus a gas pressure perturbation. The\nstars are initially threaded by a dynamically weak, poloidal magnetic field\nconfined to the stellar interior. We find that magnetic braking and turbulent\nviscous damping via magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability in\nthe bulk of the star redistribute angular momentum, damp differential rotation\nand induce the formation of a massive and nearly uniformly rotating inner core\nsurrounded by a Keplerian envelope. The core + disk configuration evolves on a\nsecular timescale and remains in quasi-stationary equilibrium until the\ntermination of our simulations. Our results suggest that the high degree of\ndifferential rotation required for $m=2$ seed density perturbations to trigger\ngas fragmentation and binary black hole formation is likely to be suppressed\nduring the normal lifetime of the star prior to evolving to the point of\ndynamical instability to collapse.

According to the no-hair theorem, every astrophysical black\nhole, including supermassive black holes, is characterized by at most three\nclassical, externally observable parameters - mass, spin, and the electric\ncharge. While the mass and the spin have routinely been measured by several\nmethods, the electric charge has usually been neglected, based on the arguments\nof efficient discharge in astrophysical plasmas. From a theoretical point of\nview, the black hole can attain charge due to the mass imbalance between\nprotons and electrons in fully ionized plasmas, which yields about $\\sim\n10^8\\,{\\rm C}$ for Sgr A*. The second, induction mechanism concerns rotating\nKerr black holes embedded in an external magnetic field, which leads to\nelectric field generation due to the twisting of magnetic field lines.

One ejection mechanism is the ablation of the neutron star surface by\nthe burst of neutrinos in the first $30\\,\\mu$s of the merger. Another, more\nefficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an\ninternal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is\nexpected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally\naccelerated wind. The shock propagates outward through the ejecta and\naccelerates in its outer layers at radii $r\\sim 10^9-10^{10}$cm, launching an\nultra-relativistic opaque envelope filled with $\\sim 10^4$ photons per nucleon.\nThe Lorentz factor profile of the envelope rises outward and determines its\nhomologous expansion, which adiabatically cools the trapped photons.

TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling\nallowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods. A generalised boosting\nmethod is the first realisation benefiting from the new framework. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0605133", "contents": "Title: Boundary effects to the entanglement entropy and two-site entanglement\n  of the spin-1 valence-bond solid Abstract: We investigate the von Neumann entropy of a block of subsystem for the\nvalence-bond solid (VBS) state with general open boundary conditions. We show\nthat the effect of the boundary on the von Neumann entropy decays exponentially\nfast in the distance between the subsystem considered and the boundary sites.\n  Further, we show that as the size of the subsystem increases, its von Neumann\nentropy exponentially approaches the summation of the von Neumann entropies of\nthe two ends, the exponent being related to the size. In contrast to critical\nsystems, where boundary effects to the von Neumann entropy decay slowly, the\nboundary effects in a VBS, a non-critical system, decay very quickly. We also\nstudy the entanglement between two spins.\n  Curiously, while the boundary operators decrease the von Neumann entropy of L\nspins, they increase the entanglement between two spins. \n\n"}
