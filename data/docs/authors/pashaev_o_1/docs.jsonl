When the target space is a flag manifold of\nsimple G, and the gauge group is a Cartan subgroup thereof, the perturbative\nmodel describes, purely physically, the recently formulated mathematical theory\nof \"Twisted Chiral Differential Operators\".

In\nparticular, the Hecke eigensheaves and Hecke operators can be described in\nterms of the correlation functions of certain operators that underlie the\ninfinite-dimensional chiral algebra of the flag manifold model.

We prove two complementary results that confirm this\nintuition. First, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using\nfewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases\nwith the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be\nreconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from\ncompressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli\nmeasurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions\nabout the unknown state.\n  We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we\nobtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data\ncontains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank\nwith decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity\nof compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample\ncomplexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements.\n  Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed\nsensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find\nthat, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing\nestimators consistently produce higher-fidelity state reconstructions than MLE.\nIn addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster\nclassical processing with no loss of accuracy.\n  Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low rank estimate using\ndirect fidelity estimation and we describe a method for compressed quantum\nprocess tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank. \n\n"}

Isotropy and statistics of the CMB Abstract: The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the\ninitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously\ntested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the\nPlanck satellite. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to\nbe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency\ndependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data,\nand are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).\nHowever, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a\nfew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.\nIn particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected\nto a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to\npersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the\nlow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any\nprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to\narbitrarily small angular scales.

Furthermore,\na $f(R)$ gravity cosmological model can be constructed in brane-antibrane\nsystem starting from the very early universe and accounting for the\ncosmological redshift at all phases of cosmic history, from inflation to late\ntime acceleration. Here we propose a $f(R)$ model where transition redshifts\ncorrespond to inflation-deceleration and deceleration-late time acceleration\ntransitions starting froma BIon system. At the point where the universe was\nborn, due to the transition of $k$ black fundamental strings to the BIon\nconfiguration, the redshift is approximately infinity and decreases with\nreducing temperature ($z\\sim T^{2}$). The BIon is a configuration in flat space\nof a universe-brane and a parallel anti-universe-brane connected by a wormhole.\nThis wormhole is a channel for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our\nuniverse, occurring at inflation and decreasing with redshift as $z\\sim\nT^{4+1/7}$.

For spins, however,\nspontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative\nrelaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole\nand the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the\nelectromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum\nfluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work\nrepresents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of\nindividual spins to microwave photons. \n\n"}

As opposed to\nthe Landauer case, the cost of erasure in this case is associated with the\ndiscrete variable.\n  Here we study the {\\it discrete} fluctuations in this cost and the\nprobability of violation of the VB bound. We also obtain a Jarzynski-like\nequality for the VB erasure protocol. We find that the fluctuations below the\nVB bound are exponentially suppressed at a far greater rate and more tightly\nthan for an equivalent Jarzynski expression for VB erasure. We expose a\ntrade-off between the size of the fluctuations and the cost of erasure. We find\nthat the discrete nature of the fluctuations is pronounced in the regime where\nreservoir spins are maximally polarized. We also state the first laws of\nthermodynamics corresponding to the conservation of spin angular momentum for\nthis particular erasure protocol. Our work will be important for novel heat\nengines based on information erasure schemes that do not incur an energy cost. \n\n"}

The main difficulty in order to\nunderstand the behavior of quantum Markov chains arises from the fact that\nquantum mechanical operators do not commute in general.

The solution is based on a\nnonlinear generally covariant theory of a metastable graviton that leads to a\nlarge-distance modification of gravity.\n  From the extra-dimensional standpoint the problem is solved due to the fact\nthat the four-dimensional vacuum energy curves mostly the extra space. The\nfour-dimensional curvature is small, being inversely proportional to a positive\npower of the vacuum energy. The effects of infinite-volume extra dimensions are\nseen by a brane-world observer as nonlocal operators.\n  From the four-dimensional perspective the problem is solved because the\nzero-mode graviton is extremely weakly coupled to localized four-dimensional\nsources. The observable gravity is mediated not by zero mode but, instead, by a\nmetastable graviton with a lifetime of the order of the present-day Hubble\nscale. Therefore, laws of gravity are modified in the infrared above the Hubble\nscale. Large wave-length sources, such as the vacuum energy, feel only the\nzero-mode interaction and, as a result, curve space very mildly. Shorter\nwave-length sources interact predominantly via exchange of the metastable\ngraviton. Because of this, all standard properties of early cosmology,\nincluding inflation, are intact. \n\n"}

In this basis, then, cubic string field theory\npossesses a well-defined initial value formulation and a conserved Hamiltonian.\nWith this new understanding it seems natural to study time dependent solutions\nrepresenting the the decay of an unstable D-branes. In this paper we study such\nsolutions using level truncation of mode oscillators in the lightcone basis,\nfinding both homogenous solutions by perturbatively expanding the string field\nin modes $e^{nt}$, and inhomogenous solutions by integrating the equations of\nmotion on a lattice.

We\ndiscuss three supersymmetric extensions of the KP hierarchy (MRSKP, \\SKP2, and\nJSKP). We define and compute their additional symmetries and we find that the\nalgebra of additional symmetries are in all three cases isomorphic to the Lie\nalgebra of superdifferential operators.

To consider an applicability of this method to quantum\nstates of a higher level system, it is essential to check if the coincidence of\nthe Voronoi diagrams also occurs. In this paper, we show a negative result for\nthat expectation. In other words, we mathematically prove that those diagrams\nno longer coincide in a higher dimension. That indicates that the method used\nin one-qubit case to calculate the Holevo capacity might not be effective in a\nhigher dimension. \n\n"}

However, no comparable formulas are available for the volumes (and,\nhence, probabilities) of various separable subsets of them. We seek to clarify\nthis situation for the Hilbert-Schmidt metric for the simplest possible case of\nn=4, that is, the two-qubit systems. Making use of the density matrix (rho)\nparameterization of Bloore (J. Phys. A 9, 2059 [1976]), we are able to reduce\neach of the real and complex volume problems to the calculation of a\none-dimensional integral, the single relevant variable being a certain ratio of\ndiagonal entries, nu = (rho_{11} rho_{44})/{rho_{22} rho_{33})$. The associated\nintegrand in each case is the product of a known (highly oscillatory near nu=1)\njacobian and a certain unknown univariate function, which our extensive\nnumerical (quasi-Monte Carlo) computations indicate is very closely\nproportional to an (incomplete) beta function B_{nu}(a,b), with a=1/2,\nb=sqrt{3}in the real case, and a=2 sqrt{6}/5, b =3/sqrt{2} in the complex case.\nAssuming the full applicability of these specific incomplete beta functions, we\nundertake separable volume calculations. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0610235", "contents": "Title: BQP-complete Problems Concerning Mixing Properties of Classical Random\n  Walks on Sparse Graphs Abstract: We describe two BQP-complete problems concerning properties of sparse graphs\nhaving a certain symmetry. The graphs are specified by efficiently computable\nfunctions which output the adjacent vertices for each vertex. Let i and j be\ntwo given vertices. The first problem consists in estimating the difference\nbetween the number of paths of length m from j to j and those which from i to\nj, where m is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. The scale of the\nestimation accuracy is specified by some a priori known upper bound on the\ngrowth of these differences with increasing m. The problem remains BQP-hard for\nregular graphs with degree 4.\n  The second problem is related to continuous-time classical random walks. The\nwalk starts at some vertex j. The promise is that the difference of the\nprobabilities of being at j and at i, respectively, decays with O(exp(-\\mu t))\nfor some \\mu>0. The problem is to decide whether this difference is greater\nthan a exp(-\\mu T) or smaller than b exp(-\\mu T) after some time instant T,\nwhere T is polylogarithmic and the difference a-b is inverse polylogarithmic in\nthe number of vertices. Since the probabilities differ only by an exponentially\nsmall amount, an exponential number of trials would be necessary if one tried\nto answer this question by running the walk itself.\n  A modification of this problem, asking whether there exists a pair of nodes\nfor which the probability difference is at least a exp(-\\mu T), is\nQCMA-complete. \n\n"}
