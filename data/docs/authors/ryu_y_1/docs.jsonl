We investigate how the inclusion of thermal conduction changes\nthe physical parameters of the hot shocked wind gas and the amount of X-ray\nemission predicted by time-dependent hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulae\nwith central stars of normal, hydrogen-rich surface composition. The radiation\nhydrodynamical models show that heat conduction leads to lower temperatures and\nhigher densities within a bubble and brings the physical properties of the\nX-ray emitting domain into close agreement with the values derived from\nobservations. Depending on the central-star mass and the evolutionary phase,\nour models predict X-ray [0.45--2.5 keV] luminosities between $10^{-8}$ and\n$10^{-4}$ of the stellar bolometric luminosities, in good agreement with the\nobservations. Less than 1% of the wind power is radiated away in this X-ray\nband.

These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk.

Systematics and uncertainties of the\n  mid-infrared spectral analysis methods Abstract: The spectral region around 10 micrometer, showing prominent dust emission\nbands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary\ndust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the\ninfluence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral\ndecomposition methods.

Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are\ngenerally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive to\ncool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.\nterrestrial) planets.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the\nprimary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc\nat any separation less than the Hill radius. The first scenario can explain a\nsystem such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are\nseparated by a great distance.

CB-BLS is a recently-introduced algorithm for the detection of\ntransiting CB planets around EBs.We describe progress in search sensitivity,\ngenerality and capability of CB-BLS, and detection tests of CB-BLS on simulated\ndata. We also describe an analytical approach for the determination of CB-BLS\ndetection limits, and a method for the correct detrending of\nintrinsically-variable stars.\n  Results. We present some blind-tests with simulated planets injected to real\nCoRoT data. The presented upgrades to CB-BLS allowed it to detect all the blind\ntests successfully, and these detections were in line with the detection limits\nanalysis.

Using a Monte Carlo approach, we select the\nphysical parameters of the binary lens system, a star hosting a planet, and we\ncalculate the pixel-lensing light curve taking into account the finite source\neffects. Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2\nM_{\\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\\rm P} < 20 M_{\\oplus}$) can\ncause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large\ntelescopes. However, even in the former case, the probability to find\ndetectable planetary features in pixel-lensing light curves is at most a few\npercent of the detectable events, and therefore many events have to be\ncollected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in M31.

Dust\n  settling and thermal structure of discs around M stars Abstract: The irradiation of protoplanetary discs by central stars is the main heating\nmechanism for discs, resulting in their flared geometric structure. In a series\nof papers, we investigate the deep links between 2D self-consistent disc\nstructure and planetary migration in irradiated discs, focusing particularly on\nthose around M stars. In this first paper, we analyse the thermal structure of\ndiscs that are irradiated by an M star by solving the radiative transfer\nequation by means of a Monte Carlo code. Our simulations of irradiated\nhydrostatic discs are realistic and self-consistent in that they include dust\nsettling with multiple grain sizes (N=15), the gravitational force of an\nembedded planet on the disc, and the presence of a dead zone (a region with\nvery low levels of turbulence) within it. We show that dust settling drives the\ntemperature of the mid-plane from an $r^{-3/5}$ distribution (well mixed dust\nmodels) toward an $r^{-3/4}$. The dead zone, meanwhile, leaves a dusty wall at\nits outer edge because dust settling in this region is enhanced compared to the\nactive turbulent disc at larger disc radii.

In general it\nconsists of two parts, one independent of and another one proportional to the\nmean magnetic field. The first part may be nonzero only in the presence of mhd\nturbulence, maintained, e.g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a\nbattery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The\nsecond part, which covers, e.g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale\ndynamos. Only a few examples of the aforementioned first part of mean\nelectromotive force have been discussed so far. It is shown that a mean\nelectromotive force proportional to the mean fluid velocity, but independent of\nthe mean magnetic field, may occur in an originally homogeneous isotropic mhd\nturbulence if there are nonzero correlations of velocity and electric current\nfluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field\nfluctuations.

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating. We have modified our\nmodel to include an orbital period dependence of the tidal dissipation factor\nin the star, $Q'_{\\ast} \\propto P^{\\gamma}$, $-1 \\leqslant \\gamma \\leqslant 1$.\nWith this model, we search, for a tidally heated planet, orbital and radius\nevolutionary tracks that fall within the observational limits of the radius,\nthe semimajor axis, and the eccentricity of the planet in its current estimated\nage range.

The ability to\ndo this relies on the system being in a quasi-equilibrium state in the sense\nthat the eccentricities are constant on the usual secular timescale, and decay\non a timescale which is much longer than the age of the system. Since the\nequilibrium eccentricity is effectively a function only of observable system\nparameters and the unknown Love number of the short-period planet, the latter\ncan be determined with accurate measurements of the planet's eccentricity and\nradius. However, this analysis relies on the unlikely assumption that the\nsystem is coplanar. Here we generalize our recent analysis of this fixed-point\nphenomenon to mutually inclined systems and show that the fixed point of\ncoplanar systems is replaced by a limit cycle, with the average value of the\neccentricity decreasing and its amplitude of variation increasing with\nincreasing mutual inclination. This behaviour significantly reduces the ability\nto unambiguously determine the Love number of the short-period planet if the\nmutual inclination is higher than around 10^o. We show that for Q-values less\nthan 10^6, the HAT-P-13 system cannot have a mutual inclination between 54 and\n126^o because Kozai oscillations coupled with tidal dissipation would act to\nquickly move the inclination outside this range, and that the behaviour of\nretrograde systems is the mirror image of that for prograde systems. We derive\na relationship between the equilibrium radius of the short-period planet, its\nQ-value and its core mass, and show that given current estimates of e_b and the\nplanet radius, the HAT-P-13 system is likely to be close to coplanar [...] \n\n"}

Abstract: In planetary nebulae, abundances of oxygen and other heavy elements derived\nfrom optical recombination lines are systematically higher than those derived\nfrom collisionally excited lines. We investigate the hypothesis that the\ndestruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas\nthat could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly\nexceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected\nto be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars. We therefore\nconclude that contemporaneous solid body destruction cannot explain the\nobserved abundance discrepancies in planetary nebulae. However, similar\narguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion.\nIn this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one\nten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris\ndisks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may\ncontribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some planetary nebulae, so\nlong as mixing of the high metallicity gas is inefficient. \n\n"}

For\nwater, we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations.\nSome admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius.\nFor the warmest considered models, the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3,\nstill extending over ~0.7 REarth. If water occurs, it will be essentially in\nthe plasma phase or in the superionic phase, but not in an ice phase.\nMetal-free envelope models have 0.02<k2<0.2, and the core mass cannot be\ndetermined from a measurement of k2.

The generalized shear term represents\nparticles' memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories and\ndepends on the inertial particle pair dispersion backward in time. The\nimportance of this backward dispersion in determining the particle relative\nvelocity is emphasized. We find that our model with a two-phase separation\nbehavior, an early ballistic phase and a later tracer-like phase, as found by\nrecent simulations for the forward (in time) dispersion of inertial particle\npairs, gives good fits to the measured relative speeds from simulations at low\nReynolds numbers. In the monodisperse case with identical particles, the\ngeneralized acceleration term vanishes and the relative velocity is determined\nby the generalized shear term. At large Reynolds numbers, our model gives a\n$St^{1/2}$ dependence of the relative velocity on the Stokes number $St$ in the\ninertial range for both the ballistic behavior and the Richardson separation\nlaw.

The negative contribution of turbulence to the effective mean\nmagnetic pressure is determined for strongly stratified forced turbulence over\na range of values of magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Small-scale dynamo\naction is shown to reduce the negative effect of turbulence on the effective\nmean magnetic pressure. However, the turbulence coefficients describing the\nnegative effective magnetic pressure phenomenon are found to be converged for\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers between 60 and 600, which is the largest value\nconsidered here. In all these models the turbulent intensity is arranged to be\nnearly independent of height, so the kinetic energy density decreases with\nheight due to the decrease in density. In a second series of numerical\nexperiments, the turbulent intensity increases with height such that the\nturbulent kinetic energy density is nearly independent of height. Turbulent\nmagnetic diffusivity and turbulent pumping velocity are determined with the\ntest-field method for both cases. The vertical profile of the turbulent\nmagnetic diffusivity is found to agree with what is expected based on simple\nmixing length expressions. Turbulent pumping is shown to be down the gradient\nof turbulent magnetic diffusivity, but it is twice as large as expected.\nCorresponding numerical mean-field models are used to show that a large-scale\ninstability can occur in both cases, provided the degree of scale separation is\nlarge enough and hence the turbulent magnetic diffusivity small enough. \n\n"}

Formally our Ks-band transits are deeper than\nthe J-band transits observed simultaneously by a factor of 1.072\\pm0.018 - a\n4-sigma discrepancy. The most straightforward explanation for our deeper\nKs-band depth is a spectral absorption feature from the limb of the atmosphere\nof the planet; for the spectral absorption feature to be this prominent the\natmosphere of GJ 1214b must have a large scale height and a low mean molecular\nweight.

During early\nphases when the stars are surrounded by discs, the binary orbit and disc\nmidplane may be mutually inclined. The discs around T Tauri stars will become\nmildly warped and undergo solid body precession around the angular momentum\nvector of the binary system. It is unclear how planetesimals in such a disc\nwill evolve and affect planet formation. Aims. We investigate the dynamics of\nplanetesimals embedded in discs that are perturbed by a binary companion on a\ncircular, inclined orbit. We examine collisional velocities of the\nplanetesimals to determine when they can grow through accretion. We vary the\nbinary inclination, binary separation, D, disc mass, and planetesimal radius.\nOur standard model has D=60 AU, inclination=45 deg, and a disc mass equivalent\nto the MMSN. Methods. We use a 3D hydrodynamics code to model the disc.\nPlanetesimals are test particles which experience gas drag, the gravitational\nforce of the disc, the companion star gravity. Planetesimal orbit crossing\nevents are detected and used to estimate collisional velocities. Results. For\nbinary systems with modest inclination (25 deg), disc gravity prevents\nplanetesimal orbits from undergoing strong differential nodal precession (which\noccurs in absence of the disc), and forces planetesimals to precess with the\ndisc on average. For bodies of different size the orbit planes become modestly\nmutually inclined, leading to collisional velocities that inhibit growth. For\nlarger inclinations (45 degrees), the Kozai effect operates, leading to\ndestructively large relative velocities. Conclusions. Planet formation via\nplanetesimal accretion is difficult in an inclined binary system with\nparameters similar to those considered in this paper.

For a qualitative\nestimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal\nphase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our\nmodel is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The\ndifference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low\nfrequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in\nlarger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and\nrheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the\nsame rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being\nnegligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the\nseismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)\nbecomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what\none might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate\ndeviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,\nand this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in\nmagnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the\nprimary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses\nthe synchronous orbit.

To\nimplement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by\nendowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale\nto the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle.

Planets with dusty\natmospheres may exhibit detectable amounts of linear polarization in the\nnear-infrared, as has been observed from some field L dwarfs. The asymmetry\nrequired in the thermal radiation field to produce polarization may arise\neither from the rotation-induced oblateness or from surface inhomogeneities,\nsuch as partial cloudiness. While it is not possible at present to predict the\nextent to which atmospheric dynamics on a given planet may produce surface\ninhomogeneities substantial enough to produce net non-zero disk integrated\npolarization, the contribution of rotation-induced oblateness can be estimated.\nUsing a self-consistent, spatially homogeneous atmospheric model and a multiple\nscattering polarization formalism for this class of exoplanets, we show that\npolarization on the order of 1% may arise due to the rotation-induced\noblateness of the planets. The degree of polarization for cloudy planets should\npeak at the same wavelengths at which the planets are brightest in the\nnear-infrared. The observed polarization may be even higher if surface\ninhomogeneities exist and play a significant role.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc.

To realize this\nidea in galaxies we use a particular DM cored profile that contains three\nparameters: a scale length (rs) and density (rho_0) of the halo, and a core\nradius (rc) stemming from the relativistic nature of the BDM model. We test\nthis model by fitting rotation curves of seventeen Low Surface Brightness\ngalaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). Since the energy Ec\nparameterizes the phase transition due to the underlying particle physics\nmodel, it is independent on the details of galaxy or structure formation and\ntherefore the DM profile parameters rs, rc, Ec are constrained, leaving only\ntwo free parameters.

To complement the existing numerical\nstudies, we focus on the primary physical variables such as the spatial profile\nof the wave, torque density, and the angular momentum flux carried by the wave,\ninstead of secondary quantities such as the planetary migration rate. Our\nresults show percent level agreement with theory in both physical and Fourier\nspace. New phenomena such as the change of the toque density sign far from the\nplanet are discovered and discussed. Also, we explore the effect of the\nnumerical algorithms, and find that a high order of accuracy, high resolution,\nand an accurate planetary potential are crucial to achieve good agreement with\nthe theory. We find that the use of a too large time-step without properly\nresolving the dynamical time scale around the planet produces incorrect\nresults, and may lead to spurious gap opening. Global simulations of planet\nmigration and gap opening violating this requirement may be affected by\nspurious effects resulting in e.g. the incorrect planetary migration rate and\ngap opening mass. \n\n"}

We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of\nTaurus-Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in\norder to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply\nthat the tidal influence of a close (<40 AU) binary companion significantly\nhastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ~2/3 of all close\nbinaries promptly disperse their disks within <1 Myr after formation. However,\nprompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and\nsingle stars, with ~80%-90% retaining their disks for at least ~2--3 Myr (but\nrarely for more than ~5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing\ntimescale have significant implications for giant planet formation; most single\nstars have 3--5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close\nbinary systems would have to form giant planets within <1 Myr. If core\naccretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in\nclose binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a\nsimilar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity\nin RV surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is\nvery well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the\ndisk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation. \n\n"}

From\nthe amplitude of the beaming modulation we derived a mass of 10 +/- 2 M_Jup for\nthe secondary, suggesting that KOI-13.01 was a massive planet, with one of the\nlargest known radii.

The difference in crater density between the youngest and oldest\nrecognized units implies a difference in age of more than a factor of 10.

Our work is based on a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20\nmicron silicate emission features for brown dwarfs in the Taurus-Auriga\nstar-forming region. A fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfs\nexhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk,\ncompared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our\ntargets, we find a flat disk structure, which is consistent with the stronger\nsigns of dust processing observed in these disks. For the case of one brown\ndwarf, 2M04230607, we find the forsterite mass fraction to be a factor of ~3\nhigher in the outer disk compared to the inner disk region. Simple large-scale\nradial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical\ncomposition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in\nthis disk. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer\ncold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets. In\nthis context, we have discussed the applicability of the various mechanisms\nthat have been proposed for comets on the formation and the outward transport\nof high-temperature material.

A previous investigation\nof the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided an estimate for the\nFPP of less than 5% for most of the candidates.

The observed dearth of nearby ($\\leq 5$ AU) brown dwarf companions to\nsolar-mass stars, known as the brown dwarf desert, as well as the tendency for\nlow-mass binary systems to be more tightly-bound than stellar binaries, have\nbeen cited as evidence for distinct formation mechanisms for brown dwarfs and\nstars. In this paper, we explore the implications of the minimal hypothesis\nthat brown dwarfs in binary systems originate via the same fundamental\nfragmentation mechanism as stars, within isolated, turbulent giant molecular\ncloud cores. We demonstrate analytically that the scaling of specific angular\nmomentum with turbulent core mass naturally gives rise to the brown dwarf\ndesert, as well as wide brown-dwarf binary systems. Further, we show that the\nturbulent core fragmentation model also naturally predicts that very low-mass\n(VLM) binary and BD/BD systems are more tightly-bound than stellar systems.

Socrates et al. (2012) argued that high\neccentricity migration (HEM) mechanisms proposed for situating these close-in\nplanets should produce an observable population of highly eccentric proto-hot\nJupiters that have not yet tidally circularized. HEM should also create\nfailed-hot Jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fast\ncircularization. Using the technique we previously presented for measuring\neccentricities from photometry (the \"photoeccentric effect\"), we are distilling\na collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot Jupiters from the Kepler\nObjects of Interest (KOI). Here we present the first, KOI-1474.01, which has a\nlong orbital period (69.7340 days) and a large eccentricity e =\n0.81+0.10/-0.07, skirting the proto-hot Jupiter boundary.

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation.

Above a certain forcing\nthreshold, the mean flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric motions within an\nequatorial belt. For fixed forcing above this threshold, we have studied the\ndynamo properties of this flow. The presence of a conducting outer wall is\nessential to the existence of a dynamo at these parameters. We have therefore\nstudied the effect of changing the material parameters of the wall (magnetic\npermeability, electrical conductivity, and thickness) on the dynamo. In common\nwith previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the\nconductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large. However, we find that\nthe effect of these two parameters on the dynamo process are different and can\neven compete to the detriment of the dynamo. Our self-consistent approach allow\nus to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are\ntypically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial\ndipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce\na strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting\nouter wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside. The generation of\nthe axisymmetric poloidal field, on the other hand, occurs in the equatorial\nbelt and does not depend on the wall properties. \n\n"}

The present work aims to better understand the properties of the\nobserved modes and the nature of their excitation.

Given the turbulent nature of star-forming\nmolecular clouds, it is possible that the gas falling onto the outer region of\na circumbinary disk and the central protostellar binary have different axes of\nrotation. Thus, the newly assembled circumbinary disk can be misaligned with\nrespect to the binary.

We have\nspatially resolved a debris disk around the remarkable M3-type star GJ581\nhosting multiple planets using deep PACS images at 70, 100 and 160 microns as\npart of the DEBRIS Program on the Herschel Space Observatory. This is the\nsecond spatially resolved debris disk found around an M-type star, after the\none surrounding the young star AU Mic (12 Myr). However, GJ 581 is much older\n(2-8 Gyr), and is X-ray quiet in the ROSAT data. We fit an axisymmetric model\nof the disk to the three PACS images and found that the best fit model is for a\ndisk extending radially from 25+/-12 AU to more than 60 AU. Such a cold disk is\nreminiscent of the Kuiper Belt but it surrounds a low mass star (0.3 M_sol) and\nits fractional dust luminosity L_dust/L_* of \\sim 10^-4 is much higher. The\ninclination limits of the disk found in our analysis make the masses of the\nplanets small enough to ensure the long-term stability of the system according\nto some dynamical simulations. The disk is collisionally dominated down to\nsubmicron-sized grains and the dust cannot be expelled from the system by\nradiation or wind pressures because of the low luminosity and low X-ray\nluminosity of GJ581. We suggest that the correlation between low-mass planets\nand debris disks recently found for G-type stars also applies to M-type\nstars.Finally, the known planets, of low masses and orbiting within 0.3 AU from\nthe star, cannot dynamically perturb the disk over the age of the star,\nsuggesting that an additional planet exists at larger distance that is stirring\nthe disk to replenish the dust. \n\n"}

Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the\ndistribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a\ntail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent\nwith previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

The wakes, which are excited by the planets, are damped by\nshocks similar to the wake damping in inviscid hydrodynamic (HD) disks. Angular\nmomentum deposition by shock damping opens gaps in both MHD turbulent disks and\ninviscid HD disks even for low mass planets, in contradiction to the \"thermal\ncriterion\" for gap opening. To test the \"viscous criterion\", we compared gap\nproperties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same\nstress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and\nwider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This\ndifference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap\nregion in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective \\alpha within the gap. Thus,\nacross the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density\nprofile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance\nthe planetary torque density.

Method and Applications Abstract: A comprehensive approach is provided to the study of both S-type and P-type\nhabitability in stellar binary systems, which in principle can also be expanded\nto systems of higher order. P-type orbits occur when the planet orbits both\nbinary components, whereas in case of S-type orbits the planet orbits only one\nof the binary components with the second component considered a perturbator.\nThe selected approach encapsulates a variety of different aspects, which\ninclude: (1) The consideration of a joint constraint including orbital\nstability and a habitable environment for a putative system planet through the\nstellar radiative energy fluxes (\"radiative habitable zone\"; RHZ) needs to be\nmet. (2) The treatment of conservative, general and extended zones of\nhabitability for the various systems as defined for the Solar System and\nbeyond. (3) The providing of a combined formalism for the assessment of both\nS-type and P-type habitability; in particular, mathematical criteria are\npresented for which kind of system S-type and P-type habitability is realized.\n(4) Applications of the attained theoretical approach to standard (theoretical)\nmain-sequence stars. In principle, five different cases of habitability are\nidentified, which are: S-type and P-type habitability provided by the full\nextent of the RHZs; habitability, where the RHZs are truncated by the\nadditional constraint of planetary orbital stability (referred to as ST and\nPT-type, respectively); and cases of no habitability at all. Regarding the\ntreatment of planetary orbital stability, we utilize the formulae of Holman &\nWiegert (1999) [AJ 117, 621], as also used by previous studies. In this work we\nfocus on binary systems in circular orbits.

Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the\ncontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring\nfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,\napparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted\nprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic\nvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again\nafter slightly more than one cycle.

The cumulative effect of close and\ndistant encounters on these planetary systems are investigated using Monte\nCarlo scattering experiments. We consider two types of planetary configurations\norbiting Sun-like stars: (i) five Jupiter-mass planets in the semi-major axis\nrange 1-42 AU orbiting a Solar mass star, with orbits that are initially\nco-planar, circular, and separated by 10 mutual Hill radii, and (ii) the four\ngas giants of our Solar system. Planets with short orbital periods are not\ndirectly affected by encountering stars. However, secular evolution of\nperturbed systems may result in the ejection of the innermost planets or in\nphysical collisions of the innermost planets with the host star, up to many\nthousands of years after a stellar encounter.

Two planets which are Hill stable are separated by a wide-enough\ndistance to ensure that they will never collide. However, Hill stable planetary\nsystems may eventually manifest Lagrange instability when the outer planet\nescapes or the inner planet collides with the star. We show empirically that\nfor two nearly coplanar Hill stable planets with eccentricities less than about\n0.3, instability can manifest itself only after a time corresponding to X\ninitial orbits of the inner planet, where log_{10}(X) is of the order of 5.2\nmu^{-0.18} and mu is the planet-star mass ratio measured in (Jupiter mass/Solar\nmass).

A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that\ntrapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0.2,\nprovided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one which is based on the\nDarwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model\nchanges dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First,\nwe discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3:2 resonance\nthis resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into\nthis (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several\ncrossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our\nmodel the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for\nmost histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar\nfriction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in\na capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our\npaper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state\nobtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture\njustifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose\nliquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a\ncritical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al.

In such cases, we show that the two limb\ndarkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,\ndescribing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal\nefficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming:\ntriangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform,\nbivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these\nparametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic,\nsquare-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws.

The recent observations of the alignment between the spin of pulsar\nA and the binary orbit is also in agreement with this scenario. Detailed\nsimulations of the formation process of pulsar B enable us to show that its\nprogenitor, just before the collapse, was a massive O-Ne-Mg white dwarf\nsurrounded by a tenuous, 0.1-0.16 M_sun, envelope.

For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds.

Understanding the possible outcomes for\nthe comet's response to such a close passage by the Sun is important for\nplanning observational campaigns and for inferring ISON's physical properties.\nWe present new numerical simulations and interpret them in context with the\nhistorical track record of comet disruptions and of sungrazing comet behavior.\nHistorical data suggest that sizes below ~200 m are susceptible to destruction\nby sublimation driven mass loss, while we find that for ISON's perihelion\ndistance, densities lower than 0.1 g cm^-3 are required to tidally disrupt a\nretrograde or non-spinning body.

In addition, we test\nhow the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a\ndetonation in the helium shell.

Such ordered fields\ncan be measured in the case of planets, stars, and galaxies, or inferred\nindirectly by the action of their dynamical influence, such as jets. Whether\nlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of\nan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic\nactivity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic\nfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution\nfor both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic\nproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic\nenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic\nhelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the\nlargest scale available. Here I discuss how magnetic helicity has come to help\nus understand the saturation of and sustenance of large scale dynamos, the need\nfor either local or global helicity fluxes to avoid dynamo quenching, and the\nassociated observational consequences. I also discuss how magnetic helicity\nacts as a hindrance to turbulent diffusion of large scale fields, and thus a\nhelper for fossil remnant large scale field origin models in some contexts. I\nbriefly discuss the connection between large scale fields and accretion disk\ntheory as well. The goal here is to provide a conceptual primer to help the\nreader efficiently penetrate the literature. \n\n"}

By simulating a small local patch of a rotating fluid,\n\\cite{Barker2014} have recently shown that tides can drive small-scale dynamos\nby exciting a hydrodynamic instability, the so-called elliptical (or tidal)\ninstability.

We are thus interested by the dynamo\nthreshold and the generated magnetic field in order to test if such a mechanism\nis relevant for planets and stars.

This allows us\nto use an efficient spectral code to solve the magnetohydrodynamic problem. We\nfirst compare the hydrodynamic results with theoretical asymptotic results, and\nnumerical results obtained in a truely deformed ellipsoid, which confirms the\npresence of the elliptical instability.

Such disks with barotropic equilibria can be\napproximately modeled using the shearing box framework, representing a small\ndisk volume with height-independent angular frequency. If the disk is in\nbaroclinic equilibrium, the angular frequency does generally depend on height,\nand it is thus necessary to go beyond the standard shearing box approach. In\nthis paper, we show that given a global disk model, it is possible to develop\napproximate models that are local in horizontal planes without an expansion in\nheight with shearing-periodic boundary conditions.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity.

This augmented method is presented here, and numerous\napplications are conveyed. In alignment with Paper I, the selected approach\nconsiders a variety of aspects, which comprise the consideration of a joint\nconstraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible\nsystem planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (\"radiative habitable\nzone\"; RHZ). The devised method is based on a combined formalism for the\nassessment of both S-type and P-type habitability; in particular, mathematical\ncriteria are deduced for which kinds of systems S-type and P-type habitable\nzones are realized. If the RHZs are truncated by the additional constraint of\norbital stability, the notation of ST-type and PT-type habitability applies. In\ncomparison to the circular case, it is found that in systems of higher\neccentricity, the range of the RHZs is significantly reduced. Moreover, for a\nconsiderable number of models, the orbital stability constraint also reduces\nthe range of S-type and P-type habitability.

Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need\nto explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent\nsystematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse\ndepths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented\nhere exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of\nUCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend.

We propose that\nthis correlation is due to the absorption by circumstellar matter that comes\nfrom the evaporation of the planets.

We have\ninvestigated orbital evolution in a formation scenario for such planets, based\non core accretion model: i) Icy cores accrete from planetesimals at $\\lesssim$\n30AU, ii) they are scattered outward by an emerging nearby gas giant to acquire\nhighly eccentric orbits, and iii) their orbits are circularized through\naccretion of disk gas in outer regions, where they spend most of time. We\nanalytically derived equations to describe the orbital circularization through\nthe gas accretion. Numerical integrations of these equations show that the\neccentricity decreases by a factor of more than 5 during the planetary mass\nincreases by a factor of 10.

A possible channel for producing such\nmisaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's\norbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a\nrecent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot\nJupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often\nchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. Here we explore the\norigin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealized\nnon-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit are\nstrictly periodic. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set of\nsecular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of these\nresonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolution\nof stellar spin axis. The degree of chaos in the system depends on the\nadiabaticity parameter $\\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the Lidov-Kozai\nnodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends on\nthe planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate. For systems\nwith zero initial spin-orbit misalignment, our theory explains the occurrence\n(as a function of $\\epsilon$) of \"periodic islands\" in the middle of a \"chaotic\nocean\" of spin evolution, and the occurrence of restricted chaos in middle of\nregular/periodic spin evolution. Finally, we discuss a novel \"adiabatic\nresonance advection\" phenomenon, in which the spin-orbit misalignment, trapped\nin a resonance, gradually evolves as the adiabaticity parameter slowly changes.\nThis phenomenon can occur for certain parameter regimes when tidal decay of the\nplanetary orbit is included. \n\n"}

In addition to detection,\nthe precise photometry provides phase curves of exoplanets, which can be used\nto study the dynamic processes on these planets. However, the interpretation of\nthese observations can be complicated by the fact that visible-wavelength phase\ncurves can represent both thermal emission and scattering from the planets.\nHere we present a semi-analytical model framework that can be applied to study\nKepler and future visible-wavelength phase curve observations of exoplanets.\nThe model efficiently computes reflection and thermal emission components for\nboth rocky and gaseous planets, considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous\nsurfaces or atmospheres. We analyze the phase curves of the gaseous planet\nKepler-7 b and the rocky planet Kepler-10 b using the model. In general, we\nfind that a hot exoplanet's visible-wavelength phase curve having a significant\nphase offset can usually be explained by two classes of solutions: one class\nrequires a thermal hot spot shifted to one side of the substellar point, and\nthe other class requires reflective clouds concentrated on the same side of the\nsubstellar point. The two solutions would require very different Bond albedos\nto fit the same phase curve; atmospheric circulation models or eclipse\nobservations at longer wavelengths can effectively rule out one class of\nsolutions, and thus pinpoint the albedo of the planet, allowing decomposition\nof the reflection and the thermal emission components in the phase curve.\nParticularly for Kepler-7 b, reflective clouds located on the west side of the\nsubstellar point can best explain its phase curve. We further derive that the\nreflectivity of the clear part of the atmosphere should be less than 7% and\nthat of the cloudy part should be greater than 80% (abridged) \n\n"}

Planet-metallicity correlations Abstract: Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation,\nrequires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gas\ngiant planets. The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling\nin the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around\nmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide\nrange of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these\nobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation\nhypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis\ncalculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations\nof the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and\nnot even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the\ninner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star\nmetallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these\nsmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around\nthe Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low\nmetallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,\nwhereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow\ncontract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally,\nsimulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity\npreference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known\ndirectly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor. \n\n"}

The planetesimal\n- gaseous-disk interactions give rise to migration and orbital evolution of the\nplanetesimals/planets. Small planetesimals are dominated by aerodynamic gas\ndrag. Large protoplanets, $m\\sim0.1M_{\\oplus}$, are dominated by type I\nmigration \\emph{differential} torque. There is an additional mass range,\n$m\\sim10^{21}-10^{25}g$ of \\emph{intermediate mass} planetesimals (IMPs), where\ngravitational interactions with the disk dominate over aerodynamic gas drag,\nbut for which such interactions were typically neglected. Here we model these\ninteractions using the \\emph{gas dynamical friction} (GDF) approach, previously\nused to study the disk-planet interactions at the planetary mass range. We find\nthe critical size where GDF dominates over gas drag, and then study the\nimplications of GDF on single IMPs. We find that planetesimals with small\ninclinations rapidly become co-planar. Eccentric orbits circularize within a\nfew Myrs, provided the the planetesimal mass is large, $m\\gtrsim10^{23}g$ and\nthat the initial eccentricity is low, $e\\lesssim0.1$.

This can lead to an\nover-abundance of rocky material (in the form of IMPs) in the inner\nprotoplanetary disk ($<1$AU) and induce rapid planetary growth. This can\nexplain the origin of super-Earth planets. In addition, GDF damps the\nvelocities of IMPs, thereby cooling the planetesimal disk and affecting its\ncollisional evolution through quenching the effects of viscous stirring by the\nlarge bodies. \n\n"}

To use observational resources most\nefficiently we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can\nform. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of\nwater (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.\nWe want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice\nlines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic\nequilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our\nsemi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)\naccretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed\nplanet evolution tracks. We consider planets accreting 1 to 12 Jupiter masses\nat distances between 1 and 20 AU to a Sun-like star. Accretion disks around\nJupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O\nice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close\nas ~3 AU to Sun-like stars. Super-Jovian planets forming beyond ~5 AU can host\nMars-mass moons. We study a broad range of disk parameters for planets at 5.2\nAU and find that the H2O ice lines are universally between ~15 and 30 Jupiter\nradii when the last generation of moons is forming. If the abundant population\nof super-Jovian planets at ~1 AU formed in situ, then they should lack giant\nicy moons because their disks did not host H2O ice in the final stages of\naccretion. In the more likely case that these planets migrated to their current\nlocations from beyond a few AU, they might be orbited by large, H2O-rich moons.\nIn this case, Mars-mass ocean moons might be common in the stellar habitable\nzones.

The spectrum and light curve are\nvery similar to slow-declining SLSNe such as PTF12dam. However, detections\nwithin ~1 day after explosion show a bright and relatively fast initial peak,\nlasting for ~15 days, prior to the usual slow rise to maximum light.

It is too bright and narrow to be explained as a\nnormal 56Ni-powered SN, and we suggest that interaction models may struggle to\nfit the two peaks simultaneously.

As disc fragmentation results in the formation of several bodies\nat comparable distances to the host star, their orbits are generally unstable.\nHere, we study the dynamical evolution of these objects. We set up the initial\nconditions based on the outcomes of the SPH simulations of Stamatellos &\nWhitworth, and for comparison we also study the evolution of systems resulting\nfrom lower-mass fragmenting discs. We refer to these two sets of simulations as\nset 1 and set 2.

Previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannot\nexplain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and high\ncontrast of the spiral arms in observations. We have carried out three\ndimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks\nexcited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the\npitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be\nexplained by the non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a\ntertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive\nplanet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have\nlarger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in\nthe azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in\nthe outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have\nsignificant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk\natmosphere. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer\ncalculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably more\nprominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3-D hydrodynamical models than\nimages based on 2-D models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium,\nindicating the need to model observations with full 3-D hydrodynamics.

Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc.

The similarity in their peak centroids and the significant positive\ncorrelation between their equivalent widths demonstrate that these transitions\ntrace the same atomic gas. The absorption lines are present towards both disk\nand diskless young stellar objects, which excludes cold gas within the\ncircumstellar disk as the absorbing material. A comparison of NaI and CO\ndetections and peak centroids demonstrates that the atomic and molecular gas\nare not co-located, the atomic gas is more extended than the molecular gas. The\nwidth of the atomic lines corroborates this finding and points to atomic gas\nabout an order of magnitude warmer than the molecular gas. The distribution of\nNaI radial velocities shows a clear spatial gradient along the length of the\nTaurus molecular cloud filaments. This suggests that absorption is associated\nwith the Taurus molecular cloud. Assuming the gradient is due to cloud\nrotation, the rotation of the atomic gas is consistent with differential\ngalactic rotation while the rotation of the molecular gas, although with the\nsame rotation axis, is retrograde. Our analysis shows that narrow NaI and KI\nabsorption resonance lines are useful tracers of the atomic envelope of\nmolecular clouds. In line with recent findings from giant molecular clouds, our\nresults demonstrate that the velocity fields of the atomic and molecular gas\nare misaligned. The angular momentum of a molecular cloud is not simply\ninherited from the rotating Galactic disk from which it formed but may be\nredistributed by cloud-cloud interactions. \n\n"}

We derive the planet radius distribution\nfunction for Kepler stars of different spectral types, sampling a range in host\nstar masses. We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets\n(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer\nNeptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth). We find no systematic trend in\nthe planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the\nincreasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass-radius relationship\nand heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are\nindependent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass\nlocked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where\nKepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average\nheavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with\nstellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7\nM_Earth in M stars.

This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer.

In\nparticular, the effects of stellar surface inhomogeneities on observed stellar\nradial velocities are extremely difficult to characterize, and thus developing\noptimal correction techniques to extract true stellar radial velocities is\nextremely challenging.

Gas distribution Abstract: Motivated by lopsided structures observed in some massive transition discs,\nwe have carried out 2D numerical simulations to study vortex structure in\nmassive discs, including the effects of disc self-gravity and the indirect\nforce which is due to the displacement of the central star from the barycenter\nof the system by the lopsided structure. When only the indirect force is\nincluded, we confirm the finding by Mittal & Chiang (2015) that the vortex\nbecomes stronger and can be more than two pressure scale heights wide, as long\nas the disc-to-star mass ratio is >1%. Such wide vortices can excite strong\ndensity waves in the disc and therefore migrate inwards rapidly. However, when\ndisc self-gravity is also considered in simulations, self-gravity plays a more\nprominent role on the vortex structure. We confirm that when the disc Toomre Q\nparameter is smaller than pi/(2h), where h is the disc's aspect ratio, the\nvortices are significantly weakened and their inward migration slows down\ndramatically. Most importantly, when the disc is massive enough (e.g. Q~3), we\nfind that the lopsided gas structure orbits around the star at a speed\nsignificantly slower than the local Keplerian speed. This sub-Keplerian pattern\nspeed can lead to the concentration of dust particles at a radius beyond the\nlopsided gas structure (as shown in Paper II).

We obtain maximum shift angles of about 25 degrees. Gas self-gravity\naccentuates the concentration differences between small and large grains. At\nlow to moderate disc masses, the larger the grains, the farther they are\ntrapped ahead of the vortex. Shift angles up to 90 degrees are reached for 10\ncm-sized grains, and we show that such large offsets can produce a\ndouble-peaked continuum emission observable at mm/cm wavelengths. This\nbehaviour comes about because the large grains undergo horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex due to the vortex's gravity. At large disc masses, since\nthe vortex's pattern frequency becomes increasingly slower than Keplerian,\nsmall grains concentrate slightly beyond the vortex and large grains form\ngenerally non-axisymmetric ring-like structures around the vortex's radial\nlocation.

We\nshow that the resonant dynamics can be described using only two fundamental\nparameters, the total angular momentum and the scaling parameter.

Aims. We perform\nthe first resolved and low-frequency imaging of the synchrotron emission with\nLOFAR at 127 MHz.

The first resolved images of Jupiter's\nradiation belts at 127-172 MHz are obtained along with total integrated flux\ndensities. They are compared with previous observations at higher frequencies\nand show a larger extent of the synchrotron emission source (>=4 $R_J$).

Instead, the He I emissions become progressively\nnarrower and symmetric. A sudden increase in flux of all He I lines is observed\nbetween 300 and 600 days.

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship\nbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In\npractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere\nof influence of the planet.

Optical phase curves have not\nyet been used to constrain these atmospheric properties consistently. We\nre-model previously published phase curves of CoRoT-1b, TrES-2b and HAT-P-7b\nand infer albedos and recirculation efficiencies.

This model takes Lambertian\nreflection, thermal emission, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler boosting into\naccount. CoRoT-1b shows a non-negligible scattering albedo (0.11<AS<0.3 at 95%\nconfidence) as well as small day-night temperature contrasts, indicative of\nmoderate to high re-distribution of energy between dayside and nightside. These\nvalues are contrary to previous secondary eclipse and phase curve analyses. In\nthe case of HAT-P-7b, model results suggest relatively high scattering albedo\n(AS=0.3).

This result was utilized for the initial setup of the second stage\nsimulations in which the runaway bodies just outside the ice line were replaced\nby the protoplanets with about the isolation mass. In the second stage\nsimulations, the outward migration of the protoplanet was followed by the\nstopping of the migration due to the increase of the random velocity of the\nplanetesimals. Due to this increase of random velocities, one of the PDM\ncriteria derived in Minton and Levison (2014) was broken. In the current\nsimulations, the effect of the gas disk is not considered. It is likely that\nthe gas disk plays an important role in planetesimal driven migration, and we\nplan to study its effect in future papers. \n\n"}

This strategy has been shown to give better results, as\nfixing the coefficients to theoretical values can give rise to important\nsystematic errors which directly impact the physical properties of the system\nderived from such lightcurves such as the planetary radius. However, studies of\nthe effect of limb darkening assumptions on the retrieved parameters have\nmostly focused on the widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out\nother proposed laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model\nintensity profiles. In this work, we show that laws such as the logarithmic,\nsquare-root and three-parameter law do a better job than the quadratic and\nlinear laws when deriving parameters from transit lightcurves, both in terms of\nbias and precision, for a wide range of situations. We therefore recommend to\nstudy which law to use on a case-by-case basis. We provide code to guide the\ndecision of when to use each of these laws and select the optimal one in a\nmean-square error sense, which we note has a dependence on both stellar and\ntransit parameters.

Due to the special orbital configuration of the HAT-P-13 system, the\nmagnitude of HAT-P-13b's eccentricity ($e_b$) is in part dictated by its Love\nnumber ($k_{2_b}$), which is in turn a proxy for the degree of central mass\nconcentration in its interior. Thus, the measurement of $e_b$ constrains\n$k_{2_b}$ and allows us to place otherwise elusive constraints on the mass of\nHAT-P-13b's core ($M_{\\rm{core,b}}$).

Here we present resolved\nALMA observations of 13CO 3-2, C18O 3-2, 13CO 6-5, and C18O 6-5 emission in TW\nHya, which allow us to derive radial gas temperature and gas surface density\nprofiles, as well as map the CO abundance as a function of radius. These\nobservations provide a measurement of the surface CO snowline at ~30 AU and\nshow evidence for an outer ring of CO emission centered at 53 AU, a feature\npreviously seen only in less abundant species. Further, the derived CO gas\ntemperature profile constrains the freeze-out temperature of CO in the warm\nmolecular layer to < 21 K. Combined with the previous detection of HD 1-0,\nthese data constrain the surface density of the warm H2 gas in the inner ~30\nAU.

The aim of this paper is to provide\nrobust numbers for the incidence of debris discs around FGK stars in the solar\nneighbourhood. The full sample of 177 FGK stars with d<20 pc proposed for the\nDUNES survey is presented. Herschel/PACS observations at 100 and 160 micron\ncomplemented with data at 70 micron, and at 250, 350 and 500 micron SPIRE\nphotometry, were obtained. The 123 objects observed by the DUNES collaboration\nwere presented in a previous paper. The remaining 54 stars, shared with the\nDEBRIS consortium and observed by them, and the combined full sample are\nstudied in this paper. The incidence of debris discs per spectral type is\nanalysed and put into context together with other parameters of the sample,\nlike metallicity, rotation and activity, and age.\n  The subsample of 105 stars with d<15 pc containing 23 F, 33 G and 49 K stars,\nis complete for F stars, almost complete for G stars and contains a substantial\nnumber of K stars to draw solid conclusions on objects of this spectral type.\nThe incidence rates of debris discs per spectral type 0.26 (6 objects with\nexcesses out of 23 F stars), 0.21 (7 out of 33 G stars) and 0.20 (10 out of 49\nK stars), the fraction for all three spectral types together being 0.22 (23 out\nof 105 stars).

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU\nWorking Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in\n2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary and\nfundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on\noptimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU\n2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The\nresolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are\nby definition exact and are expressed in SI units.

We present a follow-up study of this system\nbased on multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. Two new\ntransit events of WASP-98b were simultaneously observed in four passbands\n(g,r,i,z), using the telescope-defocussing technique, yielding eight\nhigh-precision light curves with point-to-point scatters of less than 1 mmag.\nWe also collected three spectra of the parent star with a high-resolution\nspectrograph, which we used to remeasure its spectral characteristics, in\nparticular its metallicity. We found this to be very low, Fe/H]=-0.49, but\nlarger than was previously reported, [Fe/H]=-0.60. We used these new\nphotometric and spectroscopic data to refine the orbital and physical\nproperties of this planetary system, finding that the stellar and planetary\nmass measurements are significantly larger than those in the discovery paper.\nIn addition, the multi-band light curves were used to construct an optical\ntransmission spectrum of WASP-98b and probe the characteristics of its\natmosphere at the terminator. We measured a lower radius at z compared with the\nother three passbands. The maximum variation is between the r and z bands, has\na confidence level of roughly 6 sigma and equates to 5.5 pressure scale\nheights. We compared this spectrum to theoretical models, investigating several\npossible types of atmospheres, including hazy, cloudy, cloud-free, and clear\natmospheres with titanium and vanadium oxide opacities. We could not find a\ngood fit to the observations, except in the extreme case of a clear atmosphere\nwith TiO and VO opacities, in which the condensation of Ti and V was\nsuppressed. As this case is unrealistic, our results suggest the presence of an\nadditional optical-absorbing species in the atmosphere of WASP-98b, of unknown\nchemical nature. \n\n"}

We also\ndeveloped depth-dependent corrections for the solar 1D model, for which we\nexpanded the geometrical depth to match the pressure stratification of the\nsolar <3D> model, and we reduced the density that is caused by the turbulent\npressure. We obtain the same results with our <3D> models as have been reported\npreviously. Our depth-dependent corrected 1D models match the observations to\nalmost a similar extent as the <3D> model.

We demonstrate quantitatively that the\npredicted and observed structure of such discs are prime birthsites of planets.\nPlanet formation is likely to proceed through pebble accretion, should a\nplanetary embryo ($M\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,$M$_\\oplus$) form. Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat\nthe disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc\nlocally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity. Using numerical simulations we\ndemonstrate that this source of vorticity can lead to the growth of a single\nlarge scale vortex in $\\sim 100$ orbits, which is capable of trapping\nparticles. Finally, we suggest an evolutionary cycle: planet formation proceeds\nthrough pebble accretion, followed by vortex formation and particle trapping in\nthe vortex quenching the planetary accretion and thus removing the vorticity\nsource. After the vortex is destroyed the process can begin anew. This means\ntransition discs should present with large scale vortices for a significant\nfraction of their lifetimes and remnant planets at large ~10AU separation\nshould be a common outcome of this cycle. \n\n"}

HD 59686 Ab: a massive\n  circumstellar planet orbiting a giant star in a ~13.6 au eccentric binary\n  system Abstract: Context: For over 12 yr, we have carried out a precise radial velocity survey\nof a sample of 373 G and K giant stars using the Hamilton \\'Echelle\nSpectrograph at Lick Observatory. There are, among others, a number of multiple\nplanetary systems in our sample as well as several planetary candidates in\nstellar binaries. Aims: We aim at detecting and characterizing\nsubstellar+stellar companions to the giant star HD 59686 A (HR 2877, HIP\n36616). Methods: We obtained high precision radial velocity (RV) measurements\nof the star HD 59686 A. By fitting a Keplerian model to the periodic changes in\nthe RVs, we can assess the nature of companions in the system. In order to\ndiscriminate between RV variations due to non-radial pulsation or stellar spots\nwe used infrared RVs taken with the CRIRES spectrograph at the Very Large\nTelescope. Additionally, to further characterize the system, we obtain\nhigh-resolution images with LMIRCam at the Large Binocular Telescope. Results:\nWe report the likely discovery of a giant planet with a mass of $m_{p}~\\sin\ni=6.92_{-0.24}^{+0.18}~M_{Jup}$ orbiting at $a_{p}=1.0860_{-0.0007}^{+0.0006}$\nau from the giant star HD 59686 A. Besides the planetary signal, we discover an\neccentric ($e_{B}=0.729_{-0.003}^{+0.004}$) binary companion with a mass of\n$m_{B}~\\sin i=0.5296_{-0.0008}^{+0.0011}~M_{Sun}$ orbiting at a semi-major axis\nof just $a_{B}=13.56_{-0.14}^{+0.18}$ au. Conclusions: The existence of the\nplanet HD 59686 Ab in a tight eccentric binary system severely challenges\nstandard giant planet formation theories and requires substantial improvements\nto such theories in tight binaries. Otherwise, alternative planet formation\nscenarios such as second generation planets or dynamical interactions in an\nearly phase of the system's lifetime should be seriously considered in order to\nbetter understand the origin of this enigmatic planet. \n\n"}

Taking full advantage of JWST spectroscopy of planets from 0.6um to\n28um, however, will require many observations with a combination of the NIRISS,\nNIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI instruments. In this white paper, we discuss a new\nNIRCam mode (not yet approved or implemented) that can reduce the number of\nnecessary observations to cover the 1.0um to 5.0um wavelength range. Even\nthough NIRCam was designed primarily as an imager, it also includes several\ngrisms for phasing and aligning JWST's 18 hexagonal mirror segments. NIRCam's\nlong-wavelength channel includes grisms that cover 2.4um to 5.0um with a\nresolving power of R = 1200 - 1550 using two separate configurations. The\nlong-wavelength grisms have already been approved for science operations,\nincluding wide field and single object (time series) slitless spectroscopy.

The consequent multimodality of the\nlikelihood function leads to extremely challenging search, optimization, and\nMCMC posterior sampling over the orbital parameters. Here we create a custom\nMonte Carlo sampler for sparse or noisy radial-velocity measurements of\ntwo-body systems that can produce posterior samples for orbital parameters even\nwhen the likelihood function is poorly behaved. The six standard orbital\nparameters for a binary system can be split into four non-linear parameters\n(period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters\n(velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a\nsampling method in which we densely sample the prior pdf in the non-linear\nparameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function\nmarginalized over the linear parameters. With sparse or uninformative data, the\nsampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense.\nWith informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too\nsparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC.

We show that this process can be understood as a modified,\nPCA-like process that produces porous, but non-fractal particles whose filling\nfactor is chiefly determined by the porosity of the building blocks.\n  We also show that in a coagulation environment where relative velocities are\ndriven by turbulence, a logarithmically flat mass distribution (equal mass per\nmass decade) as it is typically found in environments where fragmentation\nreplenishes small grains, leads to a situation where small particles and\naggregates dominate the growth of large ones. Therefore, in such environments,\nhierarchical growth should be seen as the norm. Consequently, we predict that\nthe aggregates in such environments are not fractals with extremely low\ndensities as they would result from extrapolation fractal laws to large sizes.\nThe compactification of aggregates does not only result from collisions with\nenough energy to restructure aggregates - it starts already earlier by filling\nvoids in particles with smaller grains that contribute to the growth. \n\n"}

The gas-phase N/O ratio\nenhancement in the outer disk (exterior to the H2O snowline) exceeds the C/O\nratio enhancement for all reasonable volatile compositions.

Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged) \n\n"}

In this Paper we present a scenario for the\nformation and orbital architecture of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In our model,\nplanet formation starts at the H2O iceline, where pebble-size particles --\nwhose origin is the outer disk -- concentrate to trigger streaming\ninstabilities. After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by\npebble accretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet's\ngravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets are\ntransported by Type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall at the\nmagnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. During disk\ndispersal, the cavity radius expands and the inner-most planets escape\nresonance.

This event\nwas located near the $K2$ Campaign 9 field that was observed by a large number\nof telescopes. As a result, the event was in the microlensing survey area of a\nnumber of these telescopes, and this enabled good coverage of the planetary\nlight curve signal. High angular resolution adaptive optics images from the\nKeck telescope reveal excess flux at the position of the source above the flux\nof the source star, as indicated by the light curve model. This excess flux\ncould be due to the lens star, but it could also be due to a companion to the\nsource or lens star, or even an unrelated star. We consider all these\npossibilities in a Bayesian analysis in the context of a standard Galactic\nmodel. Our analysis indicates that it is unlikely that a large fraction of the\nexcess flux comes from the lens, unless solar type stars are much more likely\nto host planets of this mass ratio than lower mass stars.

Planet formation with pebbles has been proposed to solve a couple of\nlong-standing issues in the classical formation model. Some sophisticated\nsimulations have been done to confirm the efficiency of pebble accretion.\nHowever, there has not been any global N-body simulations that compare the\noutcomes of planet formation via pebble accretion with observed extrasolar\nplanetary systems. Aims. In this paper, we study the effects of a range of\ninitial parameters of planet formation via pebble accretion, and present the\nfirst results of our simulations. Methods. We incorporate the pebble accretion\nmodel by Ida et al. (2016) in the N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al. 1998), along\nwith the effects of gas accretion, eccentricity and inclination damping and\nplanet migration in the disc. Results. We confirm that pebble accretion leads\nto a variety of planetary systems, but have difficulty in reproducing observed\nproperties of exoplanetary systems, such as planetary mass, semimajor axis, and\neccentricity distributions. The main reason behind this is a too-efficient type\nI migration, which sensitively depends on the disc model. However, our\nsimulations also lead to a few interesting predictions. First, we find that\nformation efficiencies of planets depend on the stellar metallicities, not only\nfor giant planets, but also for Earths (Es) and Super-Earths (SEs). The\ndependency for Es/SEs is subtle. Although higher metallicity environments lead\nto faster formation of a larger number of Es/SEs, they also tend to be lost\nlater via dynamical instability. Second, our results indicate that a wide range\nof bulk densities observed for Es and SEs is a natural consequence of dynamical\nevolution of planetary systems. Third, the ejection trend of our simulations\nsuggest that one free-floating E/SE may be expected for two smaller-mass\nplanets. \n\n"}

This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a\nplanetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of\nplanets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise\nsynchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin\nstate, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with\nfull surface coverage on the order of years or decades.

In this article, I present an analytical model of\nresonant chains of any number of planets. Using this model, I show that a\nsystem captured in a resonant chain can librate around several possible\nequilibrium configurations. The probability of capture around each equilibrium\ndepends on how the chain formed, and especially on the order in which the\nplanets have been captured in the chain. Therefore, for an observed resonant\nchain, knowing around which equilibrium the chain is librating allows for\nconstraints to be put on the formation and migration scenario of the system. I\napply this reasoning to the four planets orbiting Kepler-223 in a 3:4:6:8\nresonant chain. I show that the system is observed around one of the six\nequilibria predicted by the analytical model.

In particular, Schwarzschild space curvature (static) and\nframe-dragging (stationary) due to the planet's spin affect the satellite's\norbit.

Since the structure of many of these planets is\nsuch that the mass is dominated by a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by\na tenuous gas envelope, the sticky-sphere approximation, used in dynamical\nintegrators, may be a poor model for these collisions.

In all models of early growth, there are\nseveral processes that can inhibit grains from reaching larger sizes.\nNevertheless, observations suggest that growth of planetesimals must be rapid.\nIf a small number of 100 km sized planetesimals do manage to form in the disc,\nthen gas drag effects could enable them to efficiently accrete small solids\nfrom beyond their gravitationally focused cross-section. This gas drag-enhanced\naccretion can allow planetesimals to grow at rapid rates, in principle. We\npresent self-consistent hydrodynamics simulations with direct particle\nintegration and gas drag coupling to estimate the rate of planetesimal growth\ndue to pebble accretion. Wind tunnel simulations are used to explore a range of\nparticle sizes and disc conditions. We also explore analytic estimates of\nplanetesimal growth and numerically integrate planetesimal drift due to the\naccretion of small solids. Our results show that, for almost every case that we\nconsider, there is a clearly preferred particle size for accretion that depends\non the properties of the accreting planetesimal and the local disc conditions.\nFor solids much smaller than the preferred particle size, accretion rates are\nsignificantly reduced as the particles are entrained in the gas and flow around\nthe planetesimal. Solids much larger than the preferred size accrete at rates\nconsistent with gravitational focusing. Our analytic estimates for pebble\naccretion highlight the timescales that are needed for the growth of large\nobjects under different disc conditions and initial planetesimal sizes. \n\n"}

In Paper I we described\nour global planet formation and evolution model. In Paper II we studied the\nplanetary mass-radius relationship. Here we present an extensive study of the\nstatistics of planetary luminosities during both formation and evolution. Our\nresults can be compared with individual directly imaged (proto)planets as well\nas statistical results from surveys. We calculated three synthetic planet\npopulations assuming different efficiencies of the accretional heating by gas\nand planetesimals. We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary\nmass-luminosity relation. We study the shock and internal luminosity during\nformation. We predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus\nentropy \"tuning fork\" diagram. We find high nominal post-formation luminosities\nfor hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation histories can still lead\nto a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass.\nHowever, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the\npost-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot states. As a key result\nwe predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep\nincrease towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of\nlow-mass planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an\nestimate of the planet mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the gas\naccretion rate can be estimated. Due to the \"core-mass effect\" planets that\nunderwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies.

Using\n  exoplanet transits to analyze 3-D stellar atmospheres Abstract: CONTEXT: High-precision stellar analyses require hydrodynamic modeling to\ninterpret chemical abundances or oscillation modes. Exoplanet atmosphere\nstudies require stellar background spectra to be known along the transit path\nwhile detection of Earth analogs require stellar microvariability to be\nunderstood. Hydrodynamic 3-D models can be computed for widely different stars\nbut have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface\nfeatures. Model predictions include spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and\nwavelength shifts, and their center-to-limb changes across stellar disks. AIMS:\nTo observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly\nresolved stellar surfaces, which are free from the effects of spatial smearing\nand rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to\nsynthetic profiles from 3-D models. METHODS: During exoplanet transits,\nsuccessive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy\nbetween various transit phases provides spectra of small surface segments\ntemporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1% of\nany main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very\nprecise observations. Realistically measurable quantities are identified\nthrough simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines. RESULTS: In normal\nstars, line profile ratios between various transit phases may vary by some\n0.5%, requiring S/N ratios of 5,000 or more for meaningful spectral\nreconstruction. While not yet realistic for individual spectral lines, this is\nachievable for cool stars by averaging over numerous lines with similar\nparameters. CONCLUSIONS: For bright host stars of large transiting planets,\nspatially resolved spectroscopy is currently practical. More observable targets\nare likely to be found in the near future by ongoing photometric searches. \n\n"}

Pebble Evolution and Planet Formation\n  Timescales Abstract: Systems with tightly-packed inner planets (STIPs) are very common.

IOPF involves sequential planet formation from\npebble-rich rings that are fed from the outer disk and trapped at the pressure\nmaximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB). Planet masses are\nset by their ability to open a gap and cause the DZIB to retreat outwards. We\npresent models for the disk density and temperature structures that are\nrelevant to the conditions of IOPF. For a wide range of DZIB conditions, we\nevaluate the gap opening masses of planets in these disks that are expected to\nlead to truncation of pebble accretion onto the forming planet.

Methods.\nFirst of all, a semi-analytical model was used to define the mass of the\nprotoplanetary disks that produce each of the five dynamical scenarios of our\nresearch. Then, we made use of the same semi-analytical model to describe the\nevolution of embryos and planetesimals during the gaseous phase. Finally, we\ncarried out N-body simulations of planetary accretion in order to analyze the\nformation and water delivery of planets in the HZ in the different dynamical\nenvironments. Results. Water worlds are efficiently formed in the HZ in\ndifferent dynamical scenarios. In systems with a giant planet analog to Jupiter\nor Saturn around the snow line, super-Earths tend to migrate into the HZ from\noutside the snow line as a result of interactions with other embryos and\naccrete water only during the gaseous phase.

This state may be subject\nto a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical shear instability' (VSI), whose\nbreakdown into turbulence transports a moderate amount of angular momentum\nwhile also facilitating planet formation, possibly via the production of\nsmall-scale vortices. In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit\narbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the\nincompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are\nthemselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk\nrotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain\nlarge amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed). This `delay' in\nsaturation probably explains the prominence of the VSI linear modes in global\nsimulations. More generally, the parasites may set the amplitude of VSI\nturbulence in strongly irradiated disks. They are also important in breaking\nthe axisymmetry of the flow, via the unavoidable formation of vortices. The\nvortices, however, are not aligned with the orbital plane and thus express a\npronounced $z$-dependence. We also briefly demonstrate that the vertical shear\nhas little effect on the magnetorotational instability, whereas magnetic fields\neasily quench the VSI, a potential issue in the ionised surface regions of the\ndisk and also at larger radii. \n\n"}

For example, 3.6 micron emission originates from deeper layers of\nthe atmosphere than 4.5 micron due to greater water vapor absorption at the\nlonger wavelength. Since heat transport efficiency increases with pressure, we\nexpect thermal phase curves at 3.6 micron to exhibit smaller amplitudes and\ngreater phase offsets than at 4.5 micron; this trend is not observed. Of the\nseven hot Jupiters with full-orbit phase curves at 3.6 and 4.5 micron, all have\ngreater phase amplitude at 3.6 micron than at 4.5 micron, while four of seven\nexhibit a greater phase offset at 3.6 micron. We use a 3D\nradiative-hydrodynamic model to calculate theoretical phase curves of HD\n189733b, assuming thermo-chemical equilibrium. The model exhibits temperature,\npressure, and wavelength dependent opacity, primarily driven by carbon\nchemistry: CO is energetically favored on the dayside, while CH4 is favored on\nthe cooler nightside. Infrared opacity therefore changes by orders of magnitude\nbetween day and night, producing dramatic vertical shifts in the\nwavelength-specific photospheres, which would complicate eclipse or phase\nmapping with spectral data. The model predicts greater relative phase amplitude\nand greater phase offset at 3.6 micron than at 4.5 micron, in agreement with\nthe data. Our model qualitatively explains the observed phase curves, but is in\ntension with current thermo-chemical kinetics models that predict zonally\nuniform atmospheric composition due to transport of CO from the hot regions of\nthe atmosphere. \n\n"}

We find 20 warm super-Earths per 100 stars, regardless\nof metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ($R_P =\n1.7-4.0~R_E$) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40\nplanets per 100 stars.

Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find\nthat: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean\nchemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many\nwaterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to\nprevious claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical\ncycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C\nexchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by\nseafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass\nand ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our\nmodel, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early\nwater-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of\nmagnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory\noverlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for\nwhich the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as\nwide as it can be.

However, up to now it has been the exclusive dominion\nof the biggest telescope facilities on the ground, due to the large amount of\nphotons necessary to measure a signal in high-dispersion spectra. Here we show\nthat spectrographs with a novel design - in particular a large spectral range -\ncan open exoplanet characterisation to smaller telescope facilities too. We aim\nto demonstrate the concept on a series of spectra of the exoplanet HD 189733 b\ntaken at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo with the near-infrared spectrograph\nGIANO during two transits of the planet. In contrast to absorption in the\nEarth's atmosphere (telluric absorption), the planet transmission spectrum\nshifts in radial velocity during transit due to the changing orbital motion of\nthe planet. This allows us to remove the telluric spectrum while preserving the\nsignal of the exoplanet. The latter is then extracted by cross-correlating the\nresidual spectra with template models of the planet atmosphere computed through\nline-by-line radiative transfer calculations, and containing molecular\nabsorption lines from water and methane. By combining the signal of many\nthousands of planet molecular lines, we confirm the presence of water vapour in\nthe atmosphere of HD 189733 b at the 5.5-$\\sigma$ level. This signal was\nmeasured only in the first of the two observing nights.

For both cases, we measure the accretion rate onto the cores\nas a function of core mass and Stokes number ($\\tau_s$) of the particles and\ncompare it to recent MRI turbulence simulations.

The discovery of the event\nis important for the study of planetary formation in very low mass objects. In\naddition, it is important to consider all viable solutions in these kinds of\nambiguous events in order for the future comprehensive statistical analyses of\nplanetary/binary microlensing events. \n\n"}

This transfer\nincreases the binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical\ninstability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to\npreferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After\nthe stars tidally lock, we find that angular momentum loss due to magnetic\nbraking can significantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of\ndynamical stability, over time impacting where surviving CBPs are observed\nrelative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter\nspace and find that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most\nplausible initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major\naxis doubles from its initial value. We examine the dynamical and observable\nconsequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical instability limit by running\nN-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and find that typically,\nat least one planet is ejected from the system.

We attempt to\ndefinitively discriminate the nature of the RV variations for the young active\nK5 star BD+20 1790, for which visible (VIS) RV measurements show divergent\nresults on the existence of a substellar companion. Methods. We compare VIS\ndata with high precision RVs in the near infrared (NIR) range by using the\nGIANO - B and IGRINS spectrographs. In addition, we present for the first time\nsimultaneous VIS-NIR observations obtained with GIARPS (GIANO - B and HARPS -\nN) at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). Orbital RVs are achromatic, so the RV\namplitude does not change at different wavelengths, while stellar activity\ninduces wavelength-dependent RV variations, which are significantly reduced in\nthe NIR range with respect to the VIS. Results. The NIR radial velocity\nmeasurements from GIANO - B and IGRINS show an average amplitude of about one\nquarter with respect to previously published VIS data, as expected when the RV\njitter is due to stellar activity.

This, in turn, can be exploited to reveal the mass of these planets, in\naddition to techniques such as radial velocity and transit-timing-variation.\nHere, using updated radii for Kepler planet hosts from Gaia DR2, I show that\nthe photoevaporation features shift systematically to larger radius for planets\naround more massive stars (ranging from M-dwarfs to F-dwarfs), corresponding to\na nearly linear scaling between planet mass and its host mass.

A necessary\ncondition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical\nstability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler\nCBPs using numerical $N$-body integrations. We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,\nthe evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons\nin dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering\nstrong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct\ncollisions. This suggests that there is a dearth of highly-inclined exomoons\naround the Kepler CBPs, whereas coplanar exomoons are dynamically allowed. \n\n"}

We\nreport the albedo distribution for each taxonomic group and we compute new\nmedian values for the main types. We found that V-type and A-type candidates\nhave identical size frequency distributions, but the V-types are five times\nmore common than the A-types.

This effect, typically\nneglected in general circulation models (GCMs), has been suggested as\nexplanation for discrepancies between observed infrared lightcurves and those\npredicted by GCMs: On the nightsides of several hot Jupiters, GCMs predict\noutgoing fluxes that are too large, especially in the Spitzer 4.5 $\\mu$m band.\nWe modified the SPARC/MITgcm to include disequilibrium abundances of CH$_4$, CO\nand H$_2$O by assuming that the CH$_4$/CO ratio is constant throughout the\nsimulation domain.

If strong\nfirst-order phase transitions do not exist within neutron stars, both neutron\nstars are described by the same equation of state, and their Lambdas are highly\ncorrelated through their masses even if the equation of state is unknown. If,\nhowever, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the\ntwo stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least\nmassive star does not, this correlation will be weakened. In all cases, a\nminimum Lambda for each neutron star mass is imposed by causality, and a less\nconservative limit is imposed by the unitary gas constraint, both of which we\ncompute. In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively.

By\nstudying the well-characterized resonant planetary system around GJ 876 we aim\nto explore which effects shape disk-driven migration in such a multi-planet\nsystem to form resonant chains.

We find that due to\nthe high masses of the giant planets, substantial eccentricity can be excited\nin the disk. This results in large variations of the torque acting on the outer\nlower-mass planet, which we attribute to a shift of Lindblad and corotation\nresonances due to disk eccentricity. Depending on disk parameters, the\nmigration of the outer planet can be stopped in a non-resonant state.

Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of\nstellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we\nare facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using\ncurrent techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive\nprecise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution\nspectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By\nmeasuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV\nprecision as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows\nto demonstrate that each line is differently affected by stellar activity.\nPreliminary results show that studying in details the behaviour of each\nspectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity. \n\n"}

In CW Tau, the total and\npolarized emission are both smooth and symmetric, with polarization angles\nalmost parallel to the minor axis of the projected disk.

They are nearly coplanar to each other; the\ninner one has a large eccentricity (~0.82); and the apses of the two orbits\nlibrate around anti-alignment. Such a state defies available proposals for\nlarge eccentricities. We argue that it is instead uniquely produced by a\ndecaying protoplanetary disk. When the disk was massive, its precessional\neffect on the planets forced the two apses to center around an anti-aligned\nstate. And as the disk is gradually eroded, the pair of planets are\nadiabatically transported to a new state where most of the eccentricity (or\nrather, the angular momentum deficit) is transferred to the inner planet, and\nthe two apses are largely anti-aligned. During this transport, any initial\nmutual inclination may be reduced or enhanced; either may be compatible with\nthe current constraints. So a primordial disk can drive up planet\neccentricities both in resonant planet pairs (as has been shown for GJ 876) and\nin secularly interacting, non-resonant pairs. The mechanism discussed here may\nbe relevant for forming hot Jupiters and for explaining the observed\neccentricities of warm and cold giant planets. \n\n"}

One possibility is\nthat stars forming within the cloud regenerate turbulence via their outflows,\nwinds and radiation (\"feedback\"). Disentangling motions created by feedback\nfrom the initial cloud turbulence is challenging, however. Here we confront the\nrelationship between stellar feedback and turbulence by identifying and\nseparating the local and global impact of stellar winds.

By distinguishing between launched material,\ngas entrained by the wind and pristine gas we show energy is transferred away\nfrom the sources via magnetic waves excited by the expanding wind shells. This\naction at a distance enhances the fraction of stirring motion compared to\ncompressing motion and produces a flatter velocity power spectrum.

Giant impacts are expected to play a role in the\nformation of many of these worlds. Previous works, focused on the mechanical\nshock caused by a giant impact, have shown that these impacts can eject large\nfractions of the planetary envelope, offering a partial explanation for the\nobserved spread in exoplanet compositions. Here, we examine the thermal\nconsequences of giant impacts, and show that the atmospheric loss caused by\nthese effects can significantly exceed that caused by mechanical shocks for\nhydrogen-helium (H/He) envelopes. When a giant impact occurs, part of the\nimpact energy is converted into thermal energy, heating the rocky core and the\nenvelope. We find that the ensuing thermal expansion of the envelope can lead\nto a period of sustained, rapid mass loss through a Parker wind, resulting in\nthe partial or complete erosion of the H/He envelope. The fraction of the\nenvelope lost depends on the planet's orbital distance from its host star and\nits initial thermal state, and hence age. Planets closer to their host stars\nare more susceptible to thermal atmospheric loss triggered by impacts than ones\non wider orbits. Similarly, younger planets, with rocky cores which are still\nhot and molten from formation, suffer greater atmospheric loss. This is\nespecially interesting because giant impacts are expected to occur\n$10{-}100~\\mathrm{Myr}$ after formation. For planets where the thermal energy\nof the core is much greater than the envelope energy, the impactor mass\nrequired for significant atmospheric removal is $M_\\mathrm{imp} / M_p \\sim \\mu\n/ \\mu_c \\sim 0.1$, approximately the ratio of the heat capacities of the\nenvelope and core.

Given the observing\nstrategy employed by TESS the probability of detecting single transits in long\nperiod systems is increased. These systems require careful consideration.\n  Aims: To simulate the number of TESS transit detections during its 2 year\nmission with a particular emphasis on single transits. Additionally, to\ndetermine the feasibility of ground-based follow-up observations from a single\nsite.\n  Methods: A distribution of planets is simulated around the $\\sim$ 4 million\nstars in the TESS Candidate Target List. These planets are tested for\ndetectable transits and characterised. Based on simulated parameters the single\ntransit detections are further analysed to determine which are amenable to\nground-based follow-up.\n  Results: TESS will discover an approximate lower bound of 4700 planets with\naround 460 being single transits. A large fraction of these will be observable\nfrom a single ground-based site. This paper finds that, in a single year,\napproximately 1000 transit events of around 320 unique TESS single transit\ndetections are theoretically observable.\n  Conclusions: As we consider longer period exoplanets the need for exploring\nsingle transit detections increases. For periods $\\gtrsim45$ days the number of\nsingle transit detections outnumber multitransits by a factor of 3 (82$\\pm$18\nand 25$\\pm$7 respectively) a factor which only grows as longer period\ndetections are considered.

We synthesise noiseless observations to determine the\nsensitivities required to detect the spiral flux, and find that the line flux\ndistribution does not necessarily correlate to the abundance density\ndistribution; hence performing radiative transfer calculations is imperative.\nMoreover, the spiral features are seen in absorption, due to the GI-heated\nmidplane and high extinction, which could be indicative of GI activity.

We classified 58 disks with available\npolarimetric observations into six major categories (Ring, Spiral, Giant, Rim,\nFaint, and Small disks) based on their appearance in scattered light. We\nre-calculated the stellar and disk properties from the newly available GAIA DR2\nand related these properties with the disk categories. More than a half of our\nsample shows disk sub-structures.

Faint disks are typically found around young stars and typically\nhost no cavity. There is a possible dichotomy in the near-IR excess of sources\nwith spiral-disks (high) and ring-disks (low). Like spirals, shadows are\nassociated with a high near-IR excess.

This might account for some of the\nchaotic departures from axisymmetric structures in some planetary nebulae. I\nbase my study on the assumption that at the termination of the CEE the binary\ninteraction forms a circumbinary thick disk that feeds the companion via an\naccretion disk that launches opposite jets. I consider two processes that might\nlead to the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that lead to chaotic\naccretion flow on to the companion. The chaotic accretion flow leads to a\nvariable accretion disk around the companion, hence to variable jets. In the\nfirst process the jets inflate low-density hot bubbles in the inner regions of\nthe envelope. In the second process the inner boundary of the thick\ncircumbinary disk, that faces the center, cools by radiation thus leading to a\ntemperature, and hence also a pressure, increase with radius. The opposite\npressure and density gradients lead to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. This\nstudy further underlines the importance of exploring the termination phase of\nthe CEE to the understanding of the entire CEE and its outcomes. \n\n"}

We construct\nspectral energy distributions for prototypical IMS, comparing them to solar.\nThe XUV fluxes relevant for upper planet atmospheric heating are highest for\nthe cooler IMS and lowest for the hotter IMS, while the UV fluxes increase with\nincreasing stellar temperature. We quantify the influence of this\ncharacteristic of the stellar fluxes on the mass loss of close-in planets by\nsimulating the atmospheres of planets orbiting EUV-bright (WASP-33) and\nEUV-faint (KELT-9) A-type stars. For KELT-9b, we find that atmospheric\nexpansion caused by heating due to absorption of the stellar UV and optical\nlight drives mass-loss rates of $\\approx$10$^{11}$ g s$^{-1}$, while heating\ncaused by absorption of the stellar XUV radiation leads to mass-loss rates of\n$\\approx$10$^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$, thus underestimating mass loss.

We focus on the\nstellar wind spinning down the star along its main sequence phase and tidal\ninteraction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent\nsignificant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric\ndescriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to\nintroduce simultaneously ab-initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking\ntorques, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. We\ndevelop a 1D numerical model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking\ninto account stellar structural changes, wind braking and tidal interaction and\nimplement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of the\nstellar rotation assuming a bi-layer internal structure, and of the semi-major\naxis of the orbit.

The three hottest known DAs (surface gravity log g $\\geq$\n7.0) have effective temperatures around Teff = 140,000 K, followed by only five\nobjects in the range 104,000 - 120,000 K. They are by far outnumbered by forty\nnon-DAs with Teff = 100,000 - 250,000 K, giving a DA/non-DA ratio of 0.2. In\ncontrast, this ratio is the inverse of that for the cooler WDs. One reason for\nthis discrepancy could be uncertainties in the temperature determination of hot\nDAs using Balmer-line spectroscopy. Recent investigations involving\nmetal-ionization balances in ultraviolet (UV) spectra indeed showed that the\ntemperatures of some DAs were underestimated, but the paucity of extremely hot\nDAs prevailed. Here we present the results of a UV spectral analysis of one of\nthe three hottest DAs, PG0948+534. We find that its temperature was strongly\noverestimated by recent Balmer line analyses. We correct it downward to 105,000\n$\\pm$ 5000 K, aggravating the hot-DA paucity. The Balmer-line problem\nencountered previously is not resolved by our non-LTE line-blanketed model\natmospheres.

This is supported by the V-band variability that shows a\nperiod of P=3.45 d (amplitude 0.19 mag), which we interpret as the star's\nrotation period. The metal abundances in PG0948+534 are affected by atomic\ndiffusion and we conclude that the onset of diffusion in hot DAs occurs when\nthey cool below Teff about 105,000 K.

Here we\nsimulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \\leq m \\leq\n5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of\nthe surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of\nthe solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been\nobserved. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$.

This implies that the Andromeda\ngalaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream\nin different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge,\ndisk and halo, where the halo follows a ``universal'' profile that is\ncompressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the\nkinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of\n7.5^(+2.5)_(-1.3) x 10^{11} M_Sun, or more than 5.4 x 10^{11} M_Sun at the 99%\nconfidence level. This is the first galaxy in which it has been possible to\nmeasure the halo mass distribution by such direct dynamical means over such a\nlarge distance range. The resulting orbit shows that if M32 or NGC 205 are\nconnected with the stream, they must either trail or lag the densest region of\nthe stream by more than 100 kpc. Furthermore, according to the best-fit orbit,\nthe stream passes very close to M31, causing its demise as a coherent structure\nand producing a fan of stars that will pollute the inner halo, thereby\nconfusing efforts to measure the properties of genuine halo populations.
