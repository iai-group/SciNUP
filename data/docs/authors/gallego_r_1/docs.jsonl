This limited amount of entanglement, however, does not imply\nthat the system is classically simulatable. A matrix product state (MPS)\nalgorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential\nclassical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and\nthe amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I\nsuggest, can be filled by quantum discord.

As a result, rather than the mass-eigenstate vacuum, the correct\nground state to describe the underlying dynamics is the flavour vacuum,\nproposed some time ago by Blasone and Vitiello as a description of quantum\nfield theories with mixing. At the microscopic level, the breaking of\ntarget-space supersymmetry is induced in our space-time foam model by the\nrelative transverse motion of brane defects. Motivated by these results, we\nshow that the flavour vacuum, introduced through an inequivalent representation\nof the canonical (anti-) commutation relations, provides a vehicle for the\nbreaking of supersymmetry (SUSY) at a low-energy effective field theory level;\non considering the flavour-vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum\ntensor and comparing with the form of a perfect relativistic fluid, it is found\nthat the bosonic sector contributes as dark energy while the fermion\ncontribution is like dust.

The aim of the present\npaper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit \"polar\" codes that are\ncapacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon\nobserved by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is\nan effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by \"channel combining\"\nand \"channel splitting,\" in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are\nperfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely useless\nfor data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the\nchannel.

These are the\ntransverse-field Ising model and the XX model universality classes with both\nthe models being special cases of the transverse-field XY model.

In parallel, we also compare and\ncontrast the expected behavior of this system assuming the local nonlinearity\nin the cavities is generated by a generic Kerr effect rather than a\nJaynes-Cummings interaction. We find that the behavior of the experimentally\naccessible observables produced by the two models differs for realistic regimes\nof interactions even when the corresponding nonlinearities are of similar\nstrength. We analyze in detail the extra features available in the\nJaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) model originating from the mixed nature of the\nexcitations and investigate the regimes where the Kerr approximation would\nfaithfully match the JCH physics.

Separately, recent experiments in fluid mechanics have demonstrated\nthe emergence of a full range of quantum phenomena from completely classical\nmotion. We present two specific hypotheses. First, Kuramoto theory may give a\nbasis for geometrical thinking about entanglement. Second, we consider a recent\nsoliton model of the electron, in which the quantum-mechanical wave function is\na phase modulation of a carrier wave. Both models are consistent with one\nanother and with observation. Both models suggest how entanglement and\ndecoherence may be related to device geometry. Both models predict that it will\nbe difficult to maintain phase coherence of more than three qubits in the\nplane, or four qubits in a three-dimensional structure.

This means that, no matter how\nnon-local the nature is, the set of physical non-local correlations must be\nclosed under wirings. Then, one approach to identify the non-locality of nature\nis to characterize closed sets of non-local correlations. Although non-trivial\nexamples of wirings of no-signaling boxes are known, there is no systematic way\nto study wirings.

The spectral entropy, and analogues using other\nSchur-concave functions, can be defined as the entropy of these probabilities.\nWe describe additional conditions under which the outcome probabilities of a\nfine-grained measurement are majorized by those for a spectral measurement, and\ntherefore the \"spectral entropy\" is the measurement entropy (and therefore\nconcave). These conditions are (1) projectivity, which abstracts aspects of the\nLueders-von Neumann projection postulate in quantum theory, in particular that\nevery face of the state space is the positive part of the image of a certain\nkind of projection operator called a filter; and (2) symmetry of transition\nprobabilities.

Abstract: The definition of the classical transition state theory (TST) as a t= 0+\nlimit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that\nsimultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical\nprocess. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. 138,\n084108 (2013)] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact\nt=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and\nthat it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory. It is shown that the t=0+ limit of the new rate expression\nvanishes in the exact quantum limit. \n\n"}

As the light-matter coupling is increased into the\ndeep strong coupling regime, the ground state turns from vacuum to become a\nsuperradiant state characterized by both atomic and photonic excitations. It is\npointed out that all four transitions are of the mean-field type, that quantum\nfluctuations are negligible, and hence these fluctuations cannot be responsible\nfor the corresponding vacuum instability.

However, these known results rely crucially on the assumption that\nthe thermal machine is not only exactly preserved in every cycle, but also kept\nuncorrelated from the quantum systems on which it acts.

Decades later, it became possible to do experiments with\nindividual quantum particles and quantum systems. This was due to technological\nprogress, and for light in particular, the development of the laser. Hitherto,\nnearly all experiments and also nearly all realizations in the fields have been\nperformed with qubits, which are two-level quantum systems. We suggest that\nthis limitation is again mainly a technological one, because it is very\ndifficult to create, manipulate and measure more complex quantum systems.

These assumptions were originally introduced in the setting of\neffectus theory, a categorical logical framework generalizing classical and\nquantum logic. As these assumptions have a physical interpretation, this\nmotivates the usage of operator algebras as a model for quantum theory.\n  In contrast to other reconstructions of quantum theory, we do not start with\nthe framework of generalized probabilistic theories and instead use effect\ntheories where no convex structure and no tensor product needs to be present.\nThe lack of this structure in effectus theory has led to a different notion of\npure maps.

It allows them to find food and\nto escape from toxins. Many microorganisms can produce the chemicals to which\nthey respond themselves and use chemotaxis for signalling which can be seen as\na basic form of communication. Remarkably, the past decade has let to the\ndevelopment of synthetic microswimmers like e.g. autophoretic Janus colloids,\nwhich can self-propel through a solvent, analogously to bacteria and other\nmicroorganims. The mechanism underlying their self-propulsion involves the\nproduction of certain chemicals. The same chemicals involved in the\nself-propulsion mechanism also act on other microswimmers and bias their\nswimming direction towards (or away from) the producing microswimmer. Synthetic\nmicroswimmers therefore provide a synthetic analogue to chemotactic motile\nmicroorganisms. When these interactions are attractive, they commonly lead to\nclusters, even at low particle density. These clusters may either proceed\ntowards macrophase separation, resembling Dictyostelium aggregation, or, as\nshown very recently, lead to dynamic clusters of self-limited size (dynamic\nclustering) as seen in experiments in autophoretic Janus colloids. Besides the\nclassical case where chemical interactions are attractive, this Account\ndiscusses, as its main focus, repulsive chemical interactions, which can create\na new and less known avenue to pattern formation in active systems leading to a\nvariety of pattern, including clusters which are surrounded by shells of\nchemicals, travelling waves and more complex continously reshaping patterns.

Many\nphenomenologically interesting nonperturbative aspects of gluodynamics and QCD\ncan be described in terms of correlators of the nonabelian field strength\ntensors.

These hidden subgroup problems are typically solved by\nFourier sampling. When G is nonabelian, two important variants of Fourier\nsampling have been identified: the weak standard method, where only\nrepresentation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full\nmeasurement (i.e., the row and column of the representation, in a suitably\nchosen basis) occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method\nis indeed stronger. In this article, we settle this question in the\naffirmative.

We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer.
