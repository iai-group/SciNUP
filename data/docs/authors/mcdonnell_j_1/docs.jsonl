However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions.

These null\nresults may be due to small scale DM density fluctuations in the halo with the\ndensity of our local region being lower than the average (around 0.3 GeV/cm^3\n). However, the accumulated neutrino signal from WIMP annihilations in the\nGalactic stellar disk would be insensitive to local density variations.

We find that all electron capture\nreactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are\nnot a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are\ninfeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much\nshallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm\nthe proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12C + 12C\ntriggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction\ncross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies,\nbut resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured\nenergy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a\nresonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical\n1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the\nresonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the\ntheoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in\nthis case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord\nwith model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters.

Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial\ndimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion\nmodifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring\nof the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the\nouter radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We\nconjecture that torsion produced by spin prevents the formation of\nsingularities from matter composed of quarks and leptons. We expect that the\nCartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces an effective ultraviolet\ncutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS spacetime. We also\nestimate a maximum density of matter to be on the order of the corresponding\nCartan density, ~10^{51} kg m^{-3}, which gives a lower limit for black-hole\nmasses ~10^{16} kg. This limit corresponds to energy ~10^{43} GeV which is 39\norders of magnitude larger than the maximum beam energy currently available at\nthe LHC. Thus, if torsion exists and the ECKS theory of gravity is correct, the\nLHC cannot produce micro black holes. \n\n"}

Twin matter is\nhypothetical matter that might couple directly only to the second metric of the\ntheory. Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive\ninteractions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,\nin turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes\nof one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to\nefficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to\nconstrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons\nas a diverging lens.

We divide a two-dimensional Fermi sea into distinct wedges,\ncharacterized by the opening angle 2Theta and depth Q ~ pF, where pF is the\nFermi momentum. In each wedge, the energy is lowered by forming a single chiral\nspiral. The optimal values for Theta and Q are chosen by balancing this gain in\nenergy versus the cost of deforming the Fermi surface (which dominates at large\nTheta) and patch-patch interactions (dominant at small Theta). Using a\nnon-local four-Fermi interaction model, we estimate the gain and cost in energy\nby expanding in terms of 1/Nc (where Nc is the number of colors), lqcd/Q, and\nTheta. Due to a form factor in our non-local model, at small 1/Nc the mass gap\n(chiral condensate) is large, and the interaction among quarks and the\ncondensate local in momentum space. Consequently, interactions between\ndifferent patches are localized near their boundaries, and it is simple to\nembed many chiral spirals.

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac\nform factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we\nshow via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's\ndiquark content.

In particular, the sum of this series is needed for\nan accurate description of kaon-deuteron scattering, and appears as part of the\nnucleon-nucleon potential.

A fraction of these are\nlikely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of\nstellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular\nevolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with\nhighly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly\naffected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at\nthe highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission\nbecomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and\ncoalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than\nsimilar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of\nSMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of\nbinaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries\nwould be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation\nof GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging\nbinaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still\nvery eccentric (e>~0.5). The efficient gravitational wave analysis for such\nsystems would therefore require the use of eccentric templates.

Finally, we note that the\nformation of close stellar binaries, X-ray binaries and their merger products\ncould be induced by similar secular processes, combined with tidal friction\nrather than GW emission as in the case of compact object binaries. \n\n"}

The model is used to calculate the number densities of the\nhadrons produced in the polarized quark's decay chain. The full Collins\nfragmentation function is extracted from the sine modulation of the polarized\nnumber densities with respect to the polar angle between the initial quark's\nspin and hadron's transverse momentum. Two cases are studied here. First, a toy\nmodel for elementary Collins function is used to study the features of the\ntransversely polarized quark-jet model. Second, a full model calculation of\ntransverse momentum dependent pion and kaon Collins functions is presented. The\nremarkable feature of our model is that the 1/2 moments of the favored Collins\nfragmentation functions are positive and peak at large values of z but decrease\nand oscillate at small values of z. The 1/2 moments of the unfavored Collins\nfunctions have comparable magnitude and opposite sign to the favored functions,\nvanish at large z and peak at small values of z.

The theory predicts the existence of a\nlong-range scalar field, which passes the Solar System observational\nconstraints, even if the scalar field is very light, and modifies the\ncosmological and galactic dynamics. Thus, the theory opens new possibilities to\napproach, in the same theoretical framework, the problems of both dark energy\nand dark matter. In this work, we consider the generalized virial theorem in\nthe scalar-tensor representation of the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. More\nspecifically, taking into account the relativistic collisionless Boltzmann\nequation, we show that the supplementary geometric terms in the gravitational\nfield equations provide an effective contribution to the gravitational\npotential energy. We show that the total virial mass is proportional to the\neffective mass associated with the new terms generated by the effective scalar\nfield, and the baryonic mass. This shows that the geometric origin in the\ngeneralized virial theorem may account for the well-known virial theorem mass\ndiscrepancy in clusters of galaxies. In addition to this, we also consider\nastrophysical applications of the model and show that the model predicts that\nthe mass associated to the scalar field and its effects extend beyond the\nvirial radius of the clusters of galaxies. In the context of the galaxy cluster\nvelocity dispersion profiles predicted by the hybrid metric-Palatini model, the\ngeneralized virial theorem can be an efficient tool in observationally testing\nthe viability of this class of generalized gravity models. \n\n"}

The anisotropy in the\nmeasured clustering pattern in redshift-space is also driven by the unknown\ndistance factors at the redshift in question, the Alcock-Paczynski distortion.\nThis weakens growth rate measurements, but permits an extra geometric probe of\nthe Hubble expansion rate. In this chapter we will briefly describe the\nscientific background to the RSD technique, and forecast the potential of the\nSKA phase 1 and the SKA2 to measure the growth rate using both galaxy\ncatalogues and intensity mapping, assessing their competitiveness with current\nand future optical galaxy surveys. \n\n"}

The standard semiclassical theory suffers from fundamental\ninconsistencies (e.g.: Schr\\\"odinger cat sources, faster-than-light\ncommunication and violation of the Born rule) which can only be ignored in\nsimple typical situations.

Semi-classically one can argue that the spectrum of radiation\nemitted by a black hole look very much sparse unlike what is expected from a\nthermal object. It was demonstrated through a simple quantum model that a\nquantum black hole will retain a discrete profile, at least in the weak energy\nregime. However, it was suggested that this discreteness might be an artifact\nof the simplicity of eigen-spectrum of the model considered. Different quantum\ntheories can, in principle, give rise to different complicated spectra and make\nthe radiation from black hole dense enough in transition lines, to make them\nlook continuous in profile. We show that such a hope from a geometry-quantized\nblack hole is not realized as long as large enough black holes are dubbed with\na classical mass area relation in any gravity theory ranging from GR,\nLanczos-Lovelock to f(R) gravity. We show that the smallest frequency of\nemission from black hole in any quantum description, is bounded from below, to\nbe of the order of its inverse mass.

Abstract: Familiar factorized descriptions of classic QCD processes such as\ndeeply-inelastic scattering (DIS) apply in the limit of very large hard scales,\nmuch larger than nonperturbative mass scales and other nonperturbative physical\nproperties like intrinsic transverse momentum. Since many interesting DIS\nstudies occur at kinematic regions where the hard scale, $Q \\sim$ 1-2 GeV, is\nnot very much greater than the hadron masses involved, and the Bjorken scaling\nvariable $x_{bj}$ is large, $x_{bj} \\gtrsim 0.5$, it is important to examine\nthe boundaries of the most basic factorization assumptions and assess whether\nimproved starting points are needed.

Many of these violations can be\nattributed to the electromagnetic interaction but the question of how much of\nthe violation is due to it remains open. A schematic model based on clustering\nof quarks in the interior of the confinement region of the two-nucleon system\nis introduced and evaluated. In this model the Coulomb interaction is the\nsource of all isospin breaking. It draws on a picture of the quark density\nbased on the diquark-quark model of hadron structure which has been\ninvestigated by a number of groups. The model produces three isospin breaking\npotentials connecting This illustrative model suggests that the breaking seen\nin the low-energy NN interaction may be understood in terms of the Coulomb\nforce between members of diquark clusters. It allows the prediction of the\ncharge symmetry breaking interaction and the $nn$ scattering length from the\nwell measured $np$ singlet scattering length. Values of the $nn$ scattering\nlength around $-18$ fm are favored. Since the model is based on the quark\npicture, it can be easily extended, in the SU(3) limit, to calculate isospin\nbreaking in the strange sector in the corresponding channels.

The asymptotic symmetries are spanned\nby an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\\hat{u}(1)$\ncurrents of electric and magnetic type. These currents are associated to $U(1)$\nfields being even and odd under parity, respectively. Remarkably, although the\n$U(1)$ fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide\nnontrivial Sugawara-like contributions to the BMS$_3$ generators, and hence to\nthe energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological\nspacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state\ncorresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the\ncanonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the\nground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\\hat{u}(1)$ charge.

Conceptual aspects and cosmological predictions Abstract: Even if the fundamental action of gravity is local, the corresponding quantum\neffective action, that includes the effect of quantum fluctuations, is a\nnonlocal object. These nonlocalities are well understood in the ultraviolet\nregime but much less in the infrared, where they could in principle give rise\nto important cosmological effects. Here we systematize and extend previous work\nof our group, in which it is assumed that a mass scale $\\Lambda$ is dynamically\ngenerated in the infrared, giving rise to nonlocal terms in the quantum\neffective action of gravity. We give a detailed discussion of conceptual\naspects related to nonlocal gravity and of the cosmological consequences of\nthese models. The requirement of providing a viable cosmological evolution\nseverely restricts the form of the nonlocal terms, and selects a model (the\nso-called RR model) that corresponds to a dynamical mass generation for the\nconformal mode. For such a model: (1) there is a FRW background evolution,\nwhere the nonlocal term acts as an effective dark energy with a phantom\nequation of state, providing accelerated expansion without a cosmological\nconstant.

It has been applied successfully to the\ncases of {\\it non-rotating}, {\\it non-distorted} black holes in Einstein\nVacuum, Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theories. In this note,\nit is investigated the extent to which the framework can be generalized to the\ncase of non-Abelian gauge theories where `hairy black holes' are known to\nexist. It is found that this extension is indeed possible, despite the fact\nthat in general, there is no `canonical normalization' yielding a preferred\nHorizon Mass. In particular the zeroth and first laws are established for all\nnormalizations. Colored static spherically symmetric black hole solutions to\nthe Einstein-Yang-Mills equations are considered from this perspective. A\ncanonical formula for the Horizon Mass of such black holes is found. This\nanalysis is used to obtain nontrivial relations between the masses of the\ncolored black holes and the regular solitonic solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills\ntheory. A general testing bed for the instability of hairy black holes in\ngeneral non-linear theories is suggested. As an example, the embedded Abelian\nmagnetic solutions are considered.

Motivated by these considerations and using the fact\nthat the Isolated Horizons framework seems to be the appropriate language to\nstate uniqueness and completeness conjectures for the EYM equations --in terms\nof the horizon charges--, two such conjectures are put forward. \n\n"}

We show that the perturbation\nequations can always be written in terms of spacetime variables only,\nregardless of any particular gauge. We demonstrate how to obtain the\nRegge-Wheeler gauge, by choosing appropriate lapse and shift. In addition, not\nonly the 3-metric but also the extrinsic curvature of the initial slice have to\nsatisfy certain conditions in order to preserve the Regge-Wheeler gauge\nthroughout the evolution.

The spacetimes that are\nevolved from initial data near the black hole threshold have many properties\nthat are mathematically analogous to a critical phase transition in statistical\nmechanics.\n  Solutions near the black hole threshold go through an intermediate attractor,\ncalled the critical solution. The critical solution is either time-independent\n(static) or scale-independent (self-similar). In the latter case, the final\nblack hole mass scales as $(p-p_*)^\\gamma$ along any one-parameter family of\ndata with a regular parameter $p$ such that $p=p_*$ is the black hole threshold\nin that family.

These\nsecond order corrections enter in the form of a {\\it cumulative} contribution\nfrom {\\it all} of their Fourier modes. In order to quantify their physical\nsignificance we study their effective equation of state by looking at the\nperturbed energy density and isotropic pressure to second order.

For such a braneworld cosmology, the difficulty of\njustifying some preferred initial conditions inevitably arises. The various\nproposals for inflation restricted to the brane only partially explain the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the resulting braneworld universe because the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the bulk must be assumed. We propose a mechanism by\nwhich a brane surrounded by AdS space arises naturally so that the homogeneity\nand isotropy of both the brane and the bulk are guaranteed. We postulate an\ninitial false vacuum phase of (4+1)-dimensional Minkowski or de Sitter space\nsubsequently decaying to a true vacuum of anti-de Sitter space, assumed\ndiscretely degenerate. This decay takes place through bubble nucleation. When\ntwo bubbles of the true AdS vacuum collide, a brane (or domain wall) inevitably\nforms between the two AdS phases. We live on this brane.

This is a result of the very high energy level density\nof many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between\nparticles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A\ntime scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is\nthe qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1. At t <<\nt_c the entropy is small: S= n t^2 J^2 log_2(1/t^2 J^2), where J is the\ninter-qubit interaction strength. At t > t_c the number of ``wrong'' states\nincreases exponentially as 2^{S(t)} . Therefore, t_c may be interpreted as a\nmaximal time for operation of a quantum computer, since at t > t_c one has to\nstruggle against the second law of thermodynamics.
