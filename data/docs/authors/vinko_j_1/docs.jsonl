Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

We calculate the evolution of several\nvery massive stars with initial masses M <~ 100 Msun from the main-sequence to\nthe beginning of the Fe-core collapse and simulate their explosions and\nnucleosynthesis. In order to avoid complications associated with strong\nmass-loss, we only consider metal-poor stars with initial metallicity Z =\nZsun/200.

The C+O core mass for the 100Msun model is M_CO =\n42.6Msun and this is the heaviest model in the literature for which Fe-core\ncollapse SN is explored. The synthesized 56Ni mass increases with the\nincreasing explosion energy and progenitor mass. For the explosion energy of\nE_51 = E/10^{51} erg =30, for example, the 56Ni masses of M(56Ni) = 2.2, 2.3,\n5.0, and 6.6 Msun can be produced for the progenitors with initial masses of\n30, 50, 80 and 100 Msun (or C+O core masses M_CO = 11.4, 19.3, 34.0 and 42.6\nMsun), respectively.

This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution. In\nour model, the weaker CSM interaction giving rise to SN2006gy's characteristic\nType IIn spectrum and soft X-rays is not linked to the power source of the\nvisual continuum; instead, it arises after the blast wave breaks free of the\nopaque shell into the surrounding wind.

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004).

We extend the study of the evolution of the TFR by\nestablishing the first distant baryonic TFR.

We present the first\nbaryonic TFR (bTFR) ever established at intermediate redshift and show that,\nwithin an uncertainty of +/-0.08 dex, the zeropoint of the bTFR does not appear\nto evolve between z~0.6 and z=0. The absence of evolution in the bTFR over the\npast 6 Gyr implies that no external gas accretion is required for distant\nrotating disks to sustain star formation until z=0 and convert most of their\ngas into stars.

Radial orbit cusps and\n  bulges Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution functions that arise naturally\nduring self-similar radial infall of collisionless matter. Such matter may be\nthought of either as stars or as dark matter particles. If a rigorous steady\nstate is assumed, then the system is infinite and is described by a universal\ndistribution function given the self-similar index. The steady logarithmic\npotential case is exceptional and yields the familiar Gaussian for an infinite\nsystem with an inverse-square density profile. We show subsequently that for\ntime-dependent radial self-similar infall, the logarithmic case is accurately\ndescribed by the Fridmann and Polyachenko distribution function. The system in\nthis case is finite but growing. We are able to embed a central mass in the\nuniversal steady distribution only by iteration, except in the case of massless\nparticles. The iteration yields logarithmic corrections to the massless\nparticle case and requires a `renormalization' of the central mass. A central\nspherical mass may be accurately embedded in the Fridmann and Polyachenko\ngrowing distribution however. Some speculation is given concerning the\nimportance of radial collisionless infall in actual galaxy formation. \n\n"}

Ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons\nproduced in the center of the Galaxy by dark matter annihilation should produce\na diffuse synchrotron emission. While the spectral shape of the synchrotron\ndark matter haze depends on the particle model (and secondarily on the galactic\nmagnetic fields), the morphology of the haze depends primarily on (1) the dark\nmatter density distribution, (2) the galactic magnetic field morphology, and\n(3) the diffusion model for high-energy cosmic-ray leptons. Interestingly, an\nunidentified excess of microwave radiation with characteristics similar to\nthose predicted by dark matter models has been claimed to exist near the\ngalactic center region in the data reported by the WMAP satellite, and dubbed\nthe \"WMAP haze\".

We apply this equation of state to highly asymmetric core\ncollapse supernova matter with finite temperatures and large baryon densities.\nThe phase transition is constructed using the general Gibbs conditions, which\nresults in an extended coexistence region between the pure hadronic and pure\nquark phases in the phase diagram, i.e. the mixed phase. The supernovae are\nsimulated via general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics based on three\nflavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. During the dynamical\nevolution temperatures above 10 MeV, baryon densities above nuclear saturation\ndensity and a proton-to-baryon ratio below 0.2 are obtained. At these\nconditions the phase transition is triggered which leads to a significant\nsoftening of the EoS for matter in the mixed phase.

Provided some physics for the absolute normalisation,\nthe creation of the scaling relations can be fully explained by the\nhierarchical assembly of black hole and stellar mass through galaxy merging,\nfrom an initially uncorrelated distribution of BH and stellar masses in the\nearly Universe. We show this with a suite of dark matter halo merger trees for\nwhich we make assumptions about (uncorrelated) black hole and stellar mass\nvalues at early cosmic times.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron.

First, the field offers\nlocally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,\nsubstantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to\nthe gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the\ncollapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for\naccretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final\nmass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound\nup by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. However, this flow never\nachieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for two\nreasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central\nregions where the protostars form, and the expanding H II regions tend to\nfurther disrupt the field geometry.

Just after the launch of the supernova\nshock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The\noutflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As\nthe magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux\ndominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet\nto clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the\nprompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models:\nmagnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic\ndissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band'\nspectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading\ndecreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t\n~ 10-100 seconds. Jets with ultra-high magnetization cannot effectively\naccelerate and dissipate their energy, suggesting this transition ends the\nprompt emission and may explain the steep decay phase that follows. We assess\nseveral phenomena potentially related to magnetar birth, including low\nluminosity GRBs, thermal-rich GRBs/X-ray Flashes, very luminous supernovae, and\nshort duration GRBs with extended emission. \n\n"}

As a result, heavy elements will be\nunder-ionized after they have passed through the accretion shock. We have\nstudied systematically the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for relaxed\nclusters in the LambdaCDM cosmology using one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We found that non-equilibrium ionization effects do not depend on\ncluster mass but depend strongly on redshift which can be understood by\nself-similar scaling arguments. The effects are stronger for clusters at lower\nredshifts. We present X-ray signatures such as surface brightness profiles and\nemission lines in detail for a massive cluster at low redshift. In general,\nsoft emission (0.3-1.0 keV) is enhanced significantly by under-ionization, and\nthe enhancement can be nearly an order of magnitude near the shock radius. The\nmost prominent non-equilibrium ionization signature we found is the O VII and O\nVIII line ratio. The ratios for non-equilibrium ionization and collisional\nionization equilibrium models are different by more than an order of magnitude\nat radii beyond half of the shock radius. These non-equilibrium ionization\nsignatures are equally strong for models with different non-adiabatic shock\nelectron heating efficiencies. We have also calculated the detectability of the\nO VII and O VIII lines with the future International X-ray Observatory (IXO).\nDepending on the line ratio measured, we conclude that an exposure of ~130-380\nksec on a moderate-redshift, massive regular cluster with the X-ray\nMicrocalorimeter Spectrometer (XMS) on the IXO will be sufficient to provide a\nstrong test for the non-equilibrium ionization model. \n\n"}

Their implicit assumption is that each numbered solar cycle is a\nconsistent unit in itself, while solar activity seems to consist of a series of\nmuch less tightly intercorrelated individual cycles. Extrapolation methods, in\ncontrast, are based on the premise that the physical process giving rise to the\nsunspot number record is statistically homogeneous, i.e., the mathematical\nregularities underlying its variations are the same at any point of time, and\ntherefore it lends itself to analysis and forecasting by time series methods.\nFinally, instead of an analysis of observational data alone, model based\npredictions use physically (more or less) consistent dynamo models in their\nattempts to predict solar activity.

Particles begin the acceleration by the ExB\ndrift with the accretion flow. The energy gain in the drift regime is limited\nby the conservation of the adiabatic invariant p_perp^2/B. Upon approaching the\nfilament, the drift turns into the gyro-motion around the filament so that the\nparticle moves parallel to the azimuthal electric field. In this 'betatron'\nregime the acceleration speeds up to rapidly reach the electrodynamic limit\n$cp_{max}=eBR$ for an accelerator with magnetic field $B$ and the orbit radius\n$R$ (Larmor radius). The periodic orbit becomes unstable and the particle\nslings out of the filament to the region of a weak (uncompressed) magnetic\nfield, which terminates the acceleration.\n  The mechanism requires pre-acceleration that is likely to occur in structure\nformation shocks upstream or nearby the filament accretion flow.

Assuming that the nonlinear clustering of\ndark matter haloes can be understood, then from conservation arguments one can\nprecisely calculate the clustering properties of the smooth component and its\ncross-correlation with haloes. We then explore how the three main ingredients\nof the halo calculations, the mass function, bias and density profiles are\naffected by WDM.

Results: This technique\nshows that ETGs at a given redshift evolve into brighter galaxies at lower\nredshifts (considering rest-frame, passively evolved optical luminosities).\nThis indicates that the stellar mass of these galaxies increases with time and\nthat, in principle, a stellar mass selection at different redshifts does not\nprovide samples of galaxies in a progenitor-descendant relationship.\nConclusions: The comparison between high redshift ETGs and their likely\ndescendants at z=0 points to a higher number density for the progenitors by a\nfactor 5.5+-4.0, implying the need for mergers to decrease their number density\nby today.

The absence of\nthis emission from bright TeV blazars has been used to constrain the\nintergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), and the stringent limits placed upon the\nunresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) by Fermi has been used to\nargue against a large number of such objects at high redshifts. However, these\nare predicated upon the assumption that inverse-Compton scattering is the\nprimary energy-loss mechanism for the ultra-relativistic pairs produced by the\nannihilation of the energetic gamma rays on extragalactic background light\nphotons. Here we show that for sufficiently bright TeV sources\n(isotropic-equivalent luminosities >10^{42} erg/s) plasma beam instabilities,\nspecifically the \"oblique\" instability, present a plausible mechanism by which\nthe energy of these pairs can be dissipated locally, heating the intergalactic\nmedium. Since these instabilities typically grow on timescales short in\ncomparison to the inverse-Compton cooling rate, they necessarily suppress the\ninverse-Compton cascades. As a consequence, this places a severe constraint\nupon efforts to limit the IGMF from the lack of a discernible GeV bump in TeV\nsources. Similarly, it considerably weakens the Fermi limits upon the evolution\nof blazar populations. Specifically, we construct a TeV-blazar luminosity\nfunction from those objects presently observed and find that it is very well\ndescribed by the quasar luminosity function at z~0.1, shifted to lower\nluminosities and number densities, suggesting that both classes of sources are\nregulated by similar processes. Extending this relationship to higher\nredshifts, we show that the magnitude and shape of the EGRB above ~10 GeV is\nnaturally reproduced with this particular example of a rapidly evolving\nTeV-blazar luminosity function. \n\n"}

By quantifying physical parameters such as mass, velocity, and\norientation of the plasma ejection relative to the magnetic field, we provide a\ndescription of the nature of this particular phenomenon. The time-dependent\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) equations are solved in a box\nextending from the chromosphere to the lower corona. The plasma is heated by\ncurrents that are induced through field line braiding as a consequence of\nphotospheric motions. Spectra of optically thin emission lines in the extreme\nultraviolet range are synthesized, and magnetic field lines are traced over\ntime. Following strong heating just above the chromosphere, the pressure\nrapidly increases, leading to a hydrodynamic explosion above the upper\nchromosphere in the low transition region. The explosion drives the plasma,\nwhich needs to follow the magnetic field lines. The ejection is then moving\nmore or less ballistically along the loop-like field lines and eventually drops\ndown onto the surface of the Sun. The speed of the ejection is in the range of\nthe sound speed, well below the Alfven velocity. The plasma ejection is\nbasically a hydrodynamic phenomenon, whereas the rise of the heating rate is of\nmagnetic nature. The granular motions in the photosphere lead (by chance) to a\nstrong braiding of the magnetic field lines at the location of the explosion\nthat in turn is causing strong currents which are dissipated.

At higher redshifts, the PTA error boxes are larger, and may\ncontain as many as 100 massive-galaxy interlopers.

The entire sample consist of 161\nsources observed by XMM for more than 10 ks in pointed observations which is\nthe largest sample used so far to study AGN X-ray variability on time scales\nless than a day. We compute the excess variance for all AGN, on different\ntime-scales (10, 20, 40 and 80 ks) and in different energy bands (0.3-0.7,\n0.7-2 and 2-10 keV). We observe a highly significant and tight (~0.7 dex)\ncorrelation between excess variance and MBH. The subsample of reverberation\nmapped AGN shows an even smaller scatter (~0.45 dex) comparable to the one\ninduced by the MBH uncertainties. This implies that X-ray variability can be\nused as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than\nthe ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other. A highly significant correlation between\nexcess variance and 2-10 keV spectral index is observed.

The criterion to enter the pair\ninstability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the\nmass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen\ncore mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and\nrotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to\ndetermine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability\neffects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged\npair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars\nwith no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective\ninstability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux\ncriterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,\nthe minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce\neffectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted\nalmost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. For this case, we find that the\nminimum main sequence mass is ~40 Msun to encounter PPISN and ~65 Msun to\nencounter a PISN. When mass-loss is taken into account those mass limits become\n~50 Msun for PPISN and ~80 Msun for PISN progenitors.

Based on the light-travel\ntime effect, the two low-mass M-dwarf companions are found to orbit the binary\npair on moderate to high eccentric orbits. The derived periods of these two\ncompanions are close to a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance. We have studied\nthe stability of the system using the osculating orbital elements as presented\nby Lee et al. Results indicate an orbit-crossing architecture exhibiting\nshort-term dynamical instabilities leading to the escape of one of the proposed\ncompanions. We have examined the system's underlying model parameter-space by\nfollowing a Monte Carlo approach and found an improved fit to the timing data.\nA study of the stability of our best-fitting orbits also indicates that the\nproposed system is generally unstable. If the observed anomalous timing\nvariations of the binary period is due to additional circumbinary companions,\nthen the resulting system should exhibit a long-term stable orbital\nconfiguration much different from the orbits suggested by Lee et al.

We measure excitation temperatures in the part\nof the cloud dominated by triggered star formation (the High Density Layer,\nHDL) of 15-30 K, while in the rest of the cloud, which is relatively unaffected\nby triggering (Low Density Layer, LDL), the excitation temperature is generally\nless than 12 K. We identify a temperature gradient in the HDL which we\nassociate with an age sequence in the embedded massive star-forming regions. We\nmeasure the mass of the cloud to be 4.4+/-0.4 x 10^5 solar masses, in agreement\nwith previous estimates. Existing sub-mm continuum data are used to derive the\nfraction of gas mass in dense clumps as a function of position in the cloud.\nThis fraction, which we interpret as a Clump Formation Efficiency (CFE), is\nsignificantly enhanced across the HDL, probably due to the triggering. Finally,\nwe measure the 3D rms Mach Number as a function of position and find a\ncorrelation between the Mach number and the CFE within the HDL only. This\ncorrelation is interpreted as due to feedback from the newly-formed stars and a\nchange in its slope between the three main star-forming regions is construed as\nanother evolutionary effect. We conclude that triggering has affected the\nstar-formation process in the W3 GMC primarily by creating additional dense\nstructures that can collapse into stars.

The leading theory for the transition in the characteristic\nstellar mass predicts that the cause is the extra cooling provided by\nincreasing metallicity.

We\nuse an approximative treatment of neutrino transport and replace the\nhigh-density interior of the neutron star (NS) by an inner boundary condition\nbased on an analytic proto-NS core-cooling model, whose free parameters are\nchosen such that explosion energy, nickel production, and energy release by the\ncompact remnant of progenitors around 20 solar masses are compatible with\nSupernova 1987A. Thus we are able to simulate the accretion phase, initiation\nof the explosion, subsequent neutrino-driven wind phase for 15-20 s, and the\nfurther evolution of the blast wave for hours to days until fallback is\ncompleted. Our results challenge long-standing paradigms. We find that remnant\nmass, launch time, and properties of the explosion depend strongly on the\nstellar structure and exhibit large variability even in narrow intervals of the\nprogenitors' zero-age-main-sequence mass. While all progenitors with masses\nbelow about 15 solar masses yield NSs, black hole (BH) as well as NS formation\nis possible for more massive stars, where partial loss of the hydrogen envelope\nleads to weak reverse shocks and weak fallback.

Observed differences in\ntemperatures, outflow speeds, and velocity distribution anisotropies are useful\nconstraints on proposed explanations for how the plasma is heated and\naccelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of collisionless\nheating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come\nfrom magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical\ndescription of the radial evolution of Alfven, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD\nwaves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of\ndistance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next we\nsolved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady\nwavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling\nbetween the Alfven and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable\nchoices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the\nfast mode to the Alfven mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron\nresonance. This resonance is efficient at heating protons and other ions in the\ndirection perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and our model\npredicts heating rates for these species that agree well with both\nspectroscopic and in situ measurements. Nonetheless, the high-frequency waves\ncomprise only a small part of the total Alfvenic fluctuation spectrum, which\nremains highly two-dimensional as is observed in interplanetary space. \n\n"}

An essentially unavoidable consequence of\nmass loss during the explosion is that the companion must have an overextended\nenvelope after the explosion. While this has been noted previously, it has not\nbeen strongly emphasized as an inevitable consequence. We calculate the future\nevolution of the companion by injecting 2-6 10^47 ergs into the stellar\nevolution model of a 1 Msun donor star based on the post-explosion progenitors\nseen in simulations. We find that, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz collapse of the\nenvelope, the companion must become significantly more luminous (10 - 10^3\nLsun) for a long period of time (10^3 - 10^4 years). The lack of such a\nluminous \"leftover\" star in the LMC supernova remnant SNR 0609-67.5 provides\nanother piece of evidence against the SD scenario. We also show that none of\nthe stars proposed as the survivors of the Tycho supernova, including Tycho G,\ncould plausibly be the donor star.

These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and\ndestruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives\nsuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind\nmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher\npost-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. Strong AGN feedback is\nrequired to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate.

For this purpose, we use strong lensing and\ngas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the IMF of the\nbulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies with\nsubstantial bulge components taken from the SWELLS survey. We find that the\nstellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic\ndata.

Our results point to the existence of two\nqualitatively different regimes of NuDAF evolution: (1) steady accretion with\nquiescent burning; or (2) detonation of the disk. These outcomes are controlled\nprimarily by the ratio of the nuclear energy released to the enthalpy at the\nburning radius.

Hydrodynamical models show that the cooling\nof a shocked Wolf-Rayet star leads to a much greater difference (> 0.9 dex).\nOur proposed scenario is that of a jet produced during the explosion which\ndeposits 56Ni-rich material in the outer layers of the ejecta. The presence of\nhigh-velocity radioactive material allows us to reproduce the complete\nluminosity evolution of the object.

This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best\nsuited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves).\nThese events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions\nwith low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high\nluminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM.\nAfter about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a\nslow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is\naccelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of\nfilaments seen today. There is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope\nhypothesized to reside outside the Crab.

Once the particle distributions are known, we\ncalculate the intensity of neutrinos. We study the different effects on the\nneutrinos that can change the relative weight of different flavors. In\nparticular, we consider the effects of neutrino oscillations, and of neutrino\nspin precession caused by strong magnetic fields. The expected neutrino signals\nfrom the shocks in the uncorking regions of Population III events is very weak,\nbut the neutrino signal produced by Wolf-Rayet GRBs with $z<0.5$ is not far\nfrom the level of the atmospheric background. The IceCube experiment does not\nhave the sensitivity to detect neutrinos from the implosion of the earliest\nstars, but a number of high-energy neutrinos may be detected from nearby long\nGRBs. The cumulative signal should be detectable over several years ($\\sim 10$\nyr) of integration with the full 86-string configuration. \n\n"}

Due to dissipative processes, the thermal plasma of\nthe ICM contains useless information about the formation of structures and CRs.\nSuch past and current information is carried intact by its non-thermal emission\ncaused by highly relativistic particles spiraling in large-scale magnetic\nfields. The diffuse radio emission is not associated with the active galactic\nnucleus phenomenon and has no optical counterpart. Instead it is associated\nwith the ICM and it is characterized by steep spectrum. The low surface radio\nbrightness features are thought to be formed via re-acceleration of a relic\npopulation of relativistic electrons, or proton-proton collisions with the ICM.\nDiffuse radio sources are classified typically as `relics', `halos',\n'mini-halos' and 'radio-ghosts'.

To\ndistinguish accreting binaries from chromospherically active objects we develop\nand explain criteria based on Halpha and HeI 5786,6678 emission line properties\navailable in the literature.

In contrast, our unmixed delayed detonations\nof Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (DDC series) exhibit a faster brightening\nconcomitant with a shift in color to the blue. In this paper, we study the\norigin of these discrepancies. We find that strong chemical mixing largely\nresolves the photometric mismatch at early times, but it leads to an enhanced\nline broadening that contrasts, for example, with the markedly narrow SiII6355A\nline of SN 2011fe. We also explore an alternative configuration with\npulsational-delayed detonations (PDDEL model series). Because of the pulsation,\nPDDEL models retain more unburnt carbon, have little mass at high velocity, and\nhave a much hotter outer ejecta after the explosion. The pulsation does not\ninfluence the inner ejecta, so PDDEL and DDC models exhibit similar radiative\nproperties beyond maximum. However, at early times, PDDEL models show bluer\noptical colors and a higher luminosity, even for weak mixing. Their early-time\nradiation is derived primarily from the initial shock-deposited energy in the\nouter ejecta rather than radioactive decay heating.

The pulsation periods at\n93.66 s in 2004 and at 93.73 s in 2009 are determined. Pulse profiles of GRO\nJ1008-57 during outbursts are energy dependent: double-peak profile in soft\nbands of 3-7 keV and single-peak profile in hard X-rays above 7 keV. GRO\nJ1008-57 has undergone a spin-down trend from 1993-2009 with a rate of\n4.1x10^-5 s day^-1, and might transfer into a spin-up trend after 2009. The\nspectra from 3-100 keV of GRO J1008-57 during outbursts are fitted with photon\nindex of 1.4 and cutoff energies of 23-29 keV.

Above a\nhard X-ray flux of 10^-9 erg cm^-2 s^-1, the spectra of GRO J1008-57 during\noutbursts need an enhanced hydrogen absorption of column density 6x10^22 cm^-2.\nThe observed dip-like pulse profile of GRO J1008-57 in soft X-ray bands should\nbe caused by this intrinsic absorption. Around the outburst peaks, a possible\ncyclotron resonance scattering feature at 74 keV is detected in the spectra of\nGRO J1008-57, making the source as the neutron star of highest magnetic field\n(6.6x10^12 G) in known accreting X-ray pulsars. Two modulations periods at\n124.38 and 248.78 days are found using RXTE/ASM light curves of GRO J1008-57.\nTwo flare peaks appearing in the folded light curve have different spectral\nproperties.

EXors, a loosely\ndefined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitive\noutbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. The relationship between the\ntwo classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequence\nevolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinct\nclasses, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occur\nin the same evolutionary phases? Over the past couple of decades, many\ntheoretical and numerical models have been developed to explain the origin of\nFUor and EXor outbursts. In parallel, such accretion bursts have been detected\nat an increasing rate, and as observing techniques improve each individual\noutburst is studied in increasing detail.

These composite SEDs were previously\nconstructed from the photometric catalogs of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey, by\nstacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame\nNUV-to-NIR SEDs. In this work, we include a stacked MIPS 24 micron measurement\nfor each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent\nwith previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher\nthan expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR\ncomposite SEDs by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, which\ninclude both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation\nrates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the\nUV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs - compared to the model SFRs - by more\nthan ~ 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming\ngalaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent.

We solve these equations and, as in previous studies, find\nthat the large scale field first grows at a rate independent of the magnetic\nReynolds number R_M before quenching to an R_M dependent regime.

At very low luminosities the\nspectrum is very soft, becoming rapidly harder as the luminosity increases and\nthen, above a particular luminosity, softening again. At a given flux level,\nthe scatter in hardness ratio is not very large, meaning that the spectral\nshape is largely determined by the luminosity. The spectra were therefore\nsummed in luminosity bins and fitted with a variety of models. The best fitting\nmodel consists of two power laws, one unabsorbed and another, more luminous,\nwhich is absorbed. In this model, we find a range of intrinsic 0.5-10.0 keV\nluminosities of approximately 1.1-3.5 ergs/s, and a very large range of\nabsorbing columns, of approximately 10^22 - 10^24 cm^-2.

For specificity,\nthis paper focuses on a type of two-component explosive known as a\nnanothermite, consisting of a metal and an oxide in close proximity. When the\ntwo components interact they undergo a rapid exothermic reaction --- an\nexplosion. As a specific example, we consider metal nanoparticles of 5 nm\nradius embedded in an oxide. One cell contains more than a few million\nnanoparticles, and a large number of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detector\nmass. A WIMP interacts with a metal nucleus of the nanoparticles, depositing\nenough energy to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers.\nWhen one nanoparticle explodes it initiates a chain reaction throughout the\ncell.

If the medium around the supernova is uniform,\nthen $n_{\\rm ISM} \\lesssim 1.3 {\\rm cm^3}$ (3-$\\sigma$), which is the most\nstringent limit for the (uniform) density around a Type Ia SN. Our deep upper\nlimits favor a double-degenerate (DD) scenario--involving two WD stars--for the\nprogenitor system of SN 2014J, as such systems have less circumstellar gas than\nour upper limits. By contrast, most single-degenerate (SD) scenarios, i.e., the\nwide family of progenitor systems where a red giant, main-sequence, or\nsub-giant star donates mass to a exploding WD, are ruled out by our\nobservations. Our estimates on the limits to the gas density surrounding SN\n2011fe, using the flux density limits from Chomiuk et al. (2012), agree well\nwith their results. Although we discuss possibilities for a SD scenario to pass\nobservational tests, as well as uncertainties in the modeling of the radio\nemission, the evidence from SNe 2011fe and 2014J points in the direction of a\nDD scenario for both. \n\n"}

A preference of\n  hydrogen-poor events for extreme emission line galaxies Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are very bright explosions that were only\ndiscovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarf\ngalaxies. Understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellar\nexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover the\nelusive progenitors of SLSNe and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. In\nthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study SUperluminous\nSupernova Host galaxIES, focusing on the sample for which we have obtained\nspectroscopy. We show that SLSNe-I and SLSNe-R (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% in\nour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as Extreme Emission Line\nGalaxies (EELGs). The probability of this happening by chance is negligible and\nwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the SLSN\nphenomenon are related. In contrast, SLSNe-II (hydrogen-rich) occur in more\nmassive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. Therefore, if\nSLSNe-II constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likely\ndifferent from those of H-poor SLSNe. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are, on average,\nnot found in as extreme environments as H-poor SLSNe. We propose that H-poor\nSLSNe result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlier\nthan GRBs. This might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in these\nsystems. SLSNe present a novel method of selecting candidate EELGs independent\nof their luminosity. \n\n"}

The SDSS DR10 database contains a faint, red object at the\nposition of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of\nevidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object\nis likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the\n9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) between +8 and +45 days after discovery\nrevealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features.

In the propagating oscillatory shock\nmodel, oscillation of the Compton cloud is thought to cause QPOs. Thus, in\norder to increase QPO frequency, Compton cloud must collapse steadily in the\nrising phase. In decline phases, exactly opposite should be true. We\ninvestigate cause of this evolution of the Compton cloud. The same viscosity\nparameter which increases the Keplerian disk rate, also moves the inner edge of\nthe Keplerian component, thereby reducing the size of the Compton cloud and\nreducing the cooling time scale. We show that cooling of the Compton cloud by\ninverse Comptonization is enough for it to collapse sufficiently so as to\nexplain the QPO evolution.

For the majority of the\n21 sources, the optical spectroscopy establishes that they are indeed the\nlikely counterparts. One of the criteria we used for the identification was the\npresence of an Ha emission line. The spectra of several sources revealed an Ha\nemission line only after careful subtraction of the F or G stellar spectral\nabsorption lines. In a sub-class of three of these sources the residual Halpha\nemission line is broad (> 400 km/s) which suggests that it is formed in an\naccretion disk, whereas in other cases the line width is such that we currently\ncannot determine whether the line emission is formed in an active star/binary\nor in an accretion disk. GBS source CX377 shows this hidden accretion behaviour\nmost dramatically. The previously-identified broad Ha emission of this source\nis not present in its Gemini spectra taken about 1 year later. However, broad\nemission is revealed after subtracting an F6 template star spectrum. The Gemini\nspectra of three sources (CX446, CX1004, and CXB2) as well as the presence of\npossible eclipses in light curves of these sources suggest that these sources\nare accreting binaries viewed under a high inclination. \n\n"}

Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves.

In a\nprevious study we estimated the neutron star mass as M_NS= 2.68+/-0.14M_Sun\n(statistical error), based on limited spectroscopy and a basic (direct heating)\nlight curve model; however, much larger model-dependent systematics dominate\nthe mass uncertainty. Our new spectroscopy reveals a range of complex source\nbehavior. The variable He I companion wind emission lines can dominate\nbroad-band photometry, especially in red filters or near minimum brightness,\nand the wind flux should complete companion evaporation in a spin-down time.\nThe heated companion face also undergoes dramatic flares, reaching 40,000K over\n20% of the star; this is likely powered by a magnetic field generated in the\ncompanion. The companion center-of-light radial velocity is now well measured\nwith K_CoL = 615.4+/-5.km/s. We detect non-sinusoidal velocity components due\nto the heated face flux distribution.

We find a clear connection between the\ngamma-ray and radio emission, such that every period of gamma-ray activity is\naccompanied by the flaring of the mm-VLBI core and subsequent ejection of a new\nsuperluminal component. However, not all ejections of components are associated\nwith gamma-ray events detectable by Fermi. Clear gamma-ray detections are\nobtained only when components are moving in a direction closer to our line of\nsight.This suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission depends not only on\nthe interaction of moving components with the mm-VLBI core, but also on their\norientation with respect to the observer. Timing of the gamma-ray detections\nand ejection of superluminal components locate the gamma-ray production to\nwithin almost 0.13 pc from the mm-VLBI core, which was previously estimated to\nlie about 0.24 pc from the central black hole. This corresponds to about twice\nthe estimated extension of the broad line region, limiting the external photon\nfield and therefore suggesting synchrotron self Compton as the most probable\nmechanism for the production of the gamma-ray emission. Alternatively, the\ninteraction of components with the jet sheath can provide the necessary photon\nfield to produced the observed gamma-rays by Compton scattering. \n\n"}
{"id": "1505.04719", "contents": "Title: Metallicity at the explosion sites of interacting transients Abstract: Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

Given a model of a progenitor star, an\nexplosion energy, and an amount and distribution of radioactive nickel, SNEC\ngenerates the bolometric light curve, as well as the light curves in different\nbroad bands assuming black body emission.

We estimate\nopacities due to tree level processes involving leptons and quarks above the\nquark-hadron transition, and the most important mesons below the transition. We\nreport final sterile neutrino dark matter phase space densities that are\nsignificantly influenced by these effects, and yet relatively robust to\nremaining uncertainties in the nature of the quark-hadron transition. We also\nprovide transfer functions for cosmological density fluctuations with cutoffs\nat $k \\simeq 10 \\ h \\ {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, that are relevant to galactic structure\nformation. \n\n"}

Abstract: An increasing number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are\ndiscovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light\ncurves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability\nmechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up\nto Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether\nPISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light\ncurve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of\nmacroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting\nobservational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN\nevolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova\nevolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The\ngreatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an\nextreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the\nhydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of\nchemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric\ntemperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider\nrange of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light\ncurves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two\nwell-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme\nchemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore,\nalternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still\nto be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe. \n\n"}

However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves.

The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of\nit falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching\nepisode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the\nprincipal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN\nexplosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the\njet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse\ncore mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular\nmomentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback\nmechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the\nexplosion.

Various indirect methods have been used to\ninvestigate SN Ia progenitor systems but none have produced conclusive results.\nA prediction of single-degenerate models is that H- (or He-) rich material from\nthe envelope of the companion star should be swept up by the SN ejecta in the\nexplosion. Seven SNe Ia have been analysed to date looking for signs of H-rich\nmaterial in their late-time spectra and none were detected. We present results\nfrom new late-time spectra of 11 SNe Ia obtained at the Very Large Telescope\nusing XShooter and FORS2. We present the tentative detection of H-alpha\nemission for SN 2013ct, corresponding to ~0.007 Msun of stripped/ablated\ncompanion star material (under the assumptions of the spectral modelling). This\nmass is significantly lower than expected for single-degenerate scenarios,\nsuggesting that >0.1 Msun of H-rich is present but not observed. We do not\ndetect H-alpha emission in the other 10 SNe Ia. This brings the total sample of\nnormal SNe Ia with non-detections (<0.001-0.058 Msun) of H-rich material to 17\nevents. The simplest explanation for these non-detections is that these objects\ndid not result from the explosion of a CO white dwarf accreting matter from a\nH-rich companion star via Roche-lobe overflow or symbiotic channels. However,\nfurther spectral modelling is needed to confirm this. We also find no evidence\nof He-emission features, but models with He-rich companion stars are not\navailable to place mass limits. \n\n"}

Such a structure may arise in an\n8-12Msun star from a nuclear flash (e.g., of Ne) followed within a few years by\ncore collapse.

Because the mass\nof ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are\nalso expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical\ntransients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with\nshort spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the\nkinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long\nspin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to\nspeculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down\ntimescales. At late times the optical transients will gradually evolve into a\nnebular phase because of the photospheric recession.

To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon.

Previous formulations\nusing reproducing kernel (RK) interpolation have had difficulties maintaining\nconservation of momentum due to the fact the RK kernels are not, in general,\nspatially symmetric. Here, we utilize a reformulation of the fluid equations\nsuch that mass, linear momentum, and energy are all rigorously conserved\nwithout any assumption about kernel symmetries, while additionally maintaining\napproximate angular momentum conservation. Our approach starts from a\nrigorously consistent interpolation theory, where we derive the evolution\nequations to enforce the appropriate conservation properties, at the sacrifice\nof full consistency in the momentum equation. Additionally, by exploiting the\nincreased accuracy of the RK method's gradient, we formulate a simple limiter\nfor the artificial viscosity that reduces the excess diffusion normally\nincurred by the ordinary SPH artificial viscosity. Collectively, we call our\nsuite of modifications to the traditional SPH scheme Conservative Reproducing\nKernel SPH, or CRKSPH. CRKSPH retains many benefits of traditional SPH methods\n(such as preserving Galilean invariance and manifest conservation of mass,\nmomentum, and energy) while improving on many of the shortcomings of SPH,\nparticularly the overly aggressive artificial viscosity and zeroth-order\ninaccuracy.

The simulation covers the full solid angle to allow the\nemergence of large-scale convective modes. Due to core contraction and the\nconcomitant acceleration of nuclear burning, the convective Mach number\nincreases to ~0.1 at collapse, and an l=2 mode emerges shortly before the end\nof the simulation.

The diversity in spin and orbital properties of\nhigh-mass NSs suggests that this is most likely not a result of the recycling\nprocess, but rather reflects differences in the NS birth masses.

The heart of\nthis calculus is a line-of-parallel-angle approach that calculates the\nperturbed distribution function of a given stream segment by undoing the effect\nof all impacts. This approach allows one to compute the perturbed stream\ndensity and track in any coordinate system in minutes for realizations of the\nsubhalo distribution down to 10^5 Msun, accounting for the stream's internal\ndispersion and overlapping impacts. We study the properties of density and\ntrack fluctuations with suites of simulations. The one-dimensional density and\ntrack power spectra along the stream trace the subhalo mass function, with\nhigher-mass subhalos producing power only on large scales, while lower mass\nsubhalos cause structure on smaller scales. The time-dependence of impacts and\nof the evolution of the stream after an impact gives rise to bispectra.

We found that the date given by al-Yamani is fully\nconsistent with other evidence, including: (a) SN 1006 \"rose several times half\nan hour after sunset\" (al-Yamani), which is correct for the location of Sana in\nYemen for the time around Apr 17, but it would not be correct for late Apr or\nearly May; (b) the date (3rd year, 3rd lunar month, 28th day wuzi, Ichidai\nYoki) for an observation of a guest star in Japan is inconsistent (there is no\nday wuzi in that lunar month), but may be dated to Apr 16 by reading wuwu date\nrather than a wuzi date; (c) there is observational evidence that SN 1006 was\nobserved in East Asia early or mid April; for the second half of April, a bad\nweather (early monsoon) period is not unlikely -- there is a lack of night\nreports; (d) the observer in St. Gallen reported to have seen SN 1006 \"for\nthree months\", which must have ended at the very latest on AD 1006 Jul 10,\ngiven his northern location, so that his observations probably started in\nApril. We conclude that the correctly reported details give quite high\nconfidence in the fully self-consistent report of al-Yamani, so that the early\ndiscovery date should be considered seriously. \n\n"}

Alternatively, the spectral diversity could arise from viewing-angle\neffects or merely from a lack of early spectroscopic coverage.

The vertical scale height\nincreases with stellar age at all radii, because (1) stars that formed earlier\nwere thicker \"at birth\", and (2) stars were kinematically heated to an even\nthicker distribution after formation. Stars of the same age are thicker in the\nouter disk than in the inner disk (flaring). These lead to positive vertical\nage gradients and negative radial age gradients. The radial metallicity\ngradient is neg- ative at the mid-plane, flattens at larger disk height |Z|,\nand turns positive above |Z|~1.5kpc.

Instabilities in the wind-wind interaction zone produce\nclumps and filaments in the swept-up shell of nebular material. Turbulent\nmixing and thermal conduction at the corrugated interface can produce\nquantities of intermediate temperature and density gas between the hot, shocked\nwind bubble and the swept-up photoionized nebular material, which can emit in\nsoft, diffuse X-rays. We use the CHIANTI software to compute synthetic spectra\nfor the models and calculate their luminosities. We find that models both with\nconduction and those without can produce the X-ray temperatures and\nluminosities that are in the ranges reported in observations, although the\nmodels including thermal conduction are an order of magnitude more luminous\nthan those without.

Here we present a\nnovel approach to study the stability of hierarchical three-body systems at\narbitrary inclinations, which accounts not only for the instantaneous stability\nof such systems, but also for the secular stability and evolution through\nLidov-Kozai cycles and evection. We generalize the Hill-stability criteria to\narbitrarily inclined triple systems, explain the existence of quasi-stable\nregimes and characterize the inclination dependence of their stability. We\ncomplement the analytic treatment with an extensive numerical study, to test\nour analytic results. We find excellent correspondence up to high inclinations\n$(\\sim120^{\\circ}$), beyond which the agreement is marginal. At such high\ninclinations the stability radius is larger, the ratio between the outer and\ninner periods becomes comparable, and our secular averaging approach is no\nlonger strictly valid.

The ejecta of neutron\nstar mergers are expected to produce such electromagnetic transients, called\nmacronovae. Characteristics of the ejecta include large velocity gradients and\nthe presence of heavy $r$-process elements, which pose significant challenges\nto the accurate calculation of radiative opacities and radiation transport. For\nexample, these opacities include a dense forest of bound-bound features arising\nfrom near-neutral lanthanide and actinide elements. Here we investigate the use\nof fine-structure, line-smeared opacities that preserve the integral of the\nopacity over frequency, which is an alternative approach to the\nexpansion-opacity formalism. The use of area-preserving line profiles produces\nfrequency-dependent opacities that are one to two orders of magnitude greater\nthan those obtained with the use of expansion opacities in the Sobolev\napproximation. Opacities are calculated for four $r$-process elements (cerium,\nneodymium, samarium and uranium) using fully and semi-relativistic methods, as\nwell as different amounts of configuration interaction in the atomic structure,\nin order to test the sensitivity of the emission to the underlying atomic\nphysics. We determine the effect of these new opacities on simulated spectra\nand broad-band light curves by applying a multi-dimensional ray-trace method to\nthe ejecta predicted from 3-dimensional merger calculations. With our\nsubstantially larger opacities the simulations yield slightly lower\nluminosities that peak in the mid-IR.

Although the overall incidence rate is very\nlow, about 1 per cent in each of the Magellanic Clouds, in the case of the SMC\nand pulsation periods between 12 and 16d the incidence rate is nearly 40 per\ncent. On the other hand, in the LMC the highest incidence rate is 5 per cent\nfor pulsation periods between 8 and 14d, and the overall amplitude of the\neffect is smaller. It indicates that the phenomenon is metallicity dependent.\nTypical modulation periods are between 70 and 300d.

Previous studies of such stars were either unable to\nresolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the\nextreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its\nstability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and\nthe heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes\nsuggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary\nstate of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate. Since\nthe general relativistic instability leads to the immediate death of these\nstars, our models place an upper limit on the masses of the first quasars at\nbirth. \n\n"}

The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able to show galactic\nconformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models,\nwhen the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in\nreal space, the mean fraction of quenched galaxies around quenched primary\ngalaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same\nstellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove\nsatellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in\nGALFORM models compared with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is\npartially explained by the fact that in GALFORM once a galaxy becomes a\nsatellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later\ntime in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the\nL-GALAXIES model after removing central galaxies that were ejected from their\nhost halo in the past. Galactic conformity is also influenced by primary\ngalaxies at fixed stellar mass that reside in dark matter haloes of different\nmasses. Finally, we explore a proxy of conformity between distinct haloes. In\nthis case the conformity is weak beyond ~ 3 Mpc/h (<3% in L-GALAXIES, <1-2% in\nGALFORM models). Therefore, it seems difficult that conformity is directly\nrelated with a long-range effect. \n\n"}

We assign a star formation rate to each dark matter halo\nbased on its growth rate, which specifies how much baryonic material becomes\navailable, and the instantaneous baryon conversion efficiency, which determines\nhow efficiently this material is converted to stars, thereby capturing the\nbaryonic physics. Satellites are quenched following the delayed-then-rapid\nmodel, and they are tidally disrupted once their subhalo has lost a significant\nfraction of its mass. The model is constrained with observed data extending out\nto high redshift. The empirical relations are very flexible, and the model\ncomplexity is increased only if required by the data, assessed by several model\nselection statistics. We find that for the same final halo mass galaxies can\nhave very different star formation histories. Nevertheless, the average star\nformation and accretion rates are in good agreement with models following an\nabundance matching strategy. Galaxies that are quenched at $z=0$ typically have\na higher peak star formation rate compared to their star-forming counterparts.\nThe accretion of stars can dominate the total mass of massive galaxies, but is\ninsignificant for low-mass systems, independent of star-formation activity.\nEMERGE predicts stellar-to-halo mass ratios for individual galaxies and\nintroduces scatter self-consistently.

To test if ram pressure stripping (RPS) is the underlying cause, we\nuse a semi-analytic model to quantify the \"observational bias\" that RPS\nintroduces into the aperture-based metallicity measurements. We take integral\nfield spectroscopy of local galaxies, remove gas from their outer galactic\ndisks via RPS, and then conduct mock slit observations of cluster galaxies at\nz=0.35. Our RPS model predicts a typical cluster-scale metallicity gradient of\n-0.03 dex/Mpc. By removing gas from the outer galactic disks, RPS introduces a\nmean metallicity enhancement of +0.02 dex at a fixed stellar mass. This gas\nremoval and subsequent quenching of star formation preferentially removes low\nmass cluster galaxies from the observed star-forming population.

The NuSTAR data, taken at a 3-78 keV\nluminosity of ~6.8e35 erg/s (for a distance of 7.1 kpc), are well described by\nstandard accreting pulsar models, such as an absorbed power-law with a\nhigh-energy cutoff. We find that pulsations are still clearly visible at these\nluminosities, indicating that accretion is continuing despite the very low mass\ntransfer rate. In phase-resolved spectroscopy we find a peculiar variation of\nthe photon index from ~1.5 to ~2.5 over only about 3% of the rotational period.\nThis variation is similar to that observed with XMM-Newton at much higher\nluminosities. It may be connected to the accretion column passing through our\nline of sight. With Swift/XRT we observe luminosities as low as 1e34 erg/s\nduring which the data quality did not allow us to search for pulsations, but\nthe spectrum is much softer and well described by either a blackbody or soft\npower-law continuum. This softer spectrum might be due to the fact that\naccretion has been stopped by the propeller effect and we only observe the\nneutron star surface cooling. \n\n"}

Young neutron stars are\ninvolved in many of the possible scenarios for the origin of FRBs, and it has\nbeen suggested that the high dispersion measures observed in FRBs might be\nproduced by the ionized material in the ejecta of associated supernovae. Using\nVLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact\ncomponent not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the\nfirst time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr\nold) supernova. We show that at age 30 yr, any FRB signal at ~1 GHz would still\nbe largely absorbed by the ejecta. By the time the ejecta have expanded so that\na 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN\nejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion\nmeasures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to\npropagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at\ndistances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc.

The NGC3447/NGC3447A system, member of the LGG\n225 group, a nearby LGA, is considered a physical pair: an intermediate\nluminosity late type spiral, NGC3447, and an irregular companion, NGC3447A,\nlinked by a faint filament of matter. A ring-like structure in the NGC3447\noutskirts is emphasised by UV observations. This work aims to contribute to the\nunderstanding of galaxy evolution in low density environments, favourable\nhabitat to highly effective encounters. We performed a multi-wavelength\nanalysis of the surface photometry of this system to derive spectral energy\ndistribution and structural properties using UV and optical images. We also\ncharacterised the velocity field of the pair using new kinematic observations.\nAll these data are used to constrain smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations\nwith chemo-photometric implementation to shed light on the evolution of this\nsystem. Luminosity profiles are all consistent with the presence of a disc\nextending and including NGC3447A. The overall velocity field does not emphasise\nany significant rotation pattern, rather a small velocity gradient between\nNGC3447 and NGC3447A. Our simulation, detached from a large grid explored to\nbest-fit the global properties of the system, suggests that this arises from an\nencounter between two halos of equal mass. NGC3447 and NGC3447A belong to the\nsame halo, NGC3447A being a substructure of the same disk as NGC3447. The halo\ngravitational instability, enhanced by the encounter, fuels a long lived\ninstability in this dark matter dominated disk, driving its morphology. This\nsystem may warn about a new class of \"false pairs\" and the potential danger of\na misunderstanding of such objects in pair surveys that could produce a severe\nunderestimate of the total mass of the system.

Abstract: Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness\ndistributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition\ndisks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms. We calculate predictions for vortex observability in the\nsub-millimeter continuum with ALMA. We found that the azimuthal and radial\nextent of brightness asymmetry correlates with vortex formation process, within\nthe limitations of alpha-viscosity prescription. \n\n"}

This paper places constraints\non progenitor initial mass and metallicity in distinct core-collapse SN\nsubclasses, through a study of the parent stellar populations at the explosion\nsites. Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of 83 nearby SN explosion sites with a\nmedian distance of 18 Mpc has been collected and analysed, enabling detection\nand spectral extraction of the parent stellar population of SN progenitors.\nFrom the parent stellar population spectrum, the initial mass and metallicity\nof the coeval progenitor are derived by means of comparison to simple stellar\npopulation models and strong-line methods. Additionally, near-infrared IFS was\nemployed to characterise the star formation history at the explosion sites. No\nsignificant metallicity differences are observed among distinct SN types. The\ntypical progenitor mass is found to be highest for SN Ic, followed by type Ib,\nthen types IIb and II.

The\nnewly-revealed effects of the prevailing small-scale magnetic field within the\nconvection zone may offer possible solutions to this problem. The small-scale\nmagnetic fields can reduce the convective amplitude of small-scale motions\nthrough the Lorentz-force feedback, which concurrently inhibits the turbulent\nmixing of entropy between upflows and downflows. As a result, the effective\nPrandtl number may exceed unity inside the solar convection zone. In this\npaper, we propose and numerically confirm a possible suppression mechanism of\nconvective velocity in the effectively high-Prandtl number regime. If the\neffective horizontal thermal diffusivity decreases (the Prandtl number\naccordingly increases), the subadiabatic layer which is formed near the base of\nthe convection zone by continuous depositions of low entropy transported by\nadiabatically downflowing plumes is enhanced and extended. The global\nconvective amplitude in the high-Prandtl thermal convection is thus reduced\nespecially in the lower part of the convection zone via the change in the mean\nentropy profile which becomes more subadiabatic near the base and less\nsuperadiabatic in the bulk. \n\n"}

Depositing the magnetar energy in a narrow mass shell\nat the ejecta base leads to the formation of a dense shell at a few 1000km/s,\nwhich causes a light-curve bump at the end of the photospheric phase.\nDepositing this energy over a broad range of mass in the inner ejecta, to mimic\nthe effect of multi-dimensional fluid instabilities, prevents the formation of\na dense shell and produces an earlier-rising and smoother light curve. The\nmagnetar influence on the SN radiation is generally not visible prior to\n20-30d, during which one may discern a BSG from a RSG progenitor.

Abstract: In the Hall magnetohydrodynamics, the onset condition of the Kelvin Helmholtz\ninstability is solely determined by the Hall effect and is independent of the\nnature of shear flows. In addition, the physical mechanism behind the super and\nsub Alfvenic flows becoming unstable is quite different: the high frequency\nright circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic\nflows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave\nbecomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate\nof the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than\nthe corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the\nHall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)\nchannel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become\nKelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller\nthan the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of\nthe flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the\ninduction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a\nnew overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin\nHelmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the\nadvection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven\nMach number and is independent of the Hall diffusion coefficient. Further, the\ngrowth rate in this case linearly increase with the Alfven frequency with\nsmaller slope for sub Alfvenic flows. \n\n"}

But the role of magnetic fields and charged dust has not\nyet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas which obeys ideal MHD and\nis coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external\nacceleration (e.g., gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas.

The\ngravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain these kicks as consequences of\nasymmetric mass ejection during the supernova (SN) explosion. Support for this\nhydrodynamic explanation is provided by observations of SN remnants with\nassociated NSs, which confirm the prediction that the bulk of the explosion\nejecta, in particular chemical elements between silicon and the iron group, are\ndominantly expelled in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of the NS kick.\nHere, we present a large set of two- and three-dimensional explosion\nsimulations of electron-capture SNe, considering explosion energies between\n~3x10^49 erg and ~1.6x10^50 erg. We find that the fast acceleration of the SN\nshock in the steep density gradient delimiting the O-Ne-Mg core of the\nprogenitor enables such a rapid expansion of neutrino-heated matter that the\ngrowth of neutrino-driven convection freezes out quickly in a high-mode\nspherical harmonics pattern. Since the corresponding momentum asymmetry of the\nejecta is very small and the gravitational acceleration by the fast-expanding\nejecta abates rapidly, the NS kick velocities are at most a few km/s. The\nextremely low core compactness of O-Ne-Mg-core progenitors therefore favors\nhydrodynamic NS kicks much below the ~160 km/s measured for the Crab pulsar.\nThis suggests either that the Crab Nebula is not the remnant of an\nelectron-capture SN, but of a low-mass iron-core progenitor, or that the Crab\npulsar was not accelerated by the gravitational tug-boat mechanism but received\nits kick by a non-hydrodynamic mechanism such as, e.g., anisotropic neutrino\nemission. \n\n"}

This\ndiversity might be related to the details of the super-Eddington accretion and\nemission physics relevant to TDE disks. In this Letter, we utilize novel\nthree-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulations to study the super-Eddington compact disk phase expected in TDEs.\nConsistent with previous studies, geometrically thick disks, wide-angle\noptically-thick fast outflows and relativistic jets are produced.

Most current predictions are based on the\nMaxwellian approximation which is not only theoretically inconsistent in\nbounded systems, but also not supported by cosmological simulations. A more\nconsistent method sometimes used in calculations for direct WIMP searches\nrelies on the so-called Eddington inversion method, which relates the DM\nphase-space distribution function (DF) to its mass density profile and the\ntotal gravitational potential of the system. Originally built upon the isotropy\nassumption, this method can be extended to anisotropic systems. We investigate\nthese inversion methods in the context of Galactic DM searches, motivated by\nthe fact that the MW is a strongly constrained system, and should be even more\nso with the ongoing Gaia survey.

The impact that General\nRelativistic principles have on this structure has been the subject of many\nresearch papers. In this paper we consider within the context of General\nRelativity a prototype model for this problem by assuming that a star consists\nof polytropic gas. To justify this assumption we observe that stars undergo\nthermodynamically irreversible processes and emit heat and radiation to their\nsurroundings. Due to the emission of this energy it is worthwhile to consider\nan idealized model in which the gas is polytropic. To find interior solutions\nto the Einstein equations of General Relativity in this setting we derive a\nsingle equation for the cumulative mass distribution of the star and use\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to derive formulas for the isentropic index\nand coefficient. Using these formulas we present analytic and numerical\nsolutions for the polytropic structure of self-gravitating stars and examine\ntheir stability.

The radio and X-ray afterglows of GW170817 exhibited delayed\nonset, a gradual rise in the emission with time as t^0.8, a peak at about 150\ndays post-merger, followed by a relatively rapid decline. To date, various\nmodels have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a\nchoked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However,\nthe observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817\nlaunched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817\nexhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger.\nThis measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that,\nwhile the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow\n(cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and\nnarrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of <5 degrees, and observed from\na viewing angle of about 20 degrees.

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data. We\nshow that if the sky position and the redshift of the binary can be identified\nvia the EM counterpart and an associated host galaxy, then for 50$\\%$ of the\nsystems the viewing angle can be constrained to $\\leq 7^{\\circ}$ uncertainty\nfrom the GW data, independent of electromagnetic emission models.

We find that grid resolution, tracer number density and mass\nassignment scheme all have a significant impact on the performance of our\nreconstruction method, with triangular-shaped-cloud (TSC) mass assignment and a\ngrid resolution of ${\\sim}1{-}2h^{-1}$ Mpc being the optimal choice.

In this paper, we use a suite of\ncosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations of a single galaxy cluster, drawn\nfrom the nIFTy comparison project, to study how the dynamics of substructure\naccreted from the cosmic web influences the thermodynamical properties of the\nICM in the cluster's outskirts.

The range of astrophysical codes and galaxy formation models in\nour comparison are broadly consistent in their predictions (e.g. agreeing when\nand where shocks occur, but differing in how strong shocks will be); this is as\nwe would expect of a process driven by large-scale gravitational dynamics and\nstrong, inefficiently radiating, shocks.

I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model.

This creates the feedback\nthat limits the X-ray luminosity of the compact secondary. Wind inhibition\nmight be weakened by the effect of small-scale wind inhomogeneities (clumping)\npossibly affecting the limiting X-ray luminosity. We study the influence of\nX-ray irradiation on the stellar wind for different radial distributions of\nclumping. We calculate hot star wind models with external irradiation and\nclumping using our global wind code. The models are calculated for different\nparameters of the binary. We determine the parameters for which the X-ray wind\nionization leads to a decrease of the radiative force. This causes a decrease\nof the wind velocity and even of the mass-loss rate in the case of extreme\nX-ray irradiation. Clumping weakens the effect of X-ray irradiation because it\nfavours recombination and leads to an increase of the wind mass-loss rate. The\nbest match between the models and observed properties of high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXB) is derived with radially variable clumping. We describe the\ninfluence of X-ray irradiation on the terminal velocity and on the mass-loss\nrate in a parametric way. The X-ray luminosities predicted within the Bondi\ntheory agree nicely with observations when accounting for X-ray irradiation.\nThe ionizing feedback regulates the accretion onto the compact companion\nresulting in a relatively stable X-ray source. The wind-powered accretion model\ncan account for large luminosities in HMXBs only when introducing the ionizing\nfeedback. There are two possible states following from the dependence of X-ray\nluminosity on the wind terminal velocity and mass-loss rate. One state has low\nX-ray luminosity and a nearly undisturbed wind, and the second state has high\nX-ray luminosity and exhibits a strong influence of X-rays on the flow. \n\n"}

These similar C and Mg abundances within and across galaxies\nset a lower limit for star-formation timescales. Conversely, N and Ca are\ngenerally offset to lower abundances. The under-abundance of Ca compared to Mg\nimplies delayed enrichment of Ca through Type Ia supernovae, whereas the\ncorrelated behaviour of Ti and the lighter $\\alpha$ elements, C and Mg, suggest\ncontributions to Ti from Type II supernovae.

This line ratio is sensitive to the hardness of the stellar energy\ndistribution and therefore to the most massive stars present.\n  We conclude from our models, with consideration of recent determinations of\nthe stellar census in local, high-mass star forming regions, that the\n[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios we measure are consistent with the formation of massive\n(~50-100 solar mass) stars in most starbursts.

For lighter helium core masses, ~40 to 63 M_sun, violent pulsations\noccur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass\nejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus\ncleanly separating the heavy element nucleosynthesis of pair instability\nsupernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole\nformation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main sequence\nmasses between about 25 M_sun and 140 M_sun (M_He = 9 to 63 M_sun) as well as\nthose above 260 M_sun.

(2) How much do E/S0 galaxies contribute to the\ncounts in deep mid-infrared (MIR: 3 -- 20$\\mu m$) surveys? Among three new\nmodels for evolution of dusty galaxies, it is assumed in Model S1 that\nstarburst galaxies are the dominant population, and in Model S2 that normal\ngalaxies dominate. Model S3 is an intermediate model. Comparing the model\npredictions with a wide range of observational data collected from the\nliterature, we find that none of these models can be ruled out, given the\nuncertainties of the data. We show that the most direct method to distinguish\nthese models is to compare the predicted color distributions of IR galaxies\nwith observations, which will soon be available from the SWIRE survey. The\nmodels for E/S0 galaxies follow a simple passive evolution approach. Among the\nthree E/S0 models (E1, E2 and E3) investigated in this paper, Model E2 which is\nspecified by a peak formation redshift $z_{peak}=2$, and an e-folding formation\ntime scale $\\omega=2$ Gyr, fits the data best. This suggests a synchronization\nbetween the evolution of E/S0 galaxies and of starburst galaxies, in the sense\nthat the peak of the formation function of E/S0s ($z_{peak}=2$) is close to the\npeak of the evolution functions of starburst galaxies ($z_{peak} = 1.4$). New\npredictions for counts and confusion limits in the SIRTF bands are presented. \n\n"}

This issue is of particular\ninterest at the present time since most of the observed multiple lens systems\nhave magnification ratios and image geometries that are not well-fit by\nstandard mass models. The presence of substructure exterior to the lens has\nbeen invoked by several authors in the context of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models\nin order to explain the anamolous magnification ratios. We emphasize that the\nanomalous magnification ratios may be an artifact of the simple one-component\nmass models currently in use; the inclusion of a misaligned disk may be able to\nmimic the effect of substructure. These slight spatial offsets between the dark\nmatter halo and the disk, which are likely to occur during or as a consequence\nof interactions or mergers, lead to complex image configurations and\nnon-standard magnification ratios. We investigate two illustrative lens models:\na spiral disk embedded within a dark matter halo, and a compact disk-like\ncomponent within an elliptical galaxy.

In such cases we find\nthat the resultant lensing geometries are unusual, with high image\nmultiplicities. The caustic structures - both radial and tangential - are\ndrastically modified and the magnification ratios differ compared to\nexpectations from standard lens models.

For magnetar-strength ($\\sim10^{15}$ G) large scale\nsurface magnetic fields, this outflow is magnetically-dominated during the\nentire cooling epoch.Because the strong magnetic field forces the wind to\nco-rotate with the protoneutron star,this outflow can significantly effect the\nneutron star's early angular momentum evolution, as in analogous models of\nstellar winds (e.g. Weber & Davis 1967). If the rotational energy is large in\ncomparison with the supernova energy and the spindown timescale is short with\nrespect to the time required for the supernova shockwave to traverse the\nstellar progenitor, the energy extracted may modify the supernova shock\ndynamics significantly.

The\nslopes of the resulting period-luminosity relations are in very good agreement\nwith the slopes of these relations measured in the LMC by Persson et al.\nFitting the LMC slopes to our data, we have derived distance moduli in J and K.\nUsing these values together with the values derived in the optical V and I\nbands in our previous work, we have determined an improved total reddening for\nNGC 300 of E(B-V)=0.096 +/- 0.006 mag, which yields extremely consistent values\nfor the absorption-corrected distance modulus of the galaxy from VIJK bands.\nOur distance result for NGC 300 from this combined optical/near infrared\nCepheid study is (m-M)_0 = 26.37 +/- 0.04 (random) +/- 0.03 (systematic) mag\nand is tied to an adopted true LMC distance modulus of 18.50 mag. Both random\nand systematic uncertainties are dominated by photometric errors, while errors\ndue to reddening, metallicity effects and crowding are less important. Our\ndistance determination is consistent with the earlier result from near-infrared\n(H-band) photometry of two Cepheids in NGC 300 by Madore et al., but far more\naccurate. Our distance value also agrees with the HST Key Project result of\nFreedman et al., and with the recent distance estimate for NGC 300 from Butler\net al. from the TRGB I-band magnitude when our improved reddening is used to\ncalculate the absorption corrections. Our distance results from the different\noptical and near-infrared bands indicate that the reddening law in NGC 300 must\nbe very similar to the Galactic one. \n\n"}

In order for a massive star to become a\nWR star, it must shed its H envelope, but new estimates of the effects of\nclumping in winds indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss\nmassive stars above roughly 40-50 Msun, for which the best alternative is mass\nloss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest\nexample of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of eta Car, when the\nstar shed 12-20 Msun or more in less than a decade. Other examples are\ncircumstellar nebulae of LBVs, extragalactic eta Car analogs (``supernova\nimpostors''), and massive shells around SNe and GRBs. We do not yet fully\nunderstand what triggers LBV outbursts, but they occur nonetheless, and present\na fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals\nbecomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a\ncontinuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are\ninsensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a\npivotal role in the evolution and fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early\nuniverse.

The F_g force is conveyed by a transverse vacuuonic\ndipole-moment wave traveling at the velocity of light and can penetrate matter\nfreely. In all of respects, the F_g force represents a viable cause of Newton's\nuniversal gravity. \n\n"}
