The theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking however, is\ninherently an equilibrium theory, which does not address the dynamics of\nquantum systems in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we will use the example of a\nparticular antiferromagnetic model system to show that the presence of a\nso-called thin spectrum of collective excitations with vanishing energy -one of\nthe well-known characteristic properties shared by all symmetry-breaking\nobjects- can allow these objects to also spontaneously break time-translation\nsymmetry in the thermodynamic limit.

In this\ntheory the zeroth-order Hamiltonian describes the vibrational motion in a\nsingle random valley harmonically extended to infinity. This Hamiltonian is\ntractable, is evaluated a priori for monatomic liquids, and the same\nHamiltonian (the same set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) is used for\nequilibrium and nonequlibrium theory. Here, for the self intermediate\nscattering function Fself(q,t) we find the vibrational contribution is in near\nperfect agreement with molecular dynamics (MD) through short and intermediate\ntimes, at all q. This is direct confirmation that normal mode vibrational\ncorrelations are present in the motion of the liquid state. The primary transit\neffect is diffusive motion of the vibrational equilibrium positions, as the\nliquid transits rapidly among random valleys. This motion is modeled as a\nstandard random walk, and the resulting theoretical Fself(q,t) is in excellent\nagreement with MD results at all q and t. In the limit for q to infinity, the\ntheory automatically exhibits the correct approach to the free-particle limit.\nAlso in the limit for q to zero, the hydrodynamic limit emerges as well.

In a viscous regime at low fields the wall moves rigidly\nwith a velocity proportional to the field. Above a critical field the viscous\nmotion breaks down giving way to oscillations accompanied by a slow drift of\nthe wall.

In principle, comparing this model\nto the full rotating Boussinesq system allows us to gauge the importance of\nwave-vortical-wave vs. wave-wave-wave interactions in determining the transfer\nand distribution of wave-mode energy. As in many atmosphere-ocean phenomena we\nwork in a skewed aspect ratio domain (H/L) with Fr = Ro < 1 such that Bu = 1.\nOur focus is on the equilibration of wave-mode energy and its spectral scaling\nunder the influence of random large-scale forcing. As anticipated, when forcing\nis applied to all modes, with Fr=Ro ~ 0.05 and H/L=1/5, the wave-mode energy\nequilibrates and its spectrum scales as a power-law. For the same parameters,\nwhen forcing is restricted to only wave modes, the energy fails to equilibrate\nin both the full system as well as the GGG subsystem at resolutions we can\nachieve. This cleary demonstrates the importance of the vortical mode in\ndetermining the wave-mode energy distribution. Proceeding to the second set of\nsimulations, i.e. for the larger Fr=Ro ~ 0.1 in a less skewed aspect ratio\ndomain with H/L=1/3, we observe that the energy of the GGG subsystem\nequilibrates. Further, the full system with forcing restricted to wave modes\nalso equilbrates and both yield identical energy spectra.

Apparently, the biases do not result from\ntransient effects, but depend on the imperfect closure of the energy cycle in\nthe fluid components and on inconsistencies over land. Therefore, the planetary\nemission temperature is underestimated. This may explain the CMs' cold bias. In\nthe pre-industrial scenario, CMs agree on the location in the mid-latitudes of\nthe peaks of the meridional atmospheric enthalpy transport, while large\ndiscrepancies exist on the intensity. Disagreements on the location and\nintensity of the oceanic transport peaks are serious.

Here we examine and advance a theory as to how condensation\ninfluences atmospheric pressure through the mass removal of water from the gas\nphase with a simultaneous account of the latent heat release. Building from the\nfundamental physical principles we show that condensation is associated with a\ndecline in air pressure in the lower atmosphere.

According to this\nanalysis, the stable stratification $N^2\\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,\nand the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with\nthe potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.\nGlobally, $Fr_t^2 \\leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than\nthe total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the\nkinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the\nother hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy\n($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to\nthe kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile\n$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must\nbe long-wave scale. Locally, the flow is unstable as the gradient Richardson\nnumber $Ri>1/4$.

This\ncriterion ensures the existence of \"stable\" local solutions that do no break\ndown too fast due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. It can be seen both as a\ntwo-fluid generalization of the Rayleigh-Taylor criterion and as a nonlinear\nversion of the Kelvin stability condition. We show that gravity can control the\ninertial effects of the shear up to frequencies that are high enough for the\nsurface tension to play a relevant role. This explains why surface tension is a\nnecessary condition for well-posedness while the (low frequency) main dynamics\nof interfacial waves is unaffected by it. In order to derive a practical\nversion of this criterion, we work with a nondimensionalized version of the\nequations and allow for the possibility of various asymptotic regimes, such as\nthe shallow water limit. This limit being singular, we have to derive a new\nsymbolic analysis of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator that includes an infinitely\nsmoothing \"tail\" accounting for the contribution of the bottom.

The\nresulting quasi-one-dimensional spin model is a two-leg AFM ladder with\nfrustrating next-nearest-neighbor couplings along the legs. The individual\ncouplings are estimated from band structure calculations and by fitting the\nmagnetic susceptibility with theoretical predictions, obtained using ED. The\nnearest-neighbor leg coupling J1, the rung coupling J4, and one of the\nnext-nearest-neighbor couplings J2 amount to 120-150 K, while the second\nnext-nearest-neighbor coupling is J2'~J2/2. The spin ladders do not match the\nstructural chains, and although the next-nearest-neighbor interactions J2 and\nJ2' have very similar superexchange pathways, they differ substantially in\nmagnitude due to a tiny difference in the O-O distances and in the arrangement\nof non-magnetic PO4 tetrahedra. An extensive ED study of the proposed model\nprovides the low-energy excitation spectrum and shows that the system is in the\nstrong rung coupling regime. The strong frustration by the\nnext-nearest-neighbor couplings leads to a triplon branch with an\nincommensurate minimum.

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes.

This requires equilibrium between the\ntemperature-dependent rate of greenhouse-gas consumption by weathering,and\ngreenhouse-gas resupply by other processes.

(1) If small changes in pressure alter the temperature distribution\nacross a planet's surface such that the weathering rate increases when the\npressure decreases, a positive feedback occurs involving increasing weathering\nrate near the substellar point, decreasing pressure, and increasing substellar\nsurface temperature. (2) When decreases in pressure increase the surface area\nabove the melting point (through reduced advective cooling of the substellar\npoint), and the corresponding increase in volume of liquid causes net\ndissolution of the atmosphere, a further decrease in pressure occurs.

RHESSI's pioneering\n{\\gamma}-ray line imaging of energetic ions, revealing footpoints straddling a\nflare loop arcade, has provided strong evidence that ion acceleration is also\nrelated to magnetic reconnection. Flare particle acceleration is shown to have\na close relationship to impulsive Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events\nobserved in the interplanetary medium, and also to both fast coronal mass\nejections and gradual SEP events. \n\n"}

Abstract: The Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis considers that greenhouse gas\nconcentrations should have declined during the Holocene in absence of humankind\nactivity, leading to glacial inception around the present. It partly relies on\nthe fact that present levels of northern summer incoming solar radiation are\nclose to those that, in the past, preceded a glacial inception phenomenon,\nassociated to declines in greenhouse gas concentrations. However, experiments\nwith various numerical models of glacial cycles show that next glacial\ninception may still be delayed by several ten thousands of years, even with the\nassumption of greenhouse gas concentration declines during the Holocene.\nFurthermore, as we show here, conceptual models designed to capture the gross\ndynamics of the climate system as a whole suggest also that small disturbances\nmay sometimes cause substantial delays in glacial events, causing a fair level\nof unpredictability on ice age dynamics. This suggests the need of a validated\nmathematical description of the climate system dynamics that allows us to\nquantify uncertainties on predictions. Here, it is proposed to organise our\nknowledge about the physics and dynamics of glacial cycles through a Bayesian\ninference network.

Several recent studies\nargue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible\nbifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models. However, a broader\ndefinition of a `tipping point' also includes other abrupt, non-linear changes\nthat are neither bifurcations nor necessarily irreversible. Examination of\nsatellite data for Arctic sea-ice area reveals an abrupt increase in the\namplitude of seasonal variability in 2007 that has persisted since then. We\nidentified this abrupt transition using recently developed methods that can\ndetect multi-modality in time-series data and sometimes forewarn of\nbifurcations. When removing the mean seasonal cycle (up to 2008) from the\nsatellite data, the residual sea-ice fluctuations switch from uni-modal to\nmulti-modal behaviour around 2007. We originally interpreted this as a\nbifurcation in which a new lower ice cover attractor appears in deseasonalised\nfluctuations and is sampled in every summer-autumn from 2007 onwards. However,\nthis interpretation is clearly sensitive to how the seasonal cycle is removed\nfrom the raw data, and to the presence of continental land masses restricting\nwinter-spring ice fluctuations. Furthermore, there was no robust early warning\nsignal of critical slowing down prior to the hypothesized bifurcation. Early\nwarning indicators do however show destabilization of the summer-autumn sea-ice\ncover since 2007. Thus, the bifurcation hypothesis lacks consistent support,\nbut there was an abrupt and persistent increase in the amplitude of the\nseasonal cycle of Arctic sea-ice cover in 2007, which we describe as a\n(non-bifurcation) `tipping point'. Our statistical methods detect this `tipping\npoint' and its time of onset. \n\n"}

As a consequence, the\ncoarse-grained vorticity field can be predicted through standard statistical\nmechanics arguments (relying on the Hamiltonian structure of the\ntwo-dimensional Euler flow), for any given set of the integral constraints.\n  It has been suggested that the theory applies equally well to geophysical\nturbulence; specifically in the case of the quasi-geostrophic equations, with\npotential vorticity playing the role of the advected quantity. In this study,\nwe demonstrate analytically that the Miller-Robert-Sommeria theory leads to\nnon-trivial statistical equilibria for quasi-geostrophic flows on a rotating\nsphere, with or without bottom topography.

The novelty is the introduction of a new exchange and correlation\npotential, the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJLDA). In this paper, we\nreport our detailed analysis of this recent work.

Though the mean sea ice area has decreased\nsteadily in the period of satellite observations, a dramatic transition in the\ndynamics was initiated with the record low September ice area in 2007. The\nchange is much more pronounced in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle than in\nthe annual mean ice area. The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly\nconstant for the whole observational record despite the general decline. A\nsimple explanation, independent of the increased greenhouse warming, for the\nshape of the seasonal cycle is offered. Thus the dramatic climate change in\narctic ice area is seen in the amplitude of the cycle and to a lesser extend\nthe annual mean and the summer ice extend. The reason why the climate change is\nmost pronounced in the amplitude is related to the rapid reduction in perennial\nice and thus a thinning of the ice. The analysis shows that a tipping point for\nthe arctic ice area was crossed in 2007. \n\n"}

Searching for terrestrial planets in the HZ of\nnearby stars is the stated goal of ongoing and planned extrasolar planet\nsurveys. Previous estimates of the inner edge of the HZ were based on\none-dimensional radiative-convective models. The most serious limitation of\nthese models is the inability to predict cloud behavior. Here we use global\nclimate models with sophisticated cloud schemes to show that due to a\nstabilizing cloud feedback, tidally locked planets can be habitable at twice\nthe stellar flux found by previous studies. This dramatically expands the HZ\nand roughly doubles the frequency of habitable planets orbiting red dwarf\nstars. At high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near\nthe substellar location that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce\nsurface temperatures. Higher insolation produces stronger substellar convection\nand therefore higher albedo, making this phenomenon a stabilizing climate\nfeedback. Substellar clouds also effectively block outgoing radiation from the\nsurface, reducing or even completely reversing the thermal emission contrast\nbetween dayside and nightside. The presence of substellar water clouds and the\nresulting clement surface conditions will therefore be detectable with the\nJames Webb Space Telescope. \n\n"}

This issue is especially important for Epoch of\nReionisation (EoR) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted HI signals\nfrom the time of the earliest structures in the Universe. We explore the RFI\nsituation at 30-163 MHz by studying brightness histograms of visibility data\nobserved with LOFAR, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used in\ncosmology. An empirical RFI distribution model is derived that allows the\nsimulation of RFI in radio observations. The brightness histograms show an RFI\ndistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponent\naround -1.5. With several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniform\ndistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existing\npropagation models. Extrapolation of the power law implies that the current\nLOFAR EoR observations should be severely RFI limited if the strength of RFI\nsources remains strong after time integration. This is in contrast with actual\nobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to be\nlimited by RFI. Therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there are\nundetected RFI sources that will become visible in long observations.\nConsequently, there is no indication that RFI will prevent an EoR detection\nwith LOFAR. \n\n"}

The formalism provided similar physics to\ndynamical mean-field theory at a tiny fraction of the cost, but was inherently\nlimited by the construction of a bath designed to reproduce ground state,\nstatic properties. Here, we generalize the concept of quantum embedding to\ndynamic properties and demonstrate accurate bulk spectral functions at\nsimilarly small computational cost.

A symmetric form of the two-layer kinetic equation for Rossby\nwaves is derived using canonical variables, allowing the turbulent cascade of\nenergy between the barotropic and baroclinic modes to be studied. It turns out\nthat energy is transferred via local triad interactions from the large-scale\nbaroclinic modes to the baroclinic and barotropic modes at the Rossby\ndeformation scale. From there it is then transferred to the large-scale\nbarotropic modes via a nonlocal inverse transfer. Using scale separation a sys-\ntem of coupled equations were obtained for the small-scale baroclinic component\nand the large-scale barotropic component. Since the total energy of the\nsmall-scale component is not conserved, but the total barotropic plus\nbaroclinic energy is conserved, the baroclinic energy loss at small scales will\nbe compensated by the growth of the barotropic energy at large scales.

The octamer state was considered to be a spin-singlet state\ninduced by a Peieirls instability through the strong anisotropy of $d$\norbitals, the so-called orbital Peierls state. We reexamine this picture by\ntaking into account the spin-orbit coupling which was ignored in the previous\nstudy. We derive a low-energy effective model between $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$\nquasispins on Ir$^{4+}$ cations in an octamer from the multiorbital Hubbard\nmodel with the strong spin-orbit coupling by performing the perturbation\nexpansion from the strong correlation limit. The effective Hamiltonian is in\nthe form of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model but with an additional interaction, a\nsymmetric off-diagonal exchange interaction originating from the perturbation\nprocess including both d-d and d-p-d hopping. Analyzing the effective\nHamiltonian on two sites and the octamer by the exact diagonalization, we find\nthat there is a competition between a spin-singlet state and a quadrupolar\nstate. The former singlet state is a conventional one, adiabatically connected\nto the orbital-Peierls state. On the other hand, the latter quadrupolar state\nis stabilized by the additional interaction, which consists of a linear\ncombination of different total spin momenta along the spin quantization axis.\nIn the competing region, the model exhibits paramagnetic behavior with a\nrenormalized small effective moment at low temperature. This peculiar remnant\nparamagnetism is not obtained in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model without the\nadditional interaction.

Lengthening of waves to\nmatch the wind speed is shown to be very inefficient and consume a large\nfraction of the energy imparted by the wind. The surface shear provides a low\nenergy sink that absorbs most of the momentum from the wind. These produce\nbounds on the efficiency of wave growth.

The need\nto use stochastic approaches in weather and climate models arises because we\nstill cannot resolve all necessary processes and scales in comprehensive\nnumerical weather and climate prediction models. In many practical applications\none is mainly interested in the largest and potentially predictable scales and\nnot necessarily in the small and fast scales. For instance, reduced order\nmodels can simulate and predict large scale modes. Statistical mechanics and\ndynamical systems theory suggest that in reduced order models the impact of\nunresolved degrees of freedom can be represented by suitable combinations of\ndeterministic and stochastic components and non-Markovian (memory) terms.\nStochastic approaches in numerical weather and climate prediction models also\nlead to the reduction of model biases.

In the limit of low bottom\nfriction, classical theory of geostrophic turbulence predicts an inverse\ncascade of kinetic energy in the horizontal with condensation at the domain\nscale and barotropization on the vertical. By contrast, in the limit of large\nbottom friction, the flow is dominated by ribbons of high kinetic energy in the\nupper layer. These ribbons correspond to meandering jets separating regions of\nhomogenized potential vorticity. We interpret these result by taking advantage\nof the peculiar conservation laws satisfied by this system: the dynamics can be\nrecast in such a way that the imposed mean flow appears as an initial source of\npotential vorticity levels in the upper layer. The initial baroclinic\ninstability leads to a turbulent flow that stirs this potential vorticity field\nwhile conserving the global distribution of potential vorticity levels.\nStatistical mechanical theory of the 1-1/2 layer quasi-geostrophic model\npredict the formation of two regions of homogenized potential vorticity\nseparated by a minimal interface. We show that the dynamics of the ribbons\nresults from a competition between a tendency to reach this equilibrium state,\nand baroclinic instability that induces meanders of the interface. These\nmeanders intermittently break and induce potential vorticity mixing, but the\ninterface remains sharp throughout the flow evolution.

It is well-known that dynamics of\natmospheric CO2 is governed by multiple time-constants, and here we approximate\nthe solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four\ntime-constants to identify factors governing the time-delay between peaks in\nCO2 emissions and concentrations, and therefore the timing of the concentration\npeak. The main factor affecting this time-delay is the ratio of the rate of\nchange of emissions during its increasing and decreasing phases. If this ratio\nis large in magnitude then the time-delay between peak emissions and\nconcentrations is large. Therefore it is important to limit the magnitude of\nthis ratio through mitigation, in order to achieve an early peak in CO2\nconcentrations. This can be achieved with an early global emissions peak,\ncombined with rapid decarbonization of economic activity, because the delay\nbetween peak emissions and concentrations is affected by the time-scale with\nwhich decarbonization occurs. Of course, for limiting the magnitude of peak\nconcentrations it is also important to limit the magnitude of emissions\nthroughout its trajectory, but that aspect has been studied elsewhere and is\nnot examined here. The carbon cycle parameters affecting the timing of the\nconcentration peak are primarily the long multi-century time-constant of\natmospheric CO2, and the ratio of contributions to the impulse response\nfunction of atmospheric CO2 from the infinite time-constant and the long\ntime-constant respectively. Reducing uncertainties in these parameters can\nreduce uncertainty in forecasts of the radiative forcing peak. \n\n"}

As a special case, the background spectrum can\nconsist of only a single mode.

The main prediction of this full statistical mechanics computation is\nthe energy partition between a large scale vortical flow and small scale\nfluctuations related to inertia-gravity waves. We introduce for that purpose a\ndiscretized model of the continuous shallow water system, and compute the\ncorresponding statistical equilibria. We argue that microcanonical equilibrium\nstates of the discretized model in the continuous limit are equilibrium states\nof the actual shallow water system. We show that the presence of small scale\nfluctuations selects a subclass of equilibria among the states that were\npreviously computed by phenomenological approaches that were neglecting such\nfluctuations. In the limit of weak height fluctuations, the equilibrium state\ncan be interpreted as two subsystems in thermal contact: one subsystem\ncorresponds to the large scale vortical flow, the other subsystem corresponds\nto small scale height and velocity fluctuations. It is shown that either a\nnon-zero circulation or rotation and bottom topography are required to sustain\na non-zero large scale flow at equilibrium.

Consequently, the\nhierarchy of cumulant equations is not closed. But because atmospheric flows\nare inhomogeneous and anisotropic, the nonlinearity may manifest itself only\nweakly through interactions of mean fields with disturbances such as thermals\nor eddies. In such situations, truncations of the hierarchy of cumulant\nequations hold promise as a closure strategy.\n  We review how truncations at second order can be used to model and elucidate\nthe dynamics of atmospheric flows. Two examples are considered. First, we study\nthe growth of a dry convective boundary layer, which is heated from below,\nleading to turbulent upward energy transport and growth of the boundary layer.\nWe demonstrate that a quasilinear truncation of the equations of motion, in\nwhich interactions of disturbances among each other are neglected but\ninteractions with mean fields are taken into account, can capture the growth of\nthe convective boundary layer even if it does not capture important turbulent\ntransport terms. Second, we study the evolution of two-dimensional large-scale\nwaves representing waves in Earth's upper atmosphere. We demonstrate that a\ncumulant expansion truncated at second order (CE2) can capture the evolution of\nsuch waves and their nonlinear interaction with the mean flow in some\ncircumstances, for example, when the wave amplitude is small enough or the\nplanetary rotation rate is large enough. However, CE2 fails to capture the flow\nevolution when nonlinear eddy--eddy interactions in surf zones become\nimportant. Higher-order closures can capture these missing interactions.\n  The results point to new ways in which the dynamics of turbulent boundary\nlayers may be represented in climate models, and they illustrate different\nclasses of nonlinear processes that can control wave dissipation and momentum\nfluxes in the troposphere. \n\n"}

Shear banding is associated with strain\nlocalization, i.e. the deformation of the sheared glassy solid is localized in\nspace in form of band-like structures. These structures are often precursors to\ncatastrophic failure, implying that a proper understanding of the underlying\nmechanisms could lead to the design of smarter materials. However, despite its\nimportance in material science, the microscopic origin of shear banding in\nglassy materials is only poorly understood.

Clearly,\nunexpected waves defined in this way are predictable in a statistical sense.\nThey can occur relatively often with a small or moderate crest height, but\nlarge unexpected waves that are rogue are rare. Here, this concept is\nelaborated and statistically described based on a third-order nonlinear model.\nIn particular, the conditional return period of an unexpected wave whose crest\nexceeds a given threshold is developed. This definition leads to greater return\nperiods or on average less frequent occurrences of unexpected waves than those\nimplied by the conventional return periods not conditioned on a reference\nthreshold. Ultimately, it appears that a rogue wave that is also unexpected\nwould have a lower occurrence frequency than that of a usual rogue wave.

Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)\noffer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,\nsince they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis\nwhich explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess\nwhether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine\nthe CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel\nbaroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\\Delta T$. An\norographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We\ndetect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the\nperiodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest\ngrowing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the\ncirculation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in\nthe finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is\nattributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high\ntemperature gradients, while for low values of \\Delta T, the effect is only due\nto stronger barotropic instability.

It follows that theoretical\nunderstanding of the dynamics of jets and planetary scale waves requires\nadopting the perspective of statistical state dynamics (SSD) which comprises\nthe dynamics of the interaction between coherent and incoherent components in\nthe turbulent state. In this work the S3T implementation of SSD for barotropic\nbeta-plane turbulence is used to develop a theory for the jet/wave coexistence\nregime by separating the coherent motions consisting of the zonal jets together\nwith a selection of large-scale waves from the smaller scale motions which\nconstitute the incoherent component.

The model is obtained via a severe\ntruncation of quasi-geostrophic equations for the two fluids, and includes a\nsimple yet physically meaningful representation of their\ndynamical/thermodynamical coupling. The model has 36 degrees of freedom, and\nthe parameters are chosen so that a chaotic behaviour is observed. One finds\ntwo positive Lyapunov exponents (LEs), sixteen negative LEs, and eighteen\nnear-zero LEs. The presence of many near-zero LEs results from the vast\ntime-scale separation between the characteristic time scales of the two fluids,\nand leads to nontrivial error growth properties in the tangent space spanned by\nthe corresponding CLVs, which are geometrically very degenerate. Such CLVs\ncorrespond to two different classes of ocean/atmosphere coupled modes. The\ntangent space spanned by the CLVs corresponding to the positive and negative\nLEs has, instead, a non-pathological behaviour, and one can construct robust\nlarge deviations laws for the finite time LEs, thus providing a universal model\nfor assessing predictability on long to ultra-long scales along such\ndirections.

Neither wave tanks nor experiments in\nopen bodies detect this without nearly canceling \"eulerian flows.\" Acoustic\nwaves have an analogous problem that is particularly problematic in the\nvorticity production at the edges of beams. Here we demonstrate that the\nexplanation for this arises from subtle end-of-packet and wavetrain gradient\neffects such as microbreaking events and wave-flow decomposition subtleties\nrequired to conserve mass and momentum and avoid fictitious external forces.\nThese losses occur at both ends of packets and can produce a significant\nnonviscous energy loss for translating and spreading surface wave packets and\nwavetrains. In contrast, monochromatic sound wave packets will be shown to\nasymmetrically distort to conserve momentum.

Under suitable conditions, simulations\nwith small-scale random forcing and large-scale drag exhibit a spontaneous\nformation of multiple zonal jets. The first hint of wave-like features is seen\nin the distribution of kinetic energy as a function of frequency; specifically,\nfor progressively larger deformation scales there are systematic departures in\nthe form of isolated peaks (at progressively higher frequencies) from a\npower-law scaling. Con- comitantly, there is an inverse flux of kinetic energy\nin frequency space which extends to lower frequencies for smaller deformation\nscales. The identification of these peaks as Rossby waves is made possible by\nexamining the energy spectrum in frequency-zonal wavenumber and\nfrequency-meridional wavenumber diagrams. In fact, the modified Rhines scale\nturns out to be a useful measure of the dominant meridional wavenumber of the\nmodulating Rossby waves; once this is fixed, apart from a spectral peak at the\norigin (the steady jet), almost all the energy is contained in westward\npropagating disturbances that follow the theoretical Rossby dispersion\nrelation.

Our findings indicate that even over such large\nareas a hurricane's rainfall cannot be accounted for by concurrent evaporation.\nWe propose instead that a hurricane consumes pre-existing atmospheric water\nvapor as it moves. The propagation velocity of the cyclone, i.e. the difference\nbetween its movement velocity and the mean velocity of the surrounding air\n(steering flow), determines the water vapor budget. Water vapor available to\nthe hurricane through its movement makes the hurricane self-sufficient at about\n700 km from the hurricane center obviating the need to concentrate moisture\nfrom greater distances.

Fixing the radiative damping and\nmomentum drag timescales to be of the order of a few days, a state of SR is\nshown to emerge under steady large-scale and random small-scale vorticity\nforcing. In the first example, the stationary response to a pair of equal and\noppositely signed vortices placed on the equator is considered. Here, the\nequatorial flux budget is dominated by the eddy fluxes and these drive the\nsystem into a state of SR. Eventually, the flux associated with the momentum\ndrag increases to balance the eddy fluxes, resulting in a steady state with a\nSR jet at the equator. The initial value problem with these twin vortices also\nexhibits SR driven by eddy fluxes. Curiously, this transient solution\nspontaneously propagates westward and continually circumnavigates the globe. It\nis worth emphasizing that this SR state does not rely on any particular form of\ndissipation at large scales, and is in fact observed even in the absence of any\nlarge-scale damping mechanism. In the second example, a random small-scale\nvorticity forcing is applied across the tropics. The statistically steady state\nobtained is fairly turbulent in nature, but here too, the eddy fluxes dominate,\nand the system exhibits SR.

The mechanism responsible for VSHF\nformation is not fully understood. In this work, the formation and\nequilibration of VSHFs in a 2D Boussinesq model of stratified turbulence is\nstudied using statistical state dynamics (SSD). In SSD, equations of motion are\nexpressed directly in the statistical variables of the turbulent state.\nRestriction to 2D turbulence makes available an analytically and\ncomputationally attractive implementation of SSD referred to as S3T, in which\nthe SSD is expressed by coupling the equation for the horizontal mean structure\nwith the equation for the ensemble mean perturbation covariance. This second\norder SSD produces accurate statistics, through second order, when compared\nwith fully nonlinear simulations. In particular, S3T captures the spontaneous\nemergence of the VSHF and associated density layers seen in simulations of\nturbulence maintained by homogeneous large-scale stochastic excitation.

The forcing is a uniform steady\nwind stress that produces both a uniform large-scale zonal flow $U(t)$ and\nsmaller-scale macroturbulence (both standing and transient eddies). The flow\n$U(t)$ is retarded by Ekman drag and by the domain-averaged topographic form\nstress produced by the eddies. The topographic form stress typically balances\nmost of the applied wind stress, while the Ekman drag provides all of the\nenergy dissipation required to balance the wind work. A collection of\nstatistically equilibrated solutions delineates the main flow regimes and the\ndependence of the time-mean $U$ on the problem parameters and the statistical\nproperties of the topography.\n  If $\\beta$ is smaller than the topographic PV gradient then the flow consists\nof stagnant pools attached to pockets of closed geostrophic contours. The\nstagnant dead zones are bordered by jets and the flow through the domain is\nconcentrated into a narrow channel of open geostrophic contours.\n  If $\\beta$ is comparable to, or larger than, the topographic PV gradient then\nall geostrophic contours are open and the flow is uniformly distributed\nthroughout the domain. In this case there is an \"eddy saturation\" regime in\nwhich $U$ is insensitive to changes in the wind stress. We show that eddy\nsaturation requires strong transient eddies that act as PV diffusion.

The QG\nmodel reproduces well the evolution of the composite potential vorticity (PV)\nfield obtained from JRA-55 by considering a time-dependent effective topography\ngiven by the composite height field of the 550 K potential temperature surface.\nThe zonal-wavenumber-2 component of the effective topography is the most\nessential feature required to observe the vortex splitting. The\nstatistical-mechanics theory predicts a large-scale steady state as the most\nprobable outcome of turbulent stirring, and such a state can be computed\nwithout solving the QG dynamics. The theory is applied to a disk domain, which\nis modeled on the north polar cap in the stratosphere. The equilibrium state is\nobtained by computing the maximum of an entropy functional. In the range of\nparameters relevant to the winter stratosphere, this state is anticyclonic. By\ncontrast, cyclonic states are quasi-stationary states corresponding to saddle\npoints of the entropy functional. The theoretical calculations are compared\nwith the results of the quasi-static experiment in which the wavenumber-2\ntopographic amplitude is increased linearly and slowly with time. The results\nsuggest that S-SSWs can be qualitatively interpreted as the transition from the\ncyclonic quasi-stationary state toward the anticyclonic equilibrium state. The\npolar vortex splits during the transition toward the equilibrium state. Without\nany forcing such as radiative cooling, the anticyclonic equilibrium state would\nbe realized sufficiently after an S-SSW. \n\n"}

Baroclinicity is\ncurrently believed to be key to the development of an eddy-saturated state. In\nthis paper, it is shown that eddy saturation can also occur in a purely\nbarotropic flow over topography, without baroclinicity. Thus, eddy saturation\nis a fundamental property of barotropic dynamics above topography. It is\ndemonstrated that the main factor controlling the appearance or not of\neddy-saturated states in the barotropic setting is the structure of geostrophic\ncontours, that is the contours of $f/H$ of the ratio of the Coriolis parameter\nto the ocean's depth. Eddy-saturated states occur when the geostrophic contours\nare open, that is when the geostrophic contours span the whole zonal extent of\nthe domain. This minimal requirement for eddy-saturated states is demonstrated\nusing numerical integrations of a single-layer quasi-geostrophic flow over two\ndifferent topographies characterized by either open or closed geostrophic\ncontours with parameter values loosely inspired by the Southern Ocean. In this\nsetting, transient eddies are produced through a barotropic-topographic\ninstability that occurs due tot the interaction of the large-scale zonal flow\nwith the topography.

This is particularly acute for\nsimulation models that are flexible in their use of multi-scale, anisotropic,\nfully unstructured meshes where a relatively large number of heterogeneous\nparameters are required to constrain their full description. As a consequence,\nit can be difficult to reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data\nhandling and initialisation, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons\nrigorously.

In this paper we study, using the finite gap\nmethod, the NLS Cauchy problem for periodic initial perturbations of the\nunstable background solution of NLS exciting just one of the unstable modes.

In agreement with recent theoretical findings of the authors, in the\nsituation in which the round-off errors are negligible with respect to the\nperturbations due to the discrete scheme used in the numerical experiments, the\nsplit-step Fourier method (SSFM), the numerical output is well-described by a\nsuitable genus 2 finite-gap solution of NLS. This solution can be written in\nterms of different elementary functions in different time regions and,\nultimately, it shows an exact recurrence of rogue waves described, at each\nappearance, by the Akhmediev breather. We discover a remarkable empirical\nformula connecting the recurrence time with the number of time steps used in\nthe SSFM and, via our recent theoretical findings, we establish that the SSFM\nopens up a vertical unstable gap whose length can be computed with high\naccuracy, and is proportional to the inverse of the square of the number of\ntime steps used in the SSFM.

Recently, a hydrodynamical description of\nOTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits, aspects of which are\nconjectured to be universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without\nrandomness. Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved\nquantities (e.g., energy).

The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling\nsheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is\nreversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative\nprocess. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a\npower law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of\nthe conserved components.

The energy of the gamma rays is sufficiently high to\npotentially invoke atmospheric photonuclear reactions 14N(gamma, n)13N, which\nwould produce neutrons and eventually positrons via beta-plus decay of\ngenerated unstable radioactive isotopes, especially 13N. However, no clear\nobservational evidence for the reaction has been reported to date. Here we\nreport the first detection of neutron and positron signals from lightning with\na ground observation. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a\nTGF-like intense flash (within 1 ms) was detected at our monitoring sites\n0.5-1.7 km away from the lightning. The subsequent initial burst quickly\nsubsided with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 ms, followed by a\nprolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolt (MeV), lasting for a\nminute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 MeV of the\ninitial emission are well explained with de-excitation gamma rays from the\nnuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line\nemission corresponds to the electron-positron annihilation, and hence is the\nconclusive indication of positrons produced after the lightning. Our detection\nof neutrons and positrons is unequivocal evidence that natural lightning\ntriggers photonuclear reactions. No other natural event on the Earth is known\nto trigger photonuclear reactions. This discovery places lightning as only the\nsecond known natural channel on the Earth after the atmospheric cosmic-ray\ninteraction, in which isotopes, such as 13C, 14C, and 15N, are produced. \n\n"}

In the absence of gravity, we show that the time evolution of the\nshape of the droplet-size distribution due to turbulence-induced collisions\ndepends strongly on the turbulent energy-dissipation rate, but only weakly on\nthe Reynolds number. This can be explained through the energy dissipation rate\ndependence of the mean collision rate described by the Saffman-Turner collision\nmodel. Consistent with the Saffman-Turner collision model and its extensions,\nthe collision rate increases as the square root of the energy dissipation rate\neven when coalescence is invoked. The size distribution exhibits power law\nbehavior with a slope of -3.7 between a maximum at approximately 10 um up to\nabout 40 um. When gravity is invoked, turbulence is found to dominate the time\nevolution of an initially monodisperse droplet distribution at early times. At\nlater times, however, gravity takes over and dominates the collisional growth.\nWe find that the formation of large droplets is very sensitive to the turbulent\nenergy dissipation rate. This is due to the fact that turbulence enhances the\ncollisional growth between similar sized droplets at the early stage of\nraindrop formation. The mean collision rate grows exponentially, which is\nconsistent with the theoretical prediction of the continuous collisional growth\neven when turbulence-generated collisions are invoked. This consistency only\nreflects the mean effect of turbulence on collisional growth. \n\n"}

Abstract: Geophysical turbulence is observed to self-organize into large-scale flows\nsuch as zonal jets and coherent vortices. Previous studies on barotropic\nbeta-plane turbulence have shown that coherent flows emerge out of a background\nof homogeneous turbulence as a bifurcation when the turbulence intensity\nincreases and the emergence of large scale flows has been attributed to a new\ntype of collective, symmetry breaking instability of the statistical state\ndynamics of the turbulent flow. In this work we extend the analysis to\nstratified flows and investigate turbulent self-organization in a two-layer\nfluid with no imposed mean north-south thermal gradient and turbulence\nsupported by an external random stirring. We use a second order closure of the\nstatistical state dynamics (S3T) with an appropriate averaging ansatz that\nallows the identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and their\nstructural stability. The bifurcation of the statistically homogeneous\nequilibrium state to inhomogeneous equilibrium states comprising of zonal jets\nand/or large scale waves when the energy input rate of the excitation passes a\ncritical threshold is analytically studied. The theory predicts that when the\nflow transitions to a statistical state with large-scale structures, these\nstates are barotropic if the scale of excitation is larger than the deformation\nradius. Mixed barotropic-baroclinic states with jets and/or waves arise when\nthe excitation is at scales shorter than the deformation radius with the\nbaroclinic component of the flow being subdominant for low energy input rates\nand non-significant for higher energy input rates. The results of the S3T\ntheory are compared to nonlinear simulations. The theory is found to accurately\npredict both the critical transition arameters and the scales of the emergent\nstructures but underestimates their amplitude. \n\n"}

Explaining the formation of jets in stratified turbulence is a\nfundamental problem in geophysical fluid dynamics. Statistical state dynamics\n(SSD) provides powerful methods for analyzing turbulent systems exhibiting\nemergent organization, such as banded jets. In SSD, dynamical equations are\nwritten directly for the evolution of the turbulence statistics, enabling\ndirect analysis of the statistical interactions between the incoherent\ncomponent of the turbulence and the coherent large-scale structure component\nthat underlie jet formation. A second-order closure of SSD, known as S3T, has\npreviously been applied to show that meridionally banded jets emerge in\nbarotropic beta-plane turbulence via a statistical instability referred to as\nthe zonostrophic instability. Two-dimensional Boussinesq turbulence provides a\nsimple model of non-rotating stratified turbulence analogous to the beta-plane\nmodel of planetary turbulence.

Abstract: Geoengineering can control only some climatic variables but not others,\nresulting in side-effects. We investigate in an intermediate-complexity climate\nmodel the applicability of linear response theory (LRT) to the assessment of a\ngeoengineering method. This application of LRT is twofold. First, our objective\n(O1) is to assess only the best possible geoengineering scenario by looking for\na suitable modulation of solar forcing that can cancel out or otherwise\nmodulate a climate change signal resulting from a rise in CO2 alone. Here we\nconsider only the cancellation of the expected global mean surface air\ntemperature. It is a straightforward inverse problem for this solar forcing,\nand, considering an infinite time period, we use LRT to provide the solution in\nthe frequency domain in closed form. We provide procedures suitable for\nnumerical implementation that apply to finite time periods too. Second, to be\nable to use LRT to quantify side-effects, the response with respect to\nuncontrolled observables, such as regional must be approximately linear. Our\nobjective (O2) here is to assess the linearity of the response. We find that\nunder geoengineering in the sense of (O1) the asymptotic response of the\nglobally averaged temperature is actually not zero. This is due to an\ninaccurate determination of the linear susceptibilities. The error is due to a\nsignificant quadratic nonlinearity of the response. This nonlinear contribution\ncan be easily removed, which results in much better estimates of the linear\nsusceptibility, and, in turn, in a fivefold reduction in the global average\nsurface temperature under geoengineering. This correction dramatically improves\nalso the agreement of the spatial patterns of the predicted and of the true\nresponse. However, such an agreement is not perfect and is worse in the case of\nthe precipitation patterns, as a result of greater degree of nonlinearity. \n\n"}

Using various tests, it is shown that the LRF and EFM can\naccurately predict the time-mean responses of temperature and eddy heat flux to\nexternal forcings, and that the LRF can well predict the forcing needed to\nchange the mean flow in a specified way (inverse problem). The non-normality of\nthe LRF is discussed and its eigen/singular vectors are compared with the\nleading Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes of the DNS data.\nFurthermore, it is shown that if the LRF and EFM are simply scaled by the\nsquare-root of Rayleigh number, they perform equally well for flows at other\n$\\mathrm{Ra}$, at least in the investigated range of $ 5 \\times 10^5 \\le\n\\mathrm{Ra} \\le 1.25 \\times 10^6$.

The concept of exergy is well defined in thermodynamics, and\nseveral generalizations to chemically reacting systems have already been made.\nSimilarly, the concept of moist available enthalpy is presented in this paper\nin order to generalize the dry available enthalpy to the case of a moist\natmosphere. It is a local exergy-like function which possesses a simple\nanalytical expression where only two unknown constants are to be determined, a\nreference temperature and a reference pressure.

The droplets are subject to turbulence as well\nas gravity, and their collision and coalescence efficiencies are taken to be\nunity. We solve the thermodynamic equations governing temperature, water-vapor\nmixing ratio, and the resulting supersaturation fields together with the\nNavier-Stokes equation. We find that the droplet-size distribution broadens\nwith increasing Reynolds number and/or mean energy dissipation rate. Turbulence\naffects the condensational growth directly through supersaturation\nfluctuations, and it influences collisional growth indirectly through\ncondensation. Our simulations show for the first time that, in the absence of\nthe mean updraft cooling, supersaturation fluctuation-induced broadening of\ndroplet-size distributions enhances the collisional growth. This is contrary to\nclassical (non-turbulent) condensational growth, which leads to a growing mean\ndroplet size, but a narrower droplet-size distribution. Our findings, instead,\nshow that condensational growth facilitates collisional growth by broadening\nthe size distribution in the tails at an early stage of rain formation.

Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of\nangular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating\nstably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modeled and its\nstrength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent\ntransport is anisotropic. Only phenomenological prescriptions have been\nproposed for the transport in the horizontal direction, which however\nconstitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar\nhydrodynamics in evolution codes. We derive a new theoretical prescription for\nthe anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral\nformalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification,\nrotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent\ntransport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of\nthe radial differential rotation is derived.

In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-IR brightness\nvariability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite initial understandings of\natmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous\nstudies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to\nseek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the\nthermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via large\nopacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this\nwork, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a\nself-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing,\ncloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show\nthat radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in\nboth temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and\ndirectly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are one to tens of\nhours with typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of Kelvins in\neffective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range\nof parameter space, but the detailed evolution of variability is sensitive to\nmodel parameters.

We first demonstrate that if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic\nprimitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial\natmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have\nno effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to\nsay, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation\nis unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is\nradiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will\ngenerally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the\ncondensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the\ngreenhouse effect.

To lowest order, agreement is found\nwith Eulerian-mean theories, and the present approximation provides an explicit\nextension of known wave-averaged equations to short-scale variations of the\nwave field, and vertically varying currents only limited to weak or localized\nprofile curvatures. Further, the underlying exact equations provide a natural\nframework for extensions to finite wave amplitudes and any realistic situation.\nThe accuracy of the approximations is discussed using comparisons with exact\nnumerical solutions for linear waves over arbitrary bottom slopes, for which\nthe equations are still exact when properly accounting for partial standing\nwaves. For finite amplitude waves it is found that the approximate solutions\nare probably accurate for ocean mixed layer modelling and shoaling waves,\nprovided that an adequate turbulent closure is designed. However, for surf zone\napplications the approximations are expected to give only qualitative results\ndue to the large influence of wave nonlinearity on the vertical profiles of\nwave forcing terms. \n\n"}

We find\nthat there is small probability that the number of cyclones has increased in\nthe past thirty years. The rate at which these storms become hurricanes appears\nto be constant. The rate at which hurricanes evolve into category 4 and higher\nmajor storms does appear to have increased. We also investigate storm intensity\nby measuring the distribution of individual storm lifetime in days, storm track\nlength, and Emanuel's power dissiptation index. We find little evidence that,\noverall, the mean of the distribution of individual storm intensity is changing\nthrough time, but the variability of the distribution has increased. The cold\ntongue index and the North Atlantic oscillation index were found to be strongly\nassociated with storm quality in the Western, and to a smaller extent, the\nEastern Pacific oceans. The North Atlantic oscillation index was strongly\nassociated with the increase in the rate of strong storms evolving. \n\n"}

We performed numerical simulation of an ensemble of nonlinearly\ninteracting free gravity waves (swell) by two different methods: solution of\nprimordial dynamical equations describing potential flow of the ideal fluid\nwith a free surface and, solution of the kinetic Hasselmann equation,\ndescribing the wave ensemble in the framework of the theory of weak turbulence.\n  In both cases we observed effects predicted by this theory: frequency\ndownshift, angular spreading and formation of Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum\n$I_{\\omega} \\sim \\omega^{-4}$. To achieve quantitative coincidence of the\nresults obtained by different methods, one has to supply the Hasselmann kinetic\nequation by an empirical dissipation term $S_{diss}$ modeling the coherent\neffects of white-capping. Using of the standard dissipation terms from\noperational wave predicting model ({\\it WAM}) leads to significant improvement\non short times, but not resolve the discrepancy completely, leaving the\nquestion about optimal choice of $S_{diss}$ open. In a long run {\\it WAM}\ndissipative terms overestimate dissipation essentially. \n\n"}

The\ncomputational cost of adding LANS-alpha is only 27% for our most efficient\nimplementation, as compared to a factor of 8-10 for a doubling of resolution.\n  The LANS-alpha model improves turbulence statistics with an additional\nnonlinear term and a smoothed advecting velocity. In this work we investigate\ndifferent kinds of smoothing techniques and their effect on the LANS-alpha\nmodel's results and efficiency. We show that we can substitute convolution\nfilters for full Hemlholtz inversions and produce similar results at a\nsignificantly lower expense.\n  When constructing filters for LANS-alpha in a primitive-equation ocean model\nthe filter weights must be chosen carefully, otherwise a pressure-velocity\ninstability will be excited. We show analytically that certain ranges of filter\nweights are unstable, and confirm this with numerical experiments. Our\nstability criterion also guarantees that the kinetic energy is well defined,\nand that the filtered velocity is smoother that the original velocity. \n\n"}

One\nside sees the obvious intense westerly wind events as the main cause for the\nexceptional heating in summer 1997, the other emphasizes slower oceanic\nprocesses. We present a quantitative analysis of all factors contributing to\nthe onset of this El Nino. At six months' lead time the initial state\ncontributes about 40% of the heating compared with an average year, and the\nwind about 50%. Compared with 1996, these contributions are 30% and 90%\nrespectively. As westerly wind events are difficult to predict, this limited\nthe predictability of the onset of this El Nino. \n\n"}

It is based on the idea that the\nsolar system until quite recently contained an additional massive object of\nplanetary size. This object, called Z, is assumed to have moved on a highly\neccentric orbit bound to the sun. It influenced Earth's climate through a gas\ncloud of evaporated material. Calculations show that more than once during the\nlast 3.2 Myr it even approached the Earth close enough to provoke a significant\nshift of the geographic position of the poles.
