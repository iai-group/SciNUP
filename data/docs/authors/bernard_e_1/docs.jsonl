Several statistical tools are implemented\nin our study: likelihood ratio with a global fit and with raster scans in the\nWIMP mass and goodness-of-fit (g.o.f.). These approaches allow us to\ndifferentiate between the preferred (global best fit) and allowed (g.o.f.)\nparameter regions.

For spin-independent (SI) interactions, the best fit\nDAMA regions are ruled out to the 3$\\sigma$ C.L., even with channeling taken\ninto account. However, for WIMP masses of ~8 GeV some parameters outside these\nregions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the DAMA data and are\ncompatible with all 90% C.L. upper limits from negative searches, when\nchanneling is included. For spin-dependent (SD) interactions with proton-only\ncouplings, a range of masses below 10 GeV is compatible with DAMA and other\nexperiments, with and without channeling, when SuperK indirect detection\nconstraints are included; without the SuperK constraints, masses as high as ~20\nGeV are compatible.

The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05.

We obtained new\noptical spectroscopy for a sample of variability selected candidates with the\nESO NTT telescope. We analysed the new spectra, together with those existing in\nthe literature and studied the distribution of the objects in U-B and B-V\ncolours, optical and X-ray luminosity, and variability amplitude. A large\nfraction (17/27) of the observed candidates are broad-line luminous AGNs,\nconfirming the efficiency of variability in detecting quasars.

Several objects resulted to be\nnarrow-emission line galaxies where variability indicates nuclear activity,\nwhile no emission lines were detected in others. Some of these galaxies have\nvariability and X-ray to optical ratio close to active galactic nuclei, while\nothers have much lower variability and X-ray to optical ratio. This result can\nbe explained by the dilution of the nuclear light due to the host galaxy. Our\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of supernova search programmes to detect\nlarge samples of low-luminosity AGNs. A sizable fraction of the AGN in our\nvariability sample had escaped X-ray detection (5/47) and/or colour selection\n(9/48).

We derived gravitational mass profiles of 22\nearly-type galaxies observed with XMM-Newton and Chandra. Sixteen galaxies show\nconstant or decreasing radial temperature profiles, and their X-ray\nluminosities are consistent with kinematical energy input from stellar mass\nloss. The temperature profiles of the other 6 galaxies increase with radius,\nand their X-ray luminosities are significantly higher. The integrated\nmass-to-light ratio of each galaxy is constant at that of stars within 0.5-1\nr_e, and increases with radius, where r_e is the effective radius of a galaxy.\nThe scatter of the central mass-to-light ratio of galaxies was less in K-band\nlight. At 3r_e, the integrated mass-to-light ratios of galaxies with flat or\ndecreasing temperature profiles are twice the value at 0.5r_e, where the\nstellar mass dominates, and at 6r_e, these increase to three times the value at\n0.5r_e.

Such a framework, where DM recoils against electrons bound\nin atoms, has been proposed as an explanation for the annually modulated\nscintillation signal in DAMA/LIBRA versus the absence of a signal for nuclear\nrecoils in experiments like CDMS or XENON10. However, even in such a\nleptophilic DM scenario there are loop induced DM-hadron interactions, where\nthe photons emitted from virtual leptons couple to the charge of a nucleus.\nUsing a general effective field theory approach we show that, if such an\ninteraction is induced at one or two-loop level, then DM-nucleus scattering\ndominates over DM-electron scattering. This is because the latter is suppressed\nby the bound state wave function. One obtains a situation similar to standard\nDM-nucleus scattering analyses with considerable tension between the results of\nDAMA and CDMS/XENON10. This conclusion does not apply in the case of\npseudoscalar or axial vector coupling between DM and leptons, where the loop\ndiagrams vanish. In this case the explanation of the DAMA signal in terms of\nDM-electron scattering is strongly disfavored by the spectral shape of the\nsignal.

The hardness-intensity diagram of all RXTE/PCA data\ncombined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.\nThe evolution through the HID suggests that in the early phase of the outburst\nthe source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the soft\nstate, which is supported by our timing analysis. Broadband (4-200 keV)\nspectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard\nspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft\nstate. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during\nthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the\nsoftening in the hard intermediate state.

We\nderive an overall mass-to-light ratio of M_433/L=103^{+83}_{-48} M_sun/L_sun.\nOur mass estimate calls into question recent claims of a common mass scale for\ndSph galaxies.\n  Additionally, we find tentative evidence for a velocity gradient in our\nkinematic data of 16 +/- 3 km/s/kpc, and evidence of an asymmetric extension in\nthe light distribution at about 0.5 kpc.

This is the first in-depth analysis of the X-ray\nspectral characteristics of this source. We found that the flux of 1ES 1210-646\nvaries by a factor of about 3 on a timescale of hundreds of seconds and by a\nfactor of at least 10 among observations acquired over a time span of several\nmonths. The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron. Although the X-ray spectral description we find for the 1ES\n1210-646 emission is quite atypical for a high-mass X-ray binary, the\nmultiwavelegth information available for this object leads us to confirm this\nclassification. The results presented here allow us instead to definitely rule\nout the possibility that 1ES 1210-646 is a (magnetic) cataclysmic variable as\nproposed previously and, in a broader sense, a white dwarf nature for the\naccretor is disfavoured. X-ray spectroscopic data actually suggest a neutron\nstar with a low magnetic field as the accreting object in this system. \n\n"}

For these galaxies, we have complete (18/18) VLA\nradio and Chandra X-ray coverage. Nuclear radio emission is detected from 17/18\nof the galaxies. Ten of the galaxies exhibit extended radio emission; of these\nten, all but one also exhibit clear evidence of interaction of the radio source\nwith the surrounding, X-ray emitting gas. Among the seven galaxies with\nunresolved radio sources, one has clear, and one has small, cavity-like\nfeatures in the Chandra X-ray images; a third has a disturbed X-ray morphology.\nUsing a radio luminosity limit equivalent to L_(1.4 Ghz) > 10^(23) W/Hz to\ncalculate the radio-loud fraction, we find that this misses the majority of the\nradio detected galaxies in the sample. We determine integrated radio-to-X-ray\nflux ratios for the galaxies, GRx, which are shown to span a large range\n(factor of 100).

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that\nis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest\nhalo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter\npotential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that\n$f_{\\rm BNC}$ increases from $\\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1}\n{\\rm M_{\\odot}} \\leq M \\lsim 2 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) to $\\sim\n0.4$ in massive haloes ($M \\gsim 5 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$).

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal.

We argue that previous\nattempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universal\nadoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies.\nUnless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar medium\nduring supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulge\ndominated S0/Sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3.

In particular, we focus our attention\non the influence of interactions between galaxies on the star formation\nstrength in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.1$. With cylinder counts and\nprojected distance to the first and fifth-nearest neighbor as environment\ntracers, we find that LSBGs tend to have a lack of companions compared to HSBGs\nat small scales ($<2$ Mpc). Regarding the interactions, we have evidence that\nthe fraction of LSBGs with strong star formation activity increases when the\ndistance between pairs of galaxies ($r_{p}$) is smaller than about four times\nthe Petrosian radius ($r_{90}$) of one of the components. Our results suggest\nthat, rather than being a condition for their formation, the isolation of LSBGs\nis more connected with their survival and evolution. The effect of the\ninteraction on the star formation strength, measured by the average value of\nthe birthrate parameter $b$, seems to be stronger for HSBGs than for LSBGs.

The results are generally consistent with the known\ndichotomy of elliptical galaxy types, but some galaxies show more complex\nrotation profiles in their halos and there is a higher incidence of\nmisalignments, indicating triaxiality. Dynamical models have shown a range of\nslopes for the total mass profiles, and that the inner dark matter densities in\nellipticals are higher than in spiral galaxies, indicating earlier assembly\nredshifts. Analysis of the hot X-ray emitting gas in X-ray bright ellipticals\nand comparison with dynamical mass determinations indicates that non-thermal\ncomponents to the pressure may be important in the inner ~10 kpc, and that the\nproperties of these systems are closely related to their group environments.\nFirst results on the outer halo stellar population properties do not yet give a\nclear picture.

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed. Both\nkinematic studies and completeness-correction studies seem to point to a\ncharacteristic potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close\nto the mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy\nformation. Among the more pressing problems associated with this interpretation\nis to understand the selection biases that limit our ability to detect the\nlowest mass galaxies. The least massive satellite halos are likely to host\nstealth galaxies with very-low surface brightness and this may be an important\nlimitation in the hunt for low-mass fossils from the epoch of reionization. \n\n"}

These originate from tensor fluctuations\nof the metric produced during the inflationary phase. Their detection would\ntherefore constitute a major step towards understanding the primordial\nUniverse. The expected level of these anisotropies is however so small that it\nrequires a new generation of instruments with high sensitivity and extremely\ngood control of systematic effects. We propose the QUBIC instrument based on\nthe novel concept of bolometric interferometry, bringing together the\nsensitivity advantages of bolometric detectors with the systematics effects\nadvantages of interferometry. Methods: The instrument will directly observe the\nsky through an array of entry horns whose signals will be combined together\nusing an optical combiner. The whole set-up is located inside a cryostat.\nPolarization modulation will be achieved using a rotating half-wave plate and\ninterference fringes will be imaged on two focal planes (separated by a\npolarizing grid) tiled with bolometers. We show that QUBIC can be considered as\na synthetic imager, exactly similar to a usual imager but with a synthesized\nbeam formed by the array of entry horns. Scanning the sky provides an\nadditional modulation of the signal and improve the sky coverage shape. The\nusual techniques of map-making and power spectrum estimation can then be\napplied. We show that the sensitivity of such an instrument is comparable with\nthat of an imager with the same number of horns. We anticipate a low level of\nbeam-related systematics thanks to the fact that the synthesized beam is\ndetermined by the location of the primary horns. Other systematics should be\nunder good control thanks to an autocalibration technique, specific to our\nconcept, that will permit the accurate determination of most of the systematics\nparameters. \n\n"}

With binary population synthesis modelling at solar and one\nfifth of solar metallicity, we predict the velocities of such runaway stars or\nbinaries. We compile predictions for runaway OB stars, red supergiants and\nWolf-Rayet stars. For those stars or binaries which undergo a second stellar\nexplosion we compute their further evolution and the distance travelled until a\nType II or Type Ibc SN or a long or short gamma-ray burst occurs. We find our\npredicted population of OB runaway stars broadly matches the observed\npopulation of stars but, to match the fastest observed WR runaway stars, we\nrequire that black holes receive an asymmetric kick upon formation. We find\nthat at solar metallicity Type Ic SN progenitors travel shorter distances than\nthe progenitors of other SN types because they are typically more massive and\nthus have shorter lifetimes. Those of Type IIP SN can fly farthest about 48 pc\non average at solar metallicity. In considering the consequences of assuming\nthat the progenitors of long GRBs are spun-up secondary stars that experience\nquasi-homogeneous evolution, we find that such evolution has a dramatic effect\non the population of runaway WR stars and that some 30 per cent of GRBs could\noccur a hundred parsecs or more from their initial positions. We also consider\nmergers of double compact object binaries consisting of neutron stars and/or\nblack holes.

In our recent\nwork, we identified a structural transition in molecular clouds by studying the\nprobability distributions of gas column densities in them. In this paper, we\nfurther examine the nature of this transition. The transition takes place at\nthe visual extinction of A_V^tail = 2-4 mag, or equivalently, at \\Sigma^tail =\n40-80 Ms pc^{-2}. The clumps identified above this limit have wide ranges of\nmasses and sizes, but a remarkably constant mean volume density of n = 10^3\ncm^{-3}. This is 5-10 times larger than the density of the medium surrounding\nthe clumps. By examining the stability of the clumps, we show that they are\ngravitationally unbound entities, and that the external pressure from the\nparental molecular cloud is a significant source of confining pressure for\nthem. Then, the structural transition at A_V^tail may be linked to a transition\nbetween this population and the surrounding medium. The star formation rates in\nthe clouds correlate strongly with the total mass in the clumps, i.e, with the\nmass above A_V^tail, dropping abruptly below that threshold.

The new theory is valid for all scales\nsince metric gradients do not occur in the final evolution equations. The new\ntheory has an exact non-relativistic limit with a time-independent Newtonian\npotential. The usual Newtonian perturbation theory is inadequate to study the\nevolution of density perturbations.

Among the observed transitions at least two ratios of\nionization stages from the same element are required, e.g. CIII/CIV and\nSiIII/SiIV. For each system photoionization models are constructed varying the\nspectrum of the ionizing radiation. The spectral energy distribution can then\nbe constrained by comparing the models with the observed column density ratios.\nExtensive tests with artificial absorbers show that the spectrum of the\nionizing radiation cannot be reconstructed unambiguously, but it is possible to\nconstrain the main characteristics of the spectrum. Furthermore, the resulting\nphysical parameters of the absorber, such as ionization parameter, metallicity,\nand relative abundances, may depend strongly on the adopted ionizing spectrum.\nEven in case of well-fitting models the uncertainties can be as high as ~0.5\ndex for the ionization parameter and up to ~1.5 dex for the metallicity.\nTherefore, it is essential to know the hardness of the UV background when\nestimating the metallicity of the intergalactic medium.

The main\ngoal of our analysis is to test whether or not the observed companion mass\nratio distribution (CMRD) as a function of primary star mass and star formation\nenvironment is consistent with having been drawn from the field star IMF. We\nconsider samples of companions for M dwarfs, solar type and intermediate mass\nstars, both in the field as well as clusters or associations, and compare them\nwith populations of binaries generated by random pairing from the assumed IMF\nfor a fixed primary mass. With regard to the field we can reject the hypothesis\nthat the CMRD was drawn from the IMF for different primary mass ranges: the\nobserved CMRDs show a larger number of equal-mass systems than predicted by the\nIMF. This is in agreement with fragmentation theories of binary formation. For\nthe open clusters {\\alpha} Persei and the Pleiades we also reject the IMF\nrandom- pairing hypothesis.

With an exponentially declining\nstar-formation history over a range of time-scales, we rule out recent\nstar-formation over a wide range of ages.

Few modern digital spectra for these\nobjects have been published, from which intermediate resolution spectral\nindices and classifications could be derived. For published S stars we find\naccurate positions using the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and use the\nFAST spectrograph of the Tillinghast reflector on Mt.

We convolve all our spectra with the\nSDSS bandpasses, and employ the resulting gri magnitudes together with 2MASS\nJHK mags to investigate S star colors. S stars have colors similar to carbon\nand M stars, and are therefore difficult to distinguish by color alone.

A large-scale field reversal may exist in\nthe Milky Way but no such reversals have been observed so far in external\ngalaxies. The effects of star-forming regions of galaxies need to be included\nwhen modelling the evolution of their magnetic fields, which can then be\ncompared to future radio polarization observations. The causes of large-scale\nfield reversals also need clarification. Our model of field evolution in\nisolated disc galaxies includes a standard mean-field dynamo and continuous\ninjection of turbulent fields (the effect of supernova explosions) in discrete\nstar forming regions by implicit small-scale dynamo action. Synthetic maps of\nradio synchrotronemission and Faraday rotation measures are computed. A\nlarge-scale dynamo is essential to obtain regular large-scale spiral magnetic\nfields, observed in many galaxies. These appear, on kpc scales in near energy\nequilibrium with the turbulence, after 1-2 Gyr (redshift 4-3). Turbulent field\ninjection generates small-scale field structures. Depending on model\nparameters, large-scale field reversals may persist over many Gyrs and can\nsurvive until the present epoch. Significant polarized radio synchrotron\nemission from young galaxies is expected at redshifts less than 4. Faraday\nrotation measures (RM) are crucial to detect field reversals. Large-scale\npatterns ofrotation measures can be observed at redshifts less than 3.

For a slightly different\nchoice of parameters, large-scale field reversals can persist over the lifetime\nof a galaxy.

The\n`low-alpha' ones have r_{max}'s to 30-40 kpc, z_{max}'s to approx. 18 kpc, and\ne_{max}'s clumped at values greater than 0.85, while the `high-alpha' ones,\nr_{max}'s to about 16 kpc, z_{max}'s to 6-8 kpc, and e_{max} more or less\nuniformly distributed over 0.4-1.0. A dual in situ-plus-accretion formation\nscenario best explains the existence and characteristics of these two halo\npopulations, but one remaining defect is that this model is not consistent\nregarding the r_{max}'s obtained for the in situ `high-alpha' component; the\npredicted values are too small. It appears that omega Cen may have contributed\nin a significant way to the existence of the `low-alpha' component; recent\nmodels, including dynamical friction and tidal stripping, have produced orbital\nparameters as great as those of the `low-alpha' component. \n\n"}

Whilst it has been established that GRBs are related to the death\nthroes of massive stars, the identification of their progenitors has proved\nchallenging. Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass\nloss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we\ntake recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the\nsix line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae. The statistics imply\nthat the null hypothesis of no correlation between line-effect WR stars and\nejecta nebulae can be rejected at the 0.0004% level. Given that four\nline-effect and WR ejecta nebula have spectroscopically been confirmed to\ncontain nucleosynthetic products, we argue that the correlation is both\nstatistically significant and physically convincing.

A large number of binary lenses have already been found through\nmicrolensing surveys and a few of these systems show strong evidence of orbital\nmotion on the timescale of the lensing event. We expect that more binary lenses\nof this kind will be detected in the future. For binaries whose orbital period\nis comparable to the event duration, the orbital motion can cause the lensing\nsignal to deviate drastically from that of a static binary lens. The most\nstriking property of such light curves is the presence of quasi- periodic\nfeatures, which are produced as the source traverses the same regions in the\nrotating lens plane. These repeating features contain information about the\norbital period of the lens. If this period can be extracted, then much can be\nlearned about the lensing system even without performing time-consuming,\ndetailed light curve modeling.

There is still no\nnon-gravitational evidence for any of these dark sectors; nor for the required\nextensions of the standard model. An alternative is to imagine that GR itself\nmust be modified. Certain coincidences of scale even suggest that one might\nexpect not to have to make three independent. Because they must address the\nmost different types of data, attempts to replace dark matter with modified\ngravity are the most controversial. A phenomenological model (or family of\nmodels), Modified Newtonian Dynamics, has, over the last few years seen several\ncovariant realizations. We discuss a number of challenges that any model that\nseeks to replace dark matter with modified gravity must face: the loss of\nBirkhoff's Theorem, and the calculational simplifications it implies; the\nfailure to explain clusters, whether static or interacting, and the consequent\nneed to introduce dark matter of some form, whether hot dark matter neutrinos,\nor dark fields that arise in new sectors of the modified gravity theory; the\nintrusion of cosmological expansion into the modified force law, that arises\nprecisely because of the coincidence in scale between the centripetal\nacceleration at which Newtonian gravity fails in galaxies, and the cosmic\nacceleration.

The disk is proposed to\nhave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its\nenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal\ndebris forming a disk.

By comparing synthetic line profiles\nwith HST/STIS spectra obtained near apastron, we show that the WWC cavity has a\nstrong influence on multi-wavelength diagnostics. This influence is regulated\nby the modification of the optical depth in the continuum and spectral lines.\nWe find that H-alpha, H-beta, and Fe II lines are the most affected by the WWC\ncavity, since they form over a large volume of the primary wind. These spectral\nlines depend on latitude and azimuth since, according to the orientation of the\ncavity, different velocity regions of a spectral line are affected. For 2D\nmodels with orientation corresponding to orbital inclination angle 110deg < i <\n140deg and longitude of periastron 210deg < omega < 330deg, the blueshifted and\nzero-velocity regions of the line profiles are the most affected. These orbital\norientations are required to simultaneously fit the UV and optical spectrum of\nEta Car, for a half-opening angle of the cavity in the range 50-70deg. We find\nthat the excess P-Cygni absorption seen in H-alpha, H-beta and optical Fe II\nlines in spherical models becomes much weaker or absent in the 2D models, in\nagreement with the observations. The observed UV spectrum of Eta Car, dominated\nby Fe II absorption lines, is superbly reproduced by our 2D cavity models.\nSmall discrepancies still remain, as H-gamma and H-delta absorptions are\noverestimated by our models. We suggest that photoionization of the wind of the\nprimary by the hot companion star is responsible for the weak absorption seen\nin these lines.

We\nshow in a general manner that, if the motions are strictly non helical, then\nsuch mean field dynamo action is not possible.

These simulations resolve high density regions, comparable to giant\nmolecular clouds, where stars form. This resolution allows us to adopt a\nprescription for H_2 formation and destruction that ties star formation to the\npresence of shielded, molecular gas. Before infall, supernova feedback from the\nclumpy, bursty star formation captured by this physically motivated model leads\nto reduced dark matter (DM) densities and shallower inner density profiles in\nthe massive satellite progenitors (Mvir > 10^9 Msun, Mstar > 10^7 Msun)\ncompared to DM-only simulations. The progenitors of the lower mass satellites\nare unable to maintain bursty star formation histories, due to both heating at\nreionization and gas loss from initial star forming events, preserving the\nsteep inner density profile predicted by DM-only simulations. After infall,\ntidal stripping acts to further reduce the central densities of the luminous\nsatellites, particularly those that enter with cored dark matter halos,\nincreasing the discrepancy in the central masses predicted by baryon+DM and\nDM-only simulations.

In particular, we replace our previously\nemployed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell 8-wave scheme, which turns\nout to be significantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We\nverify the improved accuracy through simulations of the MRI in accretion disks,\nthat reproduce its correct linear growth rate. Using this new MHD code, we\nsimulate the formation of isolated disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way using\nidealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields. We find that the\nmagnetic field is quickly amplified in the initial starburst and the\ndifferential rotation of the forming disk until it eventually saturates when it\nbecomes comparable to the thermal pressure.

Using the recent\nresults on the X-ray efficiency dependence on pulsar characteristic age, we\nthen compute the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of rotation-powered pulsars.\nIn a general case it has a broken power-law shape with a high luminosity\ncutoff, which depends on the distributions of the birth spin period and the\nmagnetic field.\n  Using the observed XLF of sources in the nearby galaxies and the condition\nthat the pulsar XLF does not exceed that, we find the allowed region for the\nparameters describing the birth period distribution.

Warm\ninflation provides a natural arena to address this issue, with interactions\nbetween the scalar inflaton and other degrees of freedom leading to dissipative\nentropy production and associated thermal fluctuations.

The 1st of these encompasses the main sequence\n(MS) of SFGs, the 2nd one a rarer population of starbursts (SB). We show that\nthe sSFR-distribution of SBs can be regarded as the result of a physical\nprocess (plausibly merging) taking the mathematical form of a log-normal\nboosting kernel and enhancing star formation activity. We explore the utility\nof splitting the star-forming population into MS and SB galaxies - an approach\nwe term \"2-Star Formation Mode\" (2-SFM) framework - for understanding their\nmolecular gas properties. Variations of star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas\nfractions among SFGs take a simple, redshift-independent form, once these\nquantities are normalized to the value of an average MS galaxy. The change in\nSFE for galaxies undergoing a starburst event scales supra-linearly with the\nSFR-increase, as expected for mergers. This implies a continuous distribution\nof galaxies in the Schmidt-Kennicutt plane that separates more clearly into\nloci for SBs and normal galaxies than observed in SFR vs. M* space. SBs with\nthe largest deviations (>10-fold) from the MS, like many local ULIRGs, are not\naverage SBs, but even rarer events with progenitors having larger gas fractions\nthan typical MS galaxies. We statistically infer that the gas fractions of\ntypical SBs decrease by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to their direct MS\nprogenitors, as expected to occur in short-term SFR-boosts during which\ninternal gas reservoirs are drained more quickly than gas is accreted from the\ncosmic web. We predict variations of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in the\nSFR-M* plane and provide evidence that the higher sSFR of distant galaxies is a\ndirect consequence of larger gas fraction in these systems. \n\n"}

Recently, liquid-xenon scintillation light has been observed from\nelectronic recoils down to 2.1 keV, but without applied electric fields that\nare used in most xenon dark matter searches.

We here present a new 70 ks, plus an\narchived 18 ks, Chandra ACIS observation of the SNR CTB 87 (G74.9+1.2),\nclassified as a PWN with unusual radio properties and poorly studied in X-rays.\nWe find that the peak of the X-ray emission is clearly offset from the peak of\nthe radio emission by ~100\" and located at the southeastern edge of the radio\nnebula.

Observations of polarized radio emission show that large-scale\n(regular) magnetic fields in spiral galaxies are not axisymmetric, but\ngenerally stronger in interarm regions. In some nearby galaxies such as NGC\n6946 they are organized in narrow magnetic arms situated between the material\nspiral arms. Aims. The phenomenon of magnetic arms and their relation to the\noptical spiral arms (the material arms) call for an explanation in the\nframework of galactic dynamo theory. Several possibilities have been suggested\nbut are not completely satisfactory; here we attempt a consistent\ninvestigation. Methods. We use a 2D mean-field dynamo model in the no-z\napproximation and add injections of small-scale magnetic field, taken to result\nfrom supernova explosions, to represent the effects of dynamo action on smaller\nscales. This injection of small scale field is situated along the spiral arms,\nwhere star-formation mostly occurs. Results. A straightforward explanation of\nmagnetic arms as a result of modulation of the dynamo mechanism by material\narms struggles to produce pronounced magnetic arms, at least with realistic\nparameters, without introducing new effects such as a time lag between Coriolis\nforce and {\\alpha}-effect. In contrast, by taking into account explicitly the\nsmall-scale magnetic field that is injected into the arms by the action of the\nstar forming regions that are concentrated there, we can obtain dynamo models\nwith magnetic structures of various forms that can be compared with magnetic\narms.

To test for possible hidden errors, we\ncarried out additional observations of a sample of molecular cores in\n2010-2013. As a result, a systematic error in the radial velocities of an\namplitude ~0.02 km/s was revealed.

The recently discovered Galactic halo star\nSDSS J102915+172927 has a stellar mass of 0.8 Msun and a metallicity of\nZ=4.5x10^-5 Zsun and represents an optimal candidate for the dust-induced\nlow-mass star formation. Indeed, for the two most plausible Population III\nsupernova progenitors, with 20 Msun and 35 Msun, the critical dust-to-gas mass\nratio can be overcome provided that at least 0.4 Msun of dust condenses in the\nejecta, allowing for moderate destruction by the reverse shock. Here we show\nthat even if dust formation in the first supernovae is less efficient or strong\ndust destruction does occur, grain growth during the collapse of the parent gas\ncloud is sufficiently rapid to activate dust cooling and likely fragmentation\ninto low-mass and long-lived stars. Silicates and magnetite grains can\nexperience significant grain growth in the density range 10^9 /cc < nH<10^12\n/cc by accreting gas-phase species (SiO, SiO2, and Fe) until their gas-phase\nabundance drops to zero, reaching condensation efficiencies =1. The\ncorresponding increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio allows dust-induced\ncooling and fragmentation to be activated at 10^12 /cc < nH < 10^14 /cc, before\nthe collapsing cloud becomes optically thick to continuum radiation.

In low mass galaxies, the\naverage duration of the burst is comparable to the dynamical time of the\ngalaxy. Galaxy structure is correlated with estimated burst mass fraction, but\nin different ways in low and in high mass galaxies. High mass galaxies with\nlarge burst mass fractions are more centrally concentrated, indicating that\nbulge formation is at work. In low mass galaxies, stellar surface mass\ndensities decrease as a function of F_{burst}. These results are in good\nagreement with the observational predictions of Teyssier et al (2013) and lend\nfurther credence to the idea that the cuspy halo problem can be solved by\nenergy input from multiple starbursts over the lifetime of the galaxy. We note\nthat there is no compelling evidence for IMF variations in the population of\nstar-forming galaxies in the local Universe. \n\n"}

We determine the stability level of each disk\nprobabilistically using a Bayesian analysis of our data and a simple dynamical\nmodel.

Averaging\nover this subsample, we find a meridional shape of sigma_z/sigma_R =\n0.51^{+0.36}_{-0.25} for the SVE and, at 1.5 disk scale lengths, a stability\nparameter of Q_RW = 2.0 +/- 0.9.

We\ninvestigate a merger-feature time useful for understanding the morphological\ntransformation of galaxy mergers via numerical simulations.

This work uses SDSS, GALEX, and WISE\nobservations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fully\nquenched post-starbursts in the narrow mass range $\\log M(M_\\odot) =\n10.3-10.7$, and identifies \"transiting\" post-starbursts which are intermediate\nbetween these two populations. In this mass range, $\\sim 0.3\\%$ of galaxies are\nstarbursts, $\\sim 0.1\\%$ are quenched post-starbursts, and $\\sim 0.5\\%$ are the\ntransiting types in between. The transiting post-starbursts have stellar\nproperties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphological\ncharacteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. The AGN\nfraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts is\nabout 3 times higher ($\\gtrsim 36 \\pm 8 \\%$) than that of normal star-forming\ngalaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between the\nstarburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical AGN activity (median age\ndifference of $\\gtrsim 200 \\pm 100$ Myr), in agreement with previous studies.\nThe time delay is inferred by comparing the broad-band near NUV-to-optical\nphotometry with stellar population synthesis models. We also find that\nstarbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust-obscured than normal\nstar-forming galaxies in the same mass range. About $20\\%$ of the starbursts\nand $15\\%$ of the transiting post-starbursts can be classified as the\n\"Dust-Obscured Galaxies\" (DOGs), while only $0.8\\%$ of normal galaxies are\nDOGs.The time delay between the starburst phase and AGN activity suggests that\nAGN do not play a primary role in the original quenching of starbursts but may\nbe responsible for quenching later low-level star formation during the\npost-starburst phase. \n\n"}

New\nrelationships between line and AGN bolometric luminosity have been derived and\nthose between line and IR luminosities of the starburst component have been\nupdated.

We show that both\napproaches agree well with each other, and both show that the dominant\ntemperature contribution of the postulated void is an unobservable dipole\nanisotropy.

Eight radio source\nsamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with\n0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and\nradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes.

In contrast, the space density of jet-mode\nradio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <\n1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities.

The keys to reproduce this result are a low initial\nwater ice abundance after the pre-collapse phase together with the fact that\natomic oxygen cannot freeze-out and form water ice in regions with T(dust)>15\nK. This requires short prestellar core lifetimes of less than about 0.1Myr. The\nwater vapour profile is shaped through the interplay of FUV photodesorption,\nphotodissociation, and freeze-out. The water vapour line profiles are an\ninvaluable tracer for the FUV photon flux and envelope kinematics.\n  Conclusions: The finding that only a fraction of the oxygen budget is locked\nin water ice can be explained either by a short pre-collapse time of less than\n0.1 Myr at densities of n(H)~1e4 cm-3, or by some other process that resets the\ninitial water ice abundance for the post-collapse phase.

In order to explain their sparse structure, it\nhas been suggested that they formed as star clusters in dwarf galaxy satellites\nthat later accreted onto the Milky Way. If these clusters form in the centre of\ndwarf galaxies, they evolve in a tidally-compressive environment where the\ncontribution of the tides to the virial balance can become significant, and\nlead to a super-virial state and subsequent expansion of the cluster, once\nremoved.

The resulting redshift uncertainties inhibit\nthe efficient search for [C II] in z~7 galaxies with sub-mm instruments such as\nALMA, given their limited scan speed for faint lines. One means by which to\nimprove the precision of the inferred redshifts is to exploit the potential\nimpact of strong nebular emission lines on the colors of z~4-8 galaxies as\nobserved by Spitzer/IRAC. At z~6.8, galaxies exhibit IRAC colors as blue as\n[3.6]-[4.5] ~-1, likely due to the contribution of [O III]+Hb to the 3.6 mum\nflux combined with the absence of line contamination in the 4.5 mum band. In\nthis paper we explore the use of extremely blue [3.6]-[4.5] colors to identify\ngalaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-6.9.

The principal results are as follows.\nBoth D and f_H2 can rapidly increase during the early dissipative formation of\ngalactic disks (z ~ 2-3) and the z-evolution of these depends on initial mass\ndensities, spin parameters, and masses of galaxies.

The results show that galaxy-wide spatially averaged stellar\npopulation properties (stellar mass, mass surface density, age, metallicity,\nand extinction) match those obtained from the integrated spectrum, and that\nthese spatially averaged properties match those at $R = 1$ HLR (half light\nradius), proving that the effective radii are really effective.\n  Further, the individual radial profiles of the stellar mass surface density\n($\\mu_\\star$), luminosity weighted ages ($< {\\rm log}\\,age>_L$), and mass\nweighted metallicity ($< \\log Z_\\star >_M$) are stacked in bins of galaxy\nmorphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc and Sd). All these properties show negative\ngradients as a sign of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies. However, the\ngradients depend on the Hubble type in different ways.

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), among the best candidates\nfor dark matter, can be their own antimatter and can annihilate inside the\nstar, thereby providing a heat source. Although dark matter constitutes only\n$\\lesssim 0.1\\%$ of the stellar mass, this amount is sufficient to power the\nstar for millions to billions of years. Thus, the first phase of stellar\nevolution in the history of the Universe may have been dark stars. We review\nhow dark stars come into existence, how they grow as long as dark matter fuel\npersists, and their stellar structure and evolution. The studies were done in\ntwo different ways, first assuming polytropic interiors and more recently using\nthe MESA stellar evolution code; the basic results are the same. Dark stars are\ngiant, puffy ($\\sim$ 10 AU) and cool (surface temperatures $\\sim$10,000 K)\nobjects. We follow the evolution of dark stars from their inception at $\\sim 1\nM_\\odot$ as they accrete mass from their surroundings to become supermassive\nstars, some even reaching masses $> 10^6 M_\\odot$ and luminosities $>10^{10}\nL_\\odot$, making them detectable with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\nOnce the dark matter runs out and the dark star dies, it may collapse to a\nblack hole; thus dark stars may provide seeds for the supermassive black holes\nobserved throughout the Universe and at early times. Other sites for dark star\nformation may exist in the Universe today in regions of high dark matter\ndensity such as the centers of galaxies.

In this paper we\npresent further observations of this region (194 hours in total over ~250\ndeg^2), both in intensity and in polarization. They span four frequency\nchannels between 10 and 20 GHz, and were gathered with QUIJOTE, a new CMB\nexperiment with the goal of measuring the polarization of the CMB and Galactic\nforegrounds. When combined with other publicly-available intensity data, we\nachieve the most precise spectrum of the AME measured to date, with 13\nindependent data points being dominated by this emission. The four QUIJOTE data\npoints provide the first independent confirmation of the downturn of the AME\nspectrum at low frequencies, initially unveiled by the COSMOSOMAS experiment in\nthis region. We accomplish an accurate fit of these data using models based on\nelectric dipole emission from spinning dust grains, and also fit some of the\nparameters on which these models depend.\n  We also present polarization maps with an angular resolution of ~1 deg and a\nsensitivity of ~25 muK/beam.

These constraints are compatible with\ntheoretical predictions of the polarization fraction from electric dipole\nemission originating from spinning dust grains.

We found that at\n134--166 MHz, within the central 4$^\\circ$ of the field the $(Q,U)\\rightarrow\nI$ leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at $k<0.3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The\nleakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of\nthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to\nvary between 0.2-0.3\\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal of\nleakage. Moreover, we could define an `EoR window' in terms of the polarization\nleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the PSF-induced wedge and below\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\\perp$ when 70\\% of the leakage had\nbeen removed. These LOFAR results show that even a modest polarimetric\ncalibration over a field of view of $\\lesssim 4^\\circ$ in the future arrays\nlike SKA will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below the\nexpected EoR signal at the scales of 0.02-1 Mpc$^{-1}$. \n\n"}

Direct observations of the cold gas\ncomponent in objects with detected outflows at other wavelengths are needed to\nassess the impact of the outflow on the host galaxy interstellar medium (ISM).\nWe observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer an obscured quasar at\nz~1.5, XID2028, for which the presence of an ionised outflow has been\nunambiguously signalled by NIR spectroscopy.

All roundish nuclear rings in our\nsimulations settle in the range of $x_2$ orbits (or ILRs). However, knowing the\nresonances is insufficient to pin down the exact location of these nuclear\nrings.

Average divergence error\nis an order of magnitude lower for all test cases considered, and allows for\nthe stable simulation of the gravitational collapse of magnetised molecular\ncloud cores. The effectiveness of the cleaning may be improved by explicitly\nincreasing the hyperbolic wave speed or by cycling the cleaning equations\nbetween timesteps. In the latter, it is possible to achieve DivB=0. Chapter 4\ndevelops a switch to reduce dissipation of the magnetic field from artificial\nresistivity. Compared to the existing switch in the literature, this leads to\nsharper shock profiles in shocktube tests, lower overall dissipation of\nmagnetic energy, and importantly, is able to capture magnetic shocks in the\nhighly super-Alfvenic regime. Chapter 5 compares these numerical methods\nagainst grid-based MHD methods (using the Flash code) in simulations of the\nsmall-scale dynamo amplification of a magnetic field in driven, isothermal,\nsupersonic turbulence. Both codes exponentially amplify the magnetic energy at\na constant rate, though SPMHD shows a resolution dependence that arises from\nthe scaling of the numerical dissipation terms.

We show that, in the\npresence of a galactic bar, gas in a disc in the central regions of a galaxy\nwill be driven inwards by angular momentum transport induced by acoustic\ninstabilities within the bar's inner Lindblad resonance. This transport process\ndrives turbulence within the gas that temporarily keeps it strongly\ngravitationally stable and prevents the onset of rapid star formation. However,\nat some point the rotation curve must transition from approximately flat to\napproximately solid body, and the resulting reduction in shear reduces the\ntransport rates and causes gas to build up, eventually producing a\ngravitationally-unstable region that is subject to rapid and violent star\nformation.

There is a strong tendency for the spinning dust component\nnear many prominent HII regions to have a higher peak frequency, suggesting\nthat this increase in peak frequency is associated with dust in the\nphotodissociation regions around the nebulae. The emissivity of spinning dust\nin these diffuse regions is of the same order as previous detections in the\nliterature.

We first explore the\ncharacteristics of perturbations in polarimetric microlensing during\ncaustic-crossing of a binary lensing as follows: (a) The cooler spots over the\nGalactic bulge sources have the smaller contributions in the total flux,\nalthough they have stronger magnetic fields. (b) The maximum deviation in the\npolarimetry curve due to the spot happens when the spot is located near the\nsource edge and the source spot is first entering the caustic whereas the\nmaximum photometric deviation occurs for the spots located at the source\ncenter.

This direct collapse process is a leading\ncandidate for rapid formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high\nz. To circumvent the Courant condition at small radii, we have used the sink\nparticle method, and focus on the evolution on scales ~0.01-10 pc. The collapse\nproceeds in two stages, with the secondary runaway happening within the central\n10 pc, and with no detected fragmentation. The sink particles form when the\ncollapsing gas requires additional refinement of the grid size at the highest\nrefinement level. Their mass never exceeds ~10^3 Mo, with the sole exception of\nthe central seed which grows dramatically to ~ 2 x 10^6 Mo in ~2 Myr,\nconfirming the feasibility of this path to the SMBH. The time variability of\nangular momentum axis in the accreted gas results in the formation of two\nmisaligned disks --- a small inner disk, and a more massive, outer disk which\nis inclined by ~45^o to the inner disk. The self-gravity of these disks is\nheavily diluted --- both disks lie within the Roche limit of the central seed.\nWhile the inner disk is geometrically thin and weakly asymmetric, the outer\ndisk flares due to turbulent motions as a result of the massive inflow along a\npair of penetrating filaments. The geometry of inflow via filaments determines\nthe dominant and secondary Fourier modes in this disk --- these modes have a\nnon-self-gravitational origin. We do not confirm that m=1 is a principal mode\nthat drives the inflow in the presence of a central massive object. While the\npositions of the disks depend on the scale chosen to break the self-similar\ncollapse, the overall configuration appears to be generic, and is expected to\nform when the central seed becomes sufficiently massive. \n\n"}

The\nfate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation\nstar formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014) showed that\nexternal photoionization can stall the wind of RSGs and accumulate mass in a\ndense static shell. We use 1D R-HD simulations of an externally photoionized\nwind to predict the Halpha and [NII] emission arising from photoionized winds\nboth with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]\nemission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted\nsynthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense\nshell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities\nthat are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a\ndense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good\ntracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the\nbrightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial\nvelocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest\nemission at zero radial velocity. Our results show that the bright nebula\nsurrounding W26 must be asymmetric; we suggest it is confined by external ram\npressure from the wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on\nthe nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar. The line ratio\nstrongly favours photoionization over shock ionization, and so even if the\nobserved nebula is pressure confined there should still be an ionization front\nand a photoionization-confined shell closer to the star. \n\n"}

Sub-filaments and\n  velocities Abstract: We show that hydrodynamic turbulent cloud simulations naturally produce large\nfilaments made up of a network of smaller and coherent sub-filaments. Such\nsimulations resemble observations of filaments and fibres in nearby molecular\nclouds. The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc. Accretion flows\nalong the sub-filaments can feed material into star forming cores embedded\nwithin the network. The overall mass in sub-filaments and the number of\nsub-filaments increases as the cloud evolves. We propose that the formation of\nfilaments and sub-filaments is a natural consequence of the turbulent cascade\nin the complex multi-phase interstellar medium. Sub-filaments are formed by the\nhigh wavenumber, small scale modes in the turbulent velocity field. These are\nthen stretched by local shear motions and gathered together by a combination of\nlow wavenumber modes and gravitational contraction on larger scales, and by\ndoing so build up the extended filaments observed in column density maps. \n\n"}

A\ndetailed study of these rare sources provides new perspectives for\ninvestigating the AGN duty cycle, AGN-galaxy feedback, and accretion\nmechanisms. Large catalogues of radio sources provide statistical information\nabout the evolution of the radio-loud AGN population out to high redshifts.\nUsing wide-field imaging with the LOFAR telescope, we study both a well-known\nDDRG as well as a large number of radio sources in the field of view. We\npresent a high resolution image of the DDRG B1834+620 obtained at 144 MHz using\nLOFAR commissioning data. Our image covers about 100 square degrees and\ncontains over 1000 sources. The four components of the DDRG B1834+620 have been\nresolved for the first time at 144 MHz. Inner lobes were found to point towards\nthe direction of the outer lobes, unlike standard FR~II sources. Polarized\nemission was detected in the northern outer lobe. The high spatial resolution\nallows the identification of a large number of small double-lobed radio\nsources; roughly 10% of all sources in the field are doubles with a separation\nsmaller than 1 arcmin. The spectral fit of the four components is consistent\nwith a scenario in which the outer lobes are still active or the jets recently\nswitched off, while emission of the inner lobes is the result of a mix-up of\nnew and old jet activity. From the presence of the newly extended features in\nthe inner lobes of the DDRG, we can infer that the mechanism responsible for\ntheir formation is the bow shock that is driven by the newly launched jet. We\nfind that the density of the small doubles exceeds the density of FR-II sources\nwith similar properties at 1.4 GHz, but this difference becomes smaller for low\nflux densities. \n\n"}

Abstract: Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous\ninfrared galaxies identified by the WISE mission from their very red mid-IR\ncolors, and characterized by hot dust temperatures ($T>60~\\rm K$). Several\nstudies have shown clear evidence that the IR emission in these objects is\npowered by a highly dust-obscured AGN that shows close to Compton-thick\nabsorption at X-ray wavelengths. Thanks to the high AGN obscuration, the host\ngalaxy is easily observable, and has UV/optical colors usually consistent with\nthose of a normal galaxy. Here we discuss a sub-population of 8 Hot DOGs that\nshow enhanced rest-frame UV/optical emission. We discuss three scenarios that\nmight explain the excess UV emission: (i) unobscured light leaked from the AGN\nby reflection over the dust or by partial coverage of the accretion disk; (ii)\na second unobscured AGN in the system; or (iii) a luminous young starburst.\nX-ray observations can help discriminate between these scenarios. We study in\ndetail the blue excess Hot DOG WISE J020446.13-050640.8, which was\nserendipitously observed by Chandra/ACIS-I for 174.5 ks. The X-ray spectrum is\nconsistent with a single, hyper-luminous, highly absorbed AGN, and is strongly\ninconsistent with the presence of a secondary unobscured AGN. Based on this, we\nargue that the excess blue emission in this object is most likely either due to\nreflection or a co-eval starburst. We favor the reflection scenario as the\nunobscured star-formation rate needed to power the UV/optical emission would be\n$\\gtrsim 1000~\\rm M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$. Deep polarimetry observations could\nconfirm the reflection hypothesis. \n\n"}

Abstract: Large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relative\nto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before\nreionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple\narguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in\nlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have\nimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely\nmetal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost\nimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is\ntoo low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars\nmay contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in\nlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)\ncan be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling\nabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard\ncore-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We\nalso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in\nthese species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are\ncorrelated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local\nsilicate grains. Meanwhile [Mg/Ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from pure\nSNe yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,\npreferentially in the [C/Fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. This suggests that (1)\ndust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light\nelement abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust\nwhere they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis. \n\n"}

We use a semi-analytic method and\nnumerical simulations to explore expansion of spherical dusty H II regions and\nsurrounding neutral shells and the resulting cloud disruption. Our model for\nshell expansion adopts the static solutions of Draine (2011) for dusty H II\nregions and considers the contact outward forces on the shell due to radiation\nand thermal pressures as well as the inward gravity from the central star and\nthe shell itself. We show that the internal structure we adopt and the shell\nevolution from the semi-analytic approach are in good agreement with the\nresults of numerical simulations. Strong radiation pressure in the interior\ncontrols the shell expansion indirectly by enhancing the density and pressure\nat the ionization front. We calculate the minimum star formation efficiency\n$\\epsilon_{min}$ required for cloud disruption as a function of the cloud's\ntotal mass and mean surface density. Within the adopted spherical geometry, we\nfind that typical giant molecular clouds in normal disk galaxies have\n$\\epsilon_{min} \\lesssim 10$%, with comparable gas and radiation pressure\neffects on shell expansion. Massive cluster-forming clumps require a\nsignificantly higher efficiency of $\\epsilon_{min} \\gtrsim 50$% for disruption,\nproduced mainly by radiation-driven expansion.

We show here the first evidence that the\nMilky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end\nof its thick disk formation $\\sim$9 Gyr ago. Elemental abundances of stars\nstudied as part of the APOGEE survey reveal indeed that in less than $\\sim$2\nGyr the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order-of-magnitude.\nBecause of the tight correlation between age and alpha abundance, this event\nreflects in the dearth of stars along the inner disk sequence in the\n[Fe/H]-[$\\alpha$/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the\nMilky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at\na much lower level to form the thin disk. These events are very well matched by\nthe latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late type\ngalaxies, quenching is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion\nof gas. In our Galaxy, it occurred on a much shorter time scale, while the\nchemical continuity before and after the quenching indicates that it was not\ndue to the exhaustion of the gas. While quenching is generally associated with\nspheroids, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way,\npossibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin\ndisks. Given the demographics of late type galaxies in the local universe, in\nwhich classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true\ngenerally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately $M^*$, where\nquenching could be directly a consequence of thick disk formation. We emphasize\nthat the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and\nrelated to, the formation of the bar.

We\nderive gas-phase abundances from SDSS spectroscopy and a complementary sample\nof low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, making use of a consistent set of abundance\ncalibrations. This collection of data clearly confirms the existence of a\nplateau in the (N/O) ratio at very low metallicity, followed by an increase of\nthis ratio up to high values as the metallicity increases. This trend can be\ninterpreted as due to two main sources of nitrogen in galaxies: i) massive\nstars, which produce small amounts of pure primary nitrogen and are responsible\nfor the (N/O) ratio in the low metallicity plateau; ii) low- and\nintermediate-mass stars, which produce both secondary and primary nitrogen and\nenrich the interstellar medium with a time delay relative to massive stars, and\ncause the increase of the (N/O) ratio. We find that the length of the\nlow-metallicity plateau is almost solely determined by the star formation\nefficiency, which regulates the rate of oxygen production by massive stars. We\nshow that, to reproduce the high observed (N/O) ratios at high (O/H), as well\nas the right slope of the (N/O) vs. (O/H) curve, a differential galactic wind -\nwhere oxygen is assumed to be lost more easily than nitrogen - is necessary.

Our pipeline consists of two stages: extracting\ndescriptive features from the light curves and classification using a machine\nlearning algorithm. Our feature extraction methods vary from model-dependent\ntechniques, namely SALT2 fits, to more independent techniques fitting\nparametric models to curves, to a completely model-independent wavelet\napproach.

It is the earliest known galaxy\nwhere the interstellar medium (ISM) has been detected; dust emission was\ndetected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also\nunusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is\ntherefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical\ngalaxy at this redshift. We observed A1689-zD1 with ALMA in bands 6 and 7 and\nwith the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in band $Q$. To study the structure of\nA1689-zD1, we map the mm thermal dust emission and find two spatial components\nwith sizes about $0.4-1.7$\\,kpc (lensing-corrected). The rough spatial\nmorphology is similar to what is observed in the near-infrared with {\\it HST}\nand points to a perturbed dynamical state, perhaps indicative of a major merger\nor a disc in early formation.

Major\ndifferences are observed in the X-ray luminosities, and the Eddington ratios,\nwhich are higher in Seyfert 2s. Short-term X-ray variations were not detected,\nwhile long-term changes are common in LINERs and Seyfert 2s. Compton-thick\nsources generally do not show variations, most probably because the AGN is not\naccesible in the 0.5--10 keV energy band.

The N-body subhalo study of Chamberlain et al. verified\nthis picture and pointed out a useful observational consequence: measurements\nof subhalo correlations beyond the tidal radius are sensitive to the infall\ntime, t_infall, of the subhalo onto its host. We perform this cross-correlation\nmeasurement using ~ 160,000 red satellite galaxies in SDSS redMaPPer clusters\nand find evidence that subhalo correlations do persist well beyond the tidal\nradius, suggesting that many of the observed satellites fell into their current\nhost less than a dynamical time ago, t_infall < t_dyn.

The bubble formed by\nthe wind eventually breaks out of the disk, and most of the wind moves directly\nout of the galaxy and is definitively lost. The fraction of the wind moving\nnearly parallel to the galactic plane carves a hole in the disk which will\ncontract after the end of the SN activity. During the interval of time between\nthe end of the SN explosions and the \"closure\" of the hole, very O-poor stars\n(the Extreme population) can form out of the super-AGB (asymptotic giant\nbranch) ejecta collected in the GC center. Once the hole contracts, the AGB\nejecta mix with the pristine gas, allowing the formation of stars with an\noxygen abundance intermediate between that of the very O-poor stars and that of\nthe pristine gas.

To\nexplain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a\nsecond population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the\nlow-mass stars in the initial GC population. The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The\nlatter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface\ndensity profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first\nplace by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution\nis governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc. We\nconclude that the size and lifetime of the disc are probably not sufficient to\naccrete the amount of mass required in Bastian et al.'s scenario. \n\n"}

This\ninelastic transition causes the DM to up-scatter in terrestrial experiments\ninto an excited state up to 550 keV heavier than the DM itself. An inelastic\ntransition of this size is highly suppressed by both kinematics and nuclear\nform factors. We extend previous studies of inelastic DM to determine the\npresent bounds on the scattering cross section, and the prospects for\nimprovements in sensitivity. Three scenarios provide illustrative examples:\nnearly pure Higgsino DM; magnetic inelastic DM; and inelastic models with dark\nphoton exchange. We determine the elastic scattering rate as well as verify\nthat exothermic transitions are negligible. Presently, the strongest bounds on\nthe cross section are from xenon at LUX-PandaX (\\delta < 160 keV), iodine at\nPICO (160 < \\delta < 300 keV), and tungsten at CRESST (when \\delta > 300 keV).\nAmusingly, once \\delta > 200 keV, weak scale (and larger) DM - nucleon\nscattering cross sections are allowed. The relative competitiveness of these\nexperiments is governed by the upper bound on the recoil energies employed by\neach experiment, as well as strong sensitivity to the mass of the heaviest\nelement in the detector. Several implications, including sizable recoil\nenergy-dependent annual modulation, and improvements for future experiments are\ndiscussed. We show that the xenon experiments can improve on the PICO results,\nif they were to analyze their existing data over a larger range of recoil\nenergies, i.e., 20-500 keV. We also speculate about several reported events at\nCRESST between 45-100 keV, that could be interpreted as inelastic DM\nscattering. Future data from PICO, CRESST and xenon experiments can test this\nwith anaylses of high energy recoil data. \n\n"}

However, unlike\nprevious analyses of the MDAR, McGaugh et al. have chosen to obfuscate the MOND\nroots of their analysis, and its connection with, and implications for, this\nparadigm.

In the present work, we propose\na definite vertical stability criterion for circular equatorial timelike\ngeodesics in static, axially symmetric thin disks, possibly surrounded by other\nstructures preserving axial symmetry. It turns out that the strong energy\ncondition for the disk stress-energy content is sufficient for vertical\nstability of these orbits. Moreover, adiabatic invariance of the vertical\naction variable gives us an approximate third integral of motion for oblique\norbits which deviate slightly from the equatorial plane. Such new approximate\nthird integral certainly points to a better understanding of the analytical\nproperties of these orbits. The results presented here, derived for static\nspacetimes, may be a starting point to study the motion around rotating,\nstationary razor-thin disks.

The evolution of such counterrotating galaxies remains far\nfrom being well understood. In this paper we study the dynamics of\ncounterrotating collisionless stellar disks by means of $N$-body simulations.\nWe show that, in the presence of counterrotation, an otherwise gravitationally\nstable disk can naturally generate bending waves accompanied by strong disk\nheating across the disk plane, that is in the vertical direction. Such\nconclusion is found to hold even for dynamically warm systems with typical\nvalues of the initial vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio $\\sigma_{\\rm\nz}/\\sigma_{\\rm R} \\approx 0.5$, for which the role of pressure anisotropy\nshould be unimportant.

Here, we study such rapid accretion of the primordial gas on to\nintermediate-mass (10^2 - 10^5 M_sun) BHs under anisotropic radiation feedback.\nWe perform two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that solve the\nflow structure across the Bondi radius, from far outside of the Bondi radius\ndown to a central part which is larger than a circum-BH accretion disc. The\nradiation from the unresolved circum-BH disc is analytically modeled\nconsidering self-shadowing effect. We show that the flow settles into a steady\nstate, where the flow structure consists of two distinct parts: (1) bipolar\nionized outflowing regions, where the gas is pushed outward by thermal gas\npressure and super-Eddington radiation pressure, and (2) an equatorial neutral\ninflowing region, where the gas falls toward the central BH without affected by\nradiation feedback. The resulting accretion rate is much higher than that in\nthe case of isotropic radiation, far exceeding the Eddington-limited rate to\nreach a value slightly lower than the Bondi one.

Our analysis relies on deep VLT/X-Shooter long-slit\nspectra, along with newly developed stellar population models, allowing for\n[Na/Fe] variations, up to 1.2dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity,\nand IMF slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent\nspectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the\nfirst time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of\nmassive early-type galaxies, finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe], in the range\n0.5-0.7dex, and a bottom-heavy IMF. Therefore, individual abundance variations\ncannot be fully responsible for the trends of gravity-sensitive indices,\nstrengthening the case towards a non-universal IMF. Given current limitations\nof theoretical atmosphere models, our [Na/Fe] estimates should be taken as\nupper limits. For XSG1, where line strengths are measured out to 0.8Re, the\nradial trend of [Na/Fe] is similar to [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe], being constant out to\n0.5Re, and decreasing by 0.2-0.3dex at 0.8Re, without any clear correlation\nwith local metallicity.

We show that the properties of the host galaxy are\nconsistent with those of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRB) and\nhydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Both LGRBs and SLSNe-I were\npreviously hypothesized to be powered by the electromagnetic spin-down of\nnewly-formed, strongly-magnetized neutron stars with millisecond birth rotation\nperiods (`millisecond magnetars'). This motivates considering a scenario\nwhereby the repeated bursts from FRB 121102 originate from a young magnetar\nremnant embedded within a young hydrogen-poor supernova remnant. Requirements\non the GHz free-free optical depth through the expanding supernova ejecta\n(accounting for photo-ionization by the rotationally-powered magnetar nebula),\nenergetic constraints on the bursts, and constraints on the size of the\nquiescent source all point to an age of less than a few decades to a century.\nThe quiescent radio source can be attributed to synchrotron emission from the\nshock interaction between the fast outer layer of the supernova ejecta with the\nsurrounding wind of the progenitor star, or from deeper within the magnetar\nwind nebula. Alternatively, the radio emission could be an orphan afterglow\nfrom an initially off-axis LGRB jet, though this might require the source to be\ntoo young. The young age of the source can be tested by searching for a time\nderivative of the dispersion measure and predicted fading of the quiescent\nradio source. We propose future tests of the SLSNe-I/LGRB/FRB connection, such\nas searches for FRBs from nearby SLSNe-I/LGRB on timescales of decades after\ntheir explosions. \n\n"}

During this transition\nphase, the growing superbubble is filled with dense and cool fragments of\nshells and most of the energy is radiated away during this merging process.\nAfter passing through the intermediate phase, the superbubble eventually\nsettles on to a new power-law wind asymptote that is smaller than estimated in\na continuous wind model. This results in a significant (more than {\\it several\ntimes}) underestimation of the mechanical luminosity needed to feed the bubble.\nWe determine the X-ray and H$\\alpha$ surface brightnesses as functions of time\nfor such merging SNe in a stellar cluster and find that clusters with high SN\nrate shine predominantly in soft X-rays and H$\\alpha$. In particular, a low\nvalue of the volume averaged H$\\alpha$ to H$\\beta$ ratio and its large spread\ncan be a good indicator of the transition phase of merging SNe. \n\n"}

The star\nformation rate surface density (sigsfr) corresponding to a gas surface density\n(siggas) in each MC is obtained by counting the number of the YSOs within\nsuccessive contours of 13CO line emission.

Probing the Velocity Field with Mock Observations Abstract: Hitomi made the first direct measurements of galaxy cluster gas motions in\nthe Perseus cluster, which implied that its core is fairly \"quiescent\", with\nvelocities less than $\\sim$200 km s$^{-1}$, despite the presence of an active\ngalactic nucleus and sloshing cold fronts. Building on previous work, we use\nsynthetic Hitomi/SXS observations of the hot plasma of a simulated cluster with\nsloshing gas motions and varying viscosity to analyze its velocity structure in\na similar fashion. We find that sloshing motions can produce line shifts and\nwidths similar to those measured by Hitomi. We find these measurements are\nunaffected by the value of the gas viscosity, since its effects are only\nmanifested clearly on angular scales smaller than the SXS $\\sim$1' PSF. The PSF\nbiases the line shift of regions near the core as much as $\\sim 40-50$ km\ns$^{-1}$, so it is crucial to model this effect carefully. We also infer that\nif sloshing motions dominate the observed velocity gradient, Perseus must be\nobserved from a line of sight which is somewhat inclined from the plane of\nthese motions, but one that still allows the spiral pattern to be visible.\nFinally, we find that assuming isotropy of motions can underestimate the total\nvelocity and kinetic energy of the core in our simulation by as much as\n$\\sim$60%.

However, our knowledge of this phenomenon and its\ncharacteristics is still lacking greatly observationally, and there is\ncurrently no scenario that adequately explains its origin. It is therefore\nimportant to study as many GCs as possible to characterize whether or not they\nhave MPs, and determine their detailed behavior to enlighten formation\nscenarios, using a wide range of techniques. The Washington photometric system\nhas proved to be useful to find MPs thanks mainly to the UV-sensitivity and\nhigh efficiency of the C filter.

We investigate whether such structures are due to the\nmorphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN\nemission. With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts\nfor the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk. CN rings are produced\nnaturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk\nstructure such as a dust cavity or gap. The strong link between FUV flux and CN\nemission can provide critical information regarding the vertical structure of\nthe disk and the distribution of dust grains which affects the UV penetration,\nand could help to break some degeneracies in the SED fitting.

In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics.

We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient.

To investigate\nthe potential underlying causes we perform a comparative study of the chemistry\nof T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be disks, using a model that pays special attention to\nphotochemistry. The warmer disk temperatures and higher ultraviolet flux of\nHerbig stars compared to T Tauri stars induce some differences in the disk\nchemistry.

In the outer regions, the model indicates that the molecules\ntypically observed in disks, like HCN, CN, C2H, H2CO, CS, SO, and HCO+, do not\nhave drastic abundance differences between T Tauri and Herbig Ae disks. Some\nspecies produced under the action of photochemistry, like C2H and CN, are\npredicted to have slightly lower abundances around Herbig Ae stars due to a\nnarrowing of the photochemically active layer.

These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation. \n\n"}

One explanation for the required colder primordial gas is the energy\ntransfer between the baryon and dark matter fluids due to non-gravitational\nscattering. Here, we explore the thermal evolution of primordial gas,\ncollapsing to form Population III (Pop III) stars, when this energy transfer is\nincluded. Performing a series of one-zone calculations, we find that the\nevolution results in stars more massive than in the standard model, provided\nthat the dark matter is described by the best-fit parameters inferred from the\n21-cm observation. On the other hand, a significant part of the dark matter\nparameter space can be excluded by the requirement to form massive Pop III\nstars sufficiently early in cosmic history. Otherwise, the radiation background\nneeded to bring about the strong Wouthuysen-Field coupling at z >~ 17, inferred\nto explain the 21-cm absorption feature, could not be builtup.

Reliable extinction measurements require very\naccurate photometric calibrations. We show the first step of an iterative\nprocess linking 3D dust maps and photometric calibrations and improving them\nsimultaneously. Our previous 3D map of nearby IS dust was used to select low\nreddening SDSS/APOGEE-DR14 red giants, and this database served for an\nempirical effective temperature- and metallicity-dependent photometric\ncalibration in the Gaia G and 2MASS Ks bands.

{"id": "1804.06854", "contents": "Title: The information content in cold stellar streams Abstract: Cold stellar streams---produced by tidal disruptions of clusters---are\nlong-lived, coherent dynamical features in the halo of the Milky Way. Due to\ntheir different ages and different positions in phase space, different streams\ntell us different things about the Galaxy. Here we employ a Cramer--Rao (CRLB)\nor Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in\neleven known streams (ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D,\nPS1E, Sangarius and Triangulum). This approach depends on a generative model,\nwhich we have developed previously, and which permits calculation of\nderivatives of predicted stream properties with respect to Galaxy and stream\nparameters. We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on\neccentric orbits contain the most information about the halo shape. For each\nstream, there are near-degeneracies between dark-matter-halo properties and\nparameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor, but simultaneous\nfitting of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level.\nAt this precision, simulated dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic\nparametrizations, so we add an expansion of basis functions to give the\ngravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information\nabout the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current\nposition of the stream. In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream\nappears to measure the local acceleration at its current position; this\nmotivates thinking about future non-parametric approaches. The CRLB formalism\nalso permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar\nvelocities, distances, and proper motions. We show that kinematic measurements\nof stream stars are essential for producing competitive constraints on the\ndistribution of dark matter, which bodes well for stream studies in the age of\nGaia. \n\n"}

The stars in\nthe reddest-color sequence are likely dominated by the dynamically-hot tail of\nthe thick disk population. Information from Nissen & Schuster (2010) and from\nthe APOGEE survey suggests that stars in the blue-color sequence have elemental\nabundance patterns that can be explained by this population having a relatively\nlow star-formation efficiency during its formation. In dynamical and orbital\nspaces, such as the `Toomre diagram', the two sequences show a significant\noverlap, but with a tendency for stars on the blue-color sequence to dominate\nregions with no or retrograde rotation and high total orbital energy. In the\nplane defined by the maximal vertical excursion of the orbits versus their\napocenters, stars of both sequences redistribute into discrete wedges.

Most of our knowledge on the stellar component of galaxies is based\non the analysis of distant systems and comes from integrated light data. It is\nimportant to test whether the results of the star formation histories (SFH)\nobtained with standard full-spectrum fitting methods are in agreement with\nthose obtained through colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting (usually\nconsidered the most reliable approach). Aims. We compare SFHs recovered from\nboth techniques in Leo~A, a Local Group dwarf galaxy whose majority of stars\nformed during the last 8 Gyrs. This complements our previous findings in a\nfield in the Large Magellanic Cloud bar, where star formation has been on-going\nsince early epochs though at varying rates. Methods. We have used GTC/OSIRIS in\nlong-slit mode to obtain a high-quality integrated light spectrum by scanning a\nselected region within Leo~A, for which a CMD reaching the old main mequence\nturn-off (oMSTO) is available from HST. We compared the SFH obtained from the\ntwo datasets, using state-of-art methods of integrated light ({\\tt STECKMAP})\nand resolved stellar population analysis. In the case of the CMD, we computed\nthe SFH both from a deep CMD (observed with HST/ACS), and from a shallower one\n(archival data from HST/WFPC2). Results. The agreement between the SFHs\nrecovered from the oMSTO CMD and from full spectrum fitting is remarkable,\nparticularly regarding the time evolution of the star formation rate. The\noverall extremely low metallicity of Leo~A is recovered up to the last 2 Gyrs,\nwhen some discrepancies appear. A relatively high metallicity found for the\nyoungest stars from the integrated data is a recurring feature that might\nindicate that the current models or synthesis codes should be revised, but that\ncan be significantly mitigated using a more restrictive metallicity range...\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

In this study we pay special attention to\ntracing the time evolution of the ionizing photons' escape fraction, which\naffects the distribution of neutral hydrogen, by performing radiation\nhydrodynamics (RHD) simulations resolving dense gas in a halo. We find that the\nradial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive\nto the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape\nfraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape\nfrom its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm\nabsorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time. Whereas photons\nfrom a massive star well working to heat the ambient intergalactic medium turn\nout to cause a spatially extended 21-cm emission signature. Although individual\nsignals are found to be undetectable with the Square Kilometre Array, our\nanalysis using the results from the RHD simulations indicates that the\nproperties of the first stars are imprinted on the 21-cm global signal: its\namplitude depends not only on the cosmic star formation rate density, but also\non the typical mass of the first stars due to the stellar-mass-dependent\nheating rate. Thus, we suggest that the initial mass function of the first\nstars is an essential factor in understanding the global signal. \n\n"}

The\nstronger central tidal fields of cuspier halos minimize the cluster's ability\nto expand in response to mass loss due to stellar evolution during its early\nevolutionary stages and during its subsequent long-term evolution driven by\ntwo-body relaxation. Hence clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter halos are\ncharacterized by more compact sizes, higher velocity dispersions and remain\napproximately isotropic at all clustercentric distances. Conversely, clusters\nin cored halos can expand more and develop a velocity distribution profile that\nbecomes increasingly radially anisotropic at larger clustercentric distances.\nFinally, the larger velocity dispersion of clusters evolving in cuspier dark\nmatter profiles results in them having longer relaxation times. Hence clusters\nin cuspy galaxies relax at a slower rate and, consequently, they are both less\nmass segregated and farther from complete energy equipartition than cluster's\nin cored galaxies.

A small fraction of stars is expected, however, to follow the global\ndark matter shape of the cluster. These are the stars whose extended spatial\ndistribution results from the merging activity of galaxies and form the\nintracluster light (ICL).

Most cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations focus\ntheir computational effort on the galaxies themselves and treat the CGM more\ncoarsely, which means small-scale structure cannot be resolved. We get around\nthis issue by running zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with\nstandard mass refinement and additional uniform spatial refinement within the\nvirial radius. This results in a detailed view of its gaseous halo at\nunprecedented (1 kpc) uniform resolution with only a moderate increase in\ncomputational time. The improved spatial resolution does not impact the central\ngalaxy or the average density of the CGM. However, it drastically changes the\nradial profile of the neutral hydrogen column density, which is enhanced at\ngalactocentric radii larger than 40 kpc. The covering fraction of Lyman-Limit\nSystems within 150 kpc is almost doubled. We therefore conclude that some of\nthe observational properties of the CGM are strongly resolution dependent.\nIncreasing the resolution in the CGM, without increasing the resolution of the\ngalaxies, is a promising and computationally efficient method to push the\nboundaries of state-of-the-art simulations. \n\n"}

Fossil clues Abstract: Early-type retired galaxies (RGs, i.e. galaxies which no longer form stars)\ncan be divided into two classes: those with no emission lines, here dubbed\nlineless RGs, and those with emission lines, dubbed liny RGs. Both types of\ngalaxies contain hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) which emit ionizing\nphotons. The difference must thus lie in the presence or absence of a reservoir\nof ionizable gas. From a volume-limited sample of 38\\,038 elliptical galaxies,\nwe explore differences in physical properties between liny and lineless using\ndata from the SDSS, WISE and GALEX catalogues. To avoid biases in the\ncomparison, we pair-match liny and lineless in stellar-mass, redshift and\nhalf-light Petrosian radius. We detect marginal differences in their optical\nstellar ages and NUV luminosities, indicating that liny RGs have an excess of\nintermediate-age (0.1--5 Gyr) stellar populations. Liny RGs show higher dust\nattenuation and $W3$ luminosities than their lineless counterparts. We also\nfind that the amount of warm gas needed to explain the observed \\Ha luminosity\nin liny RGs is $10^5$--$10^8$\\msun, and that their \\nii/\\oii emission-line\nratios are typical of those of the most massive star-forming galaxies. Taken\ntogether, these results rules out the following sources for the warm gas in\nliny RGs: mass-loss from intermediate-mass stars, mergers with metal-poor\ngalaxies and intergalactic streams. They imply instead an inflow of enriched\ngas previously expelled from the galaxy or a merger with a metal-rich galaxy.\nThe ionization source and the origin of the gas producing the emission lines\nare thus disconnected. \n\n"}

Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and\ncentrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a\nprolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation.

Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh\nrefinement, we investigate how photons propagate and escape from turbulent\nclouds with different masses, star formation efficiencies (SFEs), and\nmetallicities, as well as with different models of stellar spectra and\nsupernova feedback. We find that the escape fractions in both LyC and Lya are\ngenerally increasing with time if the cloud is efficiently dispersed by\nradiation and supernova feedback. When the total SFE is low (1% of the cloud\nmass), 0.1-5% of LyC photons leave the metal-poor cloud, whereas the fractions\nincrease to 20-70% in clouds with a 10% SFE. LyC photons escape more\nefficiently if gas metallicity is lower, if the upper mass limit in the stellar\ninitial mass function is higher, if binary interactions are allowed in the\nevolution of stars, or if additional strong radiation pressure, such as Lya\npressure, is present. As a result, the number of escaping LyC photons can\neasily vary by a factor of $\\sim4$ on cloud scales. The escape fractions of Lya\nphotons are systemically higher (60-80%) than those of LyC photons despite\nlarge optical depths at line centre ($\\tau_0\\sim10^6-10^9$). Scattering of Lya\nphotons is already significant on cloud scales, leading to double-peaked\nprofiles with peak separations of $v_{\\rm sep}\\sim400\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ during\nthe initial stage of the cloud evolution, while it becomes narrower than\n$v_{\\rm sep} \\le 150 \\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the LyC bright phase.

We present here a detailed stellar population analysis of a\nrelatively isolated UDG, DGSAT I, based on spectroscopic data from the Keck\nCosmic Web Imager integral field unit. The star formation history of DGSAT I\nseems to be extended, with a mean luminosity-weighted age of ~3 Gyr, in\nagreement with previous photometric studies. However, we find a very high\n[Mg/Fe] abundance ratio, which is extreme even in the context of the highly\nalpha-enhanced massive ellipticals and ultra-faint dwarfs. The\n[Mg/Fe]-enhancement of DGSAT I appears to be 10 times higher than the most\nmagnesium-enhanced stellar systems discovered to date, and suggests that the\nchemical enrichment of this object was dominated by core-collapse supernovae.\nIntriguingly, this breaks the canonical relation between [Mg/Fe] and star\nformation time-scale. With a measured velocity dispersion of 56 +/- 10 km/s,\nDGSAT I also shows a high mass-to-light ratio, which indicates that it is\nhighly dark matter-dominated.

A description of the data analysis software is given, including\ndetailed studies of its performance on data from the simulations.\n  A set of robust observables is derived. These are insensitive to many\nefficiencies and to the details of the modeling of the parent pion production\nmechanisms, yet have distinguishable values for DCC and generic charged-neutral\ndistributions. Simulations show that the robust observables are insensitive to\ndetector efficiencies and to systematic errors in the data analysis software.\n  The resulting values for robust observables for approximately 1.5 million\nevents are shown to be consistent with production by only generic mechanisms.\nResults from samples of diffractive-tagged events and of high-multiplicity\nevents also show no evidence for DCC. \n\n"}

Recently, the DAMA NaI dark matter direct detection experiment\nreported an annual modulation in their event rate consistent with a WIMP relic.\nHowever, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Ge experiment excludes most of\nthe region preferred by DAMA. We demonstrate that if the dark matter can only\nscatter by making a transition to a slightly heavier state (Delta m ~ 100kev),\nthe experiments are no longer in conflict. Moreover, differences in the energy\nspectrum of nuclear recoil events could distinguish such a scenario from the\nstandard WIMP scenario.

Abstract: In models with universal extra dimensions (i.e. in which all Standard Model\nfields, including fermions, propagate into compact extra dimensions) momentum\nconservation in the extra dimensions leads to the conservation of Kaluza--Klein\n(KK) number at each vertex. KK number is violated by loop effects because of\nthe orbifold imposed to reproduce the chiral Standard Model with zero modes,\nhowever, a KK parity remains at any order in perturbation theory which leads to\nthe existence of a stable lightest KK particle (LKP). In addition, the\ndegeneracy in the KK spectrum is lifted by radiative corrections so that all\nother KK particles eventually decay into the LKP. We investigate cases where\nthe Standard Model lives in five or six dimensions with compactification radius\nof TeV$^{-1}$ size and the LKP is the first massive state in the KK tower of\neither the photon or the neutrino. We derive the relic density of the LKP under\na variety of assumptions about the spectrum of first tier KK modes. We find\nthat both the KK photon and the KK neutrino, with masses at the TeV scale, may\nhave appropriate annihilation cross sections to account for the dark matter,\n$\\Omega_M \\sim 0.3$. \n\n"}

In the Littlest Higgs model with T parity, the LTP is\ntypically the T-odd heavy photon, which is weakly interacting and can play the\nrole of dark matter. We analyze the relic abundance of the heavy photon,\nincluding its coannihilations with other T-odd particles, and map out the\nregions of the parameter space where it can account for the observed dark\nmatter. We evaluate the prospects for direct and indirect discovery of the\nheavy photon dark matter. The direct detection rates are quite low and a\nsubstantial improvement in experimental sensitivity would be required for\nobservation. A substantial flux of energetic gamma rays is produced in the\nannihilation of the heavy photons in the galactic halo. This flux can be\nobserved by the GLAST telescope, and, if the distribution of dark matter in the\nhalo is favorable, by ground-based telescope arrays such as VERITAS and HESS. \n\n"}
