The\nphysics of strange and charmed quarks holds the potential to connect the two\nenergy domains, interpolating between the limiting scales of QCD. This is the\nregime which will be explored using the future Antiproton Annihilations at\nDarmstadt (PANDA) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research\n(FAIR).\n  In this contribution some of the most relevant physics topics are detailed;\nand the reason why PANDA is the ideal detector to study them is given.\nPrecision studies of hadron formation in the charmonium region will greatly\nadvance our understanding of hadronic structure.

Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and\nunambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana\nneutrino mass, m_bb.

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also\nfind that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of\nleptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs\nrepresentations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a\nphenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive\nsizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering.

We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark\nmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of\nhalos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction. The\nmain characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density\nwithin the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up\nto ~ 3-4 at M_vir = 10^{12} M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean\nof <alpha> ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of\nrms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10^{13-14} M_solar steeper\nthan the NFW profile (alpha=1).

As an important new\napplication, we apply PMC scale-setting to study the top-quark forward-backward\nasymmetry. We observe that the more convergent perturbative series after PMC\nscale-setting leads to a more accurate top-quark forward-backward asymmetry.\nThe resulting PMC prediction on the asymmetry is also free from the initial\nrenormalization scale-dependence. Because the NLO PMC scale has a dip behavior\nfor the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel at small subprocess collision energies, the\nimportance of this channel to the asymmetry is increased. We observe that the\nasymmetries $A_{FB}^{t\\bar{t}}$ and $A_{FB}^{p\\bar{p}}$ at the Tevatron will be\nincreased by 42% in comparison to the previous estimates obtained by using\nconventional scale-setting; i.e. we obtain $A_{FB}^{t\\bar{t},{\\rm PMC}} \\simeq\n12.5%$ and $A_{FB}^{p\\bar{p},{\\rm PMC}} \\simeq 8.28%$.

Here, we explore top quark spin correlation measurement\nfrom a general perspective, highlighting the role of azimuthal decay angles. By\ntaking differences and sums of these angles about the top-antitop production\naxis, the presence of spin correlations can be seen as sinusoidal modulations\nresulting from the interference of different helicity channels.

Abstract: The dominant decay mode of standard model Higgs at 126 GeV $b\\bar{b}$ suffers\nfrom severe SM background at the LHC even in associated productions $Wh_{\\rm\nSM}$ or $Z h_{\\rm SM}$. The precision measurement of BR($\\phi\\to b\\bar{b})$\nrequires more data to reduce its large error bar. We investigate the\npossibility of this channel with largest uncertainty not dominating the decay\nof Higgs-like boson discovered at the LHC. In such scenarios, the Higgs signal\nshows highly suppressed $b\\bar{b}$, slightly reduced $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ and\nmoderately enhanced gauge bosons comparing with the SM predictions. The model\nrequires two different sources of electroweak symmetry breaking and radiative\ncorrection to $m_{b}$ strongly enhanced. However, large reduction in $b\\bar{b}$\nusually results large enhancement in $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ mode in particular. The\nreduction of $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ therefore implies that a new decay mode is\ninevitable. We find that a non-decoupling MSSM Higgs decay into lighter Higgs\n$H\\to hh$ may fit the signature.

In order to quantify these constraints, as well as to assess\nthe compatibility with available nuclear data from fixed target experiments and\nfrom RHIC, the traditional strategy is to perform a global fit of nuclear PDFs.\nThis procedure is however time consuming and technically challenging, and\nmoreover can only be performed by the PDF fitters themselves.

For a $\\bar{K}N (I=0)$ bound state without\ncouplings to other channels, we establish a relation between the radiative\ndecay width and the compositeness. Especially the radiative decay width of the\nbound state is proportional to the compositeness. Applying the formulation to\n$\\Lambda (1405)$, we observe that the decay to $\\Lambda \\gamma$ is dominated by\nthe $K^{-}p$ component inside $\\Lambda (1405)$, because in this decay $\\pi ^{+}\n\\Sigma ^{-}$ and $\\pi ^{-} \\Sigma ^{+}$ strongly cancel each other and the $\\pi\n\\Sigma$ component can contribute to the $\\Lambda \\gamma$ decay only through the\nslight isospin breaking. This means that the decay $\\Lambda (1405) \\to \\Lambda\n\\gamma$ is suitable for the study of the $\\bar{K} N$ component in $\\Lambda\n(1405)$. Fixing the $\\Lambda (1405)$-$\\pi \\Sigma$ coupling constant from the\nusual decay of $\\Lambda (1405) \\to \\pi \\Sigma$, we show a relation between the\nabsolute value of the $\\bar{K} N$ compositeness for $\\Lambda (1405)$ and the\nradiative decay width of $\\Lambda (1405) \\to \\Lambda \\gamma$ and $\\Sigma ^{0}\n\\gamma$, and we find that large decay width to $\\Lambda \\gamma$ implies large\n$\\bar{K}N$ compositeness for $\\Lambda (1405)$.

The DiFFs are\nextracted as Monte Carlo (MC) averages of corresponding multiplicities using\ntheir probabilistic interpretation. To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of\nthe produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with\nelementary Collins modulation.

However due to the Z-Z' mixing\nalso corresponding contributions from Z boson are present that are usually\nneglected. We calculate the impact of these contributions on Delta F=2\nprocesses and rare K, B_s and B_d decays for different values of a parameter\nbeta, which distinguishes between various 331 models and for different fermion\nrepresentations under the SU(3)_L group. We find a general expression for the\nZ-Z' mixing in terms beta, M_Z, M_Z' and tan(bar{beta}), familiar from 2 Higgs\nDoublet models, that differs from the one quoted in the literature. We study in\nparticular the models with beta=+-n/sqrt{3} with n=1,2 which have recently been\ninvestigated by us in the context of new data on B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and\nB_d->K^*(K)mu^+ mu^-. We find that these new contributions can indeed be\nneglected in the case of Delta F=2 transitions and decays, like\nB_d->K^*mu^+mu^-, where they are suppressed by the small vectorial Z coupling\nto charged leptons. However the contributions of tree-level Z exchanges to\ndecays sensitive to axial-vector couplings, like B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and B_d->K\nmu^+ mu^-, and those with neutrinos in the final state, like b->s nu bar{nu}\ntransitions, K^+->pi^+ nu bar{nu} and K_L->pi^0 nu bar{nu} cannot be generally\nneglected with size of Z contributions depending on beta, tan(bar{beta}) and\nM_Z'.

Since the tracking vertex\nresolution is typically ~10^{-3} (50 micron/4.8cm) of the rms vertex\ndistribution, whereas only ~10^{-1} (i.e. 20 vs.170 picoseconds (psec)) is\ndemonstrated for timing, it is often assumed that only photon (i.e. EM\ncalorimeter or shower-max) timing is of interest.

This progress is largely facilitated by the new\ngeneration of experiments in deuteron electrodisintegration carried out at\nunprecedentedly high momentum transfer. The theoretical analysis of these data\nconfirms the onset of the high energy eikonal regime in the scattering process\nwhich allows one to separate long range nuclear effects from the effects\ngenuinely related to the short distance structure of the deuteron. Our\nconclusion is that for the first time the deuteron is probed at relative\nmomenta beyond 300 MeV/c without dominating long range effects. As a result, at\nthese large nucleon momenta the cross section is sensitive to the nuclear\ndynamics at sub-fermi distances. Due to large internal momenta involved we are\ndealing with the relativistic bound state that is best described by the\nlight-cone momentum distribution of nucleons in the deuteron.

The relatively large masses of heavy\nquarks ensure that they are predominantly produced in the early stages of the\ncollision and probe the complete space-time evolution of the expanding medium.\nThe measurements of D-meson production in pp collisions provide an important\ntest of pQCD calculations and serve as an essential baseline for the\ncomprehensive studies in heavy-ion collisions. The study of D-meson production\nin p-Pb collisions is necessary to disentangle the cold nuclear matter effects\nfrom hot nuclear matter effects. The measurement of heavy-flavour production as\na function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions could\nprovide insight into the role of multi-parton interactions at LHC energies.\n  We present ALICE results on D-meson production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}\n=$ 7 TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm {NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV.

To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic\nfield within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic\nprofiles measured during the last free neutron oscillation experiment\n[conducted at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1990's]. We average over\nboth fluctuations in the magnetic field sampled by neutrons, and representative\nspectra of neutron speeds. We find that deviations from the quasi-free result\nfor the antineutron probability do not depend quadratically on $l$ (as a naive\nperturbative estimate would suggest) but increase only linearly with $l$. As\nregards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for\nexample, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite\ncompensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate\nthat their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical magnetic shielding. Our arguments suggest that, provided the\ndimensions of the propagation region are such that the ratio $l/D^{3/2}$ does\nnot exceed the value pertinent to the ILL experiment, and these spikes occur\nclose to either end of the propagation region, they can be neglected. We also\nestablish that any large magnetic field encountered after the propagation\nregion is exited will not diminish the probability for antineutron detection.\nFor the range of values of $l$ of most interest to the ESS experiment, it\nshould suffice to improve on the level of magnetic suppression achieved at the\nILL by a factor of two. \n\n"}

Next, the produced partons hadronize in a non-perturbative\nway later in a hadronization process. The jet fragmentation can be studied\nusing the method of two particle correlations.

When an incident wave scatters off of an obstacle, it is partially\nreflected and partially transmitted. Since the scatterer absorbs part of the\nincident energy, the reflected wave carries less energy than the incident one.\nHowever, if the obstacle is rotating, this process can be reversed and waves\ncan be amplified, extracting energy from the scatterer. Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance.

This model comes with an appealing custodial symmetry to explain the\nsmallness of the $\\rho$ parameter. However, the model cannot be renormalised\non-shell without breaking the custodial symmetry. Moreover, we find that it can\noften happen that the radiative corrections are so large that any consideration\nbased on a perturbative expansion appears to be meaningless: counter-terms to\nquartic couplings can become much larger than $4\\pi$ and/or two-loop mass\ncorrections can become larger than the one-loop ones. Therefore, conditions are\nnecessary to single out parameter regions which cannot be treated\nperturbatively. We propose and discuss different sets of such perturbativity\nconditions and show their impact on the parameter space of the Georgi-Machacek\nmodel. Moreover, the proposed conditions are general enough that they can be\napplied to other models as well. We also point out that the vacuum stability\nconstraints in the Georgi-Machacek model, which have so far only been applied\nat the tree level, receive crucial radiative corrections. We show that large\nregions of the parameter space which feature a stable electroweak vacuum at the\nloop level would have been - wrongly - ruled out by the tree-level conditions. \n\n"}

An optical unit consists of a flat, circular acrylic plate,\ncoated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), positioned near the photocathode of a\n20.2-cm diameter photomultiplier tube. The plate converts the ultra-violet\nscintillation photons from liquid argon into visible-spectrum photons to which\nthe cryogenic phototubes are sensitive.

We\ndevelop a GEANT4-based model of the optical unit, based on first principles,\nand obtain the range of probable values for the expected number of detected\nphotoelectrons ($N_{\\rm PE}$) given the known systematic errors on the\nsimulation parameters.

Ways of determining the unknown parameters of\nthree-neutrino oscillations are assessed, taking into account eight-fold\ndegeneracies in parameters that yield the same oscillation probabilities, as\nwell as ways to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale (from beta-decay,\nneutrinoless double-beta decay, large scale structure and Z-bursts).

Abstract: The ratio of the measured to the predicted standard model CC event rates in\nSNO will be 0.47 if no oscillations occur. The best-fit active oscillation\npredictions for the CC ratio are: 0.35-39 (MSW) and 0.38-42 (vacuum) (all for a\n5 MeV energy threshold), typically about 20% less than the no-oscillation\nexpectation. We calculate the predicted ratios for six active and sterile\nneutrino oscillation solutions allowed at 99% CL and determine the dependence\nof the ratios on energy threshold. If the high-energy anomaly observed by\nSuperKamiokande is due to an enhanced hep flux, MSW active solutions predict\nthat out of a total of 5000 CC events above 5 MeV in SNO between 49 and 54\nevents will be observed above 13 MeV whereas only 19 events are expected for\nno-oscillations and a nominal standard hep flux. \n\n"}

Hence it\nis important to examine in details uncertainties (and values) of inputs to the\nSSM. Currently, the largest fractional uncertainty is due to the new evaluation\nof the surface composition of the sun. We examine the nuclear input on the\nformation of solar 8B [S17(0)] and demonstrate that it is still quite uncertain\ndue to ill known slope of the measured astrophysical cross section factor and\nthus ill defined extrapolation to zero energy. This yields an additional\nreasonably estimated uncertainty due to extrapolation of +0.0 -3.0 eV-b (+0%\n-14%). Since a large discrepancy exists among measured as well as among\npredicted slopes, the value of S17(0) is dependent on the choice of data and\ntheory used to extrapolate S17(0). This situation must be alleviated by new\nmeasurement(s). The \"world average\" is driven by the Seattle result due to the\nvery small quoted uncertainty, which we however demonstrate it to be an\nover-estimated accuracy. We propose more realistic error bars for the Seattle\nresults based on the published Seattle data. \n\n"}

The calorimeter is calibrated at the low energy\nend with 6.13 MeV photons obtained from a liquid source system.

The axion is a pseudoscalar particle that was\nmotivated by theory thirty years ago, with the intention to solve the strong CP\nproblem. Together with the neutralino, the axion is one of the most promising\ndark matter candidates. The CAST experiment has been taking data during the\nlast two years, setting an upper limit on the coupling of axions to photons\nmore restrictive than from any other solar axion search in the mass range below\n0.1 eV. In 2005 CAST will enter a new experimental phase extending the\nsensitivity of the experiment to higher axion masses. The CAST experiment\nstrongly profits from technology developed for high energy physics and for\nX-ray astronomy: A superconducting prototype LHC magnet is used to convert\npotential axions to detectable X-rays in the 1-10 keV range via the inverse\nPrimakoff effect. The most sensitive detector system of CAST is a spin-off from\nspace technology, a Wolter I type X-ray optics in combination with a prototype\npn-CCD developed for ESA's XMM-Newton mission. As in other rare event searches,\nbackground suppression and a thorough shielding concept is essential to improve\nthe sensitivity of the experiment to the best possible. In this context CAST\noffers the opportunity to study the background of pn-CCDs and its long term\nbehavior in a terrestrial environment with possible implications for future\nspace applications. We will present a systematic study of the detector\nbackground of the pn-CCD of CAST based on the data acquired since 2002\nincluding preliminary results of our background simulations. \n\n"}
