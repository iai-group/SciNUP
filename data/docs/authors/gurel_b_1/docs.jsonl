First, we review how partial flag manifolds (generalizing\nGrassmannians) are described physically by nonabelian gauged linear sigma\nmodels, paying attention to realizations of tangent bundles and other aspects\npertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau\ncomplete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged\nlinear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in\nwhich the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is\nrealized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending\nprevious work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM\nexhibiting the same phenomenon.

Oancea, the same authors have\nrecently computed the Rabinowitz-Floer homology of the cotangent disk bundle\nD^*M of a closed manifold M, by establishing a long exact sequence. The first\naim of this paper is to present a chain level construction of this exact\nsequence. In fact, we show that this sequence is the long homology sequence\ninduced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes, which involves the Morse\nchain complex and the Morse differential complex of the energy functional for\nclosed geodesics on M. These chain maps are defined by considering spaces of\nsolutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation on half-cylinders, with suitable\nboundary conditions which couple them with the negative gradient flow of the\ngeodesic energy functional. The second aim is to generalize this construction\nto the case of a fiberwise uniformly convex compact subset W of T^*M whose\ninterior part contains a Lagrangian graph. Equivalently, W is the energy\nsublevel associated to an arbitrary Tonelli Lagrangian L on TM and to any\nenergy level which is larger than the strict Mane' critical value of L. In this\ncase, the energy functional for closed geodesics is replaced by the free period\nLagrangian action functional associated to a suitable calibration of L. An\nimportant issue in our analysis is to extend the uniform estimates for the\nsolutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation to Hamiltonians which have quadratic\ngrowth in the momenta. These uniform estimates are obtained by suitable\nversions of the Aleksandrov maximum principle. \n\n"}

The phase differences\namong the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle\nefficiency and hence the growth rate. Oscillations in the growth rate as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A\nvertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of\nsuper-Alfvenic accretion that is considered. In contrast, we find that a\nhorizontal magnetic field strongly increases the efficiencies of the vorticity\ncycles that bend the field lines, resulting in a significant increase of the\ngrowth rate if the different cycles are in phase. These magnetic effects are\nsignificant for large-scale modes if the Alfven velocity is a sizable fraction\nof the flow velocity. \n\n"}

The Star Formation History of\n  NGC 2976 Abstract: We present resolved stellar photometry of NGC 2976 obtained with the Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS) as part of the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury\n(ANGST) program. The data cover the radial extent of the major axis of the disk\nout to 6 kpc, or ~6 scale lengths. The outer disk was imaged to a depth of\nM_F606W ~ 1, and an inner field was imaged to the crowding limit at a depth of\nM_F606W ~ -1. Through detailed analysis and modeling of these CMDs we have\nreconstructed the star formation history of the stellar populations currently\nresiding in these portions of the galaxy, finding similar ancient populations\nat all radii but significantly different young populations at increasing radii.\nIn particular, outside of the well-measured break in the disk surface\nbrightness profile, the age of the youngest population increases with distance\nfrom the galaxy center, suggesting that star formation is shutting down from\nthe outside-in. We use our measured star formation history, along with H I\nsurface density measurements, to reconstruct the surface density profile of the\ndisk during previous epochs. Comparisons between the recovered star formation\nrates and reconstructed gas densities at previous epochs are consistent with\nstar formation following the Schmidt law during the past 0.5 Gyrs, but with a\ndrop in star formation efficiency at low gas densities, as seen in local\ngalaxies at the present day. The current rate and gas density suggest that\nrapid star formation in NGC 2976 is currently in the process of ceasing from\nthe outside-in due to gas depletion. This process of outer disk gas depletion\nand inner disk star formation was likely triggered by an interaction with the\ncore of the M81 group >~1 Gyr ago that stripped the gas from the galaxy halo\nand/or triggered gas inflow from the outer disk toward the galaxy center. \n\n"}

We find numerical solutions\nfor mass ratios q between 1e-3 and 1, starting at a small angular velocity for\nwhich tidal and rotational deformations are small, and following a sequence of\nincreasing angular velocities. Each series terminates at an appropriate ``Roche\nlimit'', above which no equilibrium solution can be found. Even though the\nRoche limit is crossed before the ``Roche lobe'' is filled, any further\nincrease in the angular velocity will result in mass-loss. For close,\ncomparable-mass binaries, we find that local deviations from ellipsoidal forms\nmay be as large as 10-20%, and departures from Keplerian rotation are\nsignificant. We compute the light curves that arise from our equilibrium\nconfigurations, assuming their distance is >>1 AU (e.g. in the Kuiper Belt).

Magnetic properties of this compound can\nbe described by a spin-1/2 anisotropic honeycomb lattice model with the\naveraged coupling \\bar J1=60-66 K. The low symmetry of the crystal structure\nleads to two inequivalent couplings J1 and J1', but this weak spatial\nanisotropy does not affect the essential physics of the honeycomb spin lattice.\nThe structural realization of the honeycomb lattice is highly non-trivial: the\nleading interactions J1 and J1' run via double bridges of VO4 tetrahedra\nbetween spatially separated Cu atoms, while the interactions between structural\nnearest neighbors are negligible. The non-negligible inter-plane coupling\nJperp~15 K gives rise to the long-range magnetic ordering at TN~26 K.

The search\nfor WIMPs requires the capability to detect the recoiling nuclei that result\nwhen these particles interact with normal matter. In order to make meaningful\nstatements about an observed signal, or lack thereof, the energy scale of\nrecoiling nuclei in LXe must be known.

This extends and unifies all\npreviously known monotonicity results. We also analyze the case where the\nmonotonicity inequality holds with equality, and extend Petz' reversibility\ntheorem for a large class of f-divergences and other distinguishability\nmeasures.

As the resonance is broad, special attention to finite-volume\neffects has to be paid, because no sharp resonance signal as from avoided level\ncrossing can be expected.

We focus on the structures and dynamics of\nthis prominence before the eruption. This prominence contains two parts: an\nactive region part containing mainly horizontal threads, and a quiet Sun part\ncontaining mainly vertical threads. On the northern side of the prominence\nchannel, both AIA and EUVI observe bright features which appear to be the lower\nlegs of loops that go above then join in the filament. Filament materials are\nobserved to frequently eject horizontally from the active region part to the\nquiet Sun part. This ejection results in the formation of a dense-column\nstructure (concentration of dark vertical threads) near the border between the\nactive region and the quiet Sun. Using the flux rope insertion method, we\ncreate non-linear force-free field models based on SDO/HMI line-of-sight\nmagnetograms. A key feature of these models is that the flux rope has\nconnections with the surroundings photosphere, so its axial flux varies along\nthe filament path.

The secure d.o.f.\nof the canonical Gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero. It has been\nknown that a strictly positive secure d.o.f. can be obtained in the Gaussian\nwiretap channel by using a helper which sends structured cooperative signals.\nWe show that the exact secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a\nhelper is 1/2. Our achievable scheme is based on real interference alignment\nand cooperative jamming, which renders the message signal and the cooperative\njamming signal separable at the legitimate receiver, but aligns them perfectly\nat the eavesdropper preventing any reliable decoding of the message signal. Our\nconverse is based on two key lemmas.

Abstract: Current experimental constraints on a large parameter space in supersymmetric\nmodels rely on the large missing energy signature.

However, if\nthe R-parity is violated, the lightest neutralino decays into the standard\nmodel particles and the missing energy cut is not efficient anymore.

We introduce the notion of an *implicit atlas* on a\nmoduli space, which is (roughly) a convenient system of local\nfinite-dimensional reductions. We present a general intrinsic strategy for\nconstructing a canonical implicit atlas on any moduli space of\npseudo-holomorphic curves. The main technical step in applying this strategy in\nany particular setting is to prove appropriate gluing theorems. We require only\ntopological gluing theorems, that is, smoothness of the transition maps between\ngluing charts need not be addressed.

We use multiwavelength COSMOS photometry, HST-ACS I-band\nimaging and optical zCOSMOS spectroscopy to derive the main global properties\nof EELGs, such as sizes, masses, SFRs, reliable metallicities from both\n\"direct\" and \"strong-line\" methods. The EELGs are compact (R_50 ~ 1.3 kpc),\nlow-mass (log(M*/Msol)~7-10) galaxies forming stars at unusually high specific\nSFR (log(sSFR/yr) up to ~ -7) compared to main sequence SFGs of the same\nstellar mass and redshift. At UV wavelengths, the EELGs are luminous and show\nhigh surface brightness and include strong Ly$\\alpha$ emitters, as revealed by\nGALEX spectroscopy. We show that zCOSMOS EELGs are high-ionization,\nlow-metallicity systems, with median 12+log(O/H)=8.16, including a handful of\nextremely metal-deficient galaxies (<10% solar). While ~80% of the EELGs show\nnon-axisymmetric morphologies, including clumpy and tadpole galaxies, we find\nthat ~29% of them show additional low surface-brightness features, which\nstrongly suggest recent or ongoing interactions. As star-forming dwarfs in the\nlocal Universe, EELGs are most often found in relative isolation.

Under a potential outcome framework (Huang, Gilbert and Janes\n[Biometrics 68 (2012) 687-696]), a predictive biomarker is considered a\npredictor for a desirable treatment benefit (defined by comparing potential\noutcomes for different treatments) and evaluated using familiar concepts in\nprediction and classification. However, the desired treatment benefit is\nunobservable because each patient can receive only one treatment in a typical\nstudy. Huang et al. overcome this problem by assuming monotonicity of potential\noutcomes, with one treatment dominating the other in all patients. Motivated by\nan HIV example that appears to violate the monotonicity assumption, we propose\na different approach based on covariates and random effects for evaluating\npredictive biomarkers under the potential outcome framework. Under the proposed\napproach, the parameters of interest can be identified by assuming conditional\nindependence of potential outcomes given observed covariates, and a sensitivity\nanalysis can be performed by incorporating an unobserved random effect that\naccounts for any residual dependence. Application of this approach to the\nmotivating example shows that baseline viral load and CD4 cell count are both\nuseful as predictive biomarkers for choosing antiretroviral drugs for\ntreatment-naive patients. \n\n"}

However, the repair data\nsent from a helper node to another failed node may vary with different repair\ngroups or the sets of helper nodes, which would inevitably leak more data\ninformation to the eavesdropper and even render the storage system unable to\nmaintain any data secrecy.\n  In this paper, we introduce and study a special category of MSCR codes,\ntermed \"\\emph{stable}\" MSCR codes, where the repair data from any one helper\nnode to any one failed node is required to be independent of the repair group\nor the set of helper nodes.

In oblivious transfer protocols a user sends\none or more messages to a receiver, while the sender remains oblivious as to\nwhich messages have been received. Protocols for oblivious transfer cannot\nexist in a classical or fully-quantum world, but can be implemented by\nrestricting the users' power.\n  The isolated qubits model is a cryptographic model in which users are\nrestricted to single-qubit operations and are not allowed to use entangling\noperations. Furthermore, all parties are allowed to store qubits for a long\ntime before measuring them.\n  In this model, a secure single-bit one-out-of-two randomised oblivious\ntransfer protocol was recently presented by Liu.

The field cooled (FC) and zero\nfield cooled (ZFC) magnetization exhibit a thermomagnetic irreversibility and\nthe ac susceptibility show a frequency dependent peak at the ferromagnetic\nordering temperature (T$_C$$\\approx$203~K) of the clusters. These features\nindicate about the presence of a non-equilibrium state below T$_C$. In the\nnon-equilibrium state, the dynamic scaling of the imaginary part of ac\nsusceptibility and the static scaling of the nonlinear susceptibility clearly\nestablish a spin-glass like cooperative freezing of ferromagnetic clusters at\n200.9(2)~K. The existence of spin-glass like freezing of ferromagnetic clusters\nis further substantiated by the ZFC aging and memory experiments.

Typically this problem is confounded with the\nproblem of graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), because both problems\nrepresent the data as a graph and predict the missing class labels of nodes.\nHowever, not all graphs are created equally. In GSSL a graph is constructed,\noften from independent data, based on similarity. As such, edges tend to\nconnect instances with the same class label. Relational networks, however, can\nbe more heterogeneous and edges do not always indicate similarity. For\ninstance, instead of links being more likely to connect nodes with the same\nclass label, they may occur more frequently between nodes with different class\nlabels (link-heterogeneity). Or nodes with the same class label do not\nnecessarily have the same type of connectivity across the whole network\n(class-heterogeneity), e.g. in a network of sexual interactions we may observe\nlinks between opposite genders in some parts of the graph and links between the\nsame genders in others. Performing classification in networks with different\ntypes of heterogeneity is a hard problem that is made harder still when we do\nnot know a-priori the type or level of heterogeneity. Here we present two\nscalable approaches for graph-based semi-supervised learning for the more\ngeneral case of relational networks. We demonstrate these approaches on\nsynthetic and real-world networks that display different link patterns within\nand between classes. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, ours give better\nclassification performance without prior knowledge of how classes interact. In\nparticular, our two-step label propagation algorithm gives consistently good\naccuracy and runs on networks of over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges in\naround 12 seconds. \n\n"}

A novel implementation of Super-Massive Black Hole (SMBH)\nformation and evolution is used, as in Tremmel et al.(2015, 2016), allowing to\nexplicitly follow SMBH dynamics at the center of galaxies.

Milky Way-like galaxies form a shallower DM density profile in SIDM\nthan they do in CDM, with differences already at 20 kpc scales. This\ndemonstrates that even for the most massive spirals the effect of SIDM\ndominates over the adiabatic contraction due to baryons. Strikingly, the\ndynamics of SMBHs differs in the SIDM and reference CDM case.

Knowing the size and/or diameter is a prerequisite of many\ndistributed network algorithms. A radio network is a collection of nodes, with\nwireless transmission and receiving capabilities. It is modeled as a simple\nundirected graph whose nodes communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round,\na node can either transmit a message to all its neighbors, or stay silent and\nlisten. At the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in\na round $i$, if $v$ listens in round $i$, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that\ntransmits in round $i$. If $v$ listens in a round, and multiple neighbors of\n$v$ transmit in this round, a collision occurs at $v$. If $v$ transmits in a\nround, it does not hear anything. If listening nodes can distinguish collision\nfrom silence, we say that the network has collision detection capability,\notherwise there is no collision detection.

Strong\nflares also show a larger change of flux, but there is no dependence of the\nmagnetic flux change on the heliocentric angle. The mean rate of change of\nflare-related magnetic field changes is 20.7 Mx cm$^{-2}$ min$^{-1}$. The\nnumber of permanent changes decays exponentially with distance from the\npolarity inversion line. The frequency of the strength of permanent changes\ndecreases exponentially, and permanent changes up to 750 Mx cm$^{-2}$ were\nobserved.

To improve the classification performance of traditional CNNs, a new\n\"Multi-function Convolutional Neural Network\" (MCNN) is created by using\ndifferent activation functions for different neurons. For $n$ neurons and $m$\ndifferent activation functions, there are a total of $m^n-m$ MCNNs and only $m$\ntraditional CNNs. Therefore, the best model is very likely to be chosen from\nMCNNs because there are $m^n-2m$ more MCNNs than traditional CNNs.

We propose a\nnew scenario whereby a collision between a metal-poor Ter 5 and a giant\nmolecular cloud (GMC) serves as a catalyst for the generation of a super-solar\npopulation of stars. Using numerical simulations of this new \"GC-GMC\" collision\nscenario we demonstrate that, within a time frame of several Gyrs, our\nsynthetic Ter 5 was capable of interacting with a metal-rich GMC in the central\nregion of the Galaxy. As a consequence of this, our simulated globular cluster\n(GC) is able to capture enough gas from the colliding GMC to form a new\npopulation of metal-rich stars.

In\nthis paper, we address this problem by learning view-invariant representations\nhierarchically using a novel method, referred to as Joint Sparse Representation\nand Distribution Adaptation (JSRDA). To obtain robust and informative feature\nrepresentations, we first incorporate a sample-affinity matrix into the\nmarginalized stacked denoising Autoencoder (mSDA) to obtain shared features,\nwhich are then combined with the private features. In order to make the feature\nrepresentations of videos across views transferable, we then learn a\ntransferable dictionary pair simultaneously from pairs of videos taken at\ndifferent views to encourage each action video across views to have the same\nsparse representation. However, the distribution difference across views still\nexists because a unified subspace where the sparse representations of one\naction across views are the same may not exist when the view difference is\nlarge. Therefore, we propose a novel unsupervised distribution adaptation\nmethod that learns a set of projections that project the source and target\nviews data into respective low-dimensional subspaces where the marginal and\nconditional distribution differences are reduced simultaneously.

We propose a simple iterative training procedure that\nleverages a duality of translations directly generated by the system for the\nzero-shot directions. The translations produced by the system (sub-optimal\nsince they contain mixed language from the shared vocabulary), are then used\ntogether with the original parallel data to feed and iteratively re-train the\nmultilingual network. Over time, this allows the system to learn from its own\ngenerated and increasingly better output. Our approach shows to be effective in\nimproving the two zero-shot directions of our multilingual model. In\nparticular, we observed gains of about 9 BLEU points over a baseline\nmultilingual model and up to 2.08 BLEU over a pivoting mechanism using two\nbilingual models.

The recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups has\ndemonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. In\nthe currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that the\nshear field contains unexpected modes, so-called B-modes, which are thought to\nbe unaccountable for by lensing. B-modes can in principle be generated by an\nintrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or may\nsignify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. In this\npaper we show that B-modes in fact {\\it are produced} by lensing itself. The\neffect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which in\nparticular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift.\nAfter presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear field into\nE- and B-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlation\nfunctions for a clustered source distribution. Numerical and analytical\nestimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resulting\nB-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but its\nrelative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, with\ncomparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds.

The derivation incorporates the metallicity dependence\nof chromospheric emission at a given age, and corrections to account for\nincompleteness, scale height-age correlations, and stellar evolutionary\neffects. The results show that the Milky Way has undergone fluctuations in the\nglobal star formation rate with amplitudes greater than a factor of 2-3 on\ntimescales less than 0.2-1 Gyr. The actual history is likely to be more bursty\nthan found here because of the smearing effect of age uncertainties.

It is suggested that the\ncolor-octet NRQCD matrix elements should be modified by adding a gauge link to\nrestore the factorization.

The intermediate N(1440)\n(P$_{11}$) resonance is excited by the short-range exchange mechanisms, while\nthe N(1535) ($S_{11}$) and N(1520) ($D_{13}$) resonances are excited by $\\eta$\nand $\\rho$ meson exchange, respectively. The $P_{11}$ increases the calculated\ncross section, whereas the $S_{11}$ and $D_{13}$ resonances decrease it. The\ncalculation takes full account of the initial and final state interactions. \n\n"}

The effect is greatest when the grooves are\naligned with the flow. The pressure difference between the liquid and the gas\nin the grooves causes a curvature of the liquid surface resisted by surface\ntension.
