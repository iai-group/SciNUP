This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate\nhydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.\nEvent-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the\nnon-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and\nstring fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional\nideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons\nvia the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation\nwithin UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a\nrealistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic\ntransport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same\ninitial conditions and freeze-out procedure. The effects of the change in the\nunderlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory\n- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are\ninvestigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the\nbaryon density and particle yields are discussed. We find that the final pion\nand proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the\nisentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are\nenhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution. The\nresults of the different calculations for the mean transverse mass excitation\nfunction, rapidity and transverse mass spectra for different particle species\nat three different beam energies are discussed in the context of the available\ndata. \n\n"}

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts.

When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,\nradioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order\nto control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique\nthat uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur\nclose to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The\ncomposite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy\nabsorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers\nthat act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the\nanalysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields.

Modification of\nheavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision\nscaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor\n(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.\n  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding\nR_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.\n  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor\nmesons into negative muons.

For the first\nproblem where experimental data have already been observed, the classical\nstatistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the\nparameter {\\Delta}m^2_{32}. These intervals are deduced from the parent\ndistribution of the estimation of {\\Delta}m^2_{32} based on experimental data.\nDue to existing experimental constraints on |{\\Delta}m^2_{32}|, the estimation\nof {\\Delta}m^2_{32} is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution (a\nBinomial distribution with 1 trial) rather than a Gaussian distribution.\nTherefore, the Feldman-Cousins approach needs to be used instead of the\nGaussian approximation in constructing confidence intervals.

In particular, it should be valuable to\ninvestigate the high-energy exclusive processes which include generalized\nparton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs). The\nGPDs and GDAs contain momentum distributions of partons and form factors. We\nfound that the exotic nature appears in momentum distributions of quarks as\nsuggested by the constituent-counting rule and in the form factors associated\nwith exotic hadron sizes and the number of constituents.

For example, the\nGDAs contain information on a time-like form factor of the energy-momentum\ntensor of a hadron h. We show that the cross section of e gamma -> e+hbar h is\nsensitive to the exotic signature by looking at the hbar h invariant-mass\ndependence by taking light hadrons, h=f_0 (980) and a_0 (980).

We fill this gap by\nperforming an optimization and statistical analysis of all the low-energy\nconstants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Our optimization protocol\ncorresponds to a simultaneous fit to scattering and bound-state observables in\nthe pion-nucleon, nucleon-nucleon, and few-nucleon sectors, thereby utilizing\nthe full model capabilities of chiEFT. We study the effect on other observables\nby demonstrating error-propagation methods that can easily be adopted by future\nworks. We employ mathematical optimization and implement automatic\ndifferentiation to attain efficient and machine-precise first- and second-order\nderivatives of the objective function with respect to the LECs. We use\npower-counting arguments to estimate the systematic uncertainty that is\ninherent to chiEFT and we construct chiral interactions at different orders\nwith quantified uncertainties.

First, techniques for measuring and\nremoving false asymmetries arising from helicity-correlated electron beam\nproperties at the few ppb level are discussed. Second, as a parity-violating\nexperiment, Qweak relies on accurate knowledge of electron beam polarimetry. To\nhelp address the requirement of accurate polarimetry, a Compton polarimeter\nbuilt specifically for Qweak. Compton polarimetry requires accurate knowledge\nof laser polarization inside a Fabry-Perot cavity enclosed in the electron beam\npipe. A new technique was developed for Qweak that nearly eliminates this\nsystematic error. \n\n"}

Drag-free technology is one of the\ntechnologies that is fundamental for LISA-Pathfinder, an ESA mission whose\nlaunch is planned for the end of September 2015. A purely drag-free object is\ndefined by the absence of all external forces other than gravity. This is not a\nnatural condition and thus requires a proper design of a spacecraft, whose core\nis an object in free-fall, called test mass (TM). The purity of the drag-free\norbit depends on the spacecraft capability of protecting the TM from\ndisturbances, which indeed has limitations. According to a NASA study, such a\nconcept provides substantial economies for LEO satellites.

QCD is characterised by two emergent\nphenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are\nexpressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion\nproperties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a\nNambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in\nNature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to\nrevealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental\nprogress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting\nboth improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved\nin the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.\nBoth challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a\ntheoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB\nworks to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,\nensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all\nthe mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and\nneutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton\ndistribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form\nfactor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions\nfor the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by\nexperiments planned at JLab 12. Those experiments will extend precise\ncharged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in\nvalidating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the\nnonperturbative and perturbative domains, and thereby reaching a goal that has\nlong driven hadro-particle physics. \n\n"}

Jets are collimated sprays of charged and\nneutral particles, which are produced in the fragmentation of hard scattered\npartons in the early stage of the collision. The measurement of nuclear\nmodification of charged jet spectra in p-Pb collisions provides an important\nway of quantifying the effects of cold nuclear matter in the initial state on\njet production, fragmentation, and hadronization. Unlike in Pb-Pb collisions,\nmodifications of jet production due to hot nuclear matter effects are not\nexpected to occur in p-Pb collisions. Therefore, measurements of nuclear\nmodifications in charged jet spectra in p-Pb collisions (commonly known as\n$R_\\mathrm{pPb}$) can be used to isolate and quantify cold nuclear matter\neffects. Potential nuclear effects are expected to be more pronounced in more\ncentral p-Pb collisions due to a higher probability of an interaction between\nthe proton and the lead-nucleus. To measure the centrality dependence of\ncharged jet spectra, it is crucial to use a reliable definition of event\ncentrality, which ALICE developed utilizing the Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC). \n\n"}

The collectivity depends on the details of\nthe shell structure around the Fermi levels, in particular the presence of the\norbitals that have the enhanced transition matrix elements of the non-axial\nquadrupole excitation. Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation\nenergy of the $\\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$. Purpose: In the present work, by studying\nsystematically the microscopic structure of the $\\gamma$ vibration in the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes with $N=98-114$, we try to understand the mechanism of\nthe observed softening. Methods: The low-frequency modes of excitation in the\nneutron-rich rare-earth nuclei are described based on nuclear\ndensity-functional theory. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals\n(EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for the ground states and in\nthe Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) for the excitations.\nResults: The lowering of the excitation energy around $N=106$ is reproduced\nwell by employing the SkM* and SLy4 functionals.

Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion\ncoefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order\nexpansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical\npotentials less then twice the temperature ($\\mu_B\\le 2T$). The fourth-order\nequation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in\nheavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim\n12$ GeV.

Since nuclear targets are used\nthis requires a good understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions.

This paper aims for a coherent view on all charged current charged\npion production data that are avaible from the experiments MiniBooNE, the near\ndetector experiment at T2K and MINERvA.

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

For these devices, the main effect caused by the neutron fluence is\na linear increase of the leakage current. In this paper, we present a technique\nthat provides a partial recovery of the neutron damage on SiPMs by means of an\nElectrical Induced Annealing. Tests were performed, at the temperature of 20C,\non a sample of three SiPM arrays (2x3) of 6 mm^2 cells with 50 um pixel sizes:\ntwo from Hamamatsu and one from SensL.

The correlations can be treated in a\ntransverse-momentum-dependent framework where sensitivity to non-Abelian\neffects from color are predicted. These measurements are the first ever to\nsearch for experimental evidence of these entangled states and will help\nestablish color flow in hadronic interactions as a new area of focus within QCD\nresearch.

For the latter, the determination of the\ncharge radius involves an extrapolation of the experimental form factor to zero\nmomentum transfer.\n  Purpose: To estimate the proton radius by introducing a novel non-parametric\napproach to model the electric form factor of the proton.\n  Methods: Within a Bayesian paradigm, we develop a model flexible enough to\nfit the data without any parametric assumptions on the form factor. The\nBayesian estimation is guided by imposing only two physical constraints on the\nform factor: (a) its value at zero momentum transfer (normalization) and (b)\nits overall shape, assumed to be a monotonically decreasing function of the\nmomentum transfer. Variants of these assumptions are explored to assess the\nimpact of these constraints.\n  Results: So far our results are inconclusive in regard to the proton puzzle,\nas they depend on both, the assumed constrains and the range of experimental\ndata used. For example, if only low momentum-transfer data is used, adopting\nonly the normalization constraint provides a value compatible with the smaller\nmuonic result, while imposing only the shape constraint favors the larger\nelectronic value.\n  Conclusions: We have presented a novel technique to estimate the proton\nradius from electron scattering data based on a non-parametric Gaussian\nprocess. We have shown the impact of the physical constraints imposed on the\nform factor and of the range of experimental data used. In this regard, we are\nhopeful that as this technique is refined and with the anticipated new results\nfrom the PRad experiment, we will get closer to resolve of the puzzle. \n\n"}

Abstract: The challenge of demonstrating that the matter produced in heavy ion\ncollisions is a deconfined quark-gluon plasma, as predicted by lattice QCD\ncalculations, is the challenge of measuring the number of thermodynamic degrees\nof freedom \\nu ~ \\epsilon/T^4 at the time t0 at which the matter comes into\napproximate local thermal equilibrium and begins to behave like a hydrodynamic\nfluid. Data from experiments done at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have\nbeen used to estimate t0 and to put a lower bound on the energy density\n\\epsilon(t0). However, measuring \\nu has seemed out of reach, because no\ncurrent data serve even as qualitative proxies for the temperature T(t0). We\npoint out that \\nu may equally appropriately be defined via \\nu ~s^4/epsilon^3,\nwhere s is the entropy density, which can be estimated from the measured final\nstate entropy. This estimate is based on the testable assumption of an\nisentropic expansion. The observation of jet quenching has the potential to\nprovide an upper bound on the energy density at early times.

A statistical model assuming chemical\nequilibrium and local strangeness conservation (i.e. strangeness conservation\nper collision) explains most of the observed features.\n  Emphasis is put onto the study of $K^+$ and $K^-$ emission at low incident\nenergies. In the framework of this statistical model it is shown that the\nexperimentally observed equality of $K^+$ and $K^-$ rates at\n``threshold-corrected'' energies $\\sqrt{s} - \\sqrt{s_{th}}$ is due to a\ncrossing of two excitation functions. Furthermore, the independence of the\n$K^+/K^-$ ratio on the number of participating nucleons observed between SIS\nand RHIC is consistent with this model.\n  It is demonstrated that the $K^-$ production at SIS energies occurs\npredominantly via strangeness exchange and that this channel is approaching\nchemical equilibrium. The observed maximum in the $K^+/\\pi^+$ excitation\nfunction is also seen in the ratio of strange to non-strange particle\nproduction. The appearance of this maximum around 30 $A\\cdot$GeV is due to the\nenergy dependence of the chemical freeze-out parameters $T$ and $\\mu_B$. \n\n"}

Among the effects that can\ncomplicate the interpretation of elliptic flow measurements are azimuthal\ncorrelations that are unrelated to the reaction plane (non-flow correlations).\nUsing data for Au + Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130 GeV from the STAR TPC,\nit is found that four-particle correlation analyses can reliably separate flow\nand non-flow correlation signals. The latter account for on average about 15%\nof the observed second-harmonic azimuthal correlation, with the largest\nrelative contribution for the most peripheral and the most central collisions.\nThe results are also corrected for the effect of flow variations within\ncentrality bins.

{"id": "physics/0603231", "contents": "Title: High Voltage Test Apparatus for a Neutron EDM Experiment and Lower Limit\n  on the Dielectric Strength of Liquid Helium at Large Volumes Abstract: A new search for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron is\nunderway using ultracold neutrons produced and held in a bath of superfluid\nhelium. Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/0701251", "contents": "Title: Compensation of eddy-current-induced magnetic field transients in a MOT Abstract: The design and implementation of a current driver for the quadrupole coil of\na magneto-optical trap are presented. The control and the power stages of the\ndriver, both based on a push-pull configuration with high-speed transistors,\nare separated, allowing for a protection of the control electronics. Moreover,\nthe coil current can be set by an analog voltage, a feature that makes possible\nboth fast and adiabatic switching of the quadrupole magnetic field. In order to\ncompensate magnetic field transients induced by eddy currents, the driver\nallows a quick reversal of the quadrupole coil current providing in such a way\nthe required magnetic flux compensation. From a fit to the measured magnetic\nfield transients, we have extracted the decay constants which confirm the\nefficiency of the compensation. Furthermore, we measured the influence of eddy\ncurrents on a sample of cold caesium atoms, testing at the same time the\nultimate performance of the driver for our applications. The results show that\nthe implemented electronic circuit is able to reduce substantially the\ntransient effects with switching times of the magnetic field below 100\nmicroseconds. \n\n"}
