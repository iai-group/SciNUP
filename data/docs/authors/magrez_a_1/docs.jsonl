The idea is that\nif Fermi surface contours coincide when shifted along the observed CDW wave\nvector, then the CDW is considered to be nesting-derived.

To\nthis end our ab initio quantum transport program ALACANT which combines the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) with density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations has been extended to describe spin-polarized systems.\nWe present calculations on nanocontacts made of Ni as a prototypical magnetic\nmaterial. We find that atomic disorder in the contact region strongly reduces\nthe a priori high spin-polarization of the conductance leading to rather\nmoderate values of the so-called ballistic magnetoresistance (BMR). On the\nother hand, we show that the adsorption of oxygen in the contact region could\nstrongly enhance the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and thus BMR\nby eliminating the spin-unpolarized s-channel. Finally, we show that short\natomic Pt chains suspended between the tips of a nanocontact are magnetic in\ncontrast to bulk Pt. However, this emergent nanoscale magnetism barely affects\nthe overall conductance of the nanocontact making it thus difficult to\ndemonstrate by simple conductance measurements. In conclusion, we find that\nspin-transport through atomic-scale conductors is quite sensitive to the actual\natomic structure as well as to the chemical composition of the conductor.

Interfacing the\nrealism of density-functional based methods with the virtues of Hubbard-like\nHamiltonians, requires the joint ab initio construction of transfer integrals\nand interaction matrix elements (like the Hubbard U) in a localized basis set.\nIn this work, we employ the scheme of maximally localized Wannier functions and\nthe constrained random phase approximation to create effective low-energy\nmodels for Manganese monoxide, and track their evolution under external\npressure. We find that in the low pressure antiferromagnetic phase, the\ncompression results in an increase of the bare Coulomb interaction for specific\norbitals. As we rationalized in recent model considerations [Phys. Rev.

Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low\ntemperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a\npolarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \\; \\mu m$ from the center.

In this\npaper we show how these effects can be used to reliably switch perpendicularly\nmagnetized layers and to move domain walls. A drift-diffusion treatment of the\nanomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin\ncurrents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In\nsystems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane\nelectric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the\nother, creating spin transfer torques. Unlike the related spin Hall effect in\nnon-magnetic materials, the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance allow control of the orientation of the injected spins, and\nhence torques, by changing the direction of the magnetization in the injecting\nlayer. The torques on one layer show a rich angular dependence as a function of\nthe orientation of the magnetization in the other layer. The control of the\ntorques afforded by changing the orientation of the magnetization in a fixed\nlayer makes it possible to reliably switch a perpendicularly magnetized free\nlayer. Our calculated critical current densities for a representative\nCoFe/Cu/FePt structure show that the switching can be efficient for appropriate\nmaterial choices.

Because of this, the\ncritical temperature is exponentially suppressed compared to the microscopic\nenergy scales. On the other hand, pairing electrons around a dispersionless\n(flat) energy band leads to very strong superconductivity, with a mean-field\ncritical temperature linearly proportional to the microscopic coupling\nconstant.

However, the\ntopological charges associated with Na$_{3}$Bi and Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ are not\nclarified yet. In this work, we identify the topological charge of\nthree-dimensional Dirac points. It is found that although the simultaneous\npresence of the time-reversal and inversion symmetries forces the net chiral\ncharge to vanish, a Dirac point can carry another quantized topological charge\nwhen an additional rotation symmetry is considered. Two different classes of\nDirac semimetals are identified depending on the nature of the rotation\nsymmetries. First, the conventional symmorphic rotational symmetry which\ncommutes with the inversion gives rise to the class I Dirac semimetals having a\npair of Dirac points on the rotation axes. Since the topological charges of\neach pair of Dirac points have the opposite sign, a pair-creation or a\npair-annihilation is required to change the number of Dirac points in the\nmomentum space. On the other hand, the class II Dirac semimetals possess a\nsingle isolated Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum, which is\nprotected by a screw rotation. The non-symmorphic nature of screw rotations\nallows the anti-commutation relation between the rotation and inversion\nsymmetries, which enables to circumvent the doubling of the number of Dirac\npoints and create a single Dirac point at the Brillouin zone boundary. \n\n"}

One is the resistivity plateau at low temperatures as\nobserved in several topological insulators (TIs), another is the negative\nmagnetoresistance (MR) when the applied magnetic field is parallel to the\ncurrent direction as observed in several topological semimetals (TSMs)\nincluding Dirac semimetals (DSMs) and Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Usually, these\ntwo exotic phenomena emerge in distinct materials with or without time reversal\nsymmetry (TRS), respectively. Here we report the discovery of a new member in\nTSMs, TaSb2, which clearly exhibits both of these phenomena in a single\nmaterial. This compound crystallizes in a base-centered monoclinic,\ncentrosymmetric structure, and is metallic with a low carrier density in the\nzero field. While applying magnetic field it exhibits insulating behavior\nbefore appearance of a resistivity plateau below Tc =13 K. In the plateau\nregime, the ultrahigh carrier mobility and extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) for\nthe field perpendicular to the current are observed as in DSMs and WSMs, in\naddition to a quantum oscillation behavior with non-trivial Berry phases. In\ncontrast to the most known DSMs and WSMs, the negative MR in TaSb2 does not\nsaturate up to 9 T, which, together with the almost linear Hall resistivity,\nmanifests itself an electron-hole non-compensated TMS. These findings indicate\nthat the resistivity plateau could be a generic feature of topology-protected\nmetallic states even in the absence of TRS and compatible with the negative MR\ndepending on the field direction. Our experiment extends a materials basis\nrepresented by TaSb2 as a new platform for future theoretical investigations\nand device applications of topological materials. \n\n"}

(ii) The correlated insulating phase just after the normal band\ninsulator corresponds to the ordered phase of slave Ising spins (Ising\ninsulator) where charge configuration is controlled by an underlying Ising\nvariable which indirectly couples to external magnetic field and hence gives\nrise to additional temperature and field dependence in semiconducting\nproperties.

We review our recent works on quantum transport\nin topological semimetals, according to the strength of the magnetic field. At\nweak magnetic fields, there are competitions between the positive\nmagnetoresistivity induced by the weak anti-localization effect and negative\nmagnetoresistivity related to the nontrivial Berry curvature. We propose a\nfitting formula for the magnetoconductivity of the weak anti-localization.

Here, we combine\nextensive magnetotransport experiments and first-principles electronic\nstructure calculations on a non-magnetic tritelluride LaTe$_{3}$ single crystal\nto uncover phenomena rare in CDW systems: $(i)$ hump-like feature in the\ntemperature dependence of resistivity at low temperature under application of\nmagnetic field, which moves to higher temperature with increasing field\nstrength, $(ii)$ highly anisotropic large transverse magnetoresistance (MR)\nupon rotation of magnetic field about current parallel to crystallographic\nc-axis, (iii) anomalously large positive MR with spike-like peaks at\ncharacteristic angles when the angle between current and field is varied in the\nbc-plane, (iv) extreme sensitivity of the angular variation of MR on field and\ntemperature. Moreover, our Hall measurement reveals remarkably high carrier\nmobility $\\sim$ 33000 cm$^{2}$/Vs, which is comparable to that observed in some\ntopological semimetals.

The interaction\nHamiltonian, derived from an action principle that classically generates the\nPeach-Koehler force, is a power series of creation and annihilation operators.\nThe leading term is quadratic, and keeping only this term the observable\nquantities of scattering processes are computed to all orders in perturbation\ntheory. The resulting theory is characterized by the magnitude of $kL$, with\n$k$ the wavenumber of an incident phonon. The theory is solved for arbitrary\n$kL$, and different limits are explored. A significant result at this level is\nthe scattering cross section for phonons by dislocation segments. This cross\nsection has a much richer structure than the linear-in-frequency behavior that\nis inferred from scattering by an infinite, static, dislocation. When many\ndislocations are present, an effective mass operator is computed in the Weak\nand Independent Scattering Approximation. The contribution of the cubic terms\nis computed to leading order in perturbation theory, allowing for a comparison\nof the scattering of a phonon by excited dislocations and three-phonon\nscattering, as well as studying the dependence of scattering amplitudes on the\ntemperature of the solid.

The orbital degree of freedom has until recently\nremained hidden, since it does not couple directly to most of experimental\nprobes. Development of synchrotron light sources has changed the situation; by\nthe resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) technique the orbital ordering has\nsuccessfully been observed . In this article, we review progress in the recent\nstudies of RXS in manganites. We start with a detailed review of the RXS\nexperiments applied to the orbital ordered manganites and other correlated\nelectron systems. We derive the scattering cross section of RXS where the\ntensor character of the atomic scattering factor (ASF) with respect to the\nx-ray polarization is stressed. Microscopic mechanisms of the anisotropic\ntensor character of ASF is introduced and numerical results of ASF and the\nscattering intensity are presented. The azimuthal angle scan is a unique\nexperimental method to identify RXS from the orbital degree of freedom. A\ntheory of the azimuthal angle and polarization dependence of the RXS intensity\nis presented. The theoretical results show good agreement with the experiments\nin manganites.

For fractional\nfilling factors nu=1/3 and 2/5 of the first Landau level, fractional charges\nq=e/3 and e/5, respectively, were measured. We investigate here the interaction\nof e/3 quasiparticles with a strong backscatterer and find unexpected results.\nWhen a weak backscatterer is introduced in the path of an otherwise noiseless\ncurrent of quasiparticles, stochastic partitioning of the quasiparticles takes\nplace and shot noise proportional to their charge appears. Specifically, at\nnu=1/3, noise corresponding to q=e/3 appears. However, the measured charge\nincreases monotonically as backscattering becomes stronger, approaching\nasymptotically q=e. In other words, only electrons, or alternatively, three\nbunched quasiparticles, tunnel through high potential barriers when impinged by\na noiseless current of quasiparticles. Here we show that such bunching of\nquasiparticles by a strong backscatterer depends on the average occupation\n(dilution) of the impinging quasiparticle current. For a very dilute impinging\ncurrent, bunching ceases altogether and the transferred charge approaches\nq=e/3.

In the id-case, we find that the coupling to disorder renders the\norder parameter dynamics diffusive but otherwise leaves much of the\nphenomenology observed in the clean case intact. In contrast, the interplay of\nimpurity scattering and order parameter fluctuations of is-symmetry entails the\nformation of a secondary superconductor transition, with a critical temperature\nexponentially sensitive to the disorder concentration. \n\n"}

In this case the Umklapp scattering among\nthe spin excitations is strongly suppressed for all relevant temperatures. We\nargue that the leading scattering mechanism for the spin excitations at not too\nlow temperatures is the \"normal\" (as opposed to the Umklapp) spin-phonon\nscattering in which the non-equilibrium momentum is transferred from the spin\nsubsystem to phonons where it quickly relaxes through the \"phonon bath\".\nBecause of the lower dimensionality of the spin excitations it is only the\nmomentum along the chains which is conserved in such a scattering.

An attractive feature of GBCO is that it allows a precise and\ncontinuous doping of CoO_{2} planes with either electrons or holes, spanning a\nwide range from the charge-ordered insulator at 50% electron doping (x=0) to\nthe undoped band insulator (x=0.5), and further towards the heavily hole-doped\nmetallic state. This continuous doping is clearly manifested in the behavior of\nthermoelectric power which exhibits a spectacular divergence with approaching\nx=0.5, where it reaches large absolute values and abruptly changes its sign. At\nlow temperatures, the homogeneous distribution of doped carriers in GBCO\nbecomes unstable, and both the magnetic and transport properties point to an\nintriguing nanoscopic phase separation. We also find that throughout the\ncomposition range the magnetic behavior in GBCO is governed by a delicate\nbalance between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions,\nwhich can be easily affected by temperature, doping, or magnetic field,\nbringing about FM-AF transitions and a giant magnetoresistance (MR) phenomenon.\nAn exceptionally strong uniaxial anisotropy of the Co spins, which dramatically\nsimplifies the possible spin arrangements, together with the possibility of\ncontinuous ambipolar doping turn GBCO into a model system for studying the\ncompeting magnetic interactions, nanoscopic phase separation and accompanying\nmagnetoresistance phenomena. \n\n"}

We write the density\nresponse matrix within mean field approximation, which leads to coexistence of\\\nsymmetric energy loss rate $F_{S}(T)$ and asymmetric energy loss rate\n$F_{A}(T)$ with total energy loss rate $ F(T)=F_{S}(T)+F_{A}(T)$ at temperature\n$T$. The symmetric component F_{S}(T) $ is equivalent to the conventional\nsingle-sub-system energy loss rate in the literature, and in the\nBloch-Gr\\\"{u}neisen limit we reproduce a set of well-known power laws\n$F_{S}(T)\\propto T^{n_{S}}$, where the prefactor and power $n_{S}$ depend on\nelectron system dimensionality and electron mean free path. For $F_{A}(T)$ we\nproduce a new set of power laws F_{A}(T)\\propto T^{n_{A}}$. Screening strongly\nreduces the symmetric coupling, but the asymmetric coupling is unscreened,\nprovided that the inter-sub-system Coulomb interactions are strong. The lack of\nscreening enhances $F_{A}(T)$ and the total energy loss rate $F(T)$.\nEspecially, in the strong screening limit we find $F_{A}(T)\\gg F_{S}(T)$. A\ncanonical example of strongly asymmetric \\textit{e-ph} matrix elements is the\ndeformation potential coupling in many-valley semiconductors. \n\n"}

A giant drop in the number of current carriers during the\ntransition, which is a consequence of local bound pair (bipolaron) formation in\nthe paramagnetic phase, is extremely sensitive to an external magnetic field.\nBelow the critical temperature of the transition, $T_c$, the binding of the\npolarons into immobile pairs competes with the ferromagnetic exchange between\npolarons and the localized spins on Mn ions, which tends to align the polaron\nmoments and, therefore, breaks up those pairs. The number of carriers abruptly\nincreases below $T_c$ leading to a sudden drop in resistivity.

Polyakov and G.~ 'tHooft in 1974. Numerous and unsuccessful attempts of\nexperimental search for monopole in cosmic rays and on accelerators in high\nenergy particle collisions have been done. Also the searches have been carried\nout in mica for monopole tracks as well as for relict monopoles, entrapped by\nferromagnetic inclusions in iron-ores, moon rock and meteorites. These\nentrapped monopoles, when released, would have the lowest velocities\n$\\beta<10^{-6}$ and do not yield ionization at all, and are hard to detect.\nTherefore it is necessary to examine thoroughly the mechanisms of slow heavy\nmonopole interaction with matter and their scale of energy loss.\n  We discuss here the interaction of a massive slow magnetic monopole with\nmagnetically ordered matter, with conductors, superconductors and with\ncondensed matter in general. Our results indicate that the energy loss of a\nslow supermassive monopole reach $10^{8} eV/cm$ and more if we take into\nconsideration the Cherenkov radiation of magnons or phonons and conductivity of\nthe media. A new method of search for cosmic and relict monopoles by\nmagnetically ordered film is considered too. This approach resembles the\ntraditional method of nuclear emulsion chamber. Apparently the proposed method\nis particularly attractive for detection of relict monopoles, released from\nmelting iron ore. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0410211", "contents": "Title: Cloning transformations in spin networks without external control Abstract: In this paper we present an approach to quantum cloning with unmodulated spin\nnetworks. The cloner is realized by a proper design of the network and a choice\nof the coupling between the qubits. We show that in the case of phase covariant\ncloner the XY coupling gives the best results. In the 1->2 cloning we find that\nthe value for the fidelity of the optimal cloner is achieved, and values\ncomparable to the optimal ones in the general N->M case can be attained. If a\nsuitable set of network symmetries are satisfied, the output fidelity of the\nclones does not depend on the specific choice of the graph. We show that spin\nnetwork cloning is robust against the presence of static imperfections.\nMoreover, in the presence of noise, it outperforms the conventional approach.\nIn this case the fidelity exceeds the corresponding value obtained by quantum\ngates even for a very small amount of noise. Furthermore we show how to use\nthis method to clone qutrits and qudits. By means of the Heisenberg coupling it\nis also possible to implement the universal cloner although in this case the\nfidelity is 10% off that of the optimal cloner. \n\n"}
