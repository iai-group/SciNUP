Such equations are ubiquitous in string\nfield theory and have recently attracted considerable interest also from\ncosmologists. Though these equations have been studied in the classical\nmathematical literature, it appears that the physics community is largely\nunaware of the relevant formalism. Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

Using the example of a massless scalar field\ntheory with a single Dirichlet boundary we explore the relationship between\nsuch approaches, with the goal of better understanding the origin of the\ndivergences. We are guided by the insight due to Dowker and Kennedy (1978) and\nDeutsch and Candelas (1979), that the divergences represent measurable effects\nthat can be interpreted with the aid of the theory of the asymptotic\ndistribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian discussed by Weyl.

In this\nmodel, edges of the square lattice are partitioned into $x$ and $z$-types that\nalternate along both coordinate directions and thus arrange into a checkerboard\npattern of $x$ and $z$-plaquettes; classical O(2)-spins are then coupled\nferromagnetically via their first components over the $x$-edges and via their\nsecond components over the $z$-edges. We prove from first principles that, at\nsufficiently low temperatures, the model exhibits orientational long-range\norder (OLRO) in one of the two principal lattice directions.

Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also\nmodified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to strong\nnonlinear effects such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and\nparametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, seminal experiments and\nproposals to slow and stop the propagation of light, and their applicability to\nmodern optical networks, and future quantum networks, have thrust EIT to the\nforefront of experimental study during the last two decades.

For the cubic model, a new stable FP is found and its\nproperties depend also strongly on the resummation parameters. It appears to be\nspurious, as expected.

Earlier work indicated that a single committed group within a\ndense social network can cause the entire network to quickly adopt the group's\nopinion (in times scaling logarithmically with the network size), so long as\nthe committed group constitutes more than about 10% of the population (with the\nfindings being qualitatively similar for sparse networks as well).

We\nfocus on the glassy effects caused by the kinetic constraint as $q\\downarrow\n0$, where $q$ is the equilibrium density of the 0's. In the physical literature\nthis limit is equivalent to the zero temperature limit. We first prove that,\nfor any given $L=O(1/q)$, the divergence as $q\\downarrow 0$ of three basic\ncharacteristic time scales of the East process of length $L$ is the same.

For any mesoscopic length scale\n$L=O(q^{-\\gamma})$, $\\gamma<1$, we show that the characteristic time scale of\ntwo East processes of length $L$ and $\\lambda L$ respectively are indeed\nseparated by a factor $q^{-a}$, $a=a(\\gamma)>0$, provided that $\\lambda \\geq 2$\nis large enough (independent of $q$, $\\lambda=2$ for $\\gamma<1/2$).

Basic equations Abstract: We provide a short historic of the early development of kinetic theory in\nplasma physics and synthesize the basic kinetic equations describing the\nevolution of systems with long-range interactions derived in Paper I. We\ndescribe the evolution of the system as a whole and the relaxation of a test\nparticle in a bath at equilibrium or out-of-equilibrium. We write these\nequations for an arbitrary long-range potential of interaction in a space of\narbitrary dimension d. We discuss the scaling of the relaxation time with the\nnumber of particles for non-singular potentials. For always spatially\nhomogeneous systems, the relaxation time of the system as a whole scales like N\nin d>1 and like N^2 (presumably) in d=1. For always spatially inhomogeneous\nsystems, the relaxation time of the system as a whole scales like N in any\ndimension of space. For one dimensional systems undergoing a dynamical phase\ntransition from a homogeneous to an inhomogeneous phase, we expect a relaxation\ntime of the form N^{\\delta} with 1<\\delta<2 intermediate between the two\nprevious cases. The relaxation time of a test particle in a bath always scales\nlike N. We also briefly discuss the kinetic theory of systems with long-range\ninteractions submitted to an external stochastic potential.

In the clean system, the density of states vanishes\nquadratically at the Dirac point.

In this paper we show that nonperturbative\neffects from rare regions, which are missed by conventional disorder-averaged\ncalculations, instead give rise to a nonzero density of states for any nonzero\ndisorder. Thus, there is no Dirac semimetal phase at non-zero disorder. The\nresults are established both by a heuristic scaling argument and via a\nsystematic saddle point analysis.

The connection between the\nprobability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global\nHamiltonians will depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these\ntwo Hamiltonians. In this paper we characterize the relation between these two\ndistributions. On one hand, we upperbound the probability of measuring an\nenergy $\\tau$ in a local region, if the global system is in a superposition of\neigenstates with energies $\\epsilon<\\tau$. On the other hand, we bound the\nprobability of measuring a global energy $\\epsilon$ in a bipartite system that\nis in a tensor product of eigenstates of its two subsystems.

At this precise value of\nfrustration, the classical model has a very large degeneracy which makes the\nproblem difficult to handle. We show that introducing a ferromagnetic $J_3$\ncoupling partially lifts this degeneracy.

We reinterpret this family of ground states as coexistence\nstates of three spirals. Using spin wave analysis, we show that thermal and\nquantum fluctuations break this degeneracy differently.

The latter were\npreviously defined as systems that admit the implementation of any desired\ntransformation on a finite target region by first initializing the state of the\nsurrounding and then letting the system evolve according to its autonomous\ndynamics. This way, one obtains a model of control where each region can play\nboth roles the controller or the system to be controlled. In physically\nuniversal systems every degree of freedom is indirectly accessible by operating\non the remaining degrees of freedom.\n  In a nutshell, the thermodynamic cost of an operation is then given by the\nsize of the region around the target region that needs to be initialized. In\nthe meantime, physically universal CAs have been constructed by Schaeffer (in\ntwo dimensions) and Salo & T\\\"orm\\\"a (in one dimension). Here we show that in\nSchaeffer's CA the cost for implementing $n$ operations grows linearly in $n$,\nwhile operating in a thermodynamic cycle requires sublinear growth to ensure\nzero cost *per operation* in the limit $n\\to\\infty$. Although this particular\nresult need not hold for general physically universal CAs, this strong notion\nof universality does imply a certain kind of instability of information, which\ncould result in lower bounds on the cost of protecting information from its\nnoisy environment.\n  The technical results of the paper are sparse and quite simple. The\ncontribution of the paper is mainly conceptual and consists in illustrating the\ntype of thermodynamic questions raised by models of control that rely on the\nconcept of physical universality. \n\n"}

The model remit was extended by analogy to describe flow in porous media\nwith double porosity, as well as to model heat conduction in media with two\nnon-equilibrium local temperature baths e.g. ion and electron baths. Uncoupling\nof the two partial differential equations leads to a higher-ordered diffusion\nequation, solutions of which could be obtained in terms of classical diffusion\nequation solutions. Similar equations could also be derived within an \"internal\nlength\" gradient (ILG) mechanics formulation applied to diffusion problems,\n{\\it i.e.}, by introducing nonlocal effects, together with inertia and\nviscosity, in a mechanics based formulation of diffusion theory.

Our goal in this paper is to\nexplore the possibility of having an equivalent relationship in the context of\nlattice models. We focus on models based on the Temperley-Lieb algebra, and use\nthe concept of braid translation, which is a natural way to close an open spin\nchain by adding an interaction between the first and last spins using braiding\nto bring them next to each other. The interaction thus obtained is in general\nnon-local, but has the key feature that it is expressed solely in terms of the\nalgebra for the open spin chain - the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebra and its\nblob algebra generalization. This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin\nchains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic\nTL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are\nknown to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid\ntranslation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the\nopen model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip. This\nstatement has a precise mathematical formulation, which is a pull-back map\nbetween irreducible modules of, respectively, the blob algebra and the affine\nTL algebra. We then turn to the same kind of analysis for two models whose\ncontinuum limits are Logarithmic CFTs - the alternating gl(1|1) and sl(2|1)\nspin chains.

In the gl(1|1) case, the\ncontent in terms of the irreducibles is the same, as well as the spectrum, but\nthe detailed structure (like logarithmic coupling) is profoundly different.\nThis carries over to the continuum limit. \n\n"}

This temperature-dependent effective charge\ninterpolates monotonically between the central charge values corresponding to\nthe IR and UV fixed points at low and high temperatures, respectively.

Here we provide a construction of quarter BPS coherent states.\nThey are coherent states built with two matrix fields, generalizing the half\nBPS case. These states are both the eigenstates of annihilation operators and\nin the kernel of dilatation operator. Another useful labeling of quarter BPS\nstates is by representations of Brauer algebras and their projection onto a\nsubalgebra $\\mathbb{C}[S_n\\times S_m]$.

However, the first law of\nthermodynamics then takes a non-standard form. We show that if one regards the\nChristodoulou and Ruffini formula for the total energy or enthalpy as defining\nthe Gibbs surface, then the rules of Gibbsian thermodynamics imply that\nnegative temperatures arise inevitably on inner horizons, as does the\nconventional form of the first law. We provide many new examples of this\nphenomenon, including black holes in STU supergravity. We also give a\ndiscussion of left and right temperatures and entropies, and show that both the\nleft and right temperatures are non-negative. The left-hand sector contributes\nexactly half the total energy of the system, and the right-hand sector\ncontributes the other half. Both the sectors satisfy conventional first laws\nand Smarr formulae. For spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant, the\ncosmological horizon is naturally assigned a negative Gibbsian temperature. We\nalso explore entropy-product formulae and a novel entropy-inversion formula,\nand we use them to test whether the entropy is a super-additive function of the\nextensive variables.

The\nquantum information written in a superposition of atomic Zeeman states of\nsending system is faithfully mapped through cavity-assisted Raman scattering\nonto PNSS of linearly polarized cavity photons.

Widely used solving procedures, as the\nDavis-Putnam-Loveland-Logeman (DPLL) algorithm, perform a systematic search for\na solution, through a sequence of trials and errors represented by a search\ntree.

We\ndiscuss the problem of the choice of the most convenient entropy indicator,\nfocusing our attention on a system of 2 qubits, and on a special set, denoted\nby $\\Im$. This set contains both the maximally and the partially entangled\nstates that are described by density matrices diagonal in the Bell basis set.\nWe select this set for the main purpose of making more straightforward our work\nof analysis.

A\nsecond order phase transition belonging to the universality class of dynamic\nisotropic percolation lies between endemic or pandemic behavior of the process.\nWe generalize the general epidemic process by introducing a fourth kind of\nindividuals, viz. individuals which are weakened by the process but not yet\ninfected. This sensibilization gives rise to a mechanism that introduces a\nglobal instability in the spreading of the process and therefore opens the\npossibility of a discontinuous transition in addition to the usual continuous\npercolation transition. The tricritical point separating the lines of first and\nsecond order transitions constitutes a new universality class, namely the\nuniversality class of tricritical dynamic isotropic percolation.

The simplest bounded potential is that of penetrable\nspheres, which takes a positive finite value if the two spheres are overlapped,\nbeing 0 otherwise. Even in the one-dimensional case, the penetrable-rod model\nis far from trivial, since interactions are not restricted to nearest neighbors\nand so its exact solution is not known.

The loss of entanglement is\nprecisely explained as a redistribution of the inertial entanglement into\nmultipartite quantum correlations among accessible and unaccessible modes from\na non-inertial perspective. We show that classical correlations are also lost\nfrom the perspective of two accelerated observers but conserved if one of the\nobservers remains inertial. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0701125", "contents": "Title: Emergence of typical entanglement in two-party random processes Abstract: We investigate the entanglement within a system undergoing a random, local\nprocess. We find that there is initially a phase of very fast generation and\nspread of entanglement. At the end of this phase the entanglement is typically\nmaximal. In previous work we proved that the maximal entanglement is reached to\na fixed arbitrary accuracy within $O(N^3)$ steps, where $N$ is the total number\nof qubits. Here we provide a detailed and more pedagogical proof. We\ndemonstrate that one can use the so-called stabilizer gates to simulate this\nprocess efficiently on a classical computer. Furthermore, we discuss three ways\nof identifying the transition from the phase of rapid spread of entanglement to\nthe stationary phase: (i) the time when saturation of the maximal entanglement\nis achieved, (ii) the cut-off moment, when the entanglement probability\ndistribution is practically stationary, and (iii) the moment block entanglement\nscales exhibits volume scaling. We furthermore investigate the mixed state and\nmultipartite setting. Numerically we find that classical and quantum\ncorrelations appear to behave similarly and that there is a well-behaved\nphase-space flow of entanglement properties towards an equilibrium, We describe\nhow the emergence of typical entanglement can be used to create a much simpler\ntripartite entanglement description. The results form a bridge between certain\nabstract results concerning typical (also known as generic) entanglement\nrelative to an unbiased distribution on pure states and the more physical\npicture of distributions emerging from random local interactions. \n\n"}

Further we give a lower and an upper limit to the maximum\ndiameter of the three-fermion configuration below which genuine tripartite\nentanglement exists and find that this distance is comparable with the maximum\nseparation between two entangled fermions. The upper and lower limit turn to be\nvery close to each other indicating that the applied witness operator is well\nsuited to reveal genuine tripartite entanglement in the collection of\nnon-interacting fermions. \n\n"}

Popescu, et al., Nature Physics 2,754(2006) and S. Goldstein\net al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 050403(2006)] that reduces almost all the pure\nstates of the \"universe\" [formed by a system S plus its surrounding heat bath\n$B$] to a canonical equilibrium state of S. We present an exactly solvable, but\nuniversal model for this kinematic thermalization with an explicit\nconsideration about the energy shell deformation due to the interaction between\nS and B. By calculating the state numbers of the \"universe\" and its subsystems\nS and B in various deformed energy shells, it is found that, for the\noverwhelming majority of the \"universe\" states (they are entangled at least),\nthe diagonal canonical typicality remains robust with respect to finite\ninteractions between S and B. Particularly, the kinematic decoherence is\nutilized here to account for the vanishing of the off-diagonal elements of the\nreduced density matrix of S. It is pointed out that the non-vanishing\noff-diagonal elements due to the finiteness of bath and the stronger\nsystem-bath interaction might offer more novelties of the quantum\nthermalization. \n\n"}

This happens when the efficiencies of Bob's two\ndetectors are different functions of a control parameter accessible to Eve\n(e.g., timing of the incoming pulses). It has previously been shown that the\nBennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol is vulnerable to this attack. In this\npaper, we show that several other protocols and encodings may also be\nvulnerable. We consider a faked states attack in the case of a partial\nefficiency mismatch on the Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) protocol,\nand derive the quantum bit error rate as a function of detector efficiencies.\nAdditionally, it is shown how faked states can in principle be constructed for\nquantum cryptosystems that use a phase-time encoding, the differential phase\nshift keying (DPSK) and the Ekert protocols. \n\n"}

The crucial ingredient is a consistency constraint: if\nthere are two different ways to compute an amplitude the two answers must\nagree. This constraint is expressed in the form of functional equations the\nsolution of which leads to the usual sum and product rules for amplitudes. A\nconsequence is that the Schrodinger equation must be linear: non-linear\nvariants of quantum mechanics are inconsistent. The physical interpretation of\nthe theory is given in terms of a single natural rule. This rule, which does\nnot itself involve probabilities, is used to obtain a proof of Born's\nstatistical postulate. Thus, consistency leads to indeterminism.\n  PACS: 03.65.Bz, 03.65.Ca. \n\n"}

This\npaper shows that this assumption is not indispensable. Abandoning the\nassumption allows to develop an ontology where particle motion is described by\nclassical paths and quantum phenomena are interpreted as a manifestation of a\ncontingent law, i.e., of a law deriving from the boundary conditions of the\nuniverse, such as the second law of thermodynamics.
