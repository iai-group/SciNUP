After considering the current limitations of more standard\ndescriptions in which a single evolution equation is posed for the surface\nheight, we overcome (some of) them by explicitly formulating the dynamics of\nthe species that transport along the surface, and by coupling it to that of the\nsurface height proper. In this we follow recent proposals inspired by\n``hydrodynamic'' descriptions of pattern formation in aeolian sand dunes and\nion-sputtered systems. From this enlarged model, and by exploiting the\ntime-scale separation among various dynamical processes in the system, we\nderive a single height equation in which coefficients can be related to\nexperimental parameters.

The roles of temperature, adhesive interactions\nand atomic structure are studied for simple geometries. An elastic, crystalline\nsubstrate contacts a rigid, atomically flat surface or a spherical tip. The\nrigid surface is formed from a commensurate or incommensurate crystal or an\namorphous solid. Spherical tips are made by bending crystalline planes or\nremoving material outside a sphere. In continuum theory the fraction of\natomically flat surfaces that is in contact rises sharply from zero to unity\nwhen a load is applied. This simple behavior is surprisingly difficult to\nreproduce with atomic scale definitions of contact. Due to thermal\nfluctuations, the number of atoms making contact at any instant rises linearly\nwith load over a wide range of loads. Pressures comparable to the ideal\nhardness are needed to achieve full contact at typical temperatures. A simple\nharmonic mean-field theory provides a quantitative description of this behavior\nand explains why the instantaneous forces on atoms have a universal exponential\nform. Contact areas are also obtained by counting the number of atoms with a\ntime-averaged repulsive force. For adhesive interactions, the resulting area is\nnearly independent of temperature and averaging interval, but usually rises\nfrom zero to unity over a range of pressures that is comparable to the ideal\nhardness. The only exception is the case of two identical commensurate\nsurfaces. For nonadhesive surfaces, the mean pressure is repulsive if there is\nany contact during the averaging interval $\\Delta t$. The associated area is\nvery sensitive to $\\Delta t$ and grows monotonically. Similar complications are\nencountered in defining contact areas for spherical tips. \n\n"}

A promising method of achieving a band gap is by\nintroducing nanoscale perforations (antidots) in a periodic pattern, known as a\ngraphene antidot lattice (GAL). A graphene antidot barrier (GAB) can be made by\nintroducing a 1D GAL strip in an otherwise pristine sheet of graphene. In this\npaper, we will use the Dirac equation (DE) with a spatially varying mass term\nto calculate the electronic transport through such structures. Our approach is\nmuch more general than previous attempts to use the Dirac equation to calculate\nscattering of Dirac electrons on antidots. The advantage of using the DE is\nthat the computational time is scale invariant and our method may therefore be\nused to calculate properties of arbitrarily large structures. We show that the\nresults of our Dirac model are in quantitative agreement with tight-binding for\nhexagonal antidots with armchair edges. Furthermore, for a wide range of\nstructures, we verify that a relatively narrow GAB, with only a few antidots in\nthe unit cell, is sufficient to give rise to a transport gap. \n\n"}

In this paper\nwe demonstrate the flexibility of this minimal basis formalism in providing a\nbasis set that can be reused as-is, i.e. without reoptimization, for\ncharge-constrained DFT calculations within a fragment approach. Support\nfunctions, represented in the underlying wavelet grid, of the template\nfragments are roto-translated with high numerical precision to the required\npositions and used as projectors for the charge weight function. We demonstrate\nthe interest of this approach to express highly precise and efficient\ncalculations for preparing diabatic states and for the computational setup of\nsystems in complex environments. \n\n"}

{"id": "1504.08240", "contents": "Title: Adhesive rough contacts near complete contact Abstract: Recently, there has been some debate over the effect of adhesion on the\ncontact of rough surfaces. Classical asperity theories predict, in agreement\nwith experimental observations, that adhesion is always destroyed by roughness\nexcept if the amplitude of the same is extremely small, and the materials are\nparticularly soft. This happens for all fractal dimensions. However, these\ntheories are limited due to the geometrical simplification, which may be\nparticularly strong in conditions near full contact. We introduce therefore a\nsimple model for adhesion, which aims at being rigorous near full contact,\nwhere we postulate there are only small isolated gaps between the two bodies.\nThe gaps can be considered as \"pressurized cracks\" by using Ken Johnson's idea\nof searching a corrective solution to the full contact solution. The solution\nis an extension of the adhesive-less solution proposed recently by Xu, Jackson,\nand Marghitu (XJM model) (2014). This process seems to confirm recent theories\nusing the JKR theory, namely that the effect of adhesion depends critically on\nthe fractal dimension. For D<2.5, the case which includes the vast majority of\nnatural surfaces, there is an expected strong effect of adhesion. Only for\nlarge fractal dimensions, D>2.5, seems for large enough magnifications that a\nfull fractal roughness completely destroys adhesion. These results are partly\nparadoxical since strong adhesion is not observed in nature except in special\ncases. A possible way out of the paradox may be that the conclusion is relevant\nfor the near full contact regime, where the strong role of flaws at the\ninterfaces, and of gaps full of contaminant, trapped air or liquid in pressure,\nneeds to be further explored. If conditions near full contact are not achieved\non loading, probably the conclusions of classical asperity theories may be\nconfirmed. \n\n"}

In general the absorption in the typical studied materials can be\nneglected and this technique is limited to the measurement of the reflectivity\nonly. In the case of strongly absorbing nuclei the number of neutrons is not\nconserved and the absorption can be directly measured by using the\nneutron-induced fluorescence technique which exploits the prompt particle\nemission of absorbing isotopes. This technique is emerging from soft matter and\nbiology where highly absorbing nuclei, generally in very small quantities, are\nused as a label for buried layers. Nowadays the importance of highly absorbing\nlayers is rapidly increasing, partially because of their application in neutron\ndetection; a field that has become more and more active also due to the\n3He-shortage.

The method evaluates the change in\nthe GW self-energy of the 2D material from the change in the screened Coulomb\ninteraction. The latter is obtained using the quantum-electrostatic\nheterostructure (QEH) model. We benchmark the G$\\Delta$W method against full\nfirst-principles GW calculations and use it to unravel the importance of\nscreening-induced band structure renormalisation in various vdWHs. A main\nresult is the observation that the size of the band gap reduction of a given 2D\nmaterial when inserted into a heterostructure scales inversely with the\npolarisability of the 2D material. Our work demonstrates that dielectric\nengineering \\emph{via} van der Waals heterostructuring represents a promising\nstrategy for tailoring the band structure of 2D materials. \n\n"}

Assuming that the\nsamples are drawn either independently or ergodically from some measure $\\mu$,\nit was shown that, in the limit as $M\\rightarrow\\infty$, the EDMD operator\n$\\mathcal{K}_{N,M}$ converges to $\\mathcal{K}_N$, where $\\mathcal{K}_N$ is the\n$L_2(\\mu)$-orthogonal projection of the action of the Koopman operator on the\nfinite-dimensional subspace of observables.

Nevertheless, the combined effects of\ncharge transfer into the substrate, stretching of bonds between silicon atoms,\nand symmetry breaking which originates from van der Waals interaction, result\nin a gap $E_{g1}$ in the spectrum of the embedded silicene. We further take the\nspin-orbit interaction into account and obtain its strength and the resulting\nenhancement in the gap $E_{g2}=2\\lambda$. Both $E_{g1}$ and $E_{g2}$ which\ncontribute to the total gap, vary significantly when different halogen atoms\nare used for the passivation of the Si surface and for the case of iodine, they\nhave very large values of $70$ and $23$ meV, respectively.

Our results based on Berry curvature and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant reveals that silicene on halogenated Si substrates has\na topological insulating state which can survive even at room temperature for\nthe substrate with iodine and bromine at the surface. Similar to the free\nstanding silicene, by applying a perpendicular electric field and at a certain\ncritical value which again depends on the type of halogens, the gap closes and\nsilicene undergoes a transition to a trivial insulating state.

Both findings point towards the\nimportance of including the volume density of loops (or 'curvature density') as\nan additional field variable into continuum models of dislocation density\nevolution. We explicitly show how this density is affected by loop mergers and\nloop generation. The equations which result for the lowest order CDD theory\nallow us, after spatial averaging and under the assumption of unidirectional\ndeformation, to recover the classical theory of Kocks and Mecking for the early\nstages of work hardening. \n\n"}

We study how Dirac cone\ntilting affects the low-energy properties by presenting a renormalization group\nanalysis of the Coulomb interaction and quenched disorder. Random scalar\npotential or random vector potential along the tilting direction cannot exist\non its own as it always dynamically generates a new type of disorder, which\ndominates at low energies and turns the system into a compressible diffusive\nmetal. Consequently, the fermions acquire a finite disorder scattering rate.\nMoreover, the isolated band-touching point is replaced by a bulk Fermi arc in\nthe Brillouin zone. These results are not qualitatively changed when the\nCoulomb interaction is incorporated. In comparison, random mass and random\nvector potential along the non-tilting direction can exist individually,\nwithout generating other types of disorder. They both suppress tilt at low\nenergies, and do not produce bulk Fermi arc. Upon taking the Coulomb\ninteraction into account, the system enters into a stable quantum critical\nstate, in which the fermion field acquires a finite anomalous dimension but the\ndynamical exponent $z=1$.

However, the same type of glassy-like\nanomalies (i.e. boson peak in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) above\nthe Debye level, peak in the normalized specific heat at $T\\simeq10 K$ etc)\nhave been recently observed also in perfectly ordered crystals, including\nthermoelectric compounds.

In particular, it is seen that a strong boson peak\nanomaly (low-energy excess of modes) in the VDOS can be due almost entirely to\nthe presence of low-energy optical phonons, provided that their energy is\ncomparable to that of the acoustic modes at the Brillouin zone boundary.

The first key feature of this method is an efficient multiscale\ndiffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) algorithm which allows off-lattice random walkers\nto take longer and concomitantly rarer steps with increasing distance away from\nthe solid-liquid interface.

Here spin injection from a ferromagnet\n(FM) into a nonmagnetic semiconductor (NS) is extensively studied by applying\nthis spin drift-diffusion equation to several typical injection structures such\nas FM/NS, FM/NS/FM, and FM/NS/NS structures.

Among the results: 1) The torque\ngenerally varies as sin theta at constant applied voltage. 2) Whenever\npolarization factors are well defined, the voltage-driven torque on each moment\nis uniquely proportional to the polarization factor of the other magnet. 3) At\nfinite applied voltage, this relation predicts significant voltage-asymmetry in\nthe torque. For one sign of voltage the torque remains substantial even when\nthe magnetoconductance is greatly diminished. 4) A broadly defined junction\nmodel, called ideal middle, allows for atomic disorder within the magnets and\nF/I interface regions.

The ground state in xc<x<xp is the disordered state with the spin gap.\nFor S>=1 the long range Neel order vanishes at xp=0.500.
