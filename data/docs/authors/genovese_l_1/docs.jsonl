The essential features of this scenario\nare that the gaugino masses are of the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB)\nform, while scalar and trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms are highly\nsuppressed. Renormalization group effects yield an allowable sparticle mass\nspectrum, while at the same time avoiding charged LSPs; the latter are common\nin models with negligible soft scalar masses, such as no-scale or gaugino\nmediation models.

We find a qualitatively\ndifferent behavior for d=3,4 w.r.t. d=2. In particular, considering any\n(sufficiently regular) gluon propagator D(p^2) and the one-loop-corrected ghost\npropagator G(p^2), we prove in the 2d case that sigma(p^2) blows up in the\ninfrared limit p -> 0 as -D(0)\\ln(p^2). Thus, for d=2, the no-pole condition\n\\sigma(p^2) < 1 (for p^2 > 0) can be satisfied only if D(0) = 0. On the\ncontrary, in d=3 and 4, sigma(p^2) is finite also if D(0) > 0. The same results\nare obtained by evaluating G(p^2) explicitly at one loop, using fitting forms\nfor D(p^2) that describe well the numerical data of D(p^2) in d=2,3,4 in the\nSU(2) case. These evaluations also show that, if one considers the coupling\nconstant g^2 as a free parameter, G(p^2) admits a one-parameter family of\nbehaviors (labelled by g^2), in agreement with Boucaud et al. In this case the\ncondition sigma(0) <= 1 implies g^2 <= g^2_c, where g^2_c is a 'critical'\nvalue. Moreover, a free-like G(p^2) in the infrared limit is obtained for any\nvalue of g^2 < g^2_c, while for g^2 = g^2_c one finds an infrared-enhanced\nG(p^2). Finally, we analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for sigma(p^2)\nand show that, for infrared-finite ghost-gluon vertices, one can bound\nsigma(p^2). Using these bounds we find again that only in the d=2 case does one\nneed to impose D(0) = 0 in order to satisfy the no-pole condition. The d=2\nresult is also supported by an analysis of the DSE using a spectral\nrepresentation for G(p^2).

The underlying\nmatrix product state (MPS) ansatz is a low-rank decomposition of the full\nconfiguration interaction tensor. The virtual dimension of the MPS controls the\nsize of the corner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached.\n  Whereas the MPS ansatz will only yield an efficient description for\nnoncritical one-dimensional systems, it can still be used as a variational\nansatz for other finite-size systems. Rather large virtual dimensions are then\nrequired. The two most important aspects to reduce the corresponding\ncomputational cost are a proper choice and ordering of the active space\norbitals, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. By\ntaking care of both aspects, DMRG becomes an efficient replacement for exact\ndiagonalization in quantum chemistry.\n  DMRG and Hartree-Fock theory have an analogous structure. The former can be\ninterpreted as a self-consistent mean-field theory in the DMRG lattice sites,\nand the latter in the particles. It is possible to build upon this analogy to\nintroduce post-DMRG methods. Based on an approximate MPS, these methods provide\nimproved ans\\\"atze for the ground state, as well as for excitations.\nExponentiation of the single-particle (single-site) excitations for a Slater\ndeterminant (an MPS with open boundary conditions) leads to the Thouless\ntheorem for Hartree-Fock theory (DMRG), an explicit nonredundant\nparameterization of the entire manifold of Slater determinants (MPS\nwavefunctions).

These atomic stress tensors can be used to describe\nliquids' structures and to investigate the connection between structural and\ndynamic properties. In particular, atomic stresses allow to address atomic\nscale correlations relevant to the Green-Kubo expression for viscosity.\nPreviously correlations between the atomic stresses of different atoms were\nstudied using the Cartesian representation of the stress tensors or the\nrepresentation based on spherical harmonics. In this paper we address\nstructural correlations in a model 3D binary liquid using the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the atomic stress tensors. Thus correlations relevant to the\nGreen-Kubo expression for viscosity are interpreted in a simple geometric way.\nOn decrease of temperature the changes in the relevant stress correlation\nfunction between different atoms are significantly more pronounced than the\nchanges in the pair density function. We demonstrate that this behaviour\noriginates from the orientational correlations between the eigenvectors of the\natomic stress tensors.

We propose a new resolution\nto the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling\nobserver in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the\nhorizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition\n(we call it \"little drama\") which is the \"complementarity dual\" of scrambling\nof information on the stretched horizon.

The EDMs of open-shell atomic systems are sensitive\nto the electron EDM and the P,T-odd scalar-pseudoscalar (S-PS) semi-leptonic\ninteraction, but the dominant contributions to the EDMs of diamagnetic atoms\ncome from the hadronic and tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) semi-leptonic\ninteractions.

Key to\nthe DMFT process is the self-consistent map of the original system into an\nAnderson impurity model, the ground state of which is computed using an\nimpurity solver. The power of the method is thus limited by the complexity of\nthe impurity model the solver can handle. Simulating realistic systems\ngenerally requires many correlated sites. By adapting the recently proposed\nadaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI) method as an impurity\nsolver, we enable much more efficient zero temperature DMFT simulations. The\nkey feature of the ASCI method is that it selects only the most relevant\nHilbert space degrees of freedom to describe the ground state. This reduces the\nnumerical complexity of the calculation, which will allow us to pursue future\nDMFT simulations with more correlated impurity sites than in previous works.\nHere we present the ASCI-DMFT method and example calculations on the\none-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models that exemplify its efficient\nconvergence and timing properties.

Subsequently, the error induced by the tensor decomposition of\nthe input Hamiltonian on ground-state energies of closed-shell nuclei\ncalculated via second-order many-body perturbation theory is benchmarked.

The employed tensor formats are found\nto lead to an efficient data compression of two-body matrix elements of the\nnuclear Hamiltonian. In particular, the sophisticated \\emph{tensor\nhypercontraction} (THC) scheme yields low tensor ranks with respect to both\nharmonic-oscillator and Hartree-Fock single-particle bases.

Basis functions may be localized in\nreal-space (atomic orbitals), in momentum-space (plane waves), or in both\ncomponents of phase-space. Such phase-space localized basis functions in the\nform of wavelets, have been used for many years in electronic structure. In\nthis paper, we turn to a phase-space localized basis set first introduced by K.\nG. Wilson. We provide the first full study of this basis and its numerical\nimplementation. To calculate electronic energies of a variety of small\nmolecules and states, we utilize the sum-of-products form, Gaussian\nquadratures, and introduce methods for selecting sample points from a grid of\nphase-space localized Wilson basis. Both full configuration interaction and\nHartree-Fock implementations are discussed and implemented numerically. As with\nmany grid based methods, describing both tightly bound and diffuse orbitals is\nchallenging so we have considered augmenting the Wilson basis set as projected\nSlater-type orbitals. We have also compared the Wilson basis set against the\nrecently introduced wavelet transformed Gaussians (gausslets).

We try to give a microscopic explanation\nfor these phase transitions by adopting Ruppeiner's approach. By studying the\nbehaviors of the Ruppeiner invariant $R$ along the co-existing lines, we find\nthat the various phase transitions may be qualitatively well explained as a\nresult of two competing factors: the first one is the low-temperature effect\nwhich tends to shrink the BH and the second one is the repulsive interaction\nbetween the BH molecules which, on the contrary, tends to expand the BH. In the\nstandard phase transition without RPT, as temperature is lowered, the first\nkind of factor dominates over the second one, so that large black hole (LBH)\ntends to shrink and thus transits to small black hole (SBH); While in the RPT,\nafter the LBH-SBH transition, as temperature is further decreased, the strength\nof the second factor increases quickly and finally becomes strong enough to\ndominate over the first factor, so that SBH tends to expand to release the high\nrepulsion and thus transits back to LBH. Moreover, by comparing the behavior of\n$R$ versus the temperature $T$ with fixed pressure to that of ordinary\ntwo-dimensional thermodynamical systems but with fixed specific volume, it is\ninteresting to see that SBH behaves like a Fermionic gas system in cases with\nRPT, while it behaves oppositely to an anyon system in cases without RPT. And\nin all cases, LBH behaves like a nearly ideal gas system. \n\n"}

However, it is a non trivial question whether the\npredictions of LQC are robust after switching on the inhomogeneous fluctuations\npresent in full LQG. Two of the most spectacular findings of LQC are that 1.\nthe inverse scale factor is bounded from above on zero volume eigenstates which\nhints at the avoidance of the local curvature singularity and 2. that the\nQuantum Einstein Equations are non -- singular which hints at the avoidance of\nthe global initial singularity.

This paper describes an\nalternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of\nHermiticity (transpose + complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically\ntransparent condition of space-time reflection (PT) symmetry. If H has an\nunbroken PT symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of PT-symmetric\nnon-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=p^2+ix^3 and H=p^2-x^4.\nAmazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive!\nIn general, if H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then it has another symmetry\nrepresented by a linear operator C. Using C, one can construct a\ntime-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus,\nPT-symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories\nhaving positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee Model is an\nexample of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian.

Although the algorithm is not\nasymptotically faster than traditional MMC, because of its hierarchical design,\nthe new algorithm executes several orders of magnitude faster than a full\nsimulation of the original problem. Consequently, the new method allows for\nrapid analysis of a phase diagram, allowing computational time to be focused on\nregions near phase transitions. \n\n"}

Attemps to tame this instability by altering the slowly\nchanging force and efforts to damp out this instability by Langevin dynamics do\nnot address the fundamental cause of this instability. In this work, we trace\nthe instability to the non-analytic character of the underlying spectrum and\nshow that a correct splitting of the Hamiltonian, which render the spectrum\nanalytic, restores stability. The resulting Hamiltonian dictates that in\nadditional to updating the momentum due to the slowly changing force, one must\nalso update the position with a modified mass.
