It is also found that\nthese phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\nrigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the\nfluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases. \n\n"}

Heuristic scaling arguments\nbased on random walk properties show that the typical cluster size scales as\n(t/ln(t))^z, with z=1/(k+2). The initial symmetric flux of particles between\nneighboring clusters is followed by an effectively assymmetric flux due to the\nunbalanced detachement rates, which leads to the above logarithmic correction.\nSmall clusters have densities of order t^{-mz(1)}, with z(1) = k/(k+2).

Specifically, we study tracer diffusivities, static structure, and\nthermodynamic properties of a variety of one- and two-component model fluid\nsystems with either additive or non-additive interactions of the hard-sphere or\nGaussian-core form.

Abstract: We have recently applied the second law to an isolated system, consisting of\na system {\\Sigma} such as a glass surrounded by an extremely large medium\n{\\Sigma}, to show that the instantaneous temperature T(t), thermodynamic\nentropy S(T_0,t) and enthalpy H(T_0,t) of {\\Sigma} decrease in any isothermal\nrelaxation towards their respective equilibrium values under isobaric cooling.\nThe Gibbs statistical entropy also conforms to the above relaxation behavior in\na glass, which however is contrary to the conjecture by Gupta, Mauro and\ncoworkers that the glass transition and the structural relaxation are inverse\nprocesses. However, they do not establish that the entropy loss during the\nglass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to\nmaintain the second law. They use a novel statistical formulation of entropy\nbased on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate, but do not\ncompare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy. The formulation is\ndesigned to show the entropy loss. Its subsequent rise not only contradicts our\nresult but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative\nabsolute temperature. To understand these puzzling results and the above\nconjecture, we have carried out a critical evaluation of their unconventional\napproach. We find that the inverse conjecture is neither supported by their\napproach nor by the second law. The zero-entropy microstate conjecture is only\nconsistent with S(T_0,t)\\equiv 0 at all temperatures, not just at absolute zero\nand is found to have no scientific merit. We show that the maximum entropy gain\nof the medium during the glass transition invalidates the entropy loss\nconjecture. After pointing out other misleading, confusing and highly\nexaggerated statements in their work, we finally conclude that their\nunconventional statistical approach and computational scheme are not\nappropriate for glasses. \n\n"}

We formulate a\nsystematic theoretical framework of entropy-based statistical mechanics for\nspherically symmetric collisionless self-gravitating systems. We use an\napproach that is very different from that of the conventional statistical\nmechanics of short-range interaction systems. We demonstrate that the\nequilibrium states of self-gravitating systems consist of both mechanical and\nstatistical equilibria, with the former characterized by a series of\nvelocity-moment equations and the latter by statistical equilibrium equations,\nwhich should be derived from the entropy principle. The velocity-moment\nequations of all orders are derived from the steady-state collisionless\nBoltzmann equation. We point out that the ergodicity is invalid for the whole\nself-gravitating systems, but it can be re-established locally. Based on the\nlocal ergodicity, using Fermi-Dirac-like statistics, with the nondegenerate\ncondition and the spatial independence of the local microstates, we rederive\nthe Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This is consistent with the validity of the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation, and should be the correct entropy form for\ncollisionless self-gravitating systems.

Exact results are obtained for the scaling\nfunctions of the finite-size contributions to the free energy density.

Since the\nscaling functions are independent of the particular microscopic realization of\nthe anisotropy within the two-dimensional Ising model, our results provide a\nlimited verification of universality.

This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is\ndiffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast.

The mean square displacement, the two-particle displacement\ncorrelation, and the overlap-density-based generalized susceptibility are\ncalculated analytically by way of the Lagrangian correlation of the\ninterparticulate space, instead of the Eulerian correlation of density that is\ncommonly used in the standard mode-coupling theory. In regard to the mean\nsquare displacement, the linear analysis reproduces the established result on\nthe asymptotic subdiffusive behavior of the system. A finite-time correction is\ngiven by incorporating the effect of entropic nonlinearity with a Lagrangian\nversion of mode-coupling theory. The notorious difficulty in derivation of the\nmode-coupling theory concerning violation of the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem is found to disappear by virtue of the Lagrangian description. The\nLagrangian description also facilitates analytical calculation of four-point\ncorrelations in the space-time, such as the two-particle displacement\ncorrelation. The two-particle displacement correlation, which is asymptotically\nself-similar in the space-time, illustrates how the cage effect confines each\nparticle within a short radius on one hand and creates collective motion of\nnumerous particles on the other hand.

In\nother terms, the attractive part of the potential function should approach a\nfinite value as the distance between the neighbors grows. To clarify this\npoint, we study the simplest model of this sort -- a chain of linearly elastic\ndisks with finite diameter.

Motivated by these experiments, we analyze the\ncontribution of such chemical steps to the critical Casimir force for the film\ngeometry and within the Ising universality class.

The LFS of the popular Kob-Andersen (KA) model\nglassformer is the bicapped square antiprism, which does tile space. Such an\nLFS-crystal is indeed realised in the $\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ structure, which is\npredicted to be a low energy state for the KA model with a 2:1 composition. We\ntherefore hypothesise that upon changing the composition in the KA model\ntowards 2:1, geometric frustration may be progressively relieved, leading to\nlarger and larger domains of LFS which would ultimately correspond to the\n$\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal. Remarkably, rather than an increase, upon changing\ncomposition we find a small decrease in the LFS population, and the system\nremains impervious to nucleation of LFS crystals. We suggest that this may be\nrelated to the composition of the LFS, as only a limited subset are compatible\nwith the crystal. We further demonstrate that the $\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal\nwill grow from a seed in the KA model with 2:1 composition and identify the\nmelting temperature to be 0.447(2). \n\n"}

{"id": "1606.04507", "contents": "Title: Hierarchy of orientational phases and axial anisotropies in the gauge\n  theoretical description of generalized nematics Abstract: The paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking encompasses the breaking of the\nrotational symmetries $O(3)$ of isotropic space to a discrete subgroup, i.e. a\nthree-dimensional point group. The subgroups form a rich hierarchy and allow\nfor many different phases of matter with orientational order. Such spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking occurs in nematic liquid crystals and a highlight of such\nanisotropic liquids are the uniaxial and biaxial nematics. Generalizing the\nfamiliar uniaxial and biaxial nematics to phases characterized by an arbitrary\npoint group symmetry, referred to as \\emph{generalized nematics}, leads to a\nlarge hierarchy of phases and possible orientational phase transitions. We\ndiscuss how a particular class of nematic phase transitions related to axial\npoint groups can be efficiently captured within a recently proposed gauge\ntheoretical formulation of generalized nematics [K. Liu, J. Nissinen, R.-J.\nSlager, K. Wu, J. Zaanen, Phys. Rev. X {\\bf 6}, 041025 (2016)]. These\ntransitions can be introduced in the model by considering anisotropic couplings\nthat do not break any additional symmetries. By and large this generalizes the\nwell-known uniaxial-biaxial nematic phase transition to any arbitrary axial\npoint group in three dimensions. We find in particular that the generalized\naxial transitions are distinguished by two types of phase diagrams with\nintermediate vestigial orientational phases and that the window of the\nvestigial phase is intimately related to the amount of symmetry of the defining\npoint group due to inherently growing fluctuations of the order parameter. This\nmight explain the stability of the observed uniaxial-biaxial phases as compared\nto the yet to be observed other possible forms of generalized nematic order\nwith higher point group symmetries. \n\n"}

The ratchet\nefficiency is nonmonotonic since the ratcheting is enhanced by increased\nactivity but diminished by the onset of self-clustering of the active\nparticles.

Suppression of the Hall voltage near charge neutrality in such systems\ngives rise to a strong quasiparticle drift in the direction perpendicular to\nthe electric current and magnetic field. This drift is responsible for a strong\ngeometrical increase of resistance even in weak magnetic fields. Combining the\nBoltzmann kinetic equation with sample electrostatics, we develop a microscopic\ntheory of magnetotransport in two and three spatial dimensions. The compensated\nHall effect in confined geometry is always accompanied by electron-hole\nrecombination near the sample edges and at large-scale inhomogeneities. As the\nresult, classical edge currents may dominate the resistance in the vicinity of\ncharge compensation. The effect leads to linear magnetoresistance in two\ndimensions in a broad range of parameters. In three dimensions, the\nmagnetoresistance is normally quadratic in the field, with the linear regime\nrestricted to rectangular samples with magnetic field directed perpendicular to\nthe sample surface.

Any practical implementation of\nsuch a memory cell calls for a strong miniaturization, at which point\nfluctuations start playing a role that cannot be neglected. A detailed\nunderstanding of switching mechanisms and reliability is essential. For this\nreason, we formulate a particle model based on the stochastic motion of oxygen\nvacancies. It allows us to investigate fluctuations in the resistance states of\na switch with two active zones. The vacancies' dynamics is governed by a master\nequation. Upon the application of a voltage pulse, the vacancies travel\ncollectively through the switch. By deriving a generalized Burgers equation we\ncan interpret this collective motion as nonlinear traveling waves, and\nnumerically verify this result. Further, we define binary logical states by\nmeans of the underlying vacancy distributions, and establish a framework of\nwriting and reading such memory element with voltage pulses. Considerations\nabout the dis- criminability of these operations under fluctuations together\nwith the markedness of the resistive switching effect itself lead to the\nconclusion, that an intermediate vacancy number is optimal for performance. \n\n"}

For the first time in\nexperiments, our results unveil a novel crystallization pathway to sponge-like\nporous crystal structures.

We also identify the conditions at which a fluctuation may convert\nto a different phase as its size increases, referred to here as a \"fluctuation\nphase transition\" (FPT). We demonstrate these phenonena in simulations of a two\ndimensional lattice model by evaluating the free energy surface that describes\nthe thermodynamic properties of a fluctuation as a function of its size and\nphase composition. We show that a FPT can occur in the fluctuations of either a\nstable or metastable bulk phase and that the transition is first-order.

Dependence of the spectral function $<\\mathbf{s}_\\kappa ^\\alpha\n\\mathbf{s}_\\kappa ^\\beta >$ of the vortex line on both the one-dimensional wave\nvector $\\kappa$ and intensity of the external force correlator\n$<\\mathbf{\\zeta}_\\kappa ^\\alpha \\mathbf{\\zeta}_\\kappa ^\\alpha>$ was studied.\nHere $\\mathbf{s}_\\kappa ^\\alpha$ is the Fourier transform of the line element\nposition $\\mathbf{s}^\\alpha (\\xi, t)$. It is shown that under the influence of\nan external random force a vortex ring becomes a small tangle whose mean size\ndepends on external force intensity. The theoretical predictions and the\nnumerical results are in reasonable agreement. \n\n"}

The approach is based on an extension of the decomposition scheme\nby introducing extra evolution subpropagators. The extended set of parameters\nof the integration is then determined by reducing the norm of truncation terms\nto a minimum. In such a way, we derive new explicit symplectic Forest-Ruth- and\nSuzuki-like integrators and present them in time-reversible velocity and\nposition forms.

This scenario is also analysed in the presence\nof an optical plug along the vortex axis. Then the condensate remains within\nthe $F_z=2$ manifold, with respect to the local magnetic field, throughout the\nformation of a vortex and hence the loss of atoms does not take place. \n\n"}

The percolation threshold at a planar surface\nis weakly sensitive to the size of the system when its lateral dimension\nincreases from 80 to 150 A. The size distribution of the largest water cluster\nshows a specific two-peaks structure in a wide range of surface coverage : the\nlower- and higher-size peaks represent contributions from non-spanning and\nspanning clusters, respectively. The ratio of the average sizes of spanning and\nnon-spanning largest clusters is about 1.8 for all studied planes. The two-peak\nstructure becomes more pronounced with decreasing size of the planar surface\nand strongly enhances at spherical surfaces. \n\n"}

In particular, we emphasize\nthat a phase space measure should be defined by means of the Jacobian of the\ntransformation between different types of coordinates since such a determinant\nis different from zero in the non-canonical case even if the phase space\ncompressibility is null. Instead, the Jacobian determinant associated with\nphase space flows is unity whenever non-canonical coordinates lead to a\nvanishing compressibility, so that its use in order to define a measure may not\nbe always correct.

Empirical\ntests are performed on on about nine to thirty years of daily returns of twelve\ndata sets comprising some major indices (Dow Jones, SP500, Nasdaq, DAX, FTSE,\nNikkei), some major bonds (JGB, TYX) and some major currencies against the US\ndollar (GBP, CHF, DEM, JPY). Our ``renormalized scenario'' exhibits\nstatistically significant predictive power in essentially all market phases. In\nconstrast, a trend following strategy and trend + acceleration following\nstrategy perform well only on different and specific market phases. The value\nof the ``renormalized scenario'' approach lies in the fact that it always finds\nthe best of the two, based on a calculation of the stability of their predicted\nmarket trajectories. \n\n"}
