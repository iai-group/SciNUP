The\npresence of magnetic fluxes on the brane world volume, required for chirality,\nperturb the soft terms away from those previously computed in the dilute-flux\nlimit.

Even with a 40% variation in the high-scale soft terms\nthe low-energy spectra take a clear and predictive form.

In the SU(3) symmetry limit,\n$f_0(1500)$ becomes a pure SU(3) octet and is degenerate with $a_0(1450)$,\nwhile $f_0(1370)$ is mainly an SU(3) singlet with a slight mixing with the\nscalar glueball which is the primary component of $f_0(1710)$.

We expose the general formalism, thoroughly applying\nit to the case j = 0 for the light cloud, relevant to the semileptonic decay\nLambda_b -> Lambda_c + l + nu.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations\non the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead\nto an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \\ge 2$ while only\nthe $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore.

These neutrinos can also be produced by oscillations of the active\nneutrinos in the early universe, leaving possible traces on different\ncosmological observables. Here we perform an updated study of the neutrino\nkinetic equations in (3+1) and (2+1) oscillation schemes, dynamically evolving\nprimordial asymmetries of active neutrinos and taking into account for the\nfirst time CP-violation effects. In the absence of neutrino asymmetries,\neV-mass scale sterile neutrinos would be completely thermalized creating a\ntension with respect to the CMB, LSS and BBN data. In the past literature,\nactive neutrino asymmetries have been invoked as a way to inhibit the sterile\nneutrino production via the in-medium suppression of the sterile-active mixing\nangle. However, neutrino asymmetries also permit a resonant sterile neutrino\nproduction. We find that if the active species have equal asymmetries L, a\nvalue |L|=10^{-3} is required to start suppressing the resonant sterile\nproduction, roughly an order of magnitude larger than what previously expected.\nWhen active species have opposite asymmetries the sterile abundance is further\nenhanced, requiring an even larger |L|\\simeq 10^{-2} to start suppressing their\nproduction. In the latter case, CP-violation (naturally expected) further\nexacerbates the phenomenon.

We demonstrate that\nif an MeV dark matter particle couples more strongly to electrons and/or\nphotons than to neutrinos, then p-wave annihilation after neutrino decoupling\ncan reduce the value of $N_{eff}$ inferred from BBN and PLANCK. This mechanism\ncan accommodate two eV sterile neutrinos even if PLANCK observes $N_{eff}$ as\nlow as the standard model theoretical value of 3.046, and a large neutrino\nasymmetry is not needed to obtain the correct primordial element abundances.\nThe dark matter annihilation also weakens the cosmological upper bounds on the\nneutrino masses, and we derive a relationship between the change in these\nbounds and the corresponding change in $N_{eff}$.

However, annihilation of Majorana DM to two fermions\noften features a helicity-suppressed s-wave rate. Radiating a gauge boson via\nelectroweak (EW) and electromagnetic (EM) bremsstrahlung removes this s-wave\nsuppression. The main purpose of this talk is to explain in some detail why the\nbranching ratio to a fermion pair is likely suppressed while the decay to the\npair plus a W/Z is not. In doing so, we investigate the general conditions for\ns-wave suppression and un-suppression using Fierz transformations and partial\nwave expansions. Suppression for the 2-to-2 process is sufficiently severe that\nthe EW and EM bremsstrahlung are likely to be the dominant modes of\ngauge-singlet Majorana DM annihilation. We end this talk with a discussion of\nthe challenge presented by space-based data for Majorana DM models, given that\nthe enhanced rate to radiated W and Z gauge bosons and their dominant decay via\nhadronic channels tends to produce more anti-protons than are observed. \n\n"}

In a neutrino-symmetric bath a \"thermal\"\npopulation of the sterile state would quickly grow, but in the presence of\nprimordial neutrino asymmetries a self-suppression as well as a resonant\nsterile neutrino production can take place, depending on temperature and chosen\nparameters. In order to characterize these effects, we go beyond the usual\naverage momentum and single mixing approximations and consider a multi-momentum\nand multi-flavour treatment of the kinetic equations. We find that the\nenhancement obtained in this case with respect to the average momentum\napproximation is significant, up to \\sim 20 % of a degree of freedom. Such\ndetailed and computationally demanding treatment further raises the asymmetry\nvalues required to significantly suppress the sterile neutrino production, up\nto large and preferentially net asymmetries |L_{\\nu}| > O(10^{-2}).

The current design of LBNE Phase I consists of a 10 kt liquid argon\ntime projection chamber (LBNE10).

We show that the contribution of local measurements of the Hubble\nconstant induces an increase of the value of the effective number of\nrelativistic degrees of freedom above the Standard Model value, giving an\nindication in favor of the existence of sterile neutrinos and their\ncontribution to dark radiation. Furthermore, the measurements of the local\ngalaxy cluster mass distribution favor the existence of sterile neutrinos with\neV-scale masses, in agreement with short-baseline neutrino oscillations data.\nIn this case there is no tension between cosmological and short-baseline\nneutrino oscillations data, but the contribution of the sterile neutrino to the\neffective number of relativistic degrees of freedom is likely to be smaller\nthan one. Considering the Dodelson-Widrow and thermal models for the\nstatistical cosmological distribution of sterile neutrinos, we found that in\nthe Dodelson-Widrow model there is a slightly better compatibility between\ncosmological and short-baseline neutrino oscillations data and the required\nsuppression of the production of sterile neutrinos in the early Universe is\nslightly smaller. \n\n"}

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam\nand a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines\n300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at\n5 $\\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating\nphase range.

It is therefore crucial to reliably predict their\nobservables. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS)\nprovides a manifestly convergent perturbation theory for the weakly non-linear\nregime of dark matter, where correlation functions are computed in an expansion\nof the wavenumber k of a mode over the wavenumber associated with the\nnon-linear scale k_nl. Since most of the information is contained at high\nwavenumbers, it is necessary to compute higher order corrections to correlation\nfunctions. After the one-loop correction to the matter power spectrum, we\nestimate that the next leading one is the two-loop contribution, which we\ncompute here. At this order in k/k_nl, there is only one counterterm in the\nEFTofLSS that must be included, though this term contributes both at tree-level\nand in several one-loop diagrams. We also discuss correlation functions\ninvolving the velocity and momentum fields. We find that the EFTofLSS\nprediction at two loops matches to percent accuracy the non-linear matter power\nspectrum at redshift zero up to k~0.6 h/Mpc, requiring just one unknown\ncoefficient that needs to be fit to observations. Given that Standard\nPerturbation Theory stops converging at redshift zero at k~0.1 h/Mpc, our\nresults demonstrate the possibility of accessing a factor of order 200 more\ndark matter quasi-linear modes than naively expected. If the remaining\nobservational challenges to accessing these modes can be addressed with similar\nsuccess, our results show that there is tremendous potential for large scale\nstructure surveys to explore the primordial universe. \n\n"}

In this letter we compute\nthe compatibility of such an observation with possible combinations of neutrino\nflavors with relative proportion (alpha_e:alpha_mu:alpha_tau). Although the\n7:21 track-to-shower ratio is naively favored for the canonical (1:1:1) at\nEarth, this is not true once the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds are\nproperly accounted for. We find that, for an astrophysical neutrino E^(-2)\nenergy spectrum, (1:1:1) at Earth is disfavored at 81% C.L.

Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of\nthe explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only\ndirect probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova.\nIn this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics\nand signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars.

The performance\nof gaseous Xe can be further improved by molecular additives such as\ntrimethylamine(TMA), which is expected to (1) cool down the ionization\nelectrons, (2) convert Xe excitation energy to TMA ionizations through Penning\ntransfer, and (3) produce scintillation and electroluminescence light in a more\neasily detectable wavelength (300 nm). In order to test the feasibility of the\nperformance improvements with TMA, we made the first direct measurement of\nPenning and fluorescence transfer efficiency with gaseous mixtures of Xe and\nTMA. While we observed a Penning transfer efficiency up to ~35%, we found\nstrong suppression of primary scintillation light with TMA. We also found that\nthe primary scintillation light with Xe and TMA mixture can be well\ncharacterized by ~3% fluorescence transfer from Xe to TMA, with further\nsuppression due to TMA self-quenching. No evidence of the scintillation light\nproduced by recombination of TMA ions was found. This strong suppression of\nscintillation light makes dark matter searches quite challenging, while the\npossibility of improved neutrinoless double beta decay searches remains open.\nThis work has been carried out within the context of the NEXT collaboration. \n\n"}

For the modeling of the partonic phase we introduce a dynamical\nquasiparticle model (DQPM) for QCD in equilibrium.

With the\napproximation that the production vertex of the Higgs boson and toponia is\ncontact, and neglecting the P-wave toponia, we analytically calculated the\ndensity matrix for the production and decay of the toponia. Under these\nassumptions, the production spectrum of the toponia is solely determined by the\nspin quantum number, therefore the toponia can be either singlet or triplet. We\nfind that the production rate of the singlet toponium is highly suppressed, and\nbehaves just like the production of a P-wave toponia. In the case of the\ntriplet toponium, three completely independent CP observables, namely azimuthal\nangles of lepton and anti-lepton in the toponium rest-frame as well as their\nsum, are predicted based on our analytical results, and checked by using the\ntree-level event generator.

In this letter, we discuss three\ndifferent types of simplified models for this possible excess. In the first\nclass of models, we assume a new resonance couples to both b bar{b} and mu^+\nmu^-. Within the allowed parameter space for the ALEPH data, this type of\nmodels is excluded because of too large Drell-Yan production of dimuon from the\nb bar{b} collision at the LHC. In the second model, we assume that the 30 GeV\nexcess is a new gauge boson Z' that couples to the SM b and a new vectorlike\nsinglet B quark heavier than Z and not to b bar{b}. Then one can account for\nthe ALEPH data without conflict with the DY constraint. The new vectorlike\nquark B can be pair produced at the LHC 8/13 TeV by QCD with sigma(BB) ~\nO(100-1000) pb, and Bq production rate is sigma(Bq) ~ a few pb which is larger\nthan sigma(Bb) roughly by an order of magnitude. Their signatures at the LHC\nwould be 2b + 4mu, bj + 2mu and 2b + 2mu, respectively, which however might\nhave been excluded already by LHC run I and II data since the multi-muon events\nhave low SM background and are rare at the LHC. In the third model, we consider\nZ -> Z' phi followed by Z' -> mu^+ mu^- and phi -> b bar{b} assuming that the\nHiggs field for Z' mass is also charged under the SM U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. In\nthis class of model, we could accommodate the Br(Z -> b bar{b} mu^+ mu^-) ~ 1.1\nX 10^{-5} if we assume very large U(1)' charge for the U(1)' breaking Higgs\nfield.

The ultra-long duration GRB 111209A, one of the\nlongest GRBs ever detected, also has the best-monitored afterglow in this rare\nclass of GRBs. We want to address the question whether GRB 111209A was a\nspecial event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical\nGRB or another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield\nsignificant clues. We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with\nthe GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope\non-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by\nmulti-band modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws,\nand we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the\nspectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large\nensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another\nultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of\nthe host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8\ndays after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this,\nthe light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9\ndays after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be\nexceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic\nrebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and\nare not unique. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and afterglow\nparameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for\nthese parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from that\nof classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A\nresulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope. \n\n"}

By numerically diagonalizing the full optomechanical\nHamiltonian, we show that the resonant generation of photons from the vacuum is\ndetermined by a ladder of mirror-field {\\em vacuum Rabi splittings}. We find\nthat vacuum emission can originate from the free evolution of an initial pure\nmechanical excited state, in analogy with the spontaneous emission from excited\natoms. By considering a coherent drive of the mirror, using a master-equation\napproach to take losses into account, we are able to study the dynamical\nCasimir effect for optomechanical coupling strengths ranging from weak to\nultrastrong. We find that a resonant production of photons out of the vacuum\ncan be observed even for mechanical frequencies lower than the cavity-mode\nfrequency. Since high mechanical frequencies, which are hard to achieve\nexperimentally, were thought to be imperative for realizing the dynamical\nCasimir effect, this result removes one of the major obstacles for the\nobservation of this long-sought effect.

To further advance this promising field, it is of great\ninterest to predict the optical response of recently discovered and\nyet-to-be-synthesized polaritonic materials alike. Here we develop a unified\nframework based on quantum linear response theory to calculate the spatially\nnon-local dielectric function of a polar lattice in arbitrary dimensions. In\nthe case of a three-dimensional bulk material, the spatially local limit of our\ncalculation reproduces standard results for the dielectric response of a polar\nlattice. Using this framework, we provide ab initio calculations of the\ndielectric permittivity of important bulk polar dielectrics such as silicon\ncarbide and hexagonal boron nitride in good agreement with experiments.

The study of\nrare kaon decays has played a key role in the development of the standard\nmodel, and the field continues to have significant impact.

Due to the exquisite\nsensitivity of rare kaon decay experiments, searches for new physics can probe\nvery high mass scales.

The well-known singular character of the two-dimensional delta-function\npotential is dealt with by considering the renormalized path integral resulting\nfrom a variety of schemes: dimensional, momentum-cutoff, and real-space\nregularization. Moreover, compatibility of the bound-state and scattering\nsectors is shown. \n\n"}

A causal theory of dissipative fluid dynamics is used instead of\nthe standard theories which are acausal. We compute the parton momentum spectra\nand HBT radii from two-particle correlation functions.

The structure-dependent coefficients in\nthe VCS amplitude therefore acquire a momentum dependence and are termed\n``generalized polarizabilities'' of the nucleon in analogy to real Compton\nscattering.
