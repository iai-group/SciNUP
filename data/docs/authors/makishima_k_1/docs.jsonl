Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

During the fading phase, our models support a single source\nof radiation, an hydrogen-rich optically-thick layer with a near-constant\ntemperature of ~7000K that recedes from a radius of 4.3x10^15 at peak to\n2.3x10^15cm 40 days later. We reproduce the hybrid narrow-core broad-wing line\nprofile shapes of SN 1994W at all times, invoking an optically-thick\nphotosphere exclusively (i.e., without any external optically-thick shell). In\nSN 1994W, slow expansion makes scattering with thermal electrons a key escape\nmechanism for photons trapped in optically-thick line cores, and allows the\nresulting broad incoherent electron-scattering wings to be seen around narrow\nline cores. In SNe with larger expansion velocities, the thermal broadening due\nto incoherent scattering is masked by the broad profile and the dominant\nfrequency redshift occasioned by bulk motions. Given the absence of broad lines\nat all times and the very low 56Ni yields, we speculate whether SN 1994W could\nhave resulted from an interaction between two ejected shells without core\ncollapse. The high conversion efficiency of kinetic to thermal energy may not\nrequire a SN-like energy budget for SN1994W. \n\n"}

In this paper, we study the current acceleration of the\nuniverse, using the formulas developed in \\cite{WS07}. We first construct\nexplicitly time-dependent solution to the 10-dimensional bulk of the\nNeveu-Schwarz/Neveu-Schwarz sector, compactified on a 5-dimensional torus.\nThen, we write down the generalized Friedmann equations on each of the two\ndynamical branes, and fit the models to the 182 gold supernova Ia data and the\nBAO parameter from SDSS, using both of our MINUIT and Monte-Carlo Markov Chain\n(MCMC) codes. With the best fitting values of the parameters involved as\ninitial conditions, we integrate the generalized Friedmann equations\nnumerically and find the future evolution of the universe. We find that it\ndepends on the choice of the radion potentials $V_{4}^{(I)} (I = 1, 2)$ of the\nbranes. In particular, when choosing them to be the Goldberger-Wise potentials,\n$V_{4}^{(I)} = \\lambda_{4}^{(I)} (\\psi^{2} - {v_{I}}^{2})^{2}$, we find that\nthe current acceleration of the universe driven by the effective cosmological\nconstant is only temporary.

We also study the\nproper distance between the two branes, and find that it remains almost\nconstant during the whole future evolution of the universe in all the models\nconsidered. \n\n"}

SDSSJ0927+2943 shows an exceptional\noptical emission-line spectrum with two sets of emission lines: one set of very\nnarrow emission lines, and a second set of broad Balmer and broad\nhigh-ionization forbidden lines which are blueshifted by 2650 km\\s relative to\nthe set of narrow emission lines. This observation is most naturally explained\nif the SMBH was ejected from the core of the galaxy, carrying with it the\nbroad-line gas while leaving behind the bulk of the narrow-line gas.

Combining these data with ROSAT All-Sky Survey observations,\nproper motions, and optical photometry/spectroscopy, we construct a list of\nhighly probable cluster members. We identify 1 A-type star, HD 45435, with\ndefinite excess emission at 4.5--24 micron indicative of debris from\nterrestrial planet formation. We also identify 2--4 late-type stars with\npossible 8 micron excesses, and 8 early-type stars with definite 24 micron\nexcesses. Constraints on the dust luminosity and temperature suggest that the\ndetected excesses are produced by debris disks. From our sample of B and A\nstars, stellar rotation appears correlated with 24 micron excess, a result\nexpected if massive primordial disks evolve into massive debris disks. To\nexplore the evolution of the frequency and magnitude of debris around A-type\nstars, we combine our results with data for other young clusters. The frequency\nof debris disks around A-type stars appears to increase from ~ 25% at 5 Myr to\n~ 50--60% at 20--25 Myr. Older A-type stars have smaller debris disk\nfrequencies: ~ 20% at 50--100 Myr.

To do this we coupled a semi-analytical\nmodel for magnetized galactic winds as suggested by \\citet{2006MNRAS.370..319B}\nto our cosmological simulation. We find that the strength and structure of\nmagnetic fields observed in galaxy clusters are well reproduced for a wide\nrange of model parameters for the magnetized, galactic winds and do only weakly\ndepend on the exact magnetic structure within the assumed galactic outflows.\nAlthough the evolution of a primordial magnetic seed field shows no significant\ndifferences to that of galaxy clusters fields from previous studies, we find\nthat the magnetic field pollution in the diffuse medium within filaments is\nbelow the level predicted by scenarios with pure primordial magnetic seed\nfield.

The close association between AGN\nactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the AGN\nfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-frame\ncolor (U-V) and spectral index Dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selection\nalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when using\nluminosity-limited samples.

Using a standard description of the Galactic\nDM halo, we find that the maximum enhancement to the direct detection event\nrate, consistent with current experimental constraints on the WIMP-nucleon\ncross section, is < 1% relative to the event rate from halo WIMPs, while the\nevent rate from neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the center of the Earth is\nunlikely to meet the threshold of next-generation, km^3-sized (IceCube, KM3NeT)\nneutrino telescopes. \n\n"}

It is difficult for feedback from near the\naccretion disk to directly impact dense molecular clouds at ~kpc. But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of\nmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is\nmore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been\naltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate a\nmoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of\nmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.\nInstead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initial\nfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of the\nluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this\nmechanism could be efficient. This amounts to hot gas outflow rates from near\nthe accretion disk of only 5-10% of the BH accretion rate. \n\n"}

We find\nthat disc plus Comptonised corona models fit the data well, but the derived\ncorona is cool, and optically thick (tau ~ 5-30). We argue that these observed\ndisc temperatures are not a good indicator of the black hole mass as the\npowerful, optically thick corona drains energy from the inner disc, and\nobscures it. We estimate the intrinsic (corona-less) disc temperature, and\ndemonstrate that in most cases it lies in the regime of stellar mass black\nholes.

Abstract: We investigate two potential mechanisms that will produce X-ray and gamma-ray\nflashes from Type Ia supernovae (SN-Ia). The mechanisms are the breakout of the\nthermonuclear burning front as it reaches the surface of the white dwarf and\nthe interaction of the rapidly expanding envelope with an accretion disk. Based\non the delayed-detonation scenario and detailed radiation-hydro calculation\nwhich include nuclear networks, we find that both mechanisms produce ~1 second\nflashes of high energy radiation with peak luminosities of 10^48 to 10^50\nerg/sec with fast rises and exponential declines. The X- and gamma-ray\nvisibility of a SN-Ia will depend strongly on self absorption within the\nprogenitor system, specifically on the properties of the accretion disk and its\norientation towards the observer. Such X-ray and gamma-ray flashes could be\ndetected as triggered events by Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) detectors on satellites,\nwith events in current GRB catalogs. We have searched through the GRB catalogs\n(for the BATSE, HETE, and Swift experiments) for GRBs that occur at the\nextrapolated time of explosion and in the correct direction for known Type Ia\nsupernovae with radial velocity of less than 3,000 km/s.

After a few tens of\nseconds, an accretion shock sweeps outward through the star. The formation and\noutward expansion of the accretion shock is accompanied with a sudden and rapid\npower-law decline in the central accretion rate Mdot ~ t^{-2.8}, which\nresembles the L_X ~ t^{-3} decline observed in the X-ray light curves. The\ncollapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-mass\nequatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere.

We present the\nfirst results of gamma-ray pulsar light curve modeling using the more realistic\nfield taken from 3D force-free magnetospheric simulations. Having the geometry\nof the field, we apply several prescriptions for the location of the emission\nzone, comparing the light curves to observations. We find that the conventional\ntwo-pole caustic model fails to produce double-peak pulse profiles, mainly\nbecause the size of the polar cap in force-free magnetosphere is larger than\nthe vacuum field polar cap. The conventional outer-gap model is capable of\nproducing only one peak under general conditions, because a large fraction of\nopen field lines does not cross the null charge surface. We propose a novel\n\"separatrix layer\" model, where the high-energy emission originates from a thin\nlayer on the open field lines just inside of the separatrix that bounds the\nopen flux tube. The emission from this layer generates two strong caustics on\nthe sky map due to the effect we term \"Sky Map Stagnation\" (SMS).

We test DTD models from the\nliterature, requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster\nSN rates and the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratios. A power-law DTD of the\nform t^{-1.2+/-0.3}, extending to a Hubble time, can satisfy both constraints.\nShallower power laws, such as t^{-1/2} cannot, assuming a single DTD, and a\nsingle star-formation burst (either brief or extended) at high z.

The brightest source of dust emission is only\nL_IR ~ 10^5 Lsun and does not correspond to the previously identified\ncandidates for the surviving star. The dust cannot be made sufficiently distant\nand cold to avoid detection unless the ejection energy, mass and velocity\nscales are those of a SN or greater.

Its peculiarities are probably due to enhanced mass loss\njust prior to the SN, followed by the interactions of the SN blast wave with\nthis ejecta. This adds to the evidence that there is a population of SN\nprogenitors that have major mass loss episodes shortly before core collapse.\nThe progenitor is a low metallicity, ~1/3 solar, high mass, M_ZAMS > 80 Msun,\nstar, which means either that BH formation can be accompanied by an SN or that\nsurprisingly high mass stars can form a NS. \n\n"}

Using the X-ray luminosity function\nand the local mass function of supermassive black holes, SMBHs we can reproduce\nthe individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and\nlow-excitation narrow emission lines.

In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar\namplitudes. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin\npeak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak. A bimodality\nshould be seen in the radio loudness of quasars.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

Most gamma-ray detected pulsars are young and\nenergetic, and many are associated with TeV sources. PSR J1357-6429 is a high\nspin-down power pulsar (Edot = 3.1 * 10^36 erg/s), discovered during the Parkes\nmultibeam survey of the Galactic plane, with significant timing noise typical\nof very young pulsars.

Using a rotational\nephemeris obtained with 74 observations made with the Parkes telescope at 1.4\nGHz, we phase-fold more than two years of gamma-ray data acquired by Fermi-LAT\nas well as those collected with XMM-Newton, and perform gamma-ray spectral\nmodeling. Significant gamma and X-ray pulsations are detected from PSR\nJ1357-6429. The light curve in both bands shows one broad peak.

Both the multi-color light\ncurve and the broad-band SED of the afterglow of GRB 091127 show evidence of a\ncooling break moving from high to lower energies. The early light curve is well\ndescribed by a broken power-law, where the initial decay in the optical/NIR\nwavelength range is considerably flatter than at X-rays. Detailed fitting of\nthe time-resolved SED shows that the break is very smooth with a sharpness\nindex of 2.2 +- 0.2, and evolves towards lower frequencies as a power-law with\nindex -1.23 +- 0.06.

To account for the phase alignment, we\nexplore geometric models where both the radio and gamma-ray emission originate\neither in the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder (R_LC) or near the\npolar caps (PCs). We obtain reasonable fits for the first three of these MSPs\nin the context of \"altitude-limited\" outer gap (alOG) and two-pole caustic\n(alTPC) geometries. The outer magnetosphere phase-aligned models differ from\nthe standard outer gap (OG) / two-pole caustic (TPC) models in two respects:\nfirst, the radio emission originates in caustics at relatively high altitudes\ncompared to the usual low-altitude conal radio beams; second, we allow the\nmaximum altitude of the gamma-ray emission region as well as both the minimum\nand maximum altitudes of the radio emission region to vary within a limited\nrange.

This can terminate star formation in the galaxy and stifle accretion onto\nthe black hole. Such Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback can account for the\nobserved proportionality between central black hole and host galaxy mass.\nDirect observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback,\nwhich occurs when the AGN is very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is\naccumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio\nmode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when\nthe AGN is operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical\ngalaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the\ncentral galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot\nsurrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot\nintracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by\nan order of magnitude.

Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a\nfurther mode of energy feedback which affect the cores of groups and\nsubclusters.

We study the gravitational lensing in the strong field regime in the JMN\nspacetime, a spherically symmetric geometry that contains a naked singularity\nand which matches smoothly with Schwarzschild metric beyond a finite radius.\nThis metric is a toy model which was shown recently to be the end state of\ngravitational collapse. In the presence of the photon sphere gravitational\nlensing signature of this spacetime is identical to that of Schwarzschild black\nhole with infinitely many relativistic images and Einstein rings, all of them\nlocated beyond a certain critical angle from optic axis and the inner\nrelativistic images all clumped together. However, in the absence of the photon\nsphere, which is the case for a wide range of parameter values in this\nspacetime, we show that we get finitely many relativistic images and Einstein\nrings spaced reasonably apart from one another, some of which can be formed\ninside the critical angle for the corresponding Schwarzschild black hole.

The sample comprises 47 GRBs with measured\nredshift that were observed by GBM until May 2012. 39 sources belong to the\nlong-duration population and 8 events were classified as short bursts. For all\nof these events we derive, where possible, the intrinsic peak energy in the\n{\\nu}F{\\nu} spectrum (Ep,rest), the duration in the rest-frame, defined as the\ntime in which 90% of the burst counts were observed (T90,rest) and the\nisotropic equivalent bolometric energy (Eiso).

It has been shown that most of the energy is\nreleased deep in the crust by pycnonuclear reactions involving low-Z elements.\nWe discuss if NSs in very-faint X-ray transients (VFXTs; those which have peak\nX-ray luminosities < 1E36 erg/s) can be used to test this model. Unfortunately\nwe cannot conclusively answer this because of the large uncertainties in our\nestimates of the accretion rate history of those VFXTs, both the short-term\n(less than a few tens of thousands of years) and the one throughout their\nlifetime. The latter is important because it can be so low that the NSs might\nnot have accreted enough matter to become massive enough that enhanced cooling\nprocesses become active. Therefore, they could be relatively warm compared to\nother systems for which such enhanced cooling processed have been inferred.\nHowever, the amount of matter can also not be too low because then the crust\nmight not have been replaced significantly by accreted matter and thus a hybrid\ncrust of partly accreted and partly original, albeit further compressed matter,\nmight be present. This would inhibit the full range of pycnonuclear reactions\nto occur and thus very likely decreasing the amount of heat deposited in the\ncrust. Furthermore, better understanding is needed how a hybrid crust affects\nother properties such as the thermal conductivity. We also show that some\nindividual NS LMXBs might have hybrid crusts as well as the NSs in HMXBs. This\nhas to be taken into account when studying the cooling properties of those\nsystems when they are in quiescence.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

The less-massive bulges and non-peaked rotation\ncurves in the galaxies simulated with primordial cooling or H_2 are linked to\nchanges in the angular momentum distribution of the baryons. These galaxies had\nsmaller amounts of low-angular momentum baryons because of increased gas loss\nfrom stellar feedback.

Focusing on linear\nperturbations, we identify seven Lagrangian operators that lead to equations of\nmotion containing at most two (space or time) derivatives, the background\nevolution being determined by the time dependent coefficients of only three of\nthese operators.

We test the viability of\nthis scenario for supermassive black holes using two samples of active galactic\nnuclei distinguished by the presence (radio-strong) and absence (radio-weak) of\nwell-collimated, relativistic jets. Each is centered on a narrow range of black\nhole mass but spans a very broad range of Eddington ratios, effectively\nsimulating, in a statistical manner, the behavior of a single black hole\nevolving across a wide spread in accretion states.

Here, we further explore the existence of possible\ndynamical connections between globular and open clusters, and realize that the\nmost obvious link must be in the form of gravitational interactions. If open\nclusters are born out of GMCs, they have to move in similar orbits. If we\naccept that globulars can interact with GMCs, triggering star formation, it\nfollows that globular and open clusters must also interact. Consistently,\ntheoretical arguments as well as observational evidence, show that globular and\nopen clusters certainly are interacting populations and their interactions are\nfar more common than usually thought, especially for objects part of the\nbulge/disk.

With much\nlower radiative efficiencies of protons than of electrons, and the recent\nreports of very strong coupling of electrons with shock-heated protons\nindicated by Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, the leptonic models seem to be\nstrongly favored over the hadronic ones. However, the electron-proton coupling\ncombined with the ERC (External-Radiation-Compton) models of gamma-ray\nproduction in leptonic models predict extremely hard X-ray spectra, with energy\nindices about 0. This is inconsistent with the observed 2-10 keV slopes of\nblazars, which cluster around an index value of 0.6. This problem can be\nresolved by assuming that electrons can be cooled down radiatively to\nnon-relativistic energies, or that blazar spectra are entirely dominated by the\nSSC (Synchrotron-Self Compton) component up to at least 10 keV. Here, we show\nthat the required cooling can be sufficiently efficient only at distances r <\n0.03pc. SSC spectra, on the other hand, can be produced roughly co-spatially\nwith the observed synchrotron and ERC components, which are most likely located\nroughly at a parsec scale. We show that the dominant SSC component can also be\nproduced much further than the dominant synchrotron and ERC components, at\ndistances larger than 10 parsecs. Hence, depending on the spatial distribution\nof the energy dissipation along the jet, one may expect to see\ngamma-ray/optical events with either correlated or uncorrelated X-rays. In all\ncases the number of electron-positron pairs per proton is predicted to be very\nlow. The direct verification of the proposed SSC scenario requires sensitive\nobservations in the hard X-ray band which is now possible with the NuSTAR\nsatellite. \n\n"}

We systematically analyze the Swift/XRT light curves of long GRBs\ndetected before 2013 August, and characterize them into four categories based\non how likely they may harbor a magnetar central engine: Gold, Silver,\nAluminum, and Non-magnetar. We also independently analyze the data of short\nGRBs with a putative magnetar central engine. We then perform a statistical\nstudy of various properties of the magnetar samples and the non-magnetar\nsample, and investigate whether the data are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat there exist two types of central engines. By deriving the physical\nparameters of the putative magnetars, we find that the observations of the Gold\nand Silver samples are generally consistent with the predictions of the\nmagnetar model. For a reasonable beaming factor for long GRBs, the derived\nmagnetar surface magnetic field $B_p$ and initial spin period $P_0$ fall into\nthe reasonable range. Magnetar winds in short GRBs, on the other hand, are\nconsistent with being isotropic.

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting\nprograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially\nretrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although\ntheoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that\nretrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for\ncertain radio quasars. In either case this work demonstrates the value of\nstudying local extragalactic microquasars as a means to better understand the\nphysics of jet launching. \n\n"}

A theoretical framework is derived\nthat validates this suggestion, and provides predictions of ghost formation in\na two-source scenario. The predictions are found to accurately match the result\nof simulations, and qualitatively reproduce the ghosts previously seen in\nobservational data. The theory also provides explanations for many previously\npuzzling features of these artefacts (regular geometry, PSF-like sidelobes,\nseeming independence on model flux), and shows that the observed phenomenon of\nflux suppression affecting unmodelled sources is due to the same mechanism. We\ndemonstrate that this ghost formation mechanism is a fundamental feature of\ncalibration, and exhibits a particularly strong and localized signature due to\narray redundancy.

Studies of the burst\nenvironment by Th\\\"one et al. (2008) suggested that this GRB came from the\ncollapse of a massive star and that the GRB site was a region with properties\ndifferent from the rest of the galaxy. We reobserved the galaxy in high spatial\nresolution using the VIMOS integral-field unit (IFU) at the VLT with a spaxel\nsize of 0.67 arcsec. Furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data from\nHIRES/Keck at two different slit positions covering the GRB site, the center of\nthe galaxy and an HII region next to the GRB region. We compare the properties\nof different HII regions in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global\nand local kinematic properties of this galaxy. The resolved data show that the\nGRB site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 Z_solar, but\nits specific SFR (SSFR) of 7.4 M_solar/yr/L/L* and age (determined by the\nHalpha EW) are similar to other HII regions in the host. The galaxy shows a\ngradient in metallicity and SSFR from the bulge to the outskirts as it is\ncommon for spiral galaxies. This gives further support to the theory that GRBs\nprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in S-type\ngalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.\nKinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for large\nperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. This study\nconfirms the collapsar origin of GRB060505 but reveals that the properties of\nthe HII region surrounding the GRB were not unique to that galaxy.

During this\nperiod, an elevated level of the M87 flux is reported at VHE gamma rays. We\ndetected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolved\njet base (radio core) with VERA at 22 and 43GHz coincident with the VHE\nactivity. Meanwhile, we confirmed with EVN at 5GHz that HST-1 (an alternative\ngamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its flux\ndensity and structure. These results in the radio bands strongly suggest that\nthe VHE gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or\n56 Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. We further\nconducted VERA astrometry for the M87 core during the flaring period, and\ndetected core shifts between 22 and 43GHz.

This indicates that a new radio-emitting component was created\nnear the black hole in the period of the VHE event, and then propagated outward\nwith progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. By combining these results,\nwe estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived a\nsub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. This value is significantly slower than\nthe super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during the\nprominent VHE flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger VHE activity\ncan be associated with the production of the higher Lorentz factor jet. \n\n"}

Hydrodynamic simulations\nshow a transition from SL to AS rotation as the influence of rotation on\nconvection is reduced, but the opposite transition occurs at a different point\nin the parameter space. The system is bistable, i.e., SL and AS rotation\nprofiles can both be stable.

Abstract: We investigate how different stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) can affect\nthe mass loss and survival of star clusters. We find that IMFs with radically\ndifferent low-mass cut-offs (between 0.1 and 2 Msun) do not change cluster\ndestruction time-scales as much as might be expected. Unsurprisingly, we find\nthat clusters with more high-mass stars lose relatively more mass through\nstellar evolution, but the response to this mass loss is to expand and hence\nsignificantly slow their dynamical evolution. We also argue that it is very\ndifficult, if not impossible, to have clusters with different IMFs that are\ninitially \"the same\", since the mass, radius and relaxation times depend on\neach other and on the IMF in a complex way. We conclude that changing the IMF\nto be biased towards more massive stars does speed up mass loss and\ndissolution, but that it is not as dramatic as might be thought. \n\n"}

In order to explain their sparse structure, it\nhas been suggested that they formed as star clusters in dwarf galaxy satellites\nthat later accreted onto the Milky Way. If these clusters form in the centre of\ndwarf galaxies, they evolve in a tidally-compressive environment where the\ncontribution of the tides to the virial balance can become significant, and\nlead to a super-virial state and subsequent expansion of the cluster, once\nremoved.

Modulation is\ndetected in 15 stars. Most of them have non-typical period ratio of the radial\nmodes. In the Petersen diagram, at a given period of the fundamental mode, they\nare located significantly below or above the sequence formed by the majority of\nRRd stars.\n  Multi-periodic modulation is very frequent; two or three modulation periods\nare detected in 8 stars. Modulation periods vary from ~20 to more than 300\ndays. Radial mode amplitudes can be modulated by a few to nearly hundred per\ncent. Both radial modes may be modulated with the same period. More commonly\nhowever, dominant modulation for the fundamental mode has different period than\ndominant modulation for the first overtone. Quite often modulation of only one\nmode is detected in the data. We find a clear feedback between pulsation\namplitude of the dominant mode and mean stellar brightness: lower the pulsation\namplitude, brighter the star. At phases of low pulsation amplitude, the mode\nperiods are prone to fast changes. All the stars share the common feature:\ntheir pulsation properties are non-stationary.

One of the criteria we used for the identification was the\npresence of an Ha emission line. The spectra of several sources revealed an Ha\nemission line only after careful subtraction of the F or G stellar spectral\nabsorption lines. In a sub-class of three of these sources the residual Halpha\nemission line is broad (> 400 km/s) which suggests that it is formed in an\naccretion disk, whereas in other cases the line width is such that we currently\ncannot determine whether the line emission is formed in an active star/binary\nor in an accretion disk.

Yet there is currently great\ndebate (and few measurements) about the behaviour of the 1.4-GHz counts in the\nmicroJy regime. One way to push the counts to these levels is via 'stacking',\nthe covariance of a map with a catalogue at higher resolution and (often) a\ndifferent wavelength. For the first time, we cast stacking in a fully bayesian\nframework, applying it to (i) the SKADS simulation and (ii) VLA data stacked at\nthe positions of sources from the VIDEO survey.

We study the possibility that future data may show the\npositron fraction dropping down abruptly to the level expected with only\nsecondary production, and forecast the implications of such a feature in term\nof possible injection mechanisms that include both Dark Matter and pulsars. \n\n"}

SN 2014J in the starburst galaxy M82, the closest\ndetected SN~Ia in three decades, provides unparalleled opportunities to study\nthe dust extinction toward an SN Ia. In order to derive the extinction as a\nfunction of wavelength, we model the color excesses toward SN 2014J, which are\nobservationally derived over a wide wavelength range in terms of dust models\nconsisting of a mixture of silicate and graphite.

The disc itself evolves on time-scales of several Myr during which\nboth temperature and density profiles change as matter accretes onto the\ncentral star. Here we use a detailed model of an evolving disc to determine the\ngrowth of planets by pebble accretion and their migration through the disc.\nCores that reach their pebble isolation mass accrete gas to finally form giant\nplanets with extensive gas envelopes, while planets that do not reach pebble\nisolation mass are stranded as ice giants and ice planets containing only minor\namounts of gas in their envelopes. Unlike earlier population synthesis models,\nour model works without any artificial reductions in migration speed and for\nprotoplanetary discs with gas and dust column densities similar to those\ninferred from observations. We find that in our nominal disc model the\nemergence of planetary embryos preferably occurs after approximately 2 Myr in\norder to not exclusively form gas giants, but also ice giants and smaller\nplanets. The high pebble accretion rates ensure that critical core masses for\ngas accretion can be reached at all orbital distances.

In Newtonian gravity the pressure within a star merely\nplays the role of opposing self-gravity. In general relativity all sources of\nenergy and momentum contribute to the gravity. As a result the pressure not\nonly opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes\nmore pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the\nmass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is\ninevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually\ndifferent than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which\nis attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs\nthe general relativistic critical mass is very close to the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. For neutron stars the maximum mass---so\ncalled Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit---is significantly smaller than the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit.

The line lists contain transition frequencies with qualified\naccuracies, intensities, quantum numbers, as well as further auxilary\ninformation. They have been generated from critically evaluated experimental\nline lists, mostly from laboratory experiments, employing established\nHamiltonian models. Seperate entries exist for different isotopic species and\nusually also for different vibrational states. As of December 2015, the number\nof entries is 792. They are available online as ascii tables with additional\nfiles documenting information on the entries. The Virtual Atomic and Molecular\nData Centre was founded more than 5 years ago as a common platform for atomic\nand molecular data. This platform facilitates exchange not only between\nspectroscopic databases related to astrophysics or astrochemistry, but also\nwith collisional and kinetic databases. A dedicated infrastructure was\ndeveloped to provide a common data format in the various databases enabling\nqueries to a large variety of databases on atomic and molecular data at once.\nFor CDMS, the incorporation in VAMDC was combined with several modifications on\nthe generation of CDMS catalog entries. Here we introduce related changes to\nthe data structure and the data content in the CDMS. The new data scheme allows\nus to incorporate all previous data entries but in addition allows us also to\ninclude entries based on new theoretical descriptions.

We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing\nmodel to simulate the UV/optical lightcurves of NGC 5548. We show that disc\nreprocessing of the observed hard X-ray lightcurve produces optical lightcurves\nwith too much fast variability as well as too short a lag time. Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to\natomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the\nscale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it\nradiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft\nX-ray excess. The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonised disc region emits FUV\nflux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc but while this gives\nreprocessed variable emission which is much closer to the observed UV and\noptical lightcurves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the\ndata. We reverse engineer a solution to match the observations and find that\nthe luminosity and temperature of the lagged emission is not consistent with\nmaterial at the light travel lag distance responding to the irradiating flux\n(either FUV or X-ray) from the AGN. We conclude that the UV/optical lags of NGC\n5548 are not the light travel time from X-ray reprocessing, nor the light\ntravel time from FUV reprocessing, but instead could be the timescale for the\nouter blackbody disc vertical structure to respond to the changing FUV\nillumination. \n\n"}

Reference\n  dynamo solutions Abstract: In this paper we complete the presentation of a new hybrid $2\\times2$D flux\ntransport dynamo (FTD) model of the solar cycle based on the Babcock-Leighton\nmechanism of poloidal magnetic field regeneration via the surface decay of\nbipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). This hybrid model is constructed by allowing\nthe surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to\nprovide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a\nmeridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key\naspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing\nthe probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of\nthe internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to\ncalibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed\ncycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing\nmany solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase\nrelationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field,\nand correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of\nthe next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the\nquenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed\nstatistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a\nsource of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations. The model thus\ncan produce Dalton-like epochs of strongly suppressed cycle amplitude lasting a\nfew cycles and can even shut off entirely following an unfavorable sequence of\nemergence events. \n\n"}

We find remarkable similarity between the optical and gamma-ray\nbehaviour of CTA 102 during the outburst, with a time lag between the two light\ncurves of ~1 hour, indicative of co-spatiality of the optical and gamma-ray\nemission regions. The relation between the gamma-ray and optical fluxes is\nconsistent with the SSC mechanism, with a quadratic dependence of the SSC\ngamma-ray flux on the synchrotron optical flux evident in the post-outburst\nstage. However, the gamma-ray/optical relationship is linear during the\noutburst; we attribute this to changes in the Doppler factor. A strong\nharder-when-brighter spectral dependence is seen both the in gamma-ray and\noptical non-thermal emission. This hardening can be explained by convexity of\nthe UV-NIR spectrum that moves to higher frequencies owing to an increased\nDoppler shift as the viewing angle decreases during the outburst stage. The\noverall pattern of Stokes parameter variations agrees with a model of a\nradiating blob or shock wave that moves along a helical path down the jet. \n\n"}

One of the important facts in\naddressing the flare energetics is the spatialtemporal correlation between the\nwhite-light emission and the hard X-ray radiation, presumably suggesting that\nthe energetic electrons are the energy sources. In this study, we present a\nstatistical analysis of 25 strong flares (?greater than or equal to M5)\nobserved simultaneously by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI).

To quantitatively describe\nthe strength of WL emission, equivalent area (EA) is defined as the integrated\ncontrast enhancement over the entire flaring area. Our results show that the\nequivalent area is inversely proportional to the HXR power index, indicating\nthat stronger WL emission tends to be associated with larger population of high\nenergy electrons. However, no obvious correlation is found between WL emission\nand flux of non-thermal electrons at 50 keV.

In the\nlast few years the digital radio technique for cosmic-ray air showers again\nmade significant progress, and there now is a consistent picture of the\nemission mechanisms confirmed by several measurements. Recent results by the\nantenna arrays AERA and Tunka-Rex confirm that the absolute accuracy for the\nshower energy is as good as the other detection techniques. Moreover, the\nsensitivity to the shower maximum of the radio signal has been confirmed in\ndirect comparison to air-Cherenkov measurements by Tunka-Rex. The dense antenna\narray LOFAR can already compete with the established techniques in accuracy for\ncosmic-ray mass-composition. In the future, a new generation of radio\nexperiments might drive the field: either by providing extremely large exposure\nfor inclined cosmic-ray or neutrino showers or, like the SKA core in Australia\nwith its several 10,000 antennas, by providing extremely detailed measurements. \n\n"}

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

For example, symbiotic stars without shell burning on\ntheir white dwarfs have been revealed through their X-ray emission, UV excess,\nand UV variability. These purely accretion powered symbiotic stars have much\nweaker optical emission lines than those with shell burning, and are therefore\nharder to discover. Yet they may be as numerous as symbiotic stars with shell\nburning. Interestingly, both types of symbiotic stars are capable of driving\nstrong outflows, leading to colliding wind X-ray emission and spatially\nresolved jets. For nova eruptions, the most surprising discovery has been that\nthey are capable of particle acceleration as evidenced by Fermi detection of\nnovae as transient GeV gamma-ray sources. For nova eruptions in cataclysmic\nvariables, this implicates internal shocks, between a slow, dense outflow and a\nfast outflow or wind. Other signatures of shocks include thermal X-rays and\nnon-thermal radio emissions, and a substantial fraction of optical emission may\nbe shock-powered in the early phase of novae. Radio (V959 Mon) and HST (V959\nMon and T Pyx) images of nova shells within a few years of their respective\neruptions suggest that the ejecta from a nova may commonly consist of an\nequatorial ring and a bipolar outflow. \n\n"}

The key property of this environment\nis a rapid decline of density and pressure along the jet, which promotes its\nrapid expansion. Such an expansion can suppress global instabilities, which\nrequire communication across the jet, and hence ensure its survival over huge\ndistances. At kpc scales, some AGN jets do show signs of strong instabilities\nand even turn into plumes. This could be a result of the flattening of the\nexternal pressure distribution in their host galaxies or inside the radio\nlobes.

The object is young and frequently liberating energy in magnetic flares\ndriven by accelerated ambipolar diffusion in the neutron star core, feeding the\nnebula and producing bright millisecond bursts. The particle number in the\nnebula is consistent with ion ejecta from giant flares.

For such a case, the combination of the sail's low mass and\nrelativistic velocity render previous treatments formally incorrect, including\nthat of Einstein himself in his seminal 1905 paper introducing special\nrelativity. To address this, we present formulae for a sail's acceleration,\nfirst in response to a single photon and then extended to an ensemble.

To address this issue, we have developed a new approach\ncombining parametric Bayesian indirect likelihood (pBIL) techniques and\nempirical modeling with realistic image simulations that reproduce a large\nfraction of these selection effects.

In this paper, we implement a new jet feedback scheme into the\nmoving mesh-code arepo, contrast different jet injection techniques and\ndemonstrate the validity of our implementation by comparing against simple\nanalytical models.

We find that TDE host galaxies have atypical photometric properties\ncompared to similar, \"typical\" galaxies. In particular, TDE host galaxies tend\nto live in or near the \"green valley\" between star-forming and passive\ngalaxies, and have bluer bulge colors ($\\Delta (g-r) \\approx 0.3$ mag), lower\nhalf-light surface brightnesses (by ~1 mag/arcsec$^2$), higher Sersic indices\n($\\Delta n_{\\rm g} \\approx 3$), and higher bulge-to-total-light ratios ($\\Delta\nB/T \\approx 0.5$) than galaxies with matched BH masses.

Within the central parts of cool cores the total\nvariance of fluctuations is dominated by isobaric and/or isothermal\nfluctuations on spatial scales ~ 10-60 kpc, which are likely associated with\nslow gas motions and bubbles of relativistic plasma.

Secular\nprocesses play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks strong spiral\nor bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual\nenrichment of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into\nstars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by\nthe feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment, and\nequilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous\ndisc and its descendent stars.

The gravitational interaction is described on the other\nhand by general relativity, based on a dynamical description of space-time at a\nclassical level.\n  Although these models are verified to high precision in the solar system\nexperiments, they suffer from several theoretical weaknesses and a lack of\npredictive power at the Planck scale as well as at cosmological scales; they\nare thus not viewed anymore as fundamental theories. As its phenomenology\ninvolves both these extreme scales, cosmology is then a good laboratory to\nprobe theories going beyond these standard models.\n  The first part of this thesis focus on cosmic strings, topological defects\nforming during the spontaneous symmetry breaking of grand unified theories in\nthe early universe.

Einstein\nsuggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses,\nwhich drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting\nstructures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the\nreasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By\nreconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests\nthat both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The\nmodel is a modified $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that\ncontinuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and\ncan flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic\nuniverse with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing\ncompatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological\nmeasurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative\nmass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms\nhaloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are\nnot cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the\nobserved distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles.

In these binary\nmodels, when the mass of one partner closely approaches the Chandrasekhar\nmaximum for a stable degenerate system, fusion can be initiated and the star\nexplodes. However, there are now a number of indications that fusion could\ninstead be triggered by a phase transition in a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf\nstar. Although these indications provide no clue as to what specific phase\ntransition initiates the explosion, it is possible that remarkable and well\nestablished host galaxy effects as considered in the present work could point\nto a specific source of the energy deposition.

We argue that the standard interpretation of AT2017gfo as\nbeing powered by radioactive decays of r-process elements faces the challenge\nof simultaneously accounting for the peak luminosity and peak time of the\nevent, as it is not easy to achieve the required high mass, and especially the\nlow opacity of the ejecta required to fit the data.

We consider energy injection from two types of the merger\nproducts: (1) a post-merger black hole powered by fallback accretion; and (2) a\nlong-lived NS remnant. The former case can only account for the early emission\nof AT2017gfo, with the late emission still powered by radioactive decay.

Abstract: We explore the ability of gravitational-wave detectors to extract the\nredshift distribution of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. The evolution of the\nmerger rate across redshifts $0 < z \\lesssim 1$ is directly tied to the\nformation and evolutionary processes, providing insight regarding the\nprogenitor formation rate together with the distribution of time delays between\nformation and merger. Because the limiting distance to which BBHs are detected\ndepends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected\nbinaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider\nthe mass and redshift distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate\ndensity, ${dN}/{dm_1\\,dm_2\\,dz}$. Our constraints on the mass distribution\nagree with previously published results, including evidence for an upper mass\ncutoff at $\\sim 40 \\ M_\\odot$. Additionally, we show that the current set of\nsix BBH detections are consistent with a merger rate density that is uniform in\ncomoving volume.

Abstract: Coronal plumes are bright magnetic funnels found in quiet regions (QRs) and\ncoronal holes (CHs). They extend high into the solar corona and last from hours\nto days. The heating processes of plumes involve dynamics of the magnetic field\nat their base, but the processes themselves remain mysterious. Recent\nobservations suggest that plume heating is a consequence of magnetic flux\ncancellation and/or convergence at the plume base. These studies suggest that\nthe base flux in plumes is of mixed polarity, either obvious or hidden in SDO\nHMI data, but do not quantify it. To investigate the magnetic origins of plume\nheating, we select ten unipolar network flux concentrations, four in CHs, four\nin QRs, and two that do not form a plume, and track plume luminosity in SDO AIA\n171 A images along with the base flux in SDO HMI magnetograms, over each flux\nconcentrations lifetime. We find that plume heating is triggered when\nconvergence of the base flux surpasses a field strength of 200 to 600 G. The\nluminosity of both QR and CH plumes respond similarly to the field in the plume\nbase, suggesting that the two have a common formation mechanism.

The most extinguished GRBs are preferentially found in the more\nmassive hosts and the UV bump is preferentially found in the most extinguished\nGRB l.o.s.

To this aim, realistic simulations probing BH dynamics in unequal-mass\ndisc galaxy mergers, into and beyond the binary hardening stage, are performed\nby combining smooth particle hydrodynamics and direct $N$-body codes. The\nstructural properties and orbits of the galaxies are chosen to be consistent\nwith the results of galaxy formation simulations. Stellar and dark matter\ndistributions are triaxial down to the central 100 pc of merger remnant. In all\ncases, a BH binary forms and hardens on time-scales of at most 100~Myr,\ncoalescing on another few hundred Myr time-scale, depending on the\ncharacteristic density and orbital eccentricity. Overall, the sinking of the BH\nbinary takes no more than $\\sim$0.5~Gyr after the merger of the two galaxies is\ncompleted, but can be much faster for very plunging orbits. Comparing with\nprevious numerical simulations following the decay of BHs in massive early-type\ngalaxies at $z \\sim 3$, we confirm that the characteristic density is the most\ncrucial parameter determining the overall BH merging time-scale, despite the\nstructural diversity of the host galaxies.

We selected five hot LBV candidates in\nM33 to refine their classification, investigate their circumstellar\nenvironments and explore their evolutionary properties. Being accessible\ntargets in the near-infrared, we conducted medium-resolution spectroscopy with\nGNIRS/GEMINI in the $K-$band to investigate their molecular circumstellar\nenvironments.

This\ncharacteristic scale reduces as more and more regions move into emission with\ntime. Ultimately, small-scale fluctuations within heated regions come to\ndominate the normalised bispectrum, which at the end of the simulation is\nalmost entirely driven by fluctuations in the density field.

Spin determination from\n  disc-Comptonisation efficiency method Abstract: [Abridged] In our previous work on Ark 120, we found that its 2014 X-ray\nspectrum is dominated by Comptonisation, while the relativistic reflection\nemission only originates at tens of $R_{\\rm g}$ from the SMBH. As a result, we\ncould not constrain the SMBH spin from disc reflection alone. Our aim is to\ndetermine its SMBH spin from an alternative technique based on the global\nenergetics of the disc-corona system. The spectral analysis uses simultaneous\nXMM-Newton (OM and pn) and NuSTAR observations on 2014 March 22 and 2013\nFebruary 18. We applied the optxconv model (based on optxagnf) to self\nconsistently reproduce the emission from the inner corona (warm and hot thermal\nComptonisation) and the outer disc (colour temperature corrected black body),\ntaking into account both the disc inclination angle and relativistic effects.\nWe modelled the mild relativistic reflection of the incident Comptonisation\ncomponents using the xilconv model. We infer a SMBH spin of\n0.83$^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$, adopting the SMBH reverberation mass of\n1.50$\\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$. In addition, we find that the coronal radius\ndecreases with increasing flux (by about a factor of two), from\n85$^{+13}_{-10}$ $R_{\\rm g}$ in 2013 to 14$\\pm$3 $R_{\\rm g}$ in 2014. This is\nthe first time that such a constraint is obtained for a SMBH spin from this\ntechnique, thanks to the bare properties of Ark 120, its well determined SMBH\nmass, and the presence of a mild relativistic reflection component in 2014\nwhich allows us to constrain the disc inclination angle. We caution that these\nresults depend on the detailed disc-corona structure, which is not yet fully\nestablished.

Under the assumption of an\ninitial Fe ([Fe/H] = -3) and O inventory due to the prompt production by the\nfirst very massive stars, the data at -3 < [Fe/H] < -1 are interpreted to\nresult from the addition of O and Fe only from type II supernovae (SNII) to the\nprompt inventory.

Consequently, the first stars created in small\nearly-forming galaxies are less metal-rich that the first stars formed in more\nmassive galaxies which typically form later. As most halo stars are likely to\noriginate in accreted dwarfs, while disk stars formed out of outflow-enriched\ngas, this scenario naturally generates a ``metallicity floor'' for old disk\nstars, which we find to be roughly coincident with the higher end of our\npredicted metallicity distribution of halo stars, in agreement with\nobservations.

Surrounding these density enhancements is hot, tenuous gas where coronal\ndissipation processes occur. We expect this situation to be most relevant when\nthe accretion rate is close to Eddington and the disc is radiation-pressure\ndominated, and so may apply to Narrow-Line Seyfert~1 (NLS1) galaxies. In this\nscenario, the hard X-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so the\ndetected X-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of the\nsheets. A simple Comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indices\ncharacteristic of NLS1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closely\nsurrounding the hard X-ray source. We test this model by fitting the XMM-Newton\nspectrum of the NLS1 1H 0707-495 between 0.5 and 11 keV with reflection\ndominated ionized disc models. A very good fit is found with three different\nreflectors each subject to the same \\Gamma=2.35 power-law.

To obtain the radiation\nspectrum in the classical domain a general expression for the spectral\ndistribution and characteristic frequency of an electron in arbitrary motion is\nderived by using Schwinger's method. The radiation patterns of the\nultrarelativistic electron are represented in terms of the acceleration of the\nparticle.

However, in contrast to previous claims, the\nmerger remnants are very anisotropic with values of the anisotropy parameter\nthat are similar to equal-mass merger remnants that form boxy, slowly rotating\nellipticals.

This behavior can be\naccounted for by precession of the radiopulsar, an interpretation that is\nreinforced by the detection of variations in its pulse profile on the same\ntimescale. Here, we model the period residuals from PSR B1828-11 in terms of\nprecession of a triaxial rigid body. We include two contributions to the\nresiduals: (i) the geometric effect, which arises because the times at which\nthe pulsar emission beam points toward the observer varies with precession\nphase; (ii) the spindown contribution, which arises from any dependence of the\nspindown torque acting on the pulsar on the angle between its spin and magnetic\naxes. We use the data to probe numerous properties of the pulsar, most notably\nits shape, and the dependence of its spindown torque on the angle between its\nspin and magnetic axes, for which we assume a sum of a spin-aligned component\n(with a weight 1-a) and a dipolar component perpendicular to the magnetic beam\naxis (weight a), rather than the vacuum dipole torque (a=1). We find that a\nvariety of shapes are consistent with the residuals, with a slight statistical\npreference for a prolate star. Moreover, a range of torque possibilities fit\nthe data equally well, with no strong preference for the vacuum model. In the\ncase of a prolate star we find evidence for an angle-dependent spindown torque.\nOur results show that the combination of geometrical and spin-down effects\nassociated with precession can account for the principal features of PSR\nB1828-11's timing behavior, without fine tuning of the parameters. \n\n"}

We detect and characterize these\nresonances in N-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radial\nfrequencies of individual orbits. We found narrow peaks in the distribution of\norbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. We\nfound five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.\nThe corotation resonance and the inner and outer Lindblad resonances are the\nmost populated. The spatial distributions of particles near resonances are\nwide. For example, the inner Lindblad resonance is not localized at a given\nradius. Particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar and\nspan a wide range of radii. On the other hand, particles near the corotation\nresonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable Lagrange\npoints. The distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.\nResonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. Our analysis\nof orbits in both N-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicates\nthat resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trapped\nmaterial. Only if the bar evolves as a whole, resonances drift through the\nphase space. In this case particles anchored near resonant orbits track the\nresonance shift and evolve. The criteria to ensure a correct resonant behavior\ndiscussed in Weinberg & Katz (2007a) can be achieved with few millions\nparticles because the regions of trapped orbits near resonances are large and\nevolving. \n\n"}

To\nmitigate the global effects of gravitational softening, Poisson's equation for\nthe disk is solved by expanding the density and potential of the galaxy in a\nset of basis functions.\n  Our results indicate that a bar can be completely destroyed in a time much\nsmaller than a Hubble time if the central mass exceeds about 0.5% of the disk\nmass. Since the implied minimum BH mass for bar destruction is of order\n10^{8.5} solar masses for a typical disk galaxy, this process should not be a\nrare phenomenon. The bar amplitude decreases gradually with time after the BH\nis added, and the rate at which the bar is destroyed increases with increasing\nBH mass.

KK gravitons may be\nproduced via quantum fluctuations during a de Sitter (dS) inflating phase of\nour brane universe.

Recent observations of\nLi6 in halo stars suggest a pre--galactic origin of this isotope, which is\nexceedingly difficult to explain by putative high redshift cosmic ray\npopulations. We investigate if one or both of these lithium problems may be\nsolved by late decaying relic particles in the Constrained Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) coupled to gravity. Assuming that the\ngravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) we find that in large\nparts of the CMSSM parameter space either of these problems can be potentially\nsolved. In particular, we also find solutions where both lithium problems may\nbe solved simultaneously.
