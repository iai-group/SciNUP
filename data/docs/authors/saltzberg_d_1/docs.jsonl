Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Such a low M_max,\ndue to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too\nmassive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally\nexplain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand,\nrecent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This\ncontradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within\nscenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter\nmodels with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange\nN-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and\ndeconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar\ncore collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently\nhot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid\nso as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun. In the\nsecond scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to\nmaterialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then,\nstellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density \\rho_crit is\nreached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at\nM=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition\nM^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark\ndeconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =~ M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun,\nwhich is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807.

The stress\ndistribution of second order around the screw dislocation is classically known\nfor the hollow circular cylinder with traction-free external and internal\nboundaries. The inner boundary surrounds the dislocation's core, which is not\ncaptured by the conventional solution. The present gauge approach enables us to\ncontinue the classically known quadratic stresses inside the core. The gauge\nequation is chosen in the Hilbert--Einstein form, and it plays the role of\nnon-conventional incompatibility law. The stress function method is used, and\nit leads to the modified stress potential given by two constituents: the\nconventional one, say, the `background' and a short-ranged gauge contribution.\nThe latter just causes additional stresses, which are localized. The asymptotic\nproperties of the resulting stresses are studied. Since the gauge contributions\nare short-ranged, the background stress field dominates sufficiently far from\nthe core. The outer cylinder's boundary is traction-free. At sufficiently\nmoderate distances, the second order stresses acquire regular continuation\nwithin the core region, and the cut-off at the core does not occur.

One of the solutions is the\ncase of a parabolic jet being accelerated by the pressure gradient as it\npropagates through a medium with pressure declining as p(z)\\propto z^{-2}. As\nthe jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into the\nambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, while\nthe magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet.\nSuch jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle\n\\theta_j at distance z is smaller than about 1/\\gamma, where \\gamma is the\ncharacteristic bulk Lorentz-factor at this distance; otherwise, different parts\nof the jet cannot maintain causal contact.

These are commonly\ncalled WNL stars (e.g., WN7h), but this new shorthand avoids confusion because\nthere are late-type WN stars without H and early-type WN stars with H. Clearly\ndifferentiating WNH stars from H-free WN stars is critical when discussing\nprogenitors of Type Ib/c SNe and GRBs -- the massive WNH stars are not likely\nSN progenitors, and are distinct from core-He burning WR stars. We show that\nthe masses of WNH stars are systematically higher than H-poor WR stars (both WN\nand WC), with little overlap, while H mass fractions of luminous WNH stars\nexceed those of LBVs. We favor the interpretation that the most luminous WNH\nstars are still core-H burning, pre-LBVs. While on the main sequence, a star's\nmass is reduced due to winds while its luminosity slowly rises, so the star\nincreases its Eddington factor and mass-loss rate, pushing it even closer to\nthe Eddington limit. With this feedback, observed masses and mass-loss rates of\nWNH stars are a natural outcome near the end of core-H burning.

To address this problem\nwe combine our earlier developed quark recombination model with quark\nphase-space distributions computed from relativistic Langevin simulations in an\nexpanding Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Hadronization is based on resonance\nformation within a Boltzmann equation which recovers thermal equilibrium and\nobeys energy conservation in the quark-coalescence process, while the fireball\nbackground is adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations of semi-central Au-Au\ncollisions at RHIC.

The induced motion of\nthe gas is coherent over the scale of the entire disk and is fast enough that\nit could be observable in features such as relativistic iron lines. The\neccentricity of the associated fluid element trajectories increases with\ndecreasing radius, leading to a crowding of orbit trajectories near their\napocenters. This results in a local density enhancement akin to a compression.\nThese compressions are sufficiently strong to produce a pair of weak shocks in\nthe vicinity of the black hole. These shocks are roughly aligned with the\nline-of-nodes between the black-hole symmetry plane and disk midplane, with one\nshock above the line-of-nodes on one side of the black hole and the other below\non the opposite side.

We explore the impact that X-ray ionizations\nhave on the power spectrum (PS) of 21-cm fluctuations by varying both the\naverage X-ray MFP and the fractional contribution of X-rays to reionization. In\ngeneral, prior to the epoch when the intergalactic medium is dominated by\nionized regions (H {\\sevensize II} regions), X-ray-induced ionization enhances\nfluctuations on spatial scales smaller than the X-ray MFP, provided that X-ray\nheating does not strongly supress galaxy formation. Conversely, at later times\nwhen \\H2 regions dominate, small-scale fluctuations in the 21-cm signal are\nsuppressed by X-ray ionization.

We discuss some of the major advances, which include, first\nof all, formulating of the analytical model of RATs. This model was shown to\nreproduce well the torques acting on actual irregular dust grains and allowed\nstudies of the parameter space for which the alignment happens with long axes\nperpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. Such a study resulted in an\nimportant conclusion that, without any paramagnetic relaxation, the RAT\nalignment always happens for interstellar grains with long axes perpendicular\nto the magnetic field. We show that the gaseous bombardment in some cases\nincreases the degree of alignment by knocking out grains from the positions of\nimperfect alignment when the grains rotate slowly to more stable positions of\nperfect alignment where grains rotate fast. In terms of pinwheel torques,\nimportant revisions have been made in the Lazarian and Draine model of grain\nflipping and thermal trapping. Those, however, do not change the major\nconclusion that very small grains (i.e. grain size smaller than ~0.03 micron)\nshould be marginally aligned. Recent work made the RAT alignment a predictive\ntheory which is ready for quantitative modeling of astrophysical polarization.\nWe predict that the microwave emission from the Zodiacal dust presents an\nimportant contaminant, which should be included into foreground polarization\ntemplates. \n\n"}

Renewed interest in this old\nproblem is driven by the prospects of detecting gravitational waves from\nstrongly gravitating binaries with extreme mass ratios. We begin here with a\nsummary of recent advances in the theory of gravitational self-interaction in\ncurved spacetime, and proceed to survey some of the ideas and computational\nstrategies devised for implementing this theory in the case of a particle\norbiting a Kerr black hole. We review in detail two of these methods: (i) the\nstandard mode-sum method, in which the metric perturbation is regularized\nmode-by-mode in a multipole decomposition, and (ii) $m$-mode regularization,\nwhereby individual azimuthal modes of the metric perturbation are regularized\nin 2+1 dimensions. We discuss several practical issues that arise, including\nthe choice of gauge, the numerical representation of the particle singularity,\nand how high-frequency contributions near the particle are dealt with in\nfrequency-domain calculations.

Our analysis is based on the combination of data from deep\nSpitzer surveys in the VVDS-SWIRE and GOODS areas.

A\nclear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the\npulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse linear\nrelationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective\ntemperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-AGB\nstar evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity.

We estimate the\ngalaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The\ntrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and\natomic gas.

The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility\nof significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.\nFive such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical\nafterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are\nsystematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst\ndensities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),\nor to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray\nfluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale\nenvironments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying\nhosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near\neach burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence\n(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10\",\nwhile somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with\nfaint galaxies at separations of ~2\".

In the plausible range of parameters, the narrow flux\nvariability in the EeV energy region assures low but detectable rates for\nIceCube (0.06-0.2 neutrino per year) and the Pierre Auger Observatory\n(0.03-0.06 neutrino per year), and detection should happen in the next decade.\nIf EeV neutrinos are detected, PeV information can help select between\ncompeting models of cosmic ray composition at the highest energy and the\nGalactic to extragalactic transition at ankle energies. With improved\nsensitivity, ZeV neutrino observatories, such as ANITA and JEM-EUSO could\nexplore and place limits on the maximum acceleration energy. \n\n"}

As the real universe is not homogeneous there are\nseveral methods to calculate the correction. The weak lensing approximation and\nthe Dyer-Roeder relation are one of them. This paper establishes a link between\nthese two approximations. It is shown that if the universe is homogeneous with\nonly small, vanishing after averaging, density fluctuations along the line of\nsight, then the distance correction is negligible. It is also shown that a\nvanishing 3D average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of\ndensity fluctuations along the line of sight is zero. In this case, even within\nthe linear approximation, the distance correction is not negligible. The\nmodified version of the Dyer-Roeder relation is presented and it is shown that\nthis modified relation is consistent with the correction obtained within the\nweak lensing approximation.

In particular, we study the case were the modified relations do not\nviolate the WKB condition at early times, focusing on a particular example\nwhich is exactly solvable: the Jacobson-Corley dispersion relation with quartic\ncorrection with positive coefficient to the squared linear relation. We find\nthat the corrections to the standard result for the bispectrum are suppressed\nby a factor $\\frac{H^2}{p_c^2}$ where $p_c$ is the scale where the modification\nto the dispersion relation becomes relevant. The modification is {\\it mildly}\nconfiguration-dependent and equilateral configurations are more suppressed with\nrespect to the local ones, by a factor of one percent. There is no\nconfiguration leading to enhancements. We then analyze the results in the\nframework of particle creation using the approximate gluing method of\nBrandenberger and Martin, which relates more directly to the modeling of the\ntrans-Planckian physics via modifications of the vacuum at a certain cutoff\nscale.

The AD produces\nthe ionizing continuum which powers the broad and narrow emission lines. The\nmaximum AD effective temperature is given by Teff=fmax(Mdot/M^2)^1/4, where M\nis the black hole mass, Mdot the accretion rate, and fmax is set by the black\nhole spin a_*. For a low enough value of Mdot/M^2 the AD may become too cold to\nproduce ionizing photons. Such an object will form a lineless quasar. This\noccurs for a local blackbody (BB) AD with a luminosity Lopt=10^46 erg/s for\nM>3.6E9 Msun, when a_*=0, and for M>1.4E10 Msun, when a_*=0.998. Using the AD\nbased Mdot, derived from M and Lopt, and the reverberation based M, derived\nfrom Lopt and the Hbeta FWHM, v, gives Teff \\propto Lopt^-0.13v^-1.45. Thus,\nTeff is mostly set by v. Quasars with a local BB AD become lineless for v>\n8,000 km/s, when a_*=0, and for v> 16,000 km/s, when a_*=0.998. Higher values\nof v are required if the AD is hotter than a local BB. The AD becoming\nnon-ionizing may explain why line emitting quasars with v>10,000 km/s are rare.\nWeak low ionization lines may still be present if the X-ray continuum is\nluminous enough, and such objects may form a population of weak emission line\nquasars (WLQ). If correct, such WLQ should show a steeply falling SED at\nlambda<1000A.

In this paper we analyse the\ngamma-ray emission measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in the energy\nrange from 100 MeV to 100 GeV in order to probe the gas and cosmic-ray content\nover the scale of the whole Cygnus complex. The signal from bright pulsars is\nlargely reduced by selecting photons in their off-pulse phase intervals. We\ncompare the diffuse gamma-ray emission with interstellar gas maps derived from\nradio/mm-wave lines and visual extinction data, and a global model of the\nregion, including other pulsars and gamma-ray sources, is sought. The integral\nHI emissivity and its spectral energy distribution are both consistent within\nthe systematics with LAT measurements in the interstellar space near the solar\nsystem.

We provide a transparent analytical\nderivation of the spectral intensities of muon neutrinos and muons generated in\nthe Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays.

Gas, CRs and field flow back along the cavity\nsurface in a \"boundary backflow\" consistent with detailed FRII observations.\nComputed ages of backflowing CRs are consistent with observed radio-synchrotron\nage variations only if shear instabilities in the boundary backflow are damped\nand we assume this is done with viscosity of unknown origin.

Applicability Limitations of a Popular\n  Formula for the Tidal Torque Abstract: Tidal torques play a key role in rotational dynamics of celestial bodies.\nThey govern these bodies' tidal despinning, and also participate in the subtle\nprocess of entrapment of these bodies into spin-orbit resonances. This makes\ntidal torques directly relevant to the studies of habitability of planets and\ntheir moons.\n  Our work begins with an explanation of how friction and lagging should be\nbuilt into the theory of bodily tides. Although much of this material can be\nfound in various publications, a short but self-consistent summary on the topic\nhas been lacking in the hitherto literature, and we are filling the gap.\n  After these preparations, we address a popular concise formula for the tidal\ntorque, which is often used in the literature, for planets or stars.We explain\nwhy the derivation of this expression, offered in the paper by Goldreich (1966;\nAJ 71, 1 - 7) and in the books by Kaula (1968, eqn. 4.5.29), and Murray &\nDermott (1999, eqn. 4.159), implicitly sets the time lag to be frequency\nindependent. Accordingly, the ensuing expression for the torque can be applied\nonly to bodies having a very special (and very hypothetical) rheology which\nmakes the time lag frequency independent, i.e, the same for all Fourier modes\nin the spectrum of tide. This expression for the torque should not be used for\nbodies of other rheologies. Specifically, the expression cannot be combined\nwith an extra assertion of the geometric lag (or the phase lag) being constant,\nbecause at finite eccentricities the said assumption is incompatible with the\nconstant-time-lag condition. \n\n"}

The detection of non-thermal emission from SNRs\ndemonstrates the presence of energetic particles, but direct signatures of\nprotons and other ions remain elusive. If these particles receive a sizeable\nfraction of the explosion energy, the morphological and spectral evolution of\nthe SNR must be modified. To assess this, we run 3D hydrodynamic simulations of\na remnant coupled with a non-linear acceleration model. We obtain the\ntime-dependent evolution of the shocked structure, impacted by the\nRayleigh-Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities at the contact discontinuity and by\nthe back-reaction of particles at the forward shock. We then compute the\nprogressive temperature equilibration and non-equilibrium ionization state of\nthe plasma, and its thermal emission in each cell. This allows us to produce\nthe first realistic synthetic maps of the projected X-ray emission from the\nSNR. Plasma conditions (temperature, ionization age) can vary widely over the\nprojected surface of the SNR, especially between the ejecta and the ambient\nmedium owing to their different composition. This demonstrates the need for\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy. We find that the integrated emission is\nreduced with particle back-reaction, with the effect being more significant for\nthe highest photon energies. Therefore different energy bands, corresponding to\ndifferent emitting elements, probe different levels of the impact of particle\nacceleration. Our work provides a framework for the interpretation of SNR\nobservations with current X-ray missions (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Suzaku) and with\nupcoming X-ray missions (such as Astro-H). \n\n"}

The transition is studied using the Polyakov loop model, with\nthe initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small\nneighborhood of the confining vacuum $l \\simeq 0$, as appropriate for $T <\nT_c$. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations.

Abstract: Based on kinematic data observed for very young, massive clusters that appear\nto be in dynamical equilibrium, it has recently been argued that such young\nsystems set examples where the early residual gas-expulsion did not happen or\nhad no dynamical effect. The intriguing scenario of a star cluster forming\nthrough a single starburst has thereby been challenged. Choosing the case of\nthe R136 cluster of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the most cited one in this\ncontext, we perform direct N-body computations that mimic the early evolution\nof this cluster including the gas-removal phase (on a thermal timescale). Our\ncalculations show that under plausible initial conditions as consistent from\nobservational data, a large fraction (> 60%) of a gas-expelled, expanding\nR136-like cluster is bound to regain dynamical equilibrium by its current age.\nTherefore, the recent measurements of velocity dispersion in the inner regions\nof R136, that indicate that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, are\nconsistent with an earlier substantial gas expulsion of R136 followed by a\nrapid re-virialization (in approx. 1 Myr). Additionally, we find that the less\nmassive Galactic NGC 3603 Young Cluster (NYC), with a substantially longer\nre-virialization time, is likely to be found deviated from dynamical\nequilibrium at its present age (approx. 1 Myr). The recently obtained stellar\nproper motions in the central part of the NYC indeed suggest this and are\nconsistent with the computed models. This work significantly extends previous\nmodels of the Orion Nebula Cluster which already demonstrated that the\nre-virialization time of young post-gas-expulsion clusters decreases with\nincreasing pre-expulsion density. \n\n"}

This hypothesis is\nmotivated by two characteristics found generically in simulations of binaries\nembedded in prograde accretion discs: (i) the formation of a central,\nlow-density cavity around the binary, and (ii) the leakage of gas into this\ncavity, occurring once per orbit via discrete streams on nearly radial\ntrajectories. The first feature would reduce the emergent optical/UV flux of\nthe system relative to active galactic nuclei powered by single SMBHs, while\nthe second can trigger quasiperiodic fluctuations in luminosity. I argue that\nthe quasiperiodic accretion signature may be much more dramatic than previously\nthought, because the infalling gas streams can strongly shock-heat via\nself-collision and tidal compression, thereby enhancing viscous accretion. Any\noptically thick gas that is circularized about either SMBH can accrete before\nthe next pair of streams is deposited, fueling transient, luminous flares that\nrecur every orbit. Due to the diminished flux in between accretion episodes,\nsuch cavity-accretion flares could plausibly be mistaken for the tidal\ndisruptions of stars in quiescent nuclei. The flares could be distinguished\nfrom tidal disruption events if their quasiperiodic recurrence is observed, or\nif they are produced by very massive SMBHs that cannot disrupt solar-type\nstars. They may be discovered serendipitously in surveys such as LSST or\neROSITA. I present a heuristic toy model as a proof of concept for the\nproduction of cavity-accretion flares, and generate mock light curves and\nspecta. I also apply the model to the active galaxy OJ 287, whose production of\nquasiperiodic pairs of optical flares has long fueled speculation that it hosts\na SMBH binary. \n\n"}

In an earlier paper, we have\npresented a Chandra data analysis of the coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclined\ndisc galaxies. Here we study the correlation of the X-ray measurements with\nother galaxy properties and compare the results with those obtained for\nelliptical galaxies. A good correlation is present between the coronal\nluminosity Lx and the SFR. But we find a better correlation between Lx and the\ntotal SN mechanical energy input rate (ESN), including the expected\ncontribution from core collapsed (CC) and Ia SNe. The X-ray radiation\nefficiency (eta=Lx/ESN) has a mean value of ~0.4% with an rms of ~0.5dex. eta\nfurther correlates with MTF/M* (MTF is the baryon mass measured from the\nrotation velocity and the Tully-Fisher relation, M* is the stellar mass\nmeasured from the K-band luminosity) and the CC SN rate surface density (FSN,\nin units of SN/yr/kpc^2), which can be characterized as: eta=0.41%MTF/M* and\neta=1.4%FSN^-0.3. These correlations reflect the roles played by the\ngravitational mass and energetic feedback concentrations in determining eta.\nThe characteristic temperature of the corona shows little dependence on the\ntotal or specific SFR, the cold gas content, or Lx. The coronae of disc\ngalaxies tend to be more X-ray luminous, hotter, and lower in Fe/O abundance\nratio than those of elliptical ones of similar masses. Early-type non-starburst\ndisc galaxies tend to be more Fe-rich, while starburst ones have a roughly\nconstant abundance ratio of Fe/O~0.36solar. Our results are consistent with the\ncoronal gas being mainly provided by stellar feedback in a mass range of\nM*~10^{8.7-11}Msun. In addition, processes such as charge exchange at cool/hot\ngas interfaces, as well as various environmental effects, are also needed to\nexplain the diversity of coronal properties. \n\n"}

We explore this issue by comparing a suite of Gadget-3 SPH simulations\nof idealised (i.e., non-cosmological) isolated discs and galaxy mergers with\notherwise identical calculations performed using the moving-mesh code Arepo.\nWhen black hole (BH) accretion and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback are\nnot included, the star formation histories (SFHs) obtained from the two codes\nagree well. When BHs are included, the code- and resolution-dependent\nvariations in the SFHs are more significant, but the agreement is still good,\nand the stellar mass formed over the course of a simulation is robust to\nvariations in the numerical method. During a merger, the gas morphology and\nphase structure are initially similar prior to the starburst phase. However,\nonce a hot gaseous halo has formed from shock heating and AGN feedback (when\nincluded), the agreement is less good. In particular, during the post-starburst\nphase, the SPH simulations feature more prominent hot gaseous haloes and\nspurious clumps, whereas with Arepo, gas clumps and filaments are less apparent\nand the hot halo gas can cool more efficiently.

One of the main uncertainties in quantifying SN\nrates from double-detonations is the (assumed) retention efficiency of He-rich\nmatter.

In addition, we test\nhow the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a\ndetonation in the helium shell. In comparing the results to our standard case\n(Ruiter et al. 2011), we find that regardless of the adopted He accretion\nprescription, the SN rates are reduced by only 25% if low-mass He shells (<\n0.05 Msun) are sufficient to trigger the detonations.

Depending on the nature of the light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion,\nreal or complex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set lower bounds to m_chi\nin the range 0.5 - 5 MeV (m_chi/m_e > 1 - 10), and they identify best fit\nvalues for m_chi in the range 5 - 10 MeV. The joint BBN + CMB analysis finds a\nbest fit value for the number of equivalent neutrinos, Delta N_nu ~ 0.65,\nnearly independent of the nature of the WIMP. In the absence of a light WIMP\n(m_chi > 20 MeV), N_eff = 3.05(1 + Delta N_nu /3). In this case, there is\nexcellent agreement between BBN and the CMB, but the joint fit reveals Delta\nN_nu = 0.40+-0.17, disfavoring standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN) (Delta\nN_nu = 0) at ~ 2.4 sigma, as well as a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1) at ~\n3.5 sigma. The best BBN + CMB joint fit disfavors the absence of dark radiation\n(Delta N_nu = 0 at ~ 95% confidence), while allowing for the presence of a\nsterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1 at ~ 1 sigma). For all cases considered here,\nthe lithium problem persists. These results, presented at the TAUP 2013\nConference, are based on Nollett & Steigman (2013). \n\n"}

However, some\nchanges can be subtle and not distinguishable using standard statistical\napproaches. Here, we report a methodology that aims to identify distinct but\nsimilar states of time variability. We apply this method to the Galactic\nsupermassive black hole, where 2.2 um flux is observed from a source associated\nwith SgrA*, and where two distinct states have recently been suggested.

In this paper we show that most\nLLAGN present extended jet radio emission when observed with sufficient angular\nresolution and sensitivity. They are thus able to power, at least, parsec-scale\nradio jets. To increase the detection rate of jets in LLAGN, we analyze\nsubarcsecond resolution data of three low-ionization nuclear emission regions.\nThis yields the detection of extended jet-like radio structures in NGC\\,1097\nand NGC\\,2911 and the first resolved parsec-scale jet of NGC\\,4594 (Sombrero).\nThe three sources belong to a sample of nearby LLAGN for which\nhigh-spatial-resolution spectral energy distribution of their core emission is\navailable. This allows us to study their accretion rate and jet power\n($Q_\\mathrm{jet}$) without drawing on (most) of the ad hoc assumptions usually\nconsidered in large statistical surveys. We find that those LLAGN with\nlarge-scale radio jets ($>$100 pc) have $Q_\\mathrm{jet} > 10^{42}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, while the lowest $Q_\\mathrm{jet}$ correspond to those LLAGN with\nparsec-scale ($\\leq$100 pc) jets.

Our detection of parsec-scale jets in individual objects\nfurther shows that the kinematic jet contribution is equally important in\nlarge- or parsec-scale objects. We also find that the Eddington-scaled\naccretion rate is still highly sub-Eddington ($<10^{-4}$) when adding the\n$Q_\\mathrm{jet}$ to the total emitted luminosity (radiated plus kinetic). This\nindicates that LLAGN are not only inefficient radiators but that they also\naccrete inefficiently or are very efficient advectors. \n\n"}

We start with a short review of the\nhistorical milestones on the path of constructing statistical-thermal models\nfor heavy-ion physics. We discovered that Heinz Koppe formulated in 1948 an\nalmost complete recipe for the statistical-thermal models. In 1950, Enrico\nFermi generalized this statistical approach, in which he started with a general\ncross-section formula and inserted into it simplifying assumptions about the\nmatrix element of the interaction process that likely reflects many features of\nthe high-energy reactions dominated by density in the phase space of final\nstates. In 1964, Hagedorn systematically analysed the high-energy phenomena\nusing all tools of statistical physics and introduced the concept of limiting\ntemperature based on the statistical bootstrap model. It turns to be quite\noften that many-particle systems can be studied with the help of\nstatistical-thermal methods. The analysis of yield multiplicities in\nhigh-energy collisions gives an overwhelming evidence for the chemical\nequilibrium in the final state. The strange particles might be an exception, as\nthey are suppressed at lower beam energies. However, their relative yields\nfulfill statistical equilibrium, as well. We review the equilibrium\nstatistical-thermal models for particle production, fluctuations and collective\nflow in heavy-ion experiments. We also review their reproduction of the lattice\nQCD thermodynamics at vanishing and finite chemical potential. During the last\ndecade, five conditions have been suggested to describe the universal behavior\nof the chemical freeze out parameters. \n\n"}

LT2 will be a 4-metre\nclass facility co-located with the LT at the Observatorio del Roque de Los\nMuchachos on the Canary island of La Palma. The telescope will be designed for\nextremely rapid response: the aim is that the telescope will take data within\n30 seconds of the receipt of a trigger from another facility. The motivation\nfor this is twofold: firstly it will make it a world-leading facility for the\nstudy of fast fading transients and explosive phenomena discovered at early\ntimes. Secondly, it will enable large-scale programmes of low-to-intermediate\nresolution spectral classification of transients to be performed with great\nefficiency. In the target-rich environment of the LSST era, minimising\nacquisition overheads will be key to maximising the science gains from any\nfollow-up programme.

We employ an optimized energy\nrange for our analysis (3.2-5.3 keV) that is relatively free of instrumental\nfeatures, and a baseline plasma emission model that incorporates the abundances\nof elements with the strongest expected emission lines at these energies (S,\nAr, Ca) as free parameters.

The\nenergies and fluxes of these features are broadly consistent with previous\nclaims, although the radial variation of the line strength appears in tension\nwith standard dark matter (DM) model predictions. Assuming a decaying DM origin\nfor the Perseus emission features allows us to predict the energies and line\nfluxes for the other clusters in our sample.

The discovery of pulsed radio emission from a few magnetars\nweakened the idea of a clean separation between magnetars and normal pulsars.\nWe use the partially screened gap (PSG) model to explain radio emission of\nmagnetars. The PSG model requires that the temperature of the polar cap is\nequal to the so-called critical value, i.e., the temperature at which the\nthermal ions outflowing from the stellar surface screen the acceleration gap.\nWe show that a magnetar has to fulfill the temperature, power, and visibility\nconditions in order to emit radio waves. First, in order to form PSG, the\nresidual temperature of the surface has to be lower than the critical value.\nSecond, since the radio emission is powered by the rotational energy, it has to\nbe high enough to enable heating of the polar cap by backstreaming particles to\nthe critical temperature. Finally, the structure of the magnetic field has to\nbe altered by magnetospheric currents in order to widen a radio beam and\nincrease the probability of detection.

In this spirit, a correlation between disk emission and jet emission\ncan be formed even if the mean luminosity of disk emission keeps constant. In\nthis work, these correlations are found in the situation that the luminosity of\ndisk emission is variable and kept with a constant mean value. The obtained\ncorrelations may be shallower than that of the fundamental plane of black hole\nactivity. In addition, the slope of correlation may increase with increasing\nobserved frequency of jet emission. For the luminosities spacing with three\ndays, the slope of correlation decreases with increasing black hole mass. The\ndeviation of our found correlations from that of the fundamental plane is\nrelated to the suppression of variability in the jet emission in comparison\nwith that in the disk emission. This mechanism may work in some sources in\nwhich shallower correlations have been reported. Moreover, it implies that\nluminosities used to estimate the relation of fundamental plane should cover an\nappropriate timescale, in which the variability of jet emission is not\nsignificantly suppressed. \n\n"}

This technique is tailored specifically to data from\nthe Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey.\nBecause LAMOST obtains roughly 3000 stellar spectra simultaneously within each\n~5-degree diameter \"plate\" that is observed, we can use the stellar parameters\nof the observed stars to account for the stellar luminosity function and target\nselection effects.

However, to improve coverage of the radio power vs.\nredshift plane at the lowest radio powers, a new faint radio sample is\nintroduced. This covers 0.8 sq. deg., in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field, to a\n1.4 GHz flux density limit of $S_{\\rm 1.4 GHz} \\geq 100~\\mu$Jy, with 99%\nredshift completeness.

In this work we show\nthat the high multiplicity events observed in ALICE stem from primary cosmic\nrays with energies above $10^{16}$ eV and that the frequency of these events\ncan be successfully described by assuming a heavy mass composition of primary\ncosmic rays in this energy range.

The\nspectral index of the radio halo is remarkably uniform ($\\alpha = -1.16$, with\nan intrinsic scatter of $\\leq 0.04$). The observed radio relic spectral index\ngives a Mach number of $\\mathcal{M} = 2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$, assuming diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA).

We aim at computing accurately the complete reprocessed spectrum\n(thermal bump + reflected) of black-hole binaries over the entire X-ray band.\nWe also determine the strength of the direct component.

We discuss the\ndependence of the local and ray-traced spectra on the emission angle and spin.\n  Results. We show the importance of the angle dependence of the total disk\nspecific intensity spectrum emitted by the illuminated atmosphere when the\nthermal disk emission if fully taken into account.

An alternative explanation, first suggested by Williams & Berger\n(2016b), is that the identified counterpart may instead be a compact AGN.

Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of\nmultivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular,\nthe diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite\nnaturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum\nParsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the\nanalyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve\nthe major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their\ndiscretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an\nunsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction\nHow do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform\nthemselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to\npresent-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout\nthe Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between\nthese, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract\nsome digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is\nclassification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From\nimages obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his\nobservations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter\n(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four\ncategories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the\nfamous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these\nclasses, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been\nrefined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global\nclassification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by\nHubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used\nto represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the\nHubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can\nbe understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations\nfound between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one\nmust admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble\nclassification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the\nmost obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,\nqualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to\ncharacterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant\nmultivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since\nthe year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble\nclassification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble\nclassification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet\nemerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate\nanalyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling\nthe observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar\nclusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant\nobjects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our\npresent day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.\nAstrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in\nastrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b).

Only two dozen stars with ([Fe/H]< -4) are known, and they show a\nwide range of abundance patterns. It is therefore important to enlarge this\nsample. We present the first results of an effort to identify new extremely\nmetal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo. Our targets have been selected from\nlow-resolution spectra obtained as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and\nfollowed-up with medium resolution spectroscopy on the 4.2 m William Herschel\nTelescope and, in a few cases, at high resolution on the the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly\nTelescope. Stellar parameters and the abundances of magnesium, calcium, iron,\nand strontium have been inferred from the spectra using classical model\natmospheres. We have also derived carbon abundances from the G band. We find\nconsistency between the metallicities estimated from SDSS and those from new\ndata at the level of 0.3 dex. The analysis of medium resolution data obtained\nwith ISIS on the WHT allow us to refine the metallicities and in some cases\nmeasure other elemental abundances.

Only one of these stars is found to be C-enhanced at\nabout [C/Fe]~+1, whereas the other metal-poor stars show C abundances at the\nlevel of [C/Fe]~+0.45. \n\n"}

We argue for acceleration times on the\norder of 100 Myrs rather than a few billion years, as assumed in some previous\nworks, and we discuss prospects for magnetic field amplification at the shock\nfront. Ultimately, we generously assume that the magnetic field is amplified to\nequipartition. This formalism allows us to obtain analytic formulae, applicable\nto any wind model, for CR acceleration. Even with generous assumptions, we find\nthat very high wind velocities are required to set up the necessary conditions\nfor acceleration beyond $10^{17}$ eV. We also estimate the luminosities of CRs\naccelerated by outflow termination shocks, including estimates for the Milky\nWay wind. \n\n"}

However, the abundance distribution created by the\nr-, rp-, or $\\nu p$-processes in PNS winds depends sensitively on the entropy\nand dynamical expansion timescale of the flow, which may be strongly affected\nby high magnetic fields.

The\nmajority of the radiative losses are not associated with localized high-Ca II\nK-brightness events, but instead with a more gentle, spatially extended, and\npersistent heating. The frequency-integrated Ca II K brightness correlates\nstrongly with the total linear polarization in the Ca II 854.2 nm line, while\nthe Ca II K profile shapes indicate that the bulk of the radiative losses occur\nin the lower chromosphere.\n  Non-LTE inversions indicate a transition from heating concentrated around\nphotospheric magnetic elements below $\\log{\\tau_{500}} =-3$ to a more\nspace-filling and time-persistent heating above $\\log{\\tau_{500}} =-4$.

These new observations allow us to study the surface brightness\ndistribution down to one arcsec resolution with very high sensitivity. Our\nimages provide an unprecedented detailed view of the Toothbrush, revealing\nenigmatic filamentary structures. To study the spectral index distribution, we\ncomplement our analysis with published LOFAR and GMRT observations.

Recent simulations of spinning black holes and (indirect) theoretical\npredictions, suggest that a somewhat analogous effect may occur for purely\ngravitational phenomena. The magnitude and precise direction of this\n\"gravitational Magnus effect\" is still the subject of debate. Starting from the\nrigorous equations of motion for spinning bodies in General Relativity\n(Mathisson-Papapetrou equations), we show that indeed such an effect takes\nplace and is a fundamental part of the spin-curvature force. The effect arises\nwhenever there is a current of mass/energy, non-parallel to a body's spin. We\ncompute the effect explicitly for some astrophysical systems of interest: a\ngalactic dark matter halo, a black hole accretion disk, and the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. It is seen to lead to\nsecular orbital precessions potentially observable by future astrometric\nexperiments and gravitational-wave detectors. Finally, we consider also the\nreciprocal problem: the \"force\" exerted by the body on the surrounding matter,\nand show that (from this perspective) the effect is due to the body's\ngravitomagnetic field. We compute it rigorously, showing the matching with its\nreciprocal, and clarifying common misconceptions in the literature regarding\nthe action-reaction law in post-Newtonian gravity. \n\n"}

LDMX would achieve the\nrequired sensitivity by leveraging existing and developing detector\ntechnologies from the CMS, HPS and Mu2e experiments. In this paper, we present\nour initial design concept, detailed GEANT-based studies of detector\nperformance, signal and background processes, and a preliminary analysis\napproach. We demonstrate how a first phase of LDMX could expand sensitivity to\na variety of light dark matter, mediator, and millicharge particles by several\norders of magnitude in coupling over the broad sub-GeV mass range. \n\n"}

One\npossible explanation for these observations is a disc warp, which could be\ninduced by a planet on a misaligned orbit. We present three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc\nand a misaligned planet. For low planet masses we show that our simulations\naccurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate\ninclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is\nseparated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet\norbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the\ninclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that\nthere is a relative tilt and twist between these discs. We show that when other\nparameters are held constant, the relative inclination that develops between\nthe inner and outer disc depends on the outer radius of the total disc\nmodelled. For a given disc mass, our results suggest that the observational\nrelevance of the warp depends more strongly on the mass of the planet rather\nthan the inclination of the orbit. \n\n"}

In this study, we\nexamine the purely gravitational interaction of idealised galaxy models falling\ninto a galaxy cluster in the context of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).\nThis modification of gravity gives rise to an external field effect (EFE),\nwhere the internal dynamics of a system are affected by the presence of\nexternal gravitational fields.

Using analytic calculations verified with mock\ngalaxy catalogs from log-normal simulations we find that constraints are\ndegraded in two ways, even when the interloper power spectrum is modeled\ncorrectly in the likelihood. Firstly, there is a loss of signal-to-noise ratio\nfor the power spectrum of the target galaxies, which propagates to all\ncosmological constraints and increases with contamination fraction, $f_c$.\nSecondly, degeneracies can open up between $f_c$ and cosmological parameters.\nIn our calculations this typically increases BAO scale uncertainties at the\n10-20% level when marginalizing over parameters determining the broadband power\nspectrum shape. External constraints on $f_c$, or parameters determining the\nshape of the power spectrum, for example from cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nmeasurements, can remove this effect. There is a near-perfect degeneracy\nbetween $f_c$ and the power spectrum amplitude for low $f_c$ values, where\n$f_c$ is not well determined from the contaminated sample alone.

These better measurements place\ntighter constraints on the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear\ndensity. In this article, we discuss a complementary approach to get insights\ninto the structure of neutron stars by providing a model prediction for\nnon-linear fundamental eigenmodes (f-modes) and their decay over time, which\nare thought to be induced by time-dependent tides in neutron star binaries.\nBuilding on pioneering studies that relate the properties of f-modes to the\nstructure of neutron stars, we systematically study this link in the\nnon-perturbative regime using models that utilize numerical relativity. Using a\nsuite of fully relativistic numerical relativity simulations of oscillating TOV\nstars, we establish blueprints for the numerical accuracy needed to accurately\ncompute the frequency and damping times of f-mode oscillations, which we expect\nto be a good guide for the requirements in the binary case. We show that the\nresulting f-mode frequencies match established results from linear perturbation\ntheory, but the damping times within numerical errors depart from linear\npredictions. This work lays the foundation for upcoming studies aimed at a\ncomparison of theoretical models of f-mode signatures in gravitational waves,\nand their uncertainties with actual gravitational wave data, searching for\nneutron star binaries on highly eccentric orbits, and probing neutron star\nstructure at high densities. \n\n"}

The candidate\nsystems have separations between $\\sim$400 and 500,000 au.

Interference detection causes samples to be sporadically flagged\nand rejected. As a necessity to reduce the data volume, flagged samples are\ntypically (implicitly) interpolated during time or frequency averaging or\nuv-gridding. This so-far unexplored systematic biases the 21-cm power spectrum,\nand it is important to understand this bias for current 21-cm experiments as\nwell as the upcoming SKA Epoch of Reionization experiment. We analyse simulated\ndata using power spectrum analysis and Gaussian process regression. We find\nthat the combination of flagging and averaging causes tiny spectral\nfluctuations, resulting in `flagging excess power'. This excess power does not\nsubstantially average down over time and, without extra mitigation techniques,\ncan exceed the power of realistic models of the 21-cm reionization signals in\nLOFAR observations. We mitigate the bias by i) implementing a novel way to\naverage data using a Gaussian-weighted interpolation scheme; ii) using unitary\ninstead of inverse-variance weighting of visibilities; and iii) using\nlow-resolution forward modelling of the data.

With these two measurements, we classify MaNGA galaxies into\ninside-out and outside-in quenching types according to their locations on the\nf$_{q}$ vs. c$_{q}$ plane and we measure the fraction of inside-out\n(outside-in) quenching galaxies as a function of halo mass.

In\naddition, high stellar mass galaxies exhibit a greater fraction of inside-out\nquenching compared to low stellar mass ones in all environments. In contrast,\nthe fraction of outside-in quenching does not depend on halo mass. Our results\nsuggest that morphological quenching may be responsible for the inside-out\nquenching seen in all environments.

Motivated\nby this, I construct here idealized spectral models of an Advection-Dominated\nAccretion Flow (ADAF) around a WD, for application to quiescent Dwarf Novae\n(DN). The Bremsstrahlung cooling of the gas in the ADAF, with temperatures\nranging from a few keV to a few tens of keV, can account for the X-ray emission\nproperties of quiescent DN. If the energy advected by the flow is thermalized\nin the WD atmosphere, the resulting emission from the entire stellar surface\n(blackbody of temperature T_eff ~ 5 eV) outshines the X-ray luminosity\nsubstantially.

At the present time there is strong experimental/observational\nevidence supporting the first three of these predictions, while the fourth one\nis not tested yet because the Higgs boson, predicted in the standard model of\nparticle physics, is yet to be found. This experimental/observational evidence\nis rich and varied ranging from the atmospheric and solar neutrino deficits,\nMACHO gravitational microlensing events, strange properties of extra-solar\nplanets, the existence of \"isolated\" planets, orthopositronium lifetime\nanomaly, Tunguska and other strange \"meteor\" events including perhaps, the\norigin of the moon. The purpose of this article is to provide a not too\ntechnical review of these ideas along with some new results. \n\n"}

In\naddition, I eliminate field 159 at (l,b) = (6.35,-4.40) based mainly on its\nseparate location, but also on unexplained statistical properties of the event\ndurations. The remaining six DIA fields form a very homogeneous and spatially\ncompact set that is very suitable for averaging. The weighting of the optical\ndepth values for these six DIA fields results in a total optical depth\ntau_{tot} = 2.01^{+0.34}_{-0.32} x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (2.22,-3.18).

For the\nslow mode, B^2 ~= c_1-c_2 rho, while for the fast mode, B^2 ~= rho^2. We also\nperform a perturbative analysis to investigate Alfven wave pressure, recovering\nprevious results that B^2 ~= rho^gamma_e, with gamma_e ~= 2, 3/2 and 1/2 at\nrespectively large, moderate and low M_a. This variety of scalings implies that\na single polytropic description of magnetic pressure is not possible in\ngeneral, since the relation between B^2 and rho depends on which mode dominates\nthe density fluctuation production, which in turn depends on the angle between\nthe magnetic field and the direction of wave propagation, and on the Alfvenic\nMach number M_a. Typically, at small M_a, the slow mode dominates, and B is\nANTIcorrelated with rho. At large M_a, both modes contribute to density\nfluctuation production, and the magnetic pressure decorrelates from density,\nexhibiting a large scatter, which however decreases towards higher densities.\nIn this case, the unsystematic behavior of the magnetic pressure causes the\ndensity PDF to generally maintain the lognormal shape corresponding to\nnon-magnetic isothermal turbulence, except when the slow mode dominates, in\nwhich case the PDF develops an excess at low densities. Our results are\nconsistent with the low values and apparent lack of correlation between the\nmagnetic field strength and density in surveys of the lower-density molecular\ngas, and also with the recorrelation apparently seen at higher densities, if\nM_a is relatively large there. \n\n"}

We delineate the\ndecay channels in which most of the decay energy ionizes and heats the IGM gas\n(and thus affects the CMB), and those in which most of the energy is carried\naway -- e.g. photons with energies 100 keV < E < 1 TeV -- and thus appears as a\ncontribution to diffuse x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. The new constraints to\nthe decay-particle parameters from the CMB power spectrum thus complement those\nfrom the cosmic X-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. Although decaying particles\ncan indeed produce an optical depth consistent with that reported by WMAP, in\nso doing they produce new fluctuations in the CMB temperature/polarization\npower spectra. For decay lifetimes less than the age of the Universe, the\ninduced power spectra generally violate current constraints, while the power\nspectra are usually consistent if the lifetime is longer than the age of the\nUniverse. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that the amount of viscous\nheating associated with the dissipation of these waves can offset radiative\ncooling rates in cooling flow clusters of galaxies. This heating mechanism\nleads to spatially distributed and approximately symmetrical dissipation. The\nheating waves reach a given distance from the cluster center on a timescale\nshorter than the cooling time. This means that this heating mechanism has the\npotential of quenching cooling flows in a quasi-stable fashion. Moreover, the\nheating is gentle as no strong shocks are present in the simulations. We first\ninvestigated whether a single continuous episode of AGN activity can lead to\nadequate dissipation to balance cooling rates. These simulations demonstrated\nthat, whereas secondary waves generated by the interaction of the rising bubble\nwith the intracluster medium are clearly present, viscous heating associated\nwith the dissipation of these waves is insufficient to balance radiative\ncooling. It is only when the central source is intermittent that the viscous\ndissipation of waves associated with subsequent episodes of activity can offset\ncooling. This suggests that the ripples observed in the Perseus cluster can be\ninterpreted as being due to the AGN duty cycle, i.e., they trace AGN activity\nhistory.

Two narrow\nabsorption systems at velocities -600 km/s and -22000 km/s are detected. The\nlow-velocity system is part of the broad absorption line (BAL), while the\nhigh-velocity one is well detached. While most narrow absorption components are\nonly detected in the high-ionization species, the lowest velocity component is\ndetected in both high- and low-ionization species, including in the excited\nSiII* and CII* lines. From the analysis of doublet lines, we find that the\nnarrow absorption lines at the low-velocity end of the BAL trough are\ncompletely saturated but do not reach zero flux, their profiles being dominated\nby a velocity-dependent covering factor. The covering factor is significantly\nsmaller for MgII than for SiIV and NV, which demonstrates the intrinsic nature\nof absorber. From the analysis of the excited SiII* and CII* lines in the\nlowest velocity component, we find an electron density ~ 1000 cm^{-3}.

We follow the\nnon-equilibrium multispecies chemistry of primordial gas in the presence of a\npoint source of X-ray radiation, which starts shining in a rare high-sigma peak\nat z=21 and emits a power-law spectrum in the 0.2-10 keV range.

The mean electron and H2 fractions\nare now 0.03 and 4e-5: the latter is 20 times larger than the primordial value,\nand will delay the buildup of a uniform UV photodissociating background. The\nnet effect of the X-rays is to reduce gas clumping in the IGM by as much as a\nfactor of 3. While the suppression of baryonic infall lowers the gas mass\nfraction at overdensities delta in the range 20-2000, enhanced molecular\ncooling increases the amount of dense material at delta>2000. In many haloes\nwithin the proximity of our miniquasar the H2-boosting effect of X-rays is too\nweak to overcome heating, and the cold and dense gas mass actually decreases.\nWe find little evidence for an entropy floor in gas at intermediate densities\npreventing gas contraction and H2 formation. Overall, the radiative feedback\nfrom X-rays enhances gas cooling in lower-sigma peaks that are far away from\nthe initial site of star formation, thus decreasing the clustering bias of the\nearly pregalactic population, but does not appear to dramatically reverse or\npromote the collapse of pregalactic clouds as a whole.

For primordial binaries, the time delay between formation\nand merger is expected to be short, tau~0.1 Gyr, implying that the redshift\ndistribution of merger events should follow that of star-formation.

Abstract: The large value of \\S17 = 22.1 \\xpm 0.6 eV-b, reported by the Seattle group,\nsuggests a larger total \\b8 solar neutrino flux. Together with the two high\nprecision values quoted for \\s34 it is either 20% or 9% larger than measured by\nSNO. While the accuracy of the Standard Solar Model has recently been\nrevisited, precise nuclear inputs are still relevant, but a detailed\nexamination of current data on \\xs17 (as opposed to an examination of \\S17\nonly) excludes quoting \\S17 with sufficiently small uncertainty. In contrast to\nsuggestions that \\S17 is now known with the (impressive) accuracy of \\xpm 3%,\nthe exact value of \\S17 is dependent on the choice of the data and the choice\nof theory used for extrapolation. In addition recent high precision results\n(including the Seattle data) on \\xs17 which are in good agreement, still differ\non the measured slopes, as does the theory, precluding an accurate\nextrapolation to zero energy of the consistent data. Using a common\nextrapolation of only the consistent high precision data, suggests a value of\n\\S17 = 21.2 \\xpm 0.5 eV-b, but a value equal to or smaller than 19.0 eV-b can\nnot be excluded due to the uncertainty in the extrapolation, leading to an\nadditional error of $^{+0.0}_{-3.0}$ eV-b.

{"id": "nucl-ex/0510081", "contents": "Title: Status of the Standard Solar Model Prediction of Solar Neutrino Fluxes Abstract: The Standard Solar Model (BP04) predicts a total 8B neutrino flux that is\n17.2% larger than measured in the salt phase of the SNO detector (and if it\nwere significant it will indicate oscillation to sterile neutrinos). Hence it\nis important to examine in details uncertainties (and values) of inputs to the\nSSM. Currently, the largest fractional uncertainty is due to the new evaluation\nof the surface composition of the sun. We examine the nuclear input on the\nformation of solar 8B [S17(0)] and demonstrate that it is still quite uncertain\ndue to ill known slope of the measured astrophysical cross section factor and\nthus ill defined extrapolation to zero energy. This yields an additional\nreasonably estimated uncertainty due to extrapolation of +0.0 -3.0 eV-b (+0%\n-14%). Since a large discrepancy exists among measured as well as among\npredicted slopes, the value of S17(0) is dependent on the choice of data and\ntheory used to extrapolate S17(0). This situation must be alleviated by new\nmeasurement(s). The \"world average\" is driven by the Seattle result due to the\nvery small quoted uncertainty, which we however demonstrate it to be an\nover-estimated accuracy. We propose more realistic error bars for the Seattle\nresults based on the published Seattle data. \n\n"}

We\nstart with a hadronic meson-baryon Lagrangian that is consistent with chiral\nsymmetry. This is used to obtain a light front version of a one-boson-exchange\nnucleon-nucleon potential (OBEP). The accuracy of our description of the\nnucleon-nucleon (NN) data is good, and similar to that of other relativistic\nOBEP models. We derive, within the light front formalism, the Hartree-Fock and\nBrueckner Hartree-Fock equations. Applying our light front OBEP, the nuclear\nmatter saturation properties are reasonably well reproduced. We obtain a value\nof the compressibility, 180 MeV, that is smaller than that of alternative\nrelativistic approaches to nuclear matter in which the compressibility usually\ncomes out too large. Because the derivation starts from a meson-baryon\nLagrangian, we are able to show that replacing the meson degrees of freedom by\na NN interaction is a consistent approximation, and the formalism allows one to\ncalculate corrections to this approximation in a well-organized manner. The\nsimplicity of the vacuum in our light front approach is an important feature in\nallowing the derivations to proceed. The mesonic Fock space components of the\nnuclear wave function are obtained also, and aspects of the meson and nucleon\nplus-momentum distribution functions are computed. We find that there are about\n0.05 excess pions per nucleon. \n\n"}
