This enables to derive the renormalized\nquantities in a manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the\nform of strongly convergent integrals. However, applications of the Abel-Plana\nformula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the\neigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized\nthe Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature. Further, the derived summation formulae have been\nused to summarize series arising in the direct mode summation approach to the\nCasimir effect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries, for\nboundaries moving with uniform proper acceleration, and in various braneworld\nscenarios.

The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains.

In quantum\ninformation processing with solid state qubits, decoherence significantly\nlimits the performances of such devices. Therefore, it is necessary to fully\nunderstand the mechanisms that lead to decoherence. In this review we discuss\nhow decoherence affects two of the most successful realizations of solid state\nqubits, namely, spin-qubits and superconducting qubits. In the former, the\nqubit is encoded in the spin 1/2 of the electron, and it is implemented by\nconfining the electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot.

However, the\ndependence of the non-linear interaction on frequency and time makes it\ndifficult to preserve a coherent pulse shape that could justify a single mode\nmodel for the time-frequency degree of freedom of the photons. In this paper,\nwe analyze the problem of temporal multi-mode effects by considering the pulse\nshape of the average output field obtained from a coherent input pulse.

The\npurpose of this paper is to examine the applicable domains for the most general\nqubit-interchange symmetric three-qubit states. First, we compute the\neigenvalues of the non-linear eigenvalue equations and the nearest separable\nstates for the permutation invariant three-qubit states with a fixed phase.\nNext, we compute the geometric entanglement measure, deduce the boundaries of\nall subspaces, and find allocations of highly and slightly entangled states.

An ultracold\nmolecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime\nfor chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external\nelectric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is\nstrictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these\nexothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a\nrate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the\nquantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress\nthe bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We\nuse an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along\nthe tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight\nconfinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can\napproach each other only in a \"side-by-side\" collision, where the chemical\nreaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction.

Since the interactions between system and environment are\nlocal, they can also cause a loss of spatial coherence: correlations between\nspatially distant parts of the system are lost and the equilibrium states can\nbecome localized. This effect limits the distance over which quantum\ninformation can be transmitted, e.g., along a spin chain.

The price to pay in the LDPC case is\nthat good efficiency is only attained for very long codes and in a very narrow\nrange centered around the quantum bit error rate (QBER) that the code was\ndesigned to reconcile, thus forcing to have several codes if a broad range of\nQBER needs to be catered for.

In the latter case, symmetries are implemented in a way that\nis forbidden in a strictly two dimensional theory.

Our result here is that the\nregularized entanglement of formation characterizes the quantum rate distortion\nfunction, extending earlier work of Devetak and Berger.

It is also shown that\nfluctuations of the instantaneous energy of the moving unstable particles has a\nsimilar form as the fluctuations in the particle rest frame but they are seen\nby the observer in his rest system much earlier than one could expect replacing\n$t$ by $t/\\gamma_{L}$ in the corresponding expressions for this energy and that\nthe amplitude of these fluctuations can be even larger than it follows from the\nstandard approach.

Here, we predict that in the\nquantum regime a dynamic hysteresis with a rich phenomenology does appear when\nsweeping the driving amplitude in a finite time. The hysteresis area as a\nfunction of the sweep time reveals a double power-law decay, with a behavior\nqualitatively different from the mean-field predictions.

Our purpose is to\nstudy the subsequent temporal generation of entanglement, quantified by\nconcurrence, when initially the qubits are in an unentangled state.

A natural question to ask is whether the same holds true for the\noutput dimension. That is, in cases when the output dimension of the channels\nis (possibly much) smaller than the input dimension, is an ancilla with\ndimension equal to the output dimension always sufficient for optimal\ndiscrimination?

For single particle systems with fully chaotic classical\ncounterparts, the problem has been partly solved by Berry (1985) within the\nso-called diagonal approximation of semiclassical periodic-orbit sums.\nDerivation of the full RMT spectral form factor $K(t)$ from semiclassics has\nbeen completed only much later in a tour de force by Mueller et al (2004). In\nrecent years, the questions of long-time dynamics at high energies, for which\nthe full many-body energy spectrum becomes relevant, are coming at the\nforefront even for simple many-body quantum systems, such as locally\ninteracting spin chains. Such systems display two universal types of behaviour\nwhich are termed as `many-body localized phase' and `ergodic phase'. In the\nergodic phase, the spectral fluctuations are excellently described by RMT, even\nfor very simple interactions and in the absence of any external source of\ndisorder.

The Kronig-Penney model is a one-dimensional\nperiodic array of delta functions that models the energy bands in a crystal.\nHere we investigate contact interactions that generalize the delta function\npotential and corresponding generalizations of the Kronig-Penney model within\nconventional and parity-time symmetric quantum mechanics (PTQM). In\nconventional quantum mechanics we determine the most general contact\ninteraction compatible with self-adjointness; in PTQM we consider interactions\nthat are symmetric under the combined transformation PT. In both cases we find\nthat the most general interaction has four independent real parameters;\ndepending on the parameter values the interaction can support more bound states\nthan the conventional delta function. In the PT case the two bound state\nenergies can be both real or a complex conjugate pair, with the transition\ncorresponding to the breaking of PT-symmetry. The scattering states for the PT\ncase are also found to exhibit spontaneous breaking of PT-symmetry. We\ninvestigate the energy bands when the generalized contact interactions are\nrepeated periodically in space in one dimension. In the Hermitian case we find\nthat the two bound states result in two narrow bands generically separated by a\ngap. These bands intersect at a single point in the Brillouin zone as the\ninteraction parameters are varied. Near the intersection the bands form a\nmassless Dirac cone. In the PT-symmetric case, as the parameters of the contact\ninteraction are varied the two bound state bands undergo a PT-symmetry breaking\ntransition wherein the two band energies go from being real to being a complex\nconjugate pair. The PT-symmetric Kronig-Penney model provides a simple soluble\nexample of the transition which has the same form as in other models of\nPT-symmetric crystals. \n\n"}

As an example, we give attacks against a\nrecently proposed ``secure communication using mesoscopic coherent states'',\nwhich employs mesoscopic states, rather than single-photon states. Our attacks\ncan be used either as a known-plaintext attack or in the case where the\nplaintext has not been randomized. One of our attacks requires beamsplitters\nand the replacement of a lossy channel by a lossless one. It is successful\nprovided that the original loss in the channel is so big that Eve can obtain\n2^k copies of what Bob receives, where k is the length of the seed key\npre-shared by Alice and Bob.

We show that several formula size lower bounds\nin the literature, specifically Khrapchenko and its extensions [Khr71, Kou93],\nincluding a key lemma of [Has98], are in fact special cases of our method.\n  The second quantity we introduce, maxPI(f), is always at least as large as\nsumPI(f), and is derived from sumPI in such a way that maxPI^2(f) remains a\nlower bound on formula size. While sumPI(f) is always a lower bound on the\nquantum query complexity of f, this is not the case in general for maxPI(f). A\nstrong advantage of sumPI(f) is that it has both primal and dual\ncharacterizations, and thus it is relatively easy to give both upper and lower\nbounds on the sumPI complexity of functions.

This device will then tell us, in an optimal way, which of the\ntemplates stored in the program registers the data state matches. In the second\ncase, we know one of the states while the other is unknown. One copy of the\nunknown state is fed into the single program register, and the data state which\nis guaranteed to be prepared in either the program state or the known state, is\nfed into the data register.

However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary\ntransforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the\nFourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale\nstructure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing\nand quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive efficient, complete,\nquantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum\nHaar and quantum Daubechies $D^{(4)}$ transforms. Our approach is to factor the\noperators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot\nproducts of unitary matrices. In so doing, we find that permutation matrices, a\nparticular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we\nfind that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are\nnot always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice\nversa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation\nmatrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly.\nHowever, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed\nexplicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the\nquantum transform. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices\narising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits\nthat implement them. This allows us to design efficient, complete quantum\ncircuits for the quantum wavelet transform. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9901025", "contents": "Title: How to share a quantum secret Abstract: We investigate the concept of quantum secret sharing. In a ((k,n)) threshold\nscheme, a secret quantum state is divided into n shares such that any k of\nthose shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but any set of k-1 or fewer\nshares contains absolutely no information about the secret. We show that the\nonly constraint on the existence of threshold schemes comes from the quantum\n\"no-cloning theorem\", which requires that n < 2k, and, in all such cases, we\ngive an efficient construction of a ((k,n)) threshold scheme. We also explore\nsimilarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum\nerror-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing\nquantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes\nmust use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k <= n < 2k-1 then any\n((k,n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a\nmixed state. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9904013", "contents": "Title: Sonoluminescence as a QED vacuum effect. I: The Physical Scenario Abstract: Several years ago Schwinger proposed a physical mechanism for\nsonoluminescence in terms of changes in the properties of the\nquantum-electrodynamic (QED) vacuum state. This mechanism is most often phrased\nin terms of changes in the Casimir Energy: changes in the distribution of\nzero-point energies and has recently been the subject of considerable\ncontroversy. The present paper further develops this quantum-vacuum approach to\nsonoluminescence: We calculate Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum\nstates in the presence of a homogeneous medium of changing dielectric constant.\nIn this way we derive an estimate for the spectrum, number of photons, and\ntotal energy emitted. We emphasize the importance of rapid spatio-temporal\nchanges in refractive indices, and the delicate sensitivity of the emitted\nradiation to the precise dependence of the refractive index as a function of\nwavenumber, pressure, temperature, and noble gas admixture. Although the\nphysics of the dynamical Casimir effect is a universal phenomenon of QED,\nspecific experimental features are encoded in the condensed matter physics\ncontrolling the details of the refractive index. This calculation places rather\ntight constraints on the possibility of using the dynamical Casimir effect as\nan explanation for sonoluminescence, and we are hopeful that this scenario will\nsoon be amenable to direct experimental probes. In a companion paper we discuss\nthe technical complications due to finite-size effects, but for reasons of\nclarity in this paper we confine attention to bulk effects. \n\n"}

We generalise this result: it is possible to\nascribe consistent outcomes to a dense subset of the set of projection valued\nmeasurements, or to a dense subset of the set of positive operator valued\nmeasurements, on any finite dimensional system. Hence no Kochen-Specker like\ncontradiction can rule out hidden variable theories indistinguishable from\nquantum theory by finite precision measurements in either class. \n\n"}

This effect is, by\nitself, insufficient to produce generically quasi-classical behaviour of the\nBohmian trajectory. However, it is shown that, if the system particle is\ninitially in an approximate energy eigenstate, then there is a tendency for the\nBohmian trajectory to become approximately classical on a rather longer\ntime-scale. The relationship between this phenomenon and the behaviour of the\nWigner function post-decoherence (as analysed by Halliwell and Zoupas) is\ndiscussed.
