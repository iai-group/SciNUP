To analyze the top-tagging method,\ntheoretical and experimental aspects of the QCD jet background are examined.\nBased on QCD factorization, we derive a simple analytic approximation for the\nshape of the QCD jet mass spectrum. We observe a good agreement with the Monte\nCarlo simulation.

In such cases vetoing undesired additional jets is an effective way to\ndiscriminate signals and background. Given an inclusive event sample with N or\nmore jets, the veto to have only N energetic jets defines an \"exclusive\" N-jet\ncross section. This strongly restricts the phase space of the underlying\ninclusive N-jet cross section and causes large double logarithms in\nperturbation theory that must be summed to obtain theory predictions.

In addition, the\nobserved baryon density is within an order of magnitude of the dark matter\ndensity. This suggests that the baryon density is physically related to a\ntypical thermal relic WIMP dark matter density. We present a model which\nsimultaneously generates thermal relic WIMP-like densities for both baryons and\ndark matter by modifying a large initial baryon asymmetry. Dark matter is due\nto O(100) GeV gauge singlet scalars produced in the annihilation of the O(TeV)\ncoloured scalars which are responsible for the final thermal WIMP-like baryon\nasymmetry. The requirement of no baryon washout implies that there are two\ngauge singlet scalars. The low temperature transfer of the asymmetry to\nconventional baryons can be understood if the long-lived O(TeV) coloured\nscalars have large hypercharge, |Y| > 4/3.

Signals from MiDM and Rayleigh Dark Matter Abstract: The effective interactions of dark matter with photons are fairly restricted.\nYet both direct detection as well as monochromatic gamma ray signatures depend\nsensitively on the presence of such interactions. For a Dirac fermion,\nelectromagnetic dipoles are possible, but are very constrained. For Majorana\nfermions, no such terms are allowed. We consider signals of an effective theory\nwith a Majorana dark matter particle and its couplings to photons. In the\npresence of a nearby excited state, there is the possibility of a magnetic\ndipole transition (Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter or MiDM), which yields both\ndirect and indirect detection signals, and, intriguingly, yields essentially\nthe same size over a wide range of dipole strengths. Absent an excited state,\nthe leading interaction of WIMPs is similar to the Rayleigh scattering of low\nenergy photons from neutral atoms, which may be captured by an effective\noperator of dimension 7 of the form $\\bar{\\chi}\\chi F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\nWhile it can be thought of as a phase of the Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter\nscenario where the excited state is much heavier than the ground state, it can\narise from other theories as well. We study the resulting phenomenology of this\nscenario: gamma ray lines from the annihilation of WIMPs; nuclear recoils in\ndirect detection; and direct production of the WIMP pair in high-energy\ncolliders. Considering recent evidence in particular for a 130 GeV line from\nthe galactic center, we discuss the detection prospects at upcoming\nexperiments. \n\n"}

However, hadronic\ncorrections also play a significant role at much higher energies due to their\nimpact on the running of standard model parameters, such as the electromagnetic\ncoupling. Currently, these hadronic contributions are accounted for by a\ncombination of experimental measurements, effective field theory techniques and\nphenomenological modeling but ideally should be calculated from first\nprinciples. Recent developments indicate that many of the most important\nhadronic corrections may be feasibly calculated using lattice QCD methods. To\nillustrate this, we will examine the lattice computation of the leading-order\nQCD corrections to the muon magnetic moment, paying particular attention to a\nrecently developed method but also reviewing the results from other\ncalculations.

We demonstrate that\nif an MeV dark matter particle couples more strongly to electrons and/or\nphotons than to neutrinos, then p-wave annihilation after neutrino decoupling\ncan reduce the value of $N_{eff}$ inferred from BBN and PLANCK. This mechanism\ncan accommodate two eV sterile neutrinos even if PLANCK observes $N_{eff}$ as\nlow as the standard model theoretical value of 3.046, and a large neutrino\nasymmetry is not needed to obtain the correct primordial element abundances.\nThe dark matter annihilation also weakens the cosmological upper bounds on the\nneutrino masses, and we derive a relationship between the change in these\nbounds and the corresponding change in $N_{eff}$.

We present results from an\nanalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets\nin addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe.

We find that the current limits on the contact\ninteraction scale Lambda in the EFT apply to theories that are perturbative for\ndark matter mass m_DM < 800 GeV.

At the same time, a mediator particle must be\npresent to produce the dark matter (DM) at the LHC. This mediator particle may\nbe produced on shell, so that direct searches for the mediating particle can\nconstrain the effective operator being applied to monojet constraints. In this\nfirst paper, we do a case study on t-channel models in monojet searches, where\nthe (Standard Model singlet) DM is pair produced via a t-channel mediating\nparticle, whose supersymmetric analogue is the squark. We compare monojet\nconstraints to direct constraints on single or pair production of the mediator\nfrom multi-jets plus missing energy searches and we identify the regions where\nthe latter dominate over the former. We show that computing bounds using\nsupersymmetric simplified models and in the narrow width approximation, as done\nin previous work in the literature, misses important quantitative effects. We\nperform a full event simulation and statistical analysis, and we compute the\neffects of both on- and off-shell production of the mediating particle, showing\nthat for both the monojet and multi-jets plus missing energy searches,\npreviously derived bounds provided more conservative bounds than what can be\nextracted by including all relevant processes in the simulation.

ALICE measured the production of ${\\rm D^{0}}$, ${\\rm\nD^{*+}}$, ${\\rm D^{+}}$ and ${\\rm D_{s}}$ mesons at central rapidity in pp,\np-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The study of the modification of the\ntransverse momentum differential yields of charm particles in Pb-Pb collisions\nwith respect to pp collisions, quantified by the nuclear modification factor\n($R_{\\rm AA}$), can unravel details of the energy loss mechanism, such as its\ndependence on the quark mass and on the path length the parton travels through\nthe medium.

Despite its utility, it is not\ninfrared and collinear (IRC) safe, so perturbative calculations are limited to\nstudying the energy evolution of multiplicity moments. While IRC-safe\nobservables, like jet mass, are perturbatively calculable, their distributions\noften exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their quark/gluon discrimination power\nis limited by the ratio of quark to gluon color factors. In this paper, we\nintroduce new IRC-safe counting observables whose discrimination performance\nexceeds that of jet mass and approaches that of track multiplicity. The key\nobservation is that track multiplicity is approximately Poisson distributed,\nwith more suppressed tails than the Sudakov peak structure from jet mass. By\nusing an iterated version of the soft drop jet grooming algorithm, we can\ndefine a \"soft drop multiplicity\" which is Poisson distributed at\nleading-logarithmic accuracy. In addition, we calculate the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to this Poisson structure. If we allow\nthe soft drop groomer to proceed to the end of the jet branching history, we\ncan define a collinear-unsafe (but still infrared-safe) counting observable.\nExploiting the universality of the collinear limit, we define generalized\nfragmentation functions to study the perturbative energy evolution of\ncollinear-unsafe multiplicity. \n\n"}

The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton\ninteraction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias\nevents. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged\ntrack momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at\n$\\sqrt{s}=1800$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV and comparing this ambient momentum\nwith that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two\nMonte Carlo models.

In\nparticular, the masses of the top (t) quark (M_t) and W boson constrain the\nmass of the long-hypothesized, but thus far not observed, Higgs boson. A\nprecise measurement of the top-quark mass can therefore point to where to look\nfor the Higgs, and indeed whether the hypothesis of a SM Higgs is consistent\nwith experimental data. Since top quarks are produced in pairs and decay in\nonly ~10^-24 s into various final states, reconstructing their mass from their\ndecay products is very challenging.

A primary purpose of this\ninvestigation is to establish the parameter space regions where CP violation\ncan be discovered and where the mass hierarchy can be determined. It is found\nthat such measurements, even with the augmented flux from proton driver\nupgrades, demand sin^2 (2 theta13) be fairly large and in the range where it is\nmeasurable by reactor experiments. \n\n"}

Instead, we use\nin this channel,for the first time, Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR), which\nexhibit a nice stability in the QCD continuum threshold t_c, at which one can\nextract, with a good accuracy, the mass of the lowest resonance. Including the\nD=7, 9 condensate contributions in the OPE, we obtain M_Theta=(1513+- 114) MeV,\nand the corresponding residue lambda_Theta^2= -(0.14-- 0.49)x 10^{-9} GeV^{12},\nwhich favours the I=0, J=1/2, and negative parity S-wave interpretation of the\nTheta (1540).
