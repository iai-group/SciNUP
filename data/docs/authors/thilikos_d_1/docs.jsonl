Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical\nstudy of the space of proper colorings (solutions).\n  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree\n(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase\ntransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.\nFirst, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the\nphase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond\nthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the\ncritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine\ntheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.\n  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue\nthat the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering\ntransition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the\nrelevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL\nalgorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results. \n\n"}

In this\narticle, we define a generalization of Schnyder woods to $d$-angulations (plane\ngraphs with faces of degree $d$) for all $d\\geq 3$. A \\emph{Schnyder\ndecomposition} is a set of $d$ spanning forests crossing each other in a\nspecific way, and such that each internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the\nspanning forests. We show that a Schnyder decomposition exists if and only if\nthe girth of the $d$-angulation is $d$. As in the case of Schnyder woods\n($d=3$), there are alternative formulations in terms of orientations\n(\"fractional\" orientations when $d\\geq 5$) and in terms of corner-labellings.\nMoreover, the set of Schnyder decompositions on a fixed $d$-angulation of girth\n$d$ is a distributive lattice. We also show that the structures dual to\nSchnyder decompositions (on $d$-regular plane graphs of mincut $d$ rooted at a\nvertex $v^*$) are decompositions into $d$ spanning trees rooted at $v^*$ such\nthat each edge not incident to $v^*$ is used in opposite directions by two\ntrees. Additionally, for even values of $d$, we show that a subclass of\nSchnyder decompositions, which are called even, enjoy additional properties\nthat yield a reduced formulation; in the case d=4, these correspond to\nwell-studied structures on simple quadrangulations (2-orientations and\npartitions into 2 spanning trees). In the case d=4, the dual of even Schnyder\ndecompositions yields (planar) orthogonal and straight-line drawing algorithms.\nFor a 4-regular plane graph $G$ of mincut 4 with $n$ vertices plus a marked\nvertex $v$, the vertices of $G\\backslash v$ are placed on a $(n-1) \\times\n(n-1)$ grid according to a permutation pattern, and in the orthogonal drawing\neach of the $2n-2$ edges of $G\\backslash v$ has exactly one bend.

In this paper we develop a general\nframework that allows us to derive a number of new results, in particular when\n$f$ may be a non-monotone function. Our algorithms are based on (approximately)\nmaximizing the multilinear extension $F$ of $f$ over a polytope $P$ that\nrepresents the constraints, and then effectively rounding the fractional\nsolution. Although this approach has been used quite successfully, it has been\nlimited in some important ways. We overcome these limitations as follows.\n  First, we give constant factor approximation algorithms to maximize $F$ over\na down-closed polytope $P$ described by an efficient separation oracle.\nPreviously this was known only for monotone functions. For non-monotone\nfunctions, a constant factor was known only when the polytope was either the\nintersection of a fixed number of knapsack constraints or a matroid polytope.\nSecond, we show that contention resolution schemes are an effective way to\nround a fractional solution, even when $f$ is non-monotone. In particular,\ncontention resolution schemes for different polytopes can be combined to handle\nthe intersection of different constraints. Via LP duality we show that a\ncontention resolution scheme for a constraint is related to the correlation gap\nof weighted rank functions of the constraint. This leads to an optimal\ncontention resolution scheme for the matroid polytope.\n  Our results provide a broadly applicable framework for maximizing linear and\nsubmodular functions subject to independence constraints. We give several\nillustrative examples. Contention resolution schemes may find other\napplications. \n\n"}

In this\npaper, we analyze the computational complexity of deciding if a given set of\nmatrices is primitive and we derive bounds on the length of the shortest\npositive product.\n  We show that while primitivity is algorithmically decidable, unless $P=NP$ it\nis not possible to decide primitivity of a matrix set in polynomial time.\nMoreover, we show that the length of the shortest positive sequence can be\nsuperpolynomial in the dimension of the matrices. On the other hand, defining\n${\\mathcal P}$ to be the set of matrices with no zero rows or columns, we give\na simple combinatorial proof of a previously-known characterization of\nprimitivity for matrices in ${\\mathcal P}$ which can be tested in polynomial\ntime. This latter observation is related to the well-known 1964 conjecture of\nCerny on synchronizing automata; in fact, any bound on the minimal length of a\nsynchronizing word for synchronizing automata immediately translates into a\nbound on the length of the shortest positive product of a primitive set of\nmatrices in ${\\mathcal P}$. In particular, any primitive set of $n \\times n$\nmatrices in ${\\mathcal P}$ has a positive product of length $O(n^3)$. \n\n"}

As a continuation of our previous (CSR\n2012) paper, we focus on the complexity of undirected graph templates. As our\nmain contribution, we settle the two principal open questions proposed in (CSR\n2012). Firstly, we complete the classification of clique templates by proving a\nfull trichotomy for all possible combinations of counting quantifiers and\nclique sizes, placing each case either in P, NP-complete or Pspace-complete.\nThis involves resolution of the cases in which we have the single quantifier\n$\\exists^{\\geq j}$ on the clique $K_{2j}$. Secondly, we confirm a conjecture\nfrom (CSR 2012), which proposes a full dichotomy for $\\exists$ and\n$\\exists^{\\geq 2}$ on all finite undirected graphs. The main thrust of this\nsecond result is the solution of the complexity for the infinite path which we\nprove is a polynomial-time solvable problem.

If, in\naddition, the insertion of an edge destroys its outer-fan-planarity, then it is\nmaximal outer-fan-planar. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm\nto test whether a given graph is maximal outer-fan-planar. The algorithm can\nalso be employed to produce an outer-fan-planar embedding, if one exists. On\nthe negative side, we show that testing fan-planarity of a graph is NP-hard,\nfor the case where the rotation system (i.e., the cyclic order of the edges\naround each vertex) is given. \n\n"}

A special case of particular interest is a uniform random\n$s$-intersection graph, where each vertex independently selects the same number\nof items uniformly at random from a common item pool. Another important case is\na binomial random $s$-intersection graph, where each item from a pool is\nindependently assigned to each vertex with the same probability.

A\nblack-box access to an unknown subset $S \\subseteq V$ is provided via queries\nof the form `Does $i \\in S$?'. We are interested in the minimum number of\nqueries needed in worst case in order to determine whether $G[S]$, the subgraph\nof $G$ induced on $S$, satisfies $\\mathcal{P}$.\n  Apart from being combinatorially rich, this setting allows us to initiate a\nsystematic study of breaking symmetry in the context of query complexity of\ngraph properties. In particular, we focus on hereditary graph properties. The\nmonotone functions in the node-query setting translate precisely to the\nhereditary graph properties. The famous Evasiveness Conjecture asserts that\neven with a minimal symmetry assumption on $G$, namely that of\nvertex-transitivity, the query complexity for any hereditary graph property in\nour setting is the worst possible, i.e., $n$.\n  We show that in the absence of any symmetry on $G$ it can fall as low as\n$O(n^{1/(d + 1) })$ where $d$ denotes the minimum possible degree of a minimal\nforbidden sub-graph for $\\mathcal{P}$. In particular, every hereditary property\nbenefits at least quadratically. The main question left open is: can it go\nexponentially low for some hereditary property?\n  We show that the answer is no for any hereditary property with {finitely\nmany} forbidden subgraphs by exhibiting a bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/k})$ for some\nconstant $k$ depending only on the property. For general ones we rule out the\npossibility of the query complexity falling down to constant by showing\n$\\Omega(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$ bound.

An approximation algorithm for CSP is called robust if\nit outputs an assignment satisfying a $(1-g(\\varepsilon))$-fraction of\nconstraints on any $(1-\\varepsilon)$-satisfiable instance, where the loss\nfunction $g$ is such that $g(\\varepsilon)\\rightarrow 0$ as\n$\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$.\n  We study how the robust approximability of CSPs depends on the set of\nconstraint relations allowed in instances, the so-called constraint language.\nAll constraint languages admitting a robust polynomial-time algorithm (with\nsome $g$) have been characterised by Barto and Kozik, with the general bound on\nthe loss $g$ being doubly exponential, specifically\n$g(\\varepsilon)=O((\\log\\log(1/\\varepsilon))/\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$. It is\nnatural to ask when a better loss can be achieved: in particular, polynomial\nloss $g(\\varepsilon)=O(\\varepsilon^{1/k})$ for some constant $k$. In this\npaper, we consider CSPs with a constraint language having a near-unanimity\npolymorphism. We give two randomized robust algorithms with polynomial loss for\nsuch CSPs: one works for any near-unanimity polymorphism and the parameter $k$\nin the loss depends on the size of the domain and the arity of the relations in\n$\\Gamma$, while the other works for a special ternary near-unanimity operation\ncalled dual discriminator with $k=2$ for any domain size. In the latter case,\nthe CSP is a common generalisation of Unique Games with a fixed domain and\n2-SAT. In the former case, we use the algebraic approach to the CSP. Both cases\nuse the standard semidefinite programming relaxation for CSP. \n\n"}

The authors left as further research to\ninvestigate this parameter on general graphs, and in particular to find\nproblems that, while admitting polynomial kernels on sparse graphs, behave\ndifferently on general graphs.\n  In this article we answer this question by finding two very natural such\nproblems: we prove that Vertex Cover admits a polynomial kernel on general\ngraphs for any integer $c \\geq 1$, and that Dominating Set does not for any\ninteger $c \\geq 2$ even on degenerate graphs, unless $\\text{NP} \\subseteq\n\\text{coNP}/\\text{poly}$.

Albeit the vast majority of molecules yields outerplanar graphs this\nproblem remains NP-hard.\n  We consider a variation of the problem of high practical relevance, where the\nrings of molecules must not be broken, i.e., the block and bridge structure of\nthe input graphs must be retained by the common subgraph.

If\nthe attacker spends time $t$ at a target $i$ of value $\\alpha_i$, and if he\nleaves before the defender visits the target, his utility is $t \\cdot \\alpha_i\n$; if the defender visits before he leaves, his utility is 0.

Such games are a simplified model of a number of real-world scenarios\nsuch as protecting computer networks from intruders, crops from thieves, etc.\n  We show that optimal defender play for this continuous time security games\nreduces to the solution of a combinatorial question regarding the existence of\ninfinite sequences over a finite alphabet, with the following properties for\neach symbol $i$: (1) $i$ constitutes a prescribed fraction $p_i$ of the\nsequence.

We are interested in the asymptotic\nnumber of compacted trees of given size, where the size of a compacted tree is\ngiven by the number of its internal nodes. Due to its superexponential growth\nthis problem poses many difficulties. Therefore we restrict our investigations\nto compacted trees of bounded right height, which is the maximal number of\nedges going to the right on any path from the root to a leaf.\n  We solve the asymptotic counting problem for this class as well as a closely\nrelated, further simplified class.\n  For this purpose, we develop a calculus on exponential generating functions\nfor compacted trees of bounded right height and for relaxed trees of bounded\nright height, which differ from compacted trees by dropping the above described\nuniqueness condition. This enables us to derive a recursively defined sequence\nof differential equations for the exponential generating functions. The\ncoefficients can then be determined by performing a singularity analysis of the\nsolutions of these differential equations.\n  Our main results are the computation of the asymptotic numbers of relaxed as\nwell as compacted trees of bounded right height and given size, when the size\ntends to infinity. \n\n"}

We\nanalyse a number of reduction rules which are commonly used in the\nphylogenetics literature to obtain fixed parameter tractable algorithms. In\nsome cases (the \\emph{subtree} reduction) the reduction rules behave similarly\nwith respect to treewidth, while others (the \\emph{cluster} reduction) behave\nvery differently, and the behaviour of the \\emph{chain reduction} is\nparticularly intriguing because of its link with graph separators and forbidden\nminors. We also show that the gap between treewidth and Tree Bisection and\nReconnect (TBR) distance can be infinitely large, and that unlike, for example,\nplanar graphs the treewidth of the display graph can be as much as linear in\nits number of vertices.

In this paper, our interest is in computing maximum flows under this\nrobustness assumption. An important new feature of our model, distinguishing it\nfrom existing max robust flow models, is that no flow can get lost in the\nnetwork.\n  We also study a tightening of reroutable flows, called strictly reroutable\nflows, making more restrictive assumptions on the capacities available for\nrerouting. For both variants, we devise a reroutable-flow equivalent of an\ns-t-cut and show that the corresponding max flow/min cut gap is bounded by 2.\nIt turns out that a strictly reroutable flow of maximum value can be found\nusing a compact LP formulation, whereas the problem of finding a maximum\nreroutable flow is NP-hard, even when all capacities are in {1, 2}.

In fact, we prove an even\nstronger statement in which those topological minors are rooted at any choice\nof prescribed subsets of vertices.\n  A number of results on $H$-topological minor free or $H$-minor free graphs\nhave conclusions or requirements tied to properties of $H$. Classes of graphs\nthat can half-integrally pack only a bounded number of $H$-topological minors\nor $H$-minors are more general topological minor-closed or minor-closed\nfamilies whose minimal obstructions are more complicated than $H$.

Some models allowing a $1/N$ expansion have been\nexplored, most of them generating branched-polymer geometries. Recently,\nenhancements yielding an additional 2d quantum-gravity (planar) phase and an\nintermediate regime of proliferating baby-universes have been found. It remains\nan open issue to find models escaping these lower dimensionality universality\nclasses.\n  Here we analyse the dominant regime and critical behaviour of a range of new\nmodels which are candidates for such effective geometries, in particular\ninteractions based on the utility graph $K_{3,3}$. We find that, upon proper\nenhancement, the two-phase structure of a branched-polymer and a 2d gravity\nregime is the common case in $U(N)$-invariant rank $D=4$ tensor models of small\norders. Not only the well known so-called necklace interactions but also\n$K_{3,3}$-type interactions turn out as the source for the planar regime. We\ngive a systematic account of the enhancement scaling, the counting of\nleading-order diagrams and the multi-critical behaviour of a wide range of\ninteractions, in particular for all order-6 interactions of rank 3 and 4. These\nfindings support the claim of universality of such mixtures of branched-polymer\nand planar diagrams at criticality. In particular, this hints at the necessity\nto consider new ingredients, or interactions of higher order and rank, in order\nto obtain higher dimensional continuum geometry from tensor models. \n\n"}

Our lower bound even generalizes to imply that no data\nstructure capable of approximating $dist_{G \\setminus F}(s, t)$ similarly can\nbeat the space usage of our spanner in the worst case. We also consider the\nedge fault tolerant (EFT) model, defined analogously with edge failures rather\nthan vertex failures. We show that the same spanner upper bound applies in this\nsetting. Our data structure lower bound extends to the case $k=2$ (and hence we\nclose the EFT problem for $3$-approximations), but it falls to $\\Omega(f^{1/2 -\n1/(2k)} \\cdot n^{1 + 1/k})$ for $k \\ge 3$.

Abstract: Partisan gerrymandering is a major cause for voter disenfranchisement in\nUnited States.

Recently,\nStephanopoulos and McGhee introduced a new and precise measure of partisan\ngerrymandering via the so-called \"efficiency gap\" that computes the absolutes\ndifference of wasted votes between two political parties in a two-party system.\nQuite importantly from a legal point of view, this measure was found legally\nconvincing enough in a US appeals court in a case that claims that the\nlegislative map of the state of Wisconsin was gerrymandered; the case is now\npending in US Supreme Court. In this article, we show the following:\n  (a) We provide interesting mathematical and computational complexity\nproperties of the problem of minimizing the efficiency gap measure. To the best\nof our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial theoretical and algorithmic\nanalyses of this measure of gerrymandering.\n  (b) We provide a simple and fast algorithm that can \"un-gerrymander\" the\ndistrict maps for the states of Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by\nbring their efficiency gaps to acceptable levels from the current unacceptable\nlevels.

Based on these empirical\nresults, we also provide some interesting insights into three practical issues\nrelated the efficiency gap measure.\n  We believe that, should the US Supreme Court uphold the decision of lower\ncourts, our research work and software will provide a crucial supporting hand\nto remove partisan gerrymandering. \n\n"}

Alavi,\nMalde, Schwenk and Erdos (1987) conjectured that $I(G;x)$ is unimodal, whenever\n$G$ is a forest, while Brown, Dilcher and Nowakowski (2000) conjectured that\n$I(G;x)$ is unimodal for any well-covered graph G.
