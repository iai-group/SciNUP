{"id": "0807.3467", "contents": "Title: Quantum phase transitions in the interacting boson model Abstract: This review is focused on various properties of quantum phase transitions\n(QPTs) in the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) of nuclear structure. The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter\nregions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited\nstates, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the\nsystem.

All these aspects of IBM phase transitions are relevant in\nthe interpretation of experimental data and important for a fundamental\nunderstanding of the QPT phenomenon. \n\n"}

We find that all electron capture\nreactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are\nnot a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are\ninfeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much\nshallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm\nthe proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12C + 12C\ntriggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction\ncross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies,\nbut resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured\nenergy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a\nresonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical\n1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the\nresonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the\ntheoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in\nthis case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord\nwith model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters.

The model form factor is computed\nusing an exact covariant calculation of the lowest-order triangle diagram and\nshown to be the same as that obtained using light-front techniques. The meaning\nof transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables, allowing\nus to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form\nfactor.

Neutral\nsystems of two charged constituents are shown to obey the lore that the heavier\none is generally closer to the transverse origin than the lighter one. It is\nargued that the negative central charge density of the neutron arises, in\npion-cloud models, from pions of high longitudinal momentum. The\nnon-relativistic limit is defined precisely and the ratio of the binding energy\nto that of the mass of the lightest constituent is shown to govern the\ninfluence of relativistic effects.

This has led\nnaturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of\n\"generalized\" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic\nfactorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process\ndependent Wilson line structures. In other words, to recover a factorization\nformula, it has become common to assume that it is sufficient to simply modify\nthe Wilson lines in the parton correlation functions for each separate hadron.\nIn this paper, we will illustrate by direct counter-example that this is not\npossible in a non-Abelian gauge theory. Since a proof of generalized transverse\nmomentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard\nhadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a\ngeneral proof does not exist. Therefore, to make the counter-argument clear and\nexplicit, we illustrate with a specific calculation for a double spin asymmetry\nin a spectator model with a non-Abelian gauge field.

Thus we are lead to question whether descriptions of angular\ncorrelation data including higher-order harmonics inform our understanding of\nthe same-side peak or heavy-ion collisions in general. Results from analysis of\ntwo-dimensional angular correlation data from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion\nCollider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that the RHIC data do\nnot exclude a single-Gaussian hypothesis for the same-side peak. We find that\nthe net effect of including the $m = 3$ harmonic or azimuth sextupole in the\nfitting model is the inclusion of small non-Gaussian dependence in the\nmathematical description of the same-side peak. Those non-Gaussian effects are\nsystematically insignificant and can be accommodated by minor perturbations to\nthe same-side 2D Gaussian peak model, which act locally at small relative\nazimuth. We also demonstrate that the 0-1% 2D angular correlation data for 2.76\nTeV Pb+Pb collisions from ATLAS, which display an away-side double peak on\nazimuth, do not require a sextupole and exclude a positive same-side sextupole. \n\n"}

The purpose of\nthis study is twofold. First, we improve our previous event-by-event studies,\nby properly implementing $p_t$ dependence in the modeling. We show that, within\nthe jet \"monography\" scenario featuring a strong near-Tc-enhancement of jet\nenergy loss, the computed high-$p_t$ nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and\nthe harmonic coefficients in its azimuthal anisotropy $v_{2,\\,3,\\,4}$, agree\nwell with the available data from both Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)\nand Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Second, in light of current discussions on\npossible final state collective behavior in the high-multiplicity pPb and dAu\ncollisions, we examine the implication of final state jet attenuation in such\ncollisions, by applying the same model used in AA collisions and quantifying\nthe corresponding $R_{pA}$ and $R_{dA}$ and their azimuthal anisotropy. The\nhigh-$p_t$ $V_n$ provide a set of clean indicators of final state energy loss.\nIn particular we find in the most central pPb (5.02 TeV) and dAu (200 GeV)\ncollisions, $V_2$ is on the order of $0.01$ and $0.1$ respectively, measurable\nwith current experimental accuracy.

Nuclear Data for Dark Matter Astrophysics Abstract: Astronomical observations from small galaxies to the largest scales in the\nuniverse can be consistently explained by the simple idea of dark matter. The\nnature of dark matter is however still unknown. Empirically it cannot be any of\nthe known particles, and many theories postulate it as a new elementary\nparticle. Searches for dark matter particles are under way: production at\nhigh-energy accelerators, direct detection through dark matter-nucleus\nscattering, indirect detection through cosmic rays, gamma rays, or effects on\nstars. Particle dark matter searches rely on observing an excess of events\nabove background, and a lot of controversies have arisen over the origin of\nobserved excesses. With the new high-quality cosmic ray measurements from the\nAMS-02 experiment, the major uncertainty in modeling cosmic ray fluxes is in\nthe nuclear physics cross sections for spallation and fragmentation of cosmic\nrays off interstellar hydrogen and helium. The understanding of direct\ndetection backgrounds is limited by poor knowledge of cosmic ray activation in\ndetector materials, with order of magnitude differences between simulation\ncodes. A scarcity of data on nucleon spin densities blurs the connection\nbetween dark matter theory and experiments. What is needed, ideally, are more\nand better measurements of spallation cross sections relevant to cosmic rays\nand cosmogenic activation, and data on the nucleon spin densities in nuclei. \n\n"}

The DiFFs are\nextracted as Monte Carlo (MC) averages of corresponding multiplicities using\ntheir probabilistic interpretation. To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of\nthe produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with\nelementary Collins modulation. We calculate the dependence of the polarised\nDiFFs on various angles such as the azimuthal angle of the single hadron and\nthe angle of the two hadron production plane $\\varphi_R$ for several values of\n$P_{SF}$.

We study\nthe emergence, evolution, and nature of both the soft and giant isoscalar\nmonopole modes as a function of neutron excess in three unstable Nickel\nisotopes: 56Ni, 68Ni, and 78Ni. The distribution of isoscalar monopole strength\nis computed in a relativistic random-phase approximation using several\naccurately calibrated effective interactions. In particular, a non-spectral\nGreen's function approach is adopted that allows for an exact treatment of the\ncontinuum without any reliance on discretization. The discretization of the\ncontinuum is neither required nor admitted. In the case of 56Ni, the lack of\nlow-energy strength results in a direct correlation between the centroid energy\nof the giant monopole resonance and the incompressibility coefficient of\nsymmetric nuclear matter. In contrast, the large neutron excess in both 68Ni\nand 78Ni generates a significant, yet relatively featureless, amount of\nlow-energy strength that is driven by transitions into the continuum.

This Letter extends the previous results\nreported by ALICE to more peripheral collisions. No strong change of the\ncharged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions with centrality is\nobserved, and when normalised to the number of participating nucleons in the\ncollisions, the evolution over pseudorapidity with centrality is likewise\nsmall. The broad pseudorapidity range allows precise estimates of the total\nnumber of produced charged particles which we find to range from $162\\pm22$\n(syst.) to $17170\\pm770$ (syst.) in 80-90% and 0-5 central collisions,\nrespectively.

For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium.

Additional states,\neither listed in the Particle Data Group booklet (PDG) but not well\nestablished, or predicted by the Quark Model (QM), are necessary in order to\nreproduce the lattice data. For mesons, it appears that the PDG and the quark\nmodel do not list enough strange mesons, or that, in this sector, interactions\nbeyond those included in the HRG model are needed to reproduce the lattice QCD\nresults. \n\n"}

These processes hold a lot of potential for resolving the outstanding\nissues related to the dynamics of hadronization in QCD. Within the minimal Fock\ncomponent framework, valid at large Bjorken $x$, the main features of the\ntheoretical approach based on the virtual nucleon approximation are elaborated.\nIn this approach, the strong final-state interaction of the DIS products with\nthe nuclear fragments is described by an effective eikonal amplitude, whose\nparameters can be extracted from the analysis of semi-inclusive DIS off the\ndeuteron target. The extraction of the $Q^2$ and $W$ mass dependences of these\nparameters gives a new observable in studying the QCD structure of DIS final\nstates. Another important feature of tagged DIS off the lightest nuclei is the\npossibility of performing pole extrapolation with a high degree of accuracy.\nSuch extrapolation allows an extraction of the neutron structure function in a\nmodel independent way due to suppression of the final-state interaction in the\non-shell limit of the struck nucleon propagator. We review the first\napplication of the pole extrapolation to recent experimental data.

[Phys. Rev. {\\bf A 94}, 043614\n(2016)] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large $s$-wave\nscattering length $a_s$ was proposed that has no free parameters. The\nfunctional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases\ntogether with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at\nlow density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities\n$\\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang\nfunctional, valid for $\\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional\nretained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional\ncorresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all\norders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One\nconclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density\nregime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with\nrespect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce\ndensity--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare\ninteraction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some\nof the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas\nproperties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that\nthe scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the\nso-called Bertsch parameter $\\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also\npoint out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those\nempirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional.

The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different picture:\naccurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector\ndiquarks; in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark\ncores contain roughly equal fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the\nassociated wave functions are predominantly $P$-wave in nature, but possess\nmeasurable $S$-wave components.

Heavy-quark\ntransport coefficients extracted from these models with their default\nparameters vary, however, by up to a factor of 5 at high momenta. To\ninvestigate the origin of this large theoretical uncertainty, a systematic\ncomparison of heavy-quark transport coefficients is carried out between various\ntransport models.

This indicates\nthe importance of a realistic hydrodynamic evolution constrained by bulk hadron\nspectra and of heavy-quark hadronization for understanding the final\nheavy-flavor hadron spectra and extracting heavy-quark drag coefficient.

A single set of SMM parameters\ndirectly determined by the data and the semi-empiricalmass formula are used\nafter the adjustable inverse level density parameter, $\\epsilon_{o}$ is\ndetermined by the fragment distributions. The results from SMM for second stage\nmultiplicity, size of the biggest fragment and the intermediate mass fragments\nare in excellent agreement with the data. Multifragmentation thresholds have\nbeen obtained for all three systems using SMM prior to secondary decay. The\ndata indicate that both thermal excitation energy $E_{th}^{*}$ and the isotope\nratio temperature $T_{He-DT}$ decrease with increase in system size at the\ncritical point. The breakup temperature obtained from SMM also shows the same\ntrend as seen in the data. The SMM model is used to study the nature of the MF\nphase transition. The caloric curve for Kr exhibits back-bending (finite latent\nheat) while the caloric curves for Au and La are consistent with a continuous\nphase transition (nearly zero latent heat) and the values of the critical\nexponents $\\tau$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, both from data and SMM, are close to\nthose for a 'liquid-gas' system for Au and La. We conclude that the larger\nCoulomb expansion energy in Au and La reduces the latent heat required for MF\nand changes the nature of the phase transition.

Special emphasis is put on its relation to the\nfluctuation of the chiral order parameter $<\\bar{q}q>$. In the vacuum, the\n$\\sigma$-meson is an elusive resonance corresponding to a pole deep in the\nsecond Riemann sheet of the $\\pi$-$\\pi$ scattering matrix in the $I$=$J$=0\nchannel.

Space cell\ndivision is available to save the number of computer operations. This improves\nthe speed of the calculation by a large factor and makes the code best\noptimized for simulation of parton cascade in ultrarelativistic heavy ion\ncollisions. \n\n"}

Here `standard model' means the combined standard model\nof minimal electroweak theory plus a standard solar model. I emphasize the\nimportance of recent analyses in which the neutrino fluxes are treated as free\nparameters, independent of any constraints from solar models, and the stunning\nagreement between the predictions of standard solar models and\nhelioseismological measurements. In order to interpret solar neutrino\nexperiments more accurately in terms of fundamental physics and astronomy, we\nneed improved improved nuclear physics data. I describe the five most important\nnuclear physics problems whose solution is required for understanding the\nprecise implications of solar neutrino experiments. \n\n"}

Prospects of\ndetermining the radiogenic contribution to terrestrial heat by detection of\nantineutrinos from natural radioactivity (geoneutrinos) are discussed. A three\nkton scintillator detector in three years can clearly discriminate among\ndifferent models of terrestrial heat production. In addition, the study of\ngeoneutrinos offers a possibility of improving the determination of neutrino\nmass and mixing, by exploiting the knowledge of Th/U abundance in the Earth. \n\n"}

The\ncalibration that relates the amount of light detected in such crystals to\nincident energy of photons or electrons is of paramount importance to\nmaintaining the energy resolution the detection system. We report on tests of\nlead tungstate crystals, read out by photomultiplier tubes, exposed to\nirradiation by monoenergetic electron or pion beams. The beam electrons\nthemselves were used to measure the scintillation light output, and a blue\nlight emitting diode (LED) was used to track variations of crystals\ntransparency. We report on the correlation of the LED measurement with\nradiation damage by the beams and also show that it can accurately monitor the\ncrystals recovery from such damage. \n\n"}

The radiation is\nreduced (compared to that from two independent particles) when the pair\nseparation is smaller than the wavelength of the emitted light.

Multivariate classification methods based on machine\nlearning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses. Also\nthe multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent\nyears. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to\nfurther gain in performance. Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA\nis a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification\nalgorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all\navailable classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly\ninterfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression\nof a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user\ninterfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling\nallowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods. A generalised boosting\nmethod is the first realisation benefiting from the new framework. \n\n"}

We simulated the spin relaxation caused by thermal excitations of\nthe high frequency cantilever modes in the region of the Rabi frequency of the\nspin sub-system. The minimum relaxation time obtained in our simulations is\ngreater but of the same order of magnitude as one measured in recent\nexperiments. We demonstrated that using a cantilever with nonuniform\ncross-sectional area may significantly increase spin relaxation time. \n\n"}
