{"id": "1209.6049", "contents": "Title: Modular Invariant Regularization of String Determinants and the Serre\n  GAGA Principle Abstract: Since any string theory involves a path integration on the world-sheet\nmetric, their partition functions are volume forms on the moduli space of genus\ng Riemann surfaces M_g, or on its super analog. It is well known that modular\ninvariance fixes strong constraints that in some cases appear only at higher\ngenus. Here we classify all the Weyl and modular invariant partition functions\ngiven by the path integral on the world-sheet metric, together with space-time\ncoordinates, b-c and/or beta-gamma systems, that correspond to volume forms on\nM_g. This was a long standing question, advocated by Belavin and Knizhnik,\ninspired by the Serre GAGA principle and based on the properties of the Mumford\nforms. The key observation is that the Bergman reproducing kernel provides a\nWeyl and modular invariant way to remove the point dependence that appears in\nthe above string determinants, a property that should have its superanalog\nbased on the super Bergman reproducing kernel. This is strictly related to the\nproperties of the propagator associated to the space-time coordinates. Such\npartition functions Z[J] have well-defined asymptotic behavior and can be\nconsidered as a basis to represent a wide class of string theories. In\nparticular, since non-critical bosonic string partition functions Z_D are\nvolume forms on M_g, we suggest that there is a mapping, based on bosonization\nand degeneration techniques, from the Liouville sector to first order systems\nthat may identify Z_D as a subclass of the Z[J]. The appearance of b-c and\nbeta-gamma systems of any conformal weight shows that such theories are related\nto W algebras. The fact that in a large N 't Hooft-like limit 2D W_N minimal\nmodels CFTs are related to higher spin gravitational theories on AdS_3,\nsuggests that the string partition functions introduced here may lead to a\nformulation of higher spin theories in a string context. \n\n"}

We show\nthat a deformation in the large of complex tori is again a complex torus, and\nthen that the same holds for products of a torus with a curve of genus $g\\geq\n2$. Together with old results of Blanchard, Calabi, and Sommese, who showed the\nexistence of non K\\\"ahler complex structures on the product of a curve with a\ntwo dimensional complex torus, this gives the first counterexamples. We\ngeneralize these constructions and we study the small deformations of what we\ncall Blanchard-Calabi 3-folds. These give infinitely many deformation\ncomponents. We give also a criterion for a complex manifold to be a complex\ntorus, namely, to have the same integral cohomology algebra of a complex torus,\nand to possess $n$ independent holomorphic and d-closed 1-forms.

The objects themselves are\nnot pathological, and are in fact as nice as can be: the curves are smooth, the\nsurfaces have very ample canonical bundle, the stable sheaves are torsion-free\nof rank 1, the singularities are normal and Cohen-Macaulay, etc. This justifies\nMumford's philosophy that even moduli spaces of well-behaved objects should be\narbitrarily bad unless there is an a priori reason otherwise.\n  Thus one can construct a smooth curve in projective space whose deformation\nspace has any given number of components, each with any given singularity type,\nwith any given non-reduced behavior along various associated subschemes.\nSimilarly one can give a surface over F_p that lifts to Z/p^7 but not Z/p^8.\n(Of course the results hold in the holomorphic category as well.)\n  It is usually difficult to compute deformation spaces directly from\nobstruction theories.
