In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric\nsecond-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In\nthe dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order\nperturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be\ntuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between\nthe two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit\noperation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible\narchitecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave\nfield states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in\ncircuit QED. In addition, we clarify the role played by the geometric\ninteraction, which constitutes a fundamental property characteristic of\nsuperconducting quantum circuits without counterpart in quantum-optical\nsystems.

This offers a fascinating arena to\nstudy the physics of broken gauge symmetry. However, the important symmetries\nin superconductors are not only the gauge invariance. Especially, the symmetry\nproperties of the pairing, i.e., the parity and spin-singlet/spin-triplet,\ndetermine the physical properties of the superconducting state. Recently it has\nbeen recognized that there is the important third symmetry of the pair\namplitude, i.e., even or odd parity with respect to the frequency. The\nconventional uniform superconducting states correspond to the even-frequency\npairing, but the recent finding is that the odd-frequency pair amplitude arises\nin the spatially non-uniform situation quite ubiquitously. Especially, this is\nthe case in the Andreev bound state (ABS) appearing at the surface/interface of\nthe sample. The other important recent development is on the nontrivial\ntopological aspects of superconductors.

The modeling of the competing electronic\nstates of the cuprates is achieved in terms of consecutive orbital selective\nincompressibility-compressibility transitions for the charge response.

For small $R_{12}$ the superconducting order parameter is only\nsuppressed to some extent near the surface for the both bands. For intermediate\nand strong interband scattering there are two possible non-trivial surface\nstates of the order parameter: (i) purely real solution, where the symmetry of\nthe superconducting state near the surface is changed from $s_{\\pm}$ to\nconventional $s_{++}$ and (ii) time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRB) state. In\nthis state the order parameters in the two bands acquire phases $\\phi_{1,2}(x)\n\\neq (0,\\pi)$ upon approaching the surface. We argue that at low temperatures\nthe TRB surface state can be more energetically favorable than the $s_{\\pm} \\to\ns_{++}$ time reversal symmetry conserving state (TR).

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad\ndomain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large\nfrequency range. In this paper we review the current state of the theory of\ndecoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. We discuss basic\nmechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices and then review several models\ndescribing the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices. The main\nfocus of the review is to analyze how the 1/f noise destroys their coherent\noperation. We start from individual qubits concentrating mostly on the devices\nbased on superconductor circuits, and then discuss some special issues related\nto more complicated architectures. Finally, we consider several strategies for\nminimizing the noise-induced decoherence. \n\n"}

The mechanism behind that resides in the\nstructural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical configurations Cu$^{\\rm\nII}$O$_4$ and Cu$^{\\rm III}$O$_4$ which compose the CuO$_2$ planes. It leads to\nspontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local\nFeshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.\nThe coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping\nof the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and\npaired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other. Upon lowering the\ntemperature to below a certain $T^*$, bound and unbound electron pairs lock\ntogether in a local quantum superposition, generating transient localized bound\nelectron pairs and a concomitant opening of a pseudo-gap in the single-particle\ndensity of states. At low temperature, this pseudo-gap state transits via a\nfirst order hole doping induced phase transition into a superconducting state\nin which the localized transient bound electron pairs get spatially phase\ncorrelated. The mechanism driving that transition is a phase separation between\ntwo phases having different relative densities of bound and unbound electron\npairs, which is reminiscent of the physics of $^4$He - $^3$He mixtures. \n\n"}

However, since the discovery of the high temperature\nsuperconductors (HTSC) in 1986, the central role attributed to the pseudogap in\nthese systems has meant that by many researchers now associate the term\npseudogap exclusively with the HTSC phenomenon. Recently, the problem has got a\nlot of new attention with the rediscovery of two distinct energy scales\n(`two-gap scenario') and charge density waves patterns in the cuprates. Despite\nmany excellent reviews on the pseudogap phenomenon in HTSC, published from its\nvery discovery up to now, the mechanism of the pseudogap and its relation to\nsuperconductivity are still open questions.

Using\nquasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes\nfinite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,\nwhich are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that\nthe magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,\nM(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between\ntwo Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,\nwhile MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase\ncoherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows\nus to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that\nMI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization\nMII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged\nmagnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC\nvoltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)\nwith frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction.

We also discuss that\nthe magnetization induced in N can be measurably large in realistic systems.\nTherefore, the measurement of the induced magnetization serves as an\nalternative way to detect the phase coherence between two Ss in Josephson\njunctions.

As a promising\ncandidate in this race, the one-dimensional chiral Majorana edge mode (CMEM) in\ntopological insulator-superconductor heterostructures has gathered renewed\ninterests during recent months after an experimental breakthrough. In this\npaper, we study the quantum transport of topological insulator-superconductor\nhybrid devices subject to light-matter interaction or general time-periodic\nmodulation. We report half-integer quantized conductance plateaus at\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{e^2}{h}$ and $\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{e^2}{h}$ upon applying the\nso-called sum rule in the theory of quantum transport in Floquet topological\nmatter. In particular, in a photoinduced topological superconductor sandwiched\nbetween two Floquet Chern insulators, it is found that for each Floquet\nsideband, the CMEM admits equal probability for normal transmission and local\nAndreev reflection over a wide range of parameter regimes, yielding\nhalf-integer quantized plateaus that resist static and time-periodic disorder.\nThe $\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{e^2}{h}$ plateau has not yet been computationally or\nexperimentally observed in any other superconducting system, and indicates the\npossibility to simultaneously create and manipulate multiple pairs of CMEMs by\nlight. The robust half-quantized conductance plateaus, due to CMEMs at\nquasienergies zero or half the driving frequency, are both fascinating and\nsubtle because they only emerge after a summation over contributions from all\nFloquet sidebands. Such a distinctive transport signature can thus serve as a\nhallmark of photoinduced CMEMs in topological insulator-superconductor\njunctions. \n\n"}

We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped\nto a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a\nstring involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the\ndifferent segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all\nsuch internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the\nlocalization of the entire string. The eigenstates of the system can then be\nconstructed perturbatively through a convergent 'string locator expansion.' We\npropose a type of out-of-time-order string correlator as a diagnostic of such a\nstring localized phase.

Here we show that, in analogy to a qubit, the\nout-of-equilibrium superconducting state in such materials can be described by\na Bloch vector and controlled on ultrafast time scales. The all-optical control\nmechanism is universal, permitting arbitrary rotations of the order parameter,\nand can induce a dynamical change of handedness of the condensate.

Due to the Doppler effect of fireballs, there exists a power law\nrelationship between the two quantities within a limited range of frequency.\nThe power law range and the power law index depend strongly on the observed\npeak energy $E_p$ as well as the rest frame radiation form, and the upper and\nlower limits of the power law range can be determined by $E_p$. It is found\nthat, within the same power law range, the ratio of the $FWHM$ of the rising\nportion to that of the decaying phase of the pulses is also related with energy\nin the form of power laws. A platform-power-law-platform feature could be\nobserved in the two relationships.

It is based on the Gutzwiller\napproximation which gives the renormalization of parameters, t and J, due to\nthe Gutzwiller's projection operator excluding the double occupancies. The\nfinite-range correlations are taken into account compared with the conventional\nGutzwiller approximation where only the on-site expectation values are\nconsidered. It is shown that the essential point of the renormalization is its\nnonlinear dependence on the expectation values of Cooper pairs and\nantiferromagnetic moment. In particular the renormalization factor of J becomes\nanisotropic in the presence of antiferromagnetic moment, i.e., that for the\nz-component is enhanced compared with that for the xy-component. The physical\norigin of this enhancement is identified as the surrounding antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations of a bond.

To this end we investigate the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model\nin the strong coupling regime at high temperatures. The dynamics is\ninvestigated within the Bloch-Redfield formalism. At low temperatures, when\nonly the few lowest levels are occupied the susceptibility can be presented as\na sum of contributions from independent level-to-level transitions. This\ncorresponds to the secular (random phase) approximation in the Bloch-Redfield\nformalism. At temperatures comparable to and higher than the oscillator\nfrequency, many transitions become important and a multiple-peak structure\nappears. We show that in this regime the secular approximation breaks down, as\nsoon as the peaks start to overlap.

The existing underground neutrino\ndetectors (SuperKamiokande, SNO, ...) and the gravity wave antennas soon to\noperate (LIGO, Virgo, ...) are well matched in their performance for detecting\ngalactic supernovae and for making use of the proposed approach. Several\nmethods are described, which apply to the different scenarios depending on\nneutrino mixing. Given the present knowledge on neutrino oscillations, the\nmethods proposed are sensitive to a mass range where neutrinos would\nessentially be mass-degenerate.

We\nobtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of an\nencoded state after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions depend\nonly on the behavior of the logical states. We use them to give a recovery\noperator independent definition of error-correcting codes.
