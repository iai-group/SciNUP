But -- do we know how clouds form\non brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets? How do they look like? Can we see\nthem? What are they composed of? Cloud formation is an old-fashioned but still\noutstanding problem for the Earth atmosphere, and it has turned into a\nchallenge for the modelling of brown dwarf and exo-planetary atmospheres. Cloud\nformation imposes strong feedbacks on the atmospheric structure, not only due\nto the clouds own opacity, but also due to the depletion of the gas phase,\npossibly leaving behind a dynamic and still supersaturated atmosphere. I\nsummarise the different approaches taken to model cloud formation in substellar\natmospheres and workout their differences. Focusing on the\nphase-non-equilibrium approach to cloud formation, I demonstrate the inside we\ngain from detailed micro-physical modelling on for instance the material\ncomposition and grain size distribution inside the cloud layer on a Brown Dwarf\natmosphere.

We present new observations of this absorption feature\nin the spectrum of Q21-1, a background field star located behind a dark\nfilament in the Cocoon Nebula (IC5146).

All clusters older than ~3 Myr show a decrease in disk fraction with\nincreasing stellar mass for Solar to higher mass stars. This result is\nsignificant at about the 1 $\\sigma$ level in each cluster. For the complete set\nof clusters we reject the null hypothesis--that Solar and intermediate-mass\nstars lose their disks at the same rate--with 95-99.9% confidence. To interpret\nthis behaviour, we investigate the impact of grain growth, binary companions,\nand photoevaporation on the evolution of disk signatures. Changes in grain\ngrowth timescales at fixed disk temperature may explain why early-type stars\nwith IR excesses appear to evolve faster than their later-type counterparts.\nLittle evidence that binary companions affect disk evolution suggests that\nphotoevaporation is the more likely mechanism for disk dispersal. A simple\nphotoevaporation model provides a good fit to the observed disk fractions for\nSolar and intermediate-mass stars. Although the current mass-dependent disk\ndispersal signal is not strong, larger and more complete samples of clusters\nwith ages of 3-5 Myr can improve the significance and provide better tests of\ntheoretical models. In addition, the orbits of extra-Solar planets can\nconstrain models of disk dispersal and migration. We suggest that the signature\nof stellar mass dependent disk dispersal due to photoevaporation may be present\nin the orbits of observed extra Solar planets.

The\nfirst scaling is s/p ratios are almost constant over a wide range of the atomic\nnumber, where the p-nculei are lighter than the s-nuclei by two or four\nneutrons. The second scaling is p/p ratios are almost constant, where the\nsecond $p$-nuclei are lighter than the first p-nucleus by two neutrons. These\nscalings are a piece of evidence that most p-nuclei are dominantly synthesized\nby the gamma-process in supernova explosions. The scalings lead to a novel\nconcept of \"universality of gamma-process\" that the s/p and p/p ratios of\nnuclei produced by individual gamma-processes are almost constant,\nrespectively. We have calculated the ratios by gamma-process based on\ncore-collapse supernova explosion models under various astrophysical conditions\nand found that the scalings hold for materials produced by individual\ngamma-processes independent of the astrophysical conditions assumed. The\nuniversality originates from three mechanisms: the shifts of the gamma-process\nlayers to keep their peak temperature, the weak s-process in pre-supernovae,\nand the independence of the s/p ratios of the nuclear reactions. The results\nfurther suggest an extended universality that the s/p ratios in the\ngamma-process layers are not only constant but also centered on a specific\nvalue of 3. With this specific value and the first scaling, we estimate that\nthe ratios of $s$-process abundance contributions from the AGB stars to the\nmassive stars are almost 6.7 for the $s$-nuclei of A > 90.

This\nplanetary system is of particular interest because it has an orbital period of\n9.202 days, the second longest one among the transiting planets known to date.\nWe study the surface rotation and the activity of the host star during an\nuninterrupted sequence of optical observations of 58 days.

It assumes that stellar\nactive regions consist of cool spots and bright faculae, analogous to sunspots\nand solar photospheric faculae, whose visibility is modulated by stellar\nrotation. The modelling of the light curve of CoRoT-Exo-4a reveals three main\nactive longitudes with lifetimes between about 30 and 60 days that rotate\nquasi-synchronously with the orbital motion of the planet.

Systematics and uncertainties of the\n  mid-infrared spectral analysis methods Abstract: The spectral region around 10 micrometer, showing prominent dust emission\nbands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary\ndust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum).

Importantly, an earlier episode of tidal heating can result\nin a planet with an inflated radius, even though its orbit has nearly\ncircularized. Moreover, we confirm that at late times, and under some\ncircumstances, by raising tides on the star itself a planet can spiral into its\nhost.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems.

This restriction relates to the requirement that dust has to be\nconcentrated in spiral features on a timescale that is less than the (roughly\ndynamical) lifetime of such features, and that such rapid accumulation requires\nspiral features whose fractional amplitude is not much less than unity. This in\nturn requires that the cooling timescale of the gas is relatively short, which\nrestricts the process to the outer disc.

Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion.

We investigate\nthe precision that can be achieved in radial velocity measurements of low mass\nstars in the near infrared (nIR) Y-, J-, and H-bands, and we compare it to the\nprecision achievable in the optical. For early-M stars, radial velocity\nmeasurements in the nIR offer no or only marginal advantage in comparison to\noptical measurements. Although they emit more flux in the nIR, the richness of\nspectral features in the optical outweighs the flux difference. We find that\nnIR measurement can be as precise than optical measurements in stars of\nspectral type ~M4, and from there the nIR gains in precision towards cooler\nobjects.

We present models of\nthe planet/star flux ratio as function of wavelength, which are calculated for\na T/P profile in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium, using a self-consistent\natmosphere code. These are compared with the CoRoT detection, and with\nmeasurements at 4.5 and 8 um from the Spitzer Space Telescope from Gillon et\nal. (2009). We estimate that reflected light contributes only at a 10-20% level\nto the total optical eclipse depth. The models allow for an 'extra absorber' to\nbe inserted at high altitude in the planet's atmosphere. This produces a\nthermal inversion layer, recently invoked to explain the photometric reversals\nand flux enhancements seen in some planets in the infrared. In the 0.5-1.5 um\nwavelength range, the model-spectra of planets with an extra absorber at high\naltitude, are relatively suppressed in flux compared to those without such\nabsorber. We therefore argue that, in contrast to the other exoplanets detected\nin the optical so far, CoRoT-2b may not exhibit a significant thermal inversion\nin its atmosphere, causing its optical brightness temperature to be boosted\nabove its maximum effective day-side temperature. \n\n"}

Several formation scenarios have\nbeen proposed, where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core\naccretion with type I migration (e.g. Terquem & Papaloizou 2007) and planetary\natmosphere physics (e.g. Alibert et al. 2006).

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating. We have modified our\nmodel to include an orbital period dependence of the tidal dissipation factor\nin the star, $Q'_{\\ast} \\propto P^{\\gamma}$, $-1 \\leqslant \\gamma \\leqslant 1$.\nWith this model, we search, for a tidally heated planet, orbital and radius\nevolutionary tracks that fall within the observational limits of the radius,\nthe semimajor axis, and the eccentricity of the planet in its current estimated\nage range.

Such a disk could provide the necessary\nenvironment for the formation of a second generation of planets in both\ncircumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation\nplanets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems may serve as seeds for,\nand/or interact with, the second generation planets, possibly forming atypical\nplanetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically\nfound in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational\nsignatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment\nwhich are inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The\norbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be\nforbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the\npre-evolved progenitor binaries.

Abstract: In planetary nebulae, abundances of oxygen and other heavy elements derived\nfrom optical recombination lines are systematically higher than those derived\nfrom collisionally excited lines. We investigate the hypothesis that the\ndestruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas\nthat could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly\nexceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected\nto be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars. We therefore\nconclude that contemporaneous solid body destruction cannot explain the\nobserved abundance discrepancies in planetary nebulae. However, similar\narguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion.\nIn this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one\nten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris\ndisks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may\ncontribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some planetary nebulae, so\nlong as mixing of the high metallicity gas is inefficient. \n\n"}

What both processes deliver is a quantitative selection\nprocess such that one can use them to draw quantitative conclusions about\nplanetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution from a given data set.\nAveraging over all 24 stars, in the period range P<300 days and the\neccentricity range 0.0<e<0.6, we could have detected 99% of planets with\nvelocity amplitudes K>7.1 m/s. For the best stars in the sample, we are able to\ndetect or exclude planets with K>3 m/s, corresponding to minimum masses of 8\nM_earth (P=5 days) or 17 M_earth (P=50 days). Our results indicate that the\nobserved \"period valley,\" a lack of giant planets (M>100 M_earth) with periods\nbetween 10-100 days, is indeed real. However, for planets in the mass range\n10-100 M_earth, our results suggest that the deficit of such planets may be a\nresult of selection effects. \n\n"}

We have studied its importance on the period, the amplitude of the\nsolar cycle, and also in producing Maunder-like grand minima in these models.\nFirst, we model the periods of the last 23 sunspot cycles by varying the\nmeridional circulation speed. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,\nthen we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some\nextent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an\nadvection-dominated regime. \n\n"}

The present\ninvestigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution\nmechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism\ngoverning the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently\n-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly\ngoverned by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient\nintroduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two\nhundred thousand million years.

We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock\naround its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For\nWASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.\nObservational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal\nvariations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock\nand the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's\nmagnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding\nambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the\nknown eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets. We show that, because the distance\nfrom the star changes along the orbit of an eccentric planet, the shock\ncharacteristics are modulated by orbital phase. We predict time offsets between\nthe beginnings of the near-UV and optical light curves that are, in general,\nless than the transit duration. Variations in shock characteristics caused in\neccentric systems can only be probed if the shock is observed at different\norbital phases, which is, in general, not the case for transit observations.\nHowever, non-thermal radio emission produced by the interaction of the star and\nplanet should be modulated by orbital phase. We also quantify the response of\nthe shock to variations in the coronal material itself due to, e.g., a\nnon-axisymmetric stellar corona, planetary obliquity, intrinsic variations of\nthe stellar magnetic field. Such variations do not depend on the system\neccentricity.

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes.

The opacity of\n  the dust aggregate size distribution Abstract: The dust size distribution in molecular clouds can be strongly affected by\nice-mantle formation and (subsequent) grain coagulation. Following previous\nwork where the dust size distribution has been calculated from a state-of-the\nart collision model for dust aggregates that involves both coagulation and\nfragmentation (Paper I), the corresponding opacities are presented in this\nstudy. The opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theory\nassuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\\mu}m silicate and graphite\ngrains and vacuum. In particular, we explore how the coagulation affects the\nnear-IR opacities and the opacity in the 9.7{\\mu}m silicate feature. We find\nthat as dust aggregates grow to {\\mu}m-sizes both the near-IR color excess and\nthe opacity in the 9.7 {\\mu}m feature increases. Despite their coagulation,\nporous aggregates help to prolong the presence of the 9.7{\\mu}m feature. We\nfind that the ratio between the opacity in the silicate feature and the near-IR\ncolor excess becomes lower with respect to the ISM, in accordance with many\nobservations of dark clouds. However, this trend is primarily a result of ice\nmantle formation and the mixed material composition of the aggregates, rather\nthan being driven by coagulation.

We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times).

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star).

These properties include: rotation, light variations (from star\nspots), coronal-chromospheric XUV activity and flares.

When all data sets are\ncombined with ages from cluster/population memberships and kinematics, the\ndetermination of Age-Rotation-Activity relationships is possible. Such\nrelationships have broad impacts not only on the studies of magnetic dynamo\ntheory & angular momentum loss of low-mass stars with deep convective zones,\nbut also on the suitability of planets hosted by red dwarfs to support life.\nWith intrinsically low luminosities (L < 0.02L_sun), the liquid water habitable\nzones (HZs) for hosted planets are very close to their host stars - typically\nat ~0.1-0.4 AU.

The binary has a maximum separation of 1\narcsec with less than 0.1 mags difference between components with identical\nultra-red colors (g-i=1.49+-0.01 mags). The orbit of the mutual components was\nfound to have a period of 961.2+-4.6 days with a semi-major axis of 21000+-160\nkm and eccentricity of 0.1529+-0.0028. The inclination is 15.68+-0.22 degs and\nthe mirror orbit rejected at high confidence. The total system mass is\n7.90+-0.21 x 10^17 kg. Equal-sized, wide binaries and ultra-red colors are\ncommon in the low inclination \"cold\" classical part of the Kuiper Belt and\nlikely formed through some sort of three body interactions within a much denser\nKuiper Belt. To date 2007 TY430 is the only ultra-red, equal-sized binary known\noutside of the classical Kuiper belt. Numerical simulations suggest 2007 TY430\nis moderately unstable in the outer part of the 3:2 resonance and thus 2007\nTY430 is likely an escaped \"cold\" classical object that later got trapped in\nresonance. Similar to the known binaries in the cold classical population, 2007\nTY430 requires a high albedo and very low density to obtain the total mass\nfound. For a realistic minimum density of 0.5 g/cm^3 the albedo of 2007 TY430\nwould be greater than 0.17. The radii of either component should be less than\n60 km and thus the relatively low eccentricity of the binary is interesting\nsince no tides should be operating on the bodies.

This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet\npopulation synthesis calculations.\n  Aims. Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of\nimportant disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime on\nfundamental planetary properties.\n  Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population\nof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration\nand disk evolution.\n  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary\ninitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different\nroles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,\ngiant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both\nmore frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets\ncannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.\nIn contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot\nfor giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher\nplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be\ncompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low\nmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high\nmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of\nmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with\nmetallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of\ngiant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,\nbut migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate\nless. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than Hot\nJupiters.\n  Conclusions.

Here, we study the evolution of\nwind-accretion disks, using a numerical approach which allows us to follow the\nlong term evolution. For a broad range of initial conditions, we derive the\nradial density and temperature profiles of the disk. In most cases,\nwind-accretion leads to long-lived stable disks over the lifetime of the AGB\ndonor star. The disks have masses of a few times 10^{-5}-10^{-3} M_sun, with\nsurface density and temperature profiles that follow broken power-laws.

However, the only numerical\nevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field\nevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by\nLaplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the\ntransition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the\ntransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone\nboundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are\nreadily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass\naccretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active\nzones, at the $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure\nmaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A\npressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized\nvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic\ninstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either\nthe parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies\nvorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive\ntransition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI. Our\nresults lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-disk\napproximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage\non modeling this transition. \n\n"}

Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that\ncause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine the\ntheory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely\nconvective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular,\nwe examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor\nQ, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered\nstar or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is\nreduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This\ngenerates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide\nwhich is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is\ndissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an\neddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a\nsecond velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature\nwith the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the\ndisturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,\nfrom which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the\nsystem evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and\nspecifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the\nthickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low\nfrequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a\nconstant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate. \n\n"}

The observed dearth of nearby ($\\leq 5$ AU) brown dwarf companions to\nsolar-mass stars, known as the brown dwarf desert, as well as the tendency for\nlow-mass binary systems to be more tightly-bound than stellar binaries, have\nbeen cited as evidence for distinct formation mechanisms for brown dwarfs and\nstars. In this paper, we explore the implications of the minimal hypothesis\nthat brown dwarfs in binary systems originate via the same fundamental\nfragmentation mechanism as stars, within isolated, turbulent giant molecular\ncloud cores. We demonstrate analytically that the scaling of specific angular\nmomentum with turbulent core mass naturally gives rise to the brown dwarf\ndesert, as well as wide brown-dwarf binary systems. Further, we show that the\nturbulent core fragmentation model also naturally predicts that very low-mass\n(VLM) binary and BD/BD systems are more tightly-bound than stellar systems. In\naddition, in order to capture the stochastic variation intrinsic to turbulence,\nwe generate $10^4$ model turbulent cores with synthetic turbulent velocity\nfields to show that the turbulent fragmentation model accommodates a small\nfraction of binary brown dwarfs with wide separations, similar to observations.\nIndeed, the picture which emerges from the turbulent fragmentation model is\nthat a single fragmentation mechanism may largely shape both stellar and brown\ndwarf binary distributions during formation. \n\n"}

We estimate the powers released\nby both processes in the case of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric, linear and\nnon-linear force-free coronal fields finding that they scale as v_r (B_s)^(4/3)\n(B_p)^(2/3) (R_p)^2, where v_r is the relative velocity between the stellar and\nplanetary fields, B_s the mean stellar surface field, B_p the planetary field\nat the poles, and R_p the radius of the planet. A chromospheric hot spot or a\nflaring activity phased to the orbital motion of the planet are found only when\nthe stellar field is axisymmetric. In the case of a non-axisymmetric field, the\ntime modulation of the energy release is multiperiodic and can be easily\nconfused with the intrinsic stellar variability.

Spectroscopic follow-up observations are used to derive its\nfundamental parameters. We compare its chromospheric activity level with a\nmodel of chrosmospheric activity evolution established by combining\nrelationships between the R'HK index and the Rossby number with a recent model\nof stellar rotation evolution on the main sequence. We measure the spot\ncoverage of the stellar surface as a function of time, and find evidence for a\ntentative increase from 5-14% at the beginning of the observing run to 13-29%\n35 days later. A high level of magnetic activity on CoRoT102899501 is\ncorroborated by a strong emission in the Balmer and Ca II HK lines (logR'HK ~\n-4).

{"id": "1210.4009", "contents": "Title: Planet formation models: the interplay with the planetesimal disc Abstract: According to the sequential accretion model, giant planet formation is based\nfirst on the formation of a solid core which, when massive enough, can\ngravitationally bind gas from the nebula to form the envelope. In order to\ntrigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses\nbefore the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. We compute the\nformation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the\nsolid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,\nexciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We\ncompute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by\nforming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of\ngiant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their\nrandom velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.\nMoreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also\nlarger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of\ndisc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their\nsurvival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,\nrapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass\nplanets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of\nthese planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have either\nmasses below 10 ME or above several Jupiter masses. To form giant planets\nbefore the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals (~ 0.1 km) have to be\nthe major contributors of the solid accretion process. However, the combination\nof oligarchic growth and fast inward migration leads to the absence of\nintermediate mass planets.

Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the\ndistribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a\ntail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent\nwith previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

From a correlation analysis with the cloud\nmap data from the Earth Observing Satellite (EOS), we find that their variation\npattern is primarily due to the uneven cloud cover distribution.

A difference in the diurnal variability patterns of H2O\nand O2 bands is ascribed to the differing vertical and horizontal distribution\nof those molecular species in the atmosphere.

If\nirradiation is present, fragmentation is suppressed for marginally unstable\ndiscs at low accretion rates (compared to the no-irradiation case), but these\nlower accretion rates correspond to higher mass discs.

These results\nfurther bolster the consensus that, without subsequent fragment disruption or\nmass loss, the gravitational instability is more likely to form brown dwarfs\nand low-mass stars than gas giant planets. \n\n"}

To test the \"viscous criterion\", we compared gap\nproperties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same\nstress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and\nwider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This\ndifference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap\nregion in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective \\alpha within the gap. Thus,\nacross the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density\nprofile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance\nthe planetary torque density.

Here we study a class\nof single planet systems where the stellar mass loss rate is time dependent.\nThe mass loss rate can be increasing or decreasing, but the stellar mass always\ndecreases monotonically. For this class of models, we develop analytic\napproximations to specify the final orbital elements for planets that remain\nbound after the epoch of mass loss, and find the conditions required for the\nplanets to become unbound. We also show that for some mass loss functions,\nplanets become unbound only in the asymptotic limit where the stellar mass\nvanishes.

The fragmentation of self-gravitating\nprotostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to\ntens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by\ngrain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central\nstar and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar\ndisc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass,\ngrain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption.

The observations clearly show\nthat brown dwarfs beyond ages of 10 Myr are exclusively fast rotators and do\nnot spin down with age. This suggests that rotational braking by magnetic winds\nbecomes very inefficient or ceases to work in the substellar regime. There is,\nhowever, some evidence for braking by disks during the first few Myrs in the\nevolution, similar to stars. Brown dwarf disks turn out to be scaled down\nversions of circumstellar disks, with dust settling, grain growth, and in some\ncases cleared out inner regions. The global disk properties roughly scale with\ncentral object mass. The evolutionary timescales in substellar disks are\nentirely consistent with what is found for stars, which may be challenging to\nunderstand.

To test the robustness of mass\ndeterminations, Lloyd (2011) compared mass distributions of planet hosting\nsubgiants with distributions from integrating isochrones and concluded it is\nunlikely the subgiant planet hosts are this massive, but rather the mass\ninferences are systematically in error.

We investigate the temporal\ndecay of the emission from GRB afterglows at late times, when the bulk of the\nshock-accelerated electrons are non-relativistic. For a uniform circumburst\nmedium, we show that such \"deep Newtonian phase\" begins at t_{DN} ~ 3\nepsilon_{e,-1}^{5/6} t_{ST}, where t_{ST} marks the transition of the blast\nwave to the non-relativistic spherically-symmetric Sedov-Taylor solution, and\nepsilon_e = 0.1 epsilon_{e,-1} quantifies the amount of shock energy\ntransferred to the post-shock electrons. For typical parameters, the deep\nNewtonian stage starts ~ 0.5-several years after the GRB. The radio flux in\nthis phase decays as F_nu ~ t^{-3(p+1)/10}, with decay slope between -0.9 and\n-1.2, for a power-law distribution of shock-accelerated electrons with index 2\n< p < 3. This is shallower than the commonly assumed scaling F_nu ~\nt^{-3(5p-7)/10} (with decay slope between -0.9 and -2.4) derived by Frail et\nal. (2000), which only applies if the GRB shock is non-relativistic, but the\nelectron distribution still peaks at ultra-relativistic energies (a regime that\nis relevant for a narrow time interval, and only if t_{DN} > t_{ST}, or\nepsilon_e > 0.03).

In principle, these planet pairs could\nhave both resonance angles associated with the resonance librating if the\norbital eccentricities are sufficiently small, because the width of first-order\nresonances diverges in the limit of vanishingly small eccentricity.

In such cases, we show that the two limb\ndarkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,\ndescribing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal\nefficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming:\ntriangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform,\nbivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these\nparametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic,\nsquare-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws. For example, in the case of\nthe popular quadratic law, we advocate fitting for q_1 = (u_1+u_2)^2 and q_2 =\n0.5u_1(u_1+u_2)^{-1} with uniform priors in the interval [0,1] to implement\ntriangular sampling easily. Employing these parametrizations allows one to\nderive model parameters which fully account for our ignorance about the\nintensity profile, yet never explore unphysical solutions, yielding robust and\nrealistic uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, in the case of triangular\nsampling with the quadratic law, our parametrization leads to significantly\nreduced mutual correlations and provides an alternative geometric explanation\nas to why naively fitting the quadratic limb darkening coefficients\nprecipitates strong correlations in the first place. \n\n"}

The H2 S(2) and S(1)\nfluxes are consistent with arising below the fully or partially ionized surface\ntraced by the [NeII] emission, in gas at about 600 K.

Depending on\nthe thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness of radiative cooling, and\nthe radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. Clearly,\nthis will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets as\npredicted by population synthesis simulations. Aims: Our goal is to study the\nglobal effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation and gap\nopening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic\nplanet population. Methods: We combine results from several analytical studies\nand 3D hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for\nthe application in our planet population synthesis calculations. Results: We\nfind a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in a 3D radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We find three convergence zones in a typical disc,\ntowards which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly the\nmigration behavior of low-mass planets.

This is an increasingly pressing problem for precision radial\nvelocity (RV) spectrographs in the near-infrared (NIR) and optical that require\nboth high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise.\nMany of these spectrographs plan to use highly coherent emission line\ncalibration sources like laser frequency combs and Fabry-Perot etalons to\nachieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. These high\nprecision calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherent\nsources. Coupling light from single mode fibers to multi-mode fibers leads to\nonly a very low number of modes being excited, thereby exacerbating the modal\nnoise measured by the spectrograph. We present a commercial off-the-shelf\n(COTS) solution that significantly mitigates modal noise at all optical and NIR\nwavelengths, and which can be applied to spectrograph calibration systems. Our\nsolution uses an integrating sphere in conjunction with a diffuser that is\nmoved rapidly using electrostrictive polymers, and is generally superior to\nmost tested forms of mechanical fiber agitation. We demonstrate a high level of\nmodal noise reduction with a narrow bandwidth 1550 nm laser.

Such conditions may exist at the inner edges of\ntransitional disks around T Tauri stars and accretion disks around AGNs. We\nderive the criterion for this instability, which we term the 'irradiation\ninstability', or IRI. We also present the linear growth rate as a function of\nbeta, the ratio between radiation force and gravity, and c_s, the sound speed\nof the disk, obtained using two methods: a semi-analytic analysis of the\nlinearized equations and a numerical simulation using the GPU-accelerated\nhydrodynamical code PEnGUIn.

Results\n  from scaling the ISM opacity Abstract: The opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates the\naccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of\nplanets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3. The\nobservational result lies between these values, pointing to core accretion as\nthe formation mechanism. \n\n"}

This is based on\nthe idea that the disk is separated into an inner and outer region and gas is\nconsidered unable to cross the gap. In fact, gas easily crosses the gap on\nhorseshoe orbits, nullifying this necessary premise which would set the\nmigration rate. In this work, it is demonstrated using highly accurate\nnumerical calculations that the actual migration rate is dependent on disk and\nplanet parameters, and can be significantly larger or smaller than the viscous\ndrift rate. In the limiting case of a disk much more massive than the\nsecondary, the migration rate saturates to a constant which is sensitive to\ndisk parameters and is not necessarily of order viscous rate. In the opposite\nlimit of a low-mass disk, the migration rate decreases linearly with disk mass.\nSteady-state solutions in the low disk mass limit show no pile-up outside the\nsecondary's orbit, and no corresponding drainage of the inner disk. \n\n"}
{"id": "1405.3991", "contents": "Title: Radial Stresses and Energy Transport in Accretion Disks Abstract: Early in the study of viscous accretion disks it was realized that energy\ntransfers from distant sources must be important, not least because the flow at\nthe disk midplane in the bulk of the disk is likely outwards, out of the\ngravitational potential well. If the source of the viscosity is powered by\naccretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, such\ndistant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, where\naccretion occurs even at the midplane. We argue here that modulations in this\nenergy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longer\nviscous, time scales. This means that both the steady state value of and\nfluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details of\nthe inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolution\ntime, can affect the outer disk. This is particularly interesting because\nobservations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~EX Lupi type\nobjects). We also note that the power supplied to shearing boxes is set by the\nboxes themselves rather than the physical energy fluxes in a global disk. That\nis, their saturated magnetic field is not subject to the full set of energy\nconstraints present in an actual disk.

In order to test the evolution of\nLi, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of\nstars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of\nterrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired\nhigh-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several\nsolar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among\nthe solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a\ndifferential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.\n[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =\n4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03\nkm/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision.

By simulating a small local patch of a rotating fluid,\n\\cite{Barker2014} have recently shown that tides can drive small-scale dynamos\nby exciting a hydrodynamic instability, the so-called elliptical (or tidal)\ninstability.

We are thus interested by the dynamo\nthreshold and the generated magnetic field in order to test if such a mechanism\nis relevant for planets and stars.

The orbital\ninclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace plane is ~8 deg, which is\nunexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from a\ncircumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process\nhas pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero\n(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to\n0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present\nvalue (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction\nfrom captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough). Our\nresults therefore imply that only 2 out of 10 instability cases (~20%) can\nexcite Iapetus's inclination to its present value (~30% of trials lead to >5\ndeg) while leaving its orbital eccentricity low. \n\n"}

Accretion from the nebula is problematic because it\nis too efficient: we find that 10-$M_\\oplus$ cores embedded in solar\nmetallicity disks tend to undergo runaway gas accretion and explode into\nJupiters, irrespective of orbital location. The threat of runaway is especially\ndire at $\\sim$0.1 AU, where solids may coagulate on timescales orders of\nmagnitude shorter than gas clearing times; thus nascent atmospheres on close-in\norbits are unlikely to be supported against collapse by planetesimal accretion.\nThe time to runaway accretion is well approximated by the cooling time of the\natmosphere's innermost convective zone, whose extent is controlled by where\nH$_2$ dissociates. Insofar as the temperatures characterizing H$_2$\ndissociation are universal, timescales for core instability tend not to vary\nwith orbital distance --- and to be alarmingly short for 10-$M_\\oplus$ cores.\nNevertheless, in the thicket of parameter space, we identify two scenarios, not\nmutually exclusive, that can reproduce the preponderance of percent-by-mass\natmospheres for super-Earths at $\\sim$0.1 AU, while still ensuring the\nformation of Jupiters at $\\gtrsim 1$ AU.

The inhibition of the convective blueshift inside active\nregions is considered, as well as the limb brightening effect of plages, a\nquadratic limb darkening law, and a realistic spot and plage contrast ratio.\nSOAP 2.0 shows that the activity-induced variation of plages is dominated by\nthe inhibition of the convective blueshift effect. For spots, this effect\nbecomes significant only for slow rotators. In addition, in the case of a major\nactive region dominating the activity-induced signal, the ratio between the\nfull width at half maximum (FWHM) and the RV peak-to-peak amplitudes of the\ncross correlation function can be used to infer the type of active region\nresponsible for the signal for stars with \\vsini$\\le8$\\kms. A ratio smaller\nthan three implies a spot, while a larger ratio implies a plage.

Elliptical Orbits Abstract: In the first paper of this series, a comprehensive approach has been provided\nfor the study of S-type and P-type habitable regions in stellar binary systems,\nwhich was, however, restricted to circular orbits of the stellar components.\nFortunately, a modest modification of the method also allows for the\nconsideration of elliptical orbits, which of course entails a much broader\nrange of applicability. This augmented method is presented here, and numerous\napplications are conveyed. In alignment with Paper I, the selected approach\nconsiders a variety of aspects, which comprise the consideration of a joint\nconstraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible\nsystem planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (\"radiative habitable\nzone\"; RHZ). The devised method is based on a combined formalism for the\nassessment of both S-type and P-type habitability; in particular, mathematical\ncriteria are deduced for which kinds of systems S-type and P-type habitable\nzones are realized. If the RHZs are truncated by the additional constraint of\norbital stability, the notation of ST-type and PT-type habitability applies. In\ncomparison to the circular case, it is found that in systems of higher\neccentricity, the range of the RHZs is significantly reduced.

The\nrelative importance of these scenarios in debris systems is unknown. Here we\npresent new Herschel Space Observatory imagery of 11 discs selected from the\nmost massive and extended known debris systems. All discs were found to be\nextended at far-infrared wavelengths, five of them being resolved for the first\ntime. We evaluated the feasibility of the self-stirring scenario by comparing\nthe measured disc sizes with the predictions of the model calculated for the\nages of our targets. We concluded that the self-stirring explanation works for\nseven discs. However, in four cases, the predicted pace of outward propagation\nof the stirring front, assuming reasonable initial disc masses, was far too low\nto explain the radial extent of the cold dust. Therefore, for HD 9672, HD\n16743, HD 21997, and HD 95086, another explanation is needed. We performed a\nsimilar analysis for {\\ss} Pic and HR 8799, reaching the same conclusion.

The origin of these close-in\nsuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet\nformation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts\n(GIs). Here we test the viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres\naccreted by isolation masses are small ($10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and\nthat atmospheric mass-loss during GIs is significant, with typical post-GI\natmospheres that are $8 \\times 10^{-4}$ the core mass. Such values are\nconsistent with terrestrial planet atmospheres but more than an order of\nmagnitude below atmospheric masses of $1-10\\%$ inferred for many close-in\nexoplanets. In the most optimistic scenario with no core luminosity, post-GI\nenvelope accretion from a depleted gas disc yields atmospheric masses that are\nseveral per cent the core mass. If the gravitational potential energy due to\nthe last mass doubling of the planet by GIs is released over the disc\ndissipation time-scale as core luminosity, then envelope masses are reduced by\nabout an order of magnitude. Finally we show that radial drift time-scales due\nto gas drag for many isolation masses are shorter than typical disc lifetimes.\nGiven these challenges, we conclude that most observed close-in planets with\nenvelopes larger than several per cent likely formed at larger separations from\ntheir host stars. \n\n"}

First, the problem is modeled with an idealized 3D general\ncirculation model (GCM) with gray gas radiative transfer. It is shown that over\na wide range of parameters the atmospheric boundary layer, rather than the\nlarge-scale circulation, is the key to understanding the planetary energy\nbalance.

The formation of the new WD\nplanetary system starts with a tidal break-up of the parent planet to\nplanetesimals near the tidal radius of about 1Rsun. Internal stress forces keep\nthe planetesimal from further tidal break-up when their radius is less than\nabout 100km.

The star HD 80606 hosts a giant planet with 4 MJup\ndetected by both transit and radial velocity techniques, being one of the most\neccentric planets detected to date. We study condensation temperature Tc trends\nof volatile and refractory element abundances to determine whether there is a\ndepletion of refractories that could be related to the terrestrial planet\nformation. Methods. We carried out a high-precision abundance determination in\nboth components of the binary system, using a line-by-line strictly\ndifferential approach, using the Sun as a reference and then using HD 80606 as\nreference. We used an updated version of the program FUNDPAR, together with\nATLAS9 model atmospheres and the MOOG code. Conclusions. From the study of Tc\ntrends, we concluded that the stars HD 80606 and HD 80607 do not seem to be\ndepleted in refractory elements, which is different for the case of the Sun.\nThen, the terrestrial planet formation would have been less efficient in the\ncomponents of this binary system than in the Sun. The lack of a trend for\nrefractory elements with Tc between both stars implies that the presence of a\ngiant planet do not neccesarily imprint a chemical signature in their host\nstars, similar to the recent result of Liu et al.

In this work we significantly expand the parameter\nspace investigated by previous simulations. In addition, the updated model\nincludes thermal sweeping, needed for studying the complete dispersal of the\ndisc.

This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves\nmediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,\nanalogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure\nin Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by\neither radiative cooling or potential frictional drag.

Here we present initial\nresults from a catalog of 382 of the most compelling stellar and substellar\ncompanion candidates detected by APOGEE, which orbit a variety of host stars in\ndiverse Galactic environments. Of these, 376 have no previously known small\nseparation companion. The distribution of companion candidates in this catalog\nshows evidence for an extremely truncated brown dwarf (BD) desert with a\npaucity of BD companions only for systems with $a < 0.1-0.2$ AU, with no\nindication of a desert at larger orbital separation.

For a significant fraction of the free-floating planet (FFP)\nevents and all caustic-crossing planetary/binary events, these 2-D parallax\nmeasurements directly lead to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) of the lens object (or lens system). For even more events, the\ncomplementary ground-based observations will yield 1-D parallax measurements.\nTogether with the 1-D parallaxes from \\emph{WFIRST} alone, they can probe the\nentire mass range $M\\gtrsim M_\\oplus$. For luminous lenses, such 1-D parallax\nmeasurements can be promoted to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) by high-resolution imaging.

Furthermore, deflection distance shows strong dependence on thrust\ndirection with the optimal direction of thrust varying with the duration of\nlaser activity.

For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud\nassuming QUMOND, a modified gravity theory of MD. In the modified gravity\nversions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external\ngravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external\nfield is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect\n(EFE).

The\ncomets of the Milgromian cloud stay away from the zone where the Galactic tide\ncan torque their orbits significantly. However, this does not need to be an\nobstacle for the injection of the comets into the inner solar system as the EFE\ncan induce significant change in perihelion distance during one revolution of a\ncomet around the Sun.

Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data\nset on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 AU of their star.\nHowever, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and\ndetection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational\nbiases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By\nassuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability, we infer the\nexpected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a\nmarginalized form. These general analytic results provide a baseline against\nwhich to compare trends predicted by mission-tailored injection/recovery\nsimulations and offer a simple way to correct for observational bias. Our\nresults explain why the observed population of transiting planets displays a\nnon-uniform impact parameter distribution, with a bias towards near-equatorial\ngeometries. We also find that the geometric bias towards observed planets\ntransiting near periastron is attenuated by the longer durations which occur\nnear apoastron. Finally, we predict that the observational bias with respect to\nratio-of-radii is super-quadratic, scaling as $(R_P/R_{\\star})^{5/2}$, driven\nby an enhanced geometric transit probability and modestly longer durations. \n\n"}

We used very high-quality spectra of the two stars\nretrieved from the HARPS archive to derive very precise stellar parameters and\nchemical abundances. We derived the stellar parameters with the classical\n(nondifferential) method, while we applied a differential line-by-line analysis\nto achieve the highest possible precision in abundances, which are fundamental\nto explore for very tiny differences in the abundances between the stars.

Chemical\nkinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the\nchemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be\ndriven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature\n(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the\nchemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite\nthe fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional\nradiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated\nchemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with\nnon-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical\ndisequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T\nprofile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical\nequilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences\nfor the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission\nspectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics\ncalculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium\nchemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated\nobservations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong\ninterpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models\nviolating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere. \n\n"}

Saturn's rings are\nmassive and made of 90-95% of water ice. In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured. Thus, our results can naturally explain the\ncompositional difference between the rings of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. \n\n"}

While A stars have putative giant impact debris at\n4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au\ncontrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could\nindicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles\nmaximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated\nplanets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet\nmasses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on\ncomets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass\nplanets.

With sparse or uninformative data, the\nsampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense.\nWith informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too\nsparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC. The\nmethod produces correct samplings in orbital parameters for data that include\nas few as three epochs. The Joker can therefore be used to produce proper\nsamplings of multimodal pdfs, which are still informative and can be used in\nhierarchical (population) modeling. We give some examples that show how the\nposterior pdf depends sensitively on the number and time coverage of the\nobservations and their uncertainties. \n\n"}

Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar.

High\nspatial resolution imaging revealed the star is single, and radial velocity\nmonitoring indicated that the dimming events can not be due to an eclipsing\nstellar or brown dwarf companion. Archival and follow-up photometry suggest the\ndimming events are transient in nature. The variable morphology of the dimming\nevents suggests they are not due to a single, spherical body.

The\npresence of a third star in an orbit around a binary system can significantly\nalter the evolution of those stars and the binary system. The rich dynamical\nbehavior in three-body systems can give rise to Lidov-Kozai cycles, in which\nthe eccentricity of the inner orbit and the inclination between the inner and\nouter orbit vary periodically. In turn, this can lead to an enhancement of\ntidal effects (tidal friction), gravitational-wave emission and stellar\ninteractions such as mass transfer and collisions. The lack of a\nself-consistent treatment of triple evolution, including both three-body\ndynamics as well as stellar evolution, hinders the systematic study and general\nunderstanding of the long-term evolution of triple systems. In this paper, we\naim to address some of these hiatus, by discussing the dominant physical\nprocesses of hierarchical triple evolution, and presenting heuristic recipes\nfor these processes.

One natural mechanism that can lead\nto the dissolution of commensurabilities is stochastic orbital forcing, induced\nby turbulent density fluctuations within the nebula. While this process is\nqualitatively promising, the conditions under which mean motion resonances can\nbe broken are not well understood. In this work, we derive a simple analytic\ncriterion that elucidates the relationship among the physical parameters of the\nsystem, and find the conditions necessary to drive planets out of resonance.\nSubsequently, we confirm our findings with numerical integrations carried out\nin the perturbative regime, as well as direct N-body simulations. Our\ncalculations suggest that turbulent resonance disruption depends most\nsensitively on the planet-star mass ratio. Specifically, for a disk with\nproperties comparable to the early solar nebula with $\\alpha=0.01$, only planet\npairs with cumulative mass ratios smaller than\n$(m_1+m_2)/M\\lesssim10^{-5}\\sim3M_{\\oplus}/M_{\\odot}$ are susceptible to\nbreaking resonance at semi-major axis of order $a\\sim0.1\\,$AU.

Streaming instability is a promising mechanism to directly\nform planetesimals from pebble-sized particles, provided a high enough\nsolids-to-gas ratio. However, local enhancements of the solids-to-gas ratio are\ndifficult to realize in a smooth disk, which motivates the consideration of\nspecial disk locations such as the snowline. In this article we investigate the\nviability of planetesimal formation by streaming instability near the snowline\ndue to water diffusion and condensation. We adopt a viscous disk model, and\nnumerically solve the transport equations for vapor and solids on a\ncylindrical, 1D grid. We take into account radial drift of solids, gas\naccretion on to the central star, and turbulent diffusion. We study the\nimportance of the back-reaction of solids on the gas and of the radial\nvariation of the mean molecular weight of the gas. We find that water diffusion\nand condensation can locally enhance the ice surface density by a factor 3--5\noutside the snowline. Assuming that icy pebbles contain many micron-sized\nsilicate grains that are released during evaporation, the enhancement is\nincreased by another factor $\\sim$$2$. In this `many-seeds' model, the\nsolids-to-gas ratio interior to the snowline is enhanced as well, but not as\nmuch as just outside the snowline. In the context of a viscous disk, the\ndiffusion-condensation mechanism is most effective for high values of the\nturbulence parameter $\\alpha$ ($10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$). Therefore, assuming young\ndisks are more vigorously turbulent than older disks, planetesimals near the\nsnowline can form in an early stage of the disk. In highly turbulent disks,\ntens of Earth masses can be stored in an annulus outside the snowline, which\ncan be identified with recent ALMA observations. \n\n"}

Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass.

We then provide an algorithm to determine the fate of\ninfallers for any WD, and apply the algorithm to four limiting combinations of\nhot versus cool (young/old) WDs with snowy (weak, volatile) versus rocky\n(strong, refractory) infallers. We find: (i) Total sublimation above the\nphotosphere befalls all small infallers across the entire WD temperature (T_WD)\nrange, the threshold size rising with T_WD and 100X larger for rock than snow.\n(ii) All very large objects fragment tidally regardless of T_WD: for rock, a_0\n>= 10^5 cm; for snow, a_0 >= 10^3 -- 3x10^4 cm across all WD cooling ages.\n(iii) A considerable range of a_0 avoids fragmentation and total sublimation,\nyielding impacts or grazes with cold WDs. This range narrows rapidly with\nincreasing T_WD, especially for snowy bodies.

From this\nanalysis, we find that the lens of OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 is a very low-mass star\nwith the mass $0.10 \\pm 0.02 \\ M_\\odot$ or a brown dwarf with the mass $55\\pm 9\n\\ M_{J}$, which are respectively located at $D_{\\rm LS} = 0.80 \\pm 0.19\\\n\\textrm{kpc}$ and $ D_{\\rm LS} = 0.54 \\pm 0.08\\ \\textrm{kpc}$, and thus it is\nthe first isolated low-mass microlens that has been decisively located in the\nGalactic bulge. The fundamental reason for the degeneracy is that the\nfinite-source effect is seen only in a single data point from \\textit{Spitzer}\nand this single data point gives rise to two solutions for $\\rho$. Because the\n$\\rho$ degeneracy can be resolved only by relatively high cadence observations\naround the peak, while the \\textit{Spitzer} cadence is typically $\\sim 1\\,{\\rm\nday}^{-1}$, we expect that events for which the finite-source effect is seen\nonly in the \\textit{Spitzer} data may frequently exhibit this $\\rho$\ndegeneracy. For OGLE-2015-BLG-1482, the relative proper motion of the lens and\nsource for the low-mass star is $\\mu_{\\rm rel} = 9.0 \\pm 1.9\\ \\textrm{mas\nyr$^{-1}$}$, while for the brown dwarf it is $5.5 \\pm 0.5\\ \\textrm{mas\nyr$^{-1}$}$.

(2014) showed in 3D SPH simulations that\ntilted discs in binary systems can be unstable to the development of global,\ndamped Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations in which the discs exchange tilt for\neccentricity. We investigate the linear stability of KL modes for tilted\ninviscid discs under the approximations that the disc eccentricity is small and\nthe disc remains flat. By using 1D equations, we are able to probe regimes of\nlarge ratios of outer to inner disc edge radii that are realistic for binary\nsystems of hundreds of AU separations and are not easily probed by\nmulti-dimensional simulations. For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge. We\npresent a framework for understanding the zones of instability based on the\ndetermination of branches of marginally unstable modes. In general, multiple\ngrowing eccentric KL modes can be present in a disc. Coplanar apsidal-nodal\nprecession resonances delineate instability branches. We determine the range of\ntilt angles for unstable modes as a function of disc aspect ratio. Unlike the\nKL instability for free particles that involves a critical (minimum) tilt\nangle, disc instability is possible for any nonzero tilt angle depending on the\ndisc aspect ratio. \n\n"}

I present a comprehensive study, which considers habitability\nnot only on planets, but on satellites, as well. My research focuses on three\nclosely related topics. The first one is the circumstellar habitable zone,\nwhich is usually used as a first proxy for determining the habitability of a\nplanet around the host star. The word habitability is used in the sense that\nliquid water, which is essential for life as we know it, may be present on the\nplanetary surface. Whether the planet is habitable or not, its moon might have\na suitable surface temperature for holding water reservoirs, providing that\ntidal heating is in action. Tidal heating is generated inside the satellite and\nits source is the strong gravitational force of the nearby planet. The second\ntopic of my research explores tidal heating and the habitability of extra-solar\nmoons with and without stellar radiation and other related energy sources. Life\nis possible to form even on icy planetary bodies, inside tidally heated\nsubsurface oceans.

However, in most disk studies, only average\noptical properties and thus an average temperature is assumed to account for an\nensemble of grains with different radii. We investigate the impact of\nsubdividing the grain radius distribution into multiple sub-intervals on the\nresulting dust temperature distribution and spectral energy distribution (SED).\nThese quantities were computed for two different scenarios: (1) Radius\ndistribution represented by 16 logarithmically distributed radius intervals,\nand (2) radius distribution represented by a single grain species with averaged\noptical properties (reference). Within the considered parameter range, i.e., of\ngrain radii between 5 nm and 1 mm and an optically thin and thick disk with a\nparameterized density distribution, we obtain the following results: In\noptically thin disk regions, the temperature spread can be as large as ~63% and\nthe relative grain surface below a certain temperature is lower than in the\nreference disk.

In this work, the feedback\nof realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular\nemissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. The\nradial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models\nthat include growth, fragmentation and radial drift. A new version of the code\nDALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence\nthe disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference\nof dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth\nof CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.\nThe effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the\ncontinuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission\ncan easily differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent\n$\\alpha$ ranging between typical values.

All cases apart from possibly WASP-43\nare consistent with a regime in which gravity waves are damped during their\npropagation over the star. However, at present this is not definitive as\nobservational errors are large. We find that although it is expected to apply\nto Kepler-91, linear radiative damping cannot explain this dis- sipation regime\napplying to MS stars. Thus, a nonlinear mechanism may be needed.\n  Kepler-91 is found to be such that the time scale for evolution of the star\nis comparable to that for the orbit.

Jupiter's\nlarge internal dynamo magnetic field generates a gigantic magnetosphere, which\nis strongly rotational driven and possesses large plasma sources located deeply\nwithin the magnetosphere. The combination of the latter two effects is the\nprimary reason for Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the\nonly known moon with an intrinsic dynamo magnetic field, which generates a\nmini-magnetosphere located within Jupiter's larger magnetosphere including two\nauroral ovals. Ganymede's magnetosphere is qualitatively different compared to\nthe one from Jupiter. It possesses no bow shock but develops Alfv\\'en wings\nsimilar to most of the extrasolar planets which orbit their host stars within\n0.1 AU. New numerical models of Jupiter's and Ganymede's magnetospheres\npresented here provide quantitative insight into the processes that maintain\nthese magnetospheres. Jupiter's magnetospheric field is approximately\ntime-periodic at the locations of Jupiter's moons and induces secondary\nmagnetic fields in electrically conductive layers such as subsurface oceans. In\nthe case of Ganymede, these secondary magnetic fields influence the oscillation\nof the location of its auroral ovals. Based on dedicated Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations, an analysis of the amplitudes of the auroral oscillations\nprovides evidence that Ganymede harbors a subsurface ocean. Callisto in\ncontrast does not possess a mini-magnetosphere, but still shows a perturbed\nmagnetic field environment. Callisto's ionosphere and atmospheric UV emission\nis different compared to the other Galilean satellites as it is primarily been\ngenerated by solar photons compared to magnetospheric electrons. \n\n"}

Our aim is to understand the cause of\nthe non-convergence of the cooling boundary for fragmentation reported in the\nliterature. We run SPH simulations with two different artificial viscosity\nimplementations, and compare them with MFM, which does not employ any\nartificial viscosity. With MFM we demonstrate convergence of the critical\ncooling time scale for fragmentation at \\beta_{crit} =3.. Non-convergence\npersists in SPH codes, although it is significantly mitigated with schemes\nhaving reduced artificial viscosity such as inviscid SPH (ISPH) (Cullen &\nDehnen 2010). We show how the non-convergence problem is caused by artificial\nfragmentation triggered by excessive dissipation of angular momentum in domains\nwith large velocity derivatives. With increased resolution such domains become\nmore prominent. Vorticity lags behind density due to numerical viscous\ndissipation in these regions, promoting collapse with longer cooling times.\nSuch effect is shown to be dominant over the competing tendency of artificial\nviscosity to diminish with increasing resolution. When the initial conditions\nare first relaxed for several orbits, the flow is more regular, with lower\nshear and vorticity in non-axisymmetric regions, aiding convergence. Yet MFM is\nthe only method that converges exactly. Our findings are of general interest as\nnumerical dissipation via artificial viscosity or advection errors can also\noccur in grid-based codes. Indeed for the FARGO code values of \\beta_{crit}\nsignificantly higher than our converged estimate have been reported in the\nliterature.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination.

Here, we identify and study both resonant and new\nnon-resonant instabilities, in the simple case where the gas satisfies neutral\nhydrodynamics and supports acoustic waves ($\\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2}\\,k^{2}$). The\ngas and dust are coupled via an arbitrary drag law and subject to external\naccelerations (e.g. gravity, radiation pressure). If there is any dust drift\nvelocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities exist for {\\em all}\ndust-to-gas ratios $\\mu$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on $\\mu$\naround resonance, as $\\sim\\mu^{1/3}$ or $\\sim \\mu^{1/2}$ (depending on\nwavenumber). The behavior changes depending on whether the drift velocity is\nlarger or smaller than the sound speed $c_{s}$.

The complex relationship between these\nactivity indicators is analysed: while no strong connection is found between\nthe large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the\nnon-thermal flux originating in the chromosphere.\n  We then examine the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the\noptical radial-velocity jitter available in the literature, especially for\nplanet host stars. We use this to derive for all stars an activity merit\nfunction (higher for quieter stars) with the goal of identifying the most\nfavorable stars where the radial-velocity jitter is low enough for planet\nsearches. We find that the main contributors to the RV jitter are the\nlarge-scale magnetic field and the chromospheric non-thermal emission.\n  In addition, three stars (GJ 1289, GJ 793, and GJ 251) have been followed\nalong their rotation using the spectropolarimetric mode, and we derive their\nmagnetic topology. These very slow rotators are good representatives of future\nSPIRou targets. They are compared to other stars where the magnetic topology is\nalso known. The poloidal component of the magnetic field is predominent in all\nthree stars. \n\n"}

Gas accreting from the disc on to the\nstar provides a way to measure the elemental abundances because even refractory\nspecies are in an atomic gaseous form. Here we compare the abundance ratios\nderived from UV lines probing T Tauri accretion streams to simple models of\ndisc evolution. Although the interpretation of line ratios in terms of\nabundances is highly uncertain, discs with large cavities in mm images tend to\nhave lower Si emission. Since this can naturally be explained by the suppressed\naccretion of dust, this suggests that abundance variations are at least\npartially responsible for the variations seen in the line ratios. Our models of\ndisc evolution due to grain growth, radial drift and the flux of volatile\nspecies carried as ices on grain surfaces, give rise to a partial sorting of\nthe atomic species based on the volatility of their dominant molecular\ncarriers. This arises because volatiles are left behind at their snow lines\nwhile the grains continue to drift. We show that this reproduces the main\nfeatures seen in the accretion line ratio data, such as C/N ratios that are a\nfew times solar and the correlation between the Si to volatile ratio with\nmm-flux. We highlight the fact that developing a more robust linkage between\nline ratios and abundance ratios and acquiring data for larger samples has the\npotential to cast considerable light on the chemical history of protoplanetary\ndiscs. \n\n"}

Abstract: The nearest stellar system consists of the stars Proxima, alpha Centauri A\nand B and at least one planet Proxima b. The habitability of Proxima b and any\nother planets are likely to be significantly influenced by the orbital\nevolution of the system. To study the dynamical evolution of the system, we\nsimulate the motions of Proxima and alpha Centauri A and B due to the\nperturbations from the Galactic tide and stellar encounters in a Monte Carlo\nfashion. From 100 clones, we find that 74% orbits of Proxima Centauri are bound\nto alpha Centauri A and B while 17% and 9% orbits become unbound in the\nsimulations over the past and future 5 Gyr. If the system migrated outward in\nthe Milky Way to its current location, more than 50% of clones could become\nunstable in backward simulations. The ratio of unstable clones increases with\nthe simulation time scale and encounter rate. This provides some evidence for a\ncapture scenario for the formation of the current triple system.

One possible formation scenario for HJs is\nhigh-eccentricity (high-e) migration, in which the planet forms at much larger\nradii, is excited to high eccentricity by some mechanism, and migrates to its\ncurrent orbit due to tidal dissipation occurring near periapsis. We consider\nhigh-e migration in dense stellar systems such as the cores of globular\nclusters (GCs), in which encounters with passing stars can excite planets to\nthe high eccentricities needed to initiate migration. We study this process via\nMonte Carlo simulations of encounters with a star+planet system including the\neffects of tidal dissipation, using an efficient regularized restricted\nthree-body code. HJs are produced in our simulations over a significant range\nof the stellar number density n_*. Assuming the planet is initially on a\nlow-eccentricity orbit with semimajor axis 1 au, for n_* < 1e3 pc^{-3} the\nencounter rate is too low to induce orbital migration, whereas for n_* > 1e6\npc^{-3} HJ formation is suppressed because the planet is more likely ejected\nfrom its host star, tidally disrupted, or transferred to a perturbing star.

Their\nconstituent nucleobases were primarily meteoritic in origin and not from\ninterplanetary dust particles. Ponds appeared as continents rose out of the\nearly global ocean but this increasing availability of \"targets\" for meteorites\nwas offset by declining meteorite bombardment rates. Moreover, the rapid losses\nof nucleobases to pond seepage during wet periods, and to UV photodissociation\nduring dry periods means that the synthesis of nucleotides and their\npolymerization into RNA occurred in just one to a few wet-dry cycles.

In this study we consider the ability of CO to trace the\ngas mass over a wide range of disk structural parameters and search for\nchemical species that could possibly be used as alternative mass tracers to CO.\nSpecifically, we apply detailed astrochemical modeling to a large set of models\nof protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, to select molecules with\nabundances correlated with the disk mass and being relatively insensitive to\nother disk properties. We do not consider sophisticated dust evolution models,\nrestricting ourselves with the standard astrochemical assumption of $0.1~\\mu $m\ndust. We find that CO is indeed the best molecular tracer for total gas mass,\ndespite the fact that it is not the main carbon carrier, provided reasonable\nassumptions about CO abundance in the disk are used.

Diagnostics for extended\n  hazy atmospheres Abstract: At optical wavelengths, Titan's brightness for large Sun-Titan-observer phase\nangles significantly exceeds its dayside brightness. The brightening that\noccurs near back-illumination is due to moderately large haze particles in the\nmoon's extended atmosphere that forward-scatter the incident sunlight.\nMotivated by this phenomenon, here we investigate the forward scattering from\ncurrently known exoplanets, its diagnostics possibilities, the observational\nrequirements to resolve it, and potential implications. An analytical\nexpression is derived for the amount of starlight forward-scattered by an\nexponential atmosphere that takes into account the finite angular size of the\nstar. We use this expression to tentatively estimate how prevalent this\nphenomenon may be. Based on numerical calculations that consider exoplanet\nvisibility, we identify numerous planets with predicted out-of-transit forward\nscattering signals of up to tens of parts-per-million provided that aerosols of\n$>$1 micron size form over an extended vertical region near the optical radius\nlevel. We propose that the interpretation of available optical phase curves\nshould be revised to constrain the strength of this phenomenon that might\nprovide insight into aerosol scale heights and particle sizes. For the\nrelatively general atmospheres considered here, forward scattering reduces the\ntransmission-only transit depth by typically less than the equivalent to a\nscale height.

Our survey, together with other ALMA\nstudies, have yielded null results for disks around young planet-mass\ncompanions and placed stringent dust mass upper limits, typically less than 0.1\nM_earth, when assuming dust continuum is optically thin. Such low-mass gas/dust\ncontent can lead to a disk lifetime estimate (from accretion rates) much\nshorter than the age of the system. To alleviate this timescale discrepancy, we\nsuggest that disks around wide companions might be very compact and optically\nthick, in order to sustain a few Myr of accretion yet have very weak\n(sub)millimeter flux so as to still be elusive to ALMA. Our order-of-magnitude\nestimate shows that compact optically-thick disks might be smaller than 1000\nR_jup and only emit ~micro-Jy of flux in the (sub)millimeter, but their average\ntemperature can be higher than that of circumstellar disks.

We analyze new VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric\nimages of HD 100546 with filters in H$\\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum. We\nhave probed the disk gap and the surface layers of the outer disk, covering a\nregion < 500 mas (< 55 au at 109 pc) from the star, at an angular resolution of\n~ 20 mas. Our data show an asymmetry: the SE and NW regions of the outer disk\nare more polarized than the SW and NE. This can be explained from a\npreferential scattering angle close to 90$^o$, consistent with previous\npolarization images. The outer disk extends from 13 $\\pm$ 2 to 45 $\\pm$ 9 au,\nwith a position angle and inclination of 137 $\\pm$ 5$^o$ and 44 $\\pm$ 8$^o$.\nThe comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could\nincrease with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements\nare still consistent within the error bars. In addition, no direct signature of\nthe innermost candidate companion is detected from polarimetry, confirming\nrecent results based on intensity imagery.

Since observed\nsuper-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas\nefficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to\nbe rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we\npropose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat\ntransport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is\ninvestigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate\npseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the\nradiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling\nluminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for\nthe turbulent diffusivity, $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$. If $\\nu_{\\rm turb}>\\nu_{\\rm\ncritical} $, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet\nwould become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant.

This state may be subject\nto a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical shear instability' (VSI), whose\nbreakdown into turbulence transports a moderate amount of angular momentum\nwhile also facilitating planet formation, possibly via the production of\nsmall-scale vortices. In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit\narbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the\nincompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are\nthemselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk\nrotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain\nlarge amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed). This `delay' in\nsaturation probably explains the prominence of the VSI linear modes in global\nsimulations. More generally, the parasites may set the amplitude of VSI\nturbulence in strongly irradiated disks. They are also important in breaking\nthe axisymmetry of the flow, via the unavoidable formation of vortices. The\nvortices, however, are not aligned with the orbital plane and thus express a\npronounced $z$-dependence.

By studying the arrival times of the p-mode maxima and\nminima through the O-C method, in a previous article the presence of a planet\nwas inferred with an orbital period of 3.2 yr and a minimum mass of 3.2 M_Jup.\nHere we present an updated O-C analysis using a larger data set of 1066 hours\nof photometric time series (~2.5x larger in terms of the number of data\npoints), which covers the period between 1999 and 2012 (compared with 1999-2006\nof the previous analysis).

Since\n2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation\nperiod (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of\nregime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between\ndifferent pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the\nO-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1\nand f2 differ or at least agree less well than before.

We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks.

We find no evidence for\nalkali absorption features, nor evidence of a scattering slope longward of 0.53\nmicrons. The spectrum is indicative of moderate to high metallicity (~100-1000x\nsolar) while moderate metallicity scenarios (~100x solar) require aerosol\nopacity. The optical spectrum also rules out some highly scattering haze\nmodels. We find an increase in transit depth around 0.8 microns in the\ntransmission spectra of 3 different sub-Jovian exoplanets (GJ 436b, HAT-P-26b,\nand GJ 1214b). While most of the data come from STIS, data from three other\ninstruments may indicate this is not an instrumental effect.

For this purpose we designed, implemented and tested a novel numerical\ntechnique, the \"Gravitational Ray Tracing\" (GRT) designed to compute the\nrelative impact probability (RIP) on the surface of any planet.

We find the mean grain\nsize of silicate minerals to be a key control on magma ascent. For grain sizes\nlarger than $\\approx$ 1 mm, melt segregation produces distinct radial structure\nand chemical stratification. This stratification is most pronounced for bodies\nformed at around 1 Myr after formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions. These findings\nsuggest a link between the time and orbital location of planetesimal formation\nand their subsequent structural and chemical evolution. According to our\nmodels, the evolution of partially molten planetesimal interiors falls into two\ncategories. In the magma ocean scenario, the whole interior of a planetesimal\nexperiences nearly complete melting, which would result in turbulent convection\nand core-mantle differentiation by the rainfall mechanism. In the magma sill\nscenario, segregating melts gradually deplete the deep interior of the\nradiogenic heat source. In this case, magma may form melt-rich layers beneath a\ncool and stable lid, while core formation would proceed by percolation.

Here we report the abundances of 30 elements with precisions\nof 2% for 79 Sun-like stars within 100 parsecs. Systematic errors are minimized\nin this study by focusing on solar twin stars and performing a line-by-line\ndifferential analysis using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra. We\nresolve [X/Fe] abundance trends in galactic chemical evolution at precisions of\n$10^{-3}$ dex Gyr$^{-1}$ and reveal that stars with similar ages and\nmetallicities have nearly identical abundance patterns. Contrary to previous\nresults, we find that the ratios of carbon-to-oxygen and magnesium-to-silicon\nin solar metallicity stars are homogeneous to within 10% throughout the solar\nneighborhood, implying that exoplanets may exhibit much less compositional\ndiversity than previously thought. Finally, we demonstrate that the Sun has a\nsubtle deficiency in refractory material relative to >80% of solar twins (at\n2$\\sigma$ confidence), suggesting a possible signpost for planetary systems\nlike our own. \n\n"}

We used HARPS-N\nhigh-precision radial velocity measurements, gathered during transit events, to\nmeasure the RM effect in the target systems and determine the sky-projected\nangle between the planetary orbital plane and the stellar equator. The\ncharacterisation of stellar atmospheric parameters was performed exploiting the\nHARPS-N spectra, using line equivalent width ratios, and spectral synthesis\nmethods. Photometric parameters of the five transiting exoplanets were\nre-analysed through 17 new light curves, obtained with an array of medium-class\ntelescopes, and other light curves from the literature. Survey-time-series\nphotometric data were analysed for determining the rotation periods of the five\nstars and their spin inclination. From the analysis of the RM effect we derived\na sky-projected obliquity of 21.2 degree, -54 degree, -2.1 degree, 0 degree and\n-129 degree for HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-22b, WASP-39b and WASP-60b,\nrespectively. The latter value indicates that WASP-60b is moving on a\nretrograde orbit. These values represent the first measurements of \\lambda for\nthe five exoplanetary systems under study. The stellar activity of HAT-P-22\nindicates a rotation period of 28.7 days, which allowed us to estimate the true\nmisalignment angle of HAT-P-22b, \\psi=24 degree.

Abstract: In the present paper, we model the wind of solar analogues at different ages\nto investigate the evolution of the solar wind. Recently, it has been suggested\nthat winds of solar type stars might undergo a change in properties at old\nages, whereby stars older than the Sun would be less efficient in carrying away\nangular momentum than what was traditionally believed. Adding to this, recent\nobservations suggest that old solar-type stars show a break in coronal\nproperties, with a steeper decay in X-ray luminosities and temperatures at\nolder ages. We use these X-ray observations to constrain the thermal\nacceleration of winds of solar analogues. Our sample is based on the stars from\nthe `Sun in time' project with ages between 120-7000 Myr. The break in X-ray\nproperties leads to a break in wind mass-loss rates ($\\dot{M}$) at roughly 2\nGyr, with $\\dot{M}$ (t < 2 Gyr) $\\propto t^{-0.74}$ and $\\dot{M}$ (t > 2 Gyr)\n$\\propto$ $t^{-3.9}$. This steep decay in $\\dot{M}$ at older ages could be the\nreason why older stars are less efficient at carrying away angular momentum,\nwhich would explain the anomalously rapid rotation observed in older stars. We\nalso show that none of the stars in our sample would have winds dense enough to\nproduce thermal emission above 1-2 GHz, explaining why their radio emissions\nhave not yet been detected. Combining our models with dynamo evolution models\nfor the magnetic field of the Earth we find that, at early ages ($\\approx$100\nMyr) our Earth had a magnetosphere that was 3 or more times smaller than its\ncurrent size. \n\n"}

Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such\nstars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying\nlocal environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar\ndensity ($n_{c} > 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant\nrole in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\\sim 3$ Myr. By\ncombining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in\na PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely\ndestroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local\nclusters we find that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD\npopulation then photoevaporation is always the dominating influence. \n\n"}

This is necessary to\ncompare the outputs of such models with observed radial velocity jitters and is\ncritical to better understand the impact of stellar activity on exoplanet\ndetectability. We propose a coherent picture to describe the relationship\nbetween magnetic activity, including the quiet Sun regions, and the\nchromospheric emission using the Sun as a test-bench and a reference. We\nanalyzed a time series of MDI magnetograms jointly with chromospheric emission\ntime series obtained at Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak observatories. This has\nallowed us to study the variability in the quiet Sun over the solar cycle, and\nthen, based on available relations between magnetic fields in active structures\nand chromospheric emission, to propose an empirical reconstruction of the solar\nchromospheric emission based on all contributions. We show that the magnetic\nflux covering the solar surface, including in the quieted regions, varies in\nphase with the solar cycle, suggesting a long-term relationship between the\nglobal dynamo and the contribution of all components of solar activity. We have\nbeen able to propose a reconstruction of the solar S-index, including a\nrelationship between the weak field component and its chomospheric emission,\nwhich is in good agreement with the literature.

For planets, it is in contrast still a\nyoung method which only became important in recent years because of the rapid\nincrease of the number of known extrasolar planets, and the associated growth\nof statistical observational constraints. With planetary population synthesis,\nthe theory of planet formation and evolution can be put to the test against\nthese constraints. In this review of planetary population synthesis, we first\nbriefly list key observational constraints. Then, the work flow in the method\nand its two main components are presented, namely global end-to-end models that\npredict planetary system properties directly from protoplanetary disk\nproperties and probability distributions for these initial conditions. An\noverview of various population synthesis models in the literature is given. The\nsub-models for the physical processes considered in global models are\ndescribed: the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, the planets' accretion of\nsolids and gas, orbital migration, and N-body interactions among concurrently\ngrowing protoplanets. Next, typical population synthesis results are\nillustrated in the form of new syntheses obtained with the latest generation of\nthe Bern model. Planetary formation tracks, the distribution of planets in the\nmass-distance and radius-distance plane, the planetary mass function, and the\ndistributions of planetary radii, semimajor axes, and luminosities are shown,\nlinked to underlying physical processes, and compared with their observational\ncounterparts.

While current simulations of terrestrial\naccretion can reproduce many observed qualities of the solar system,\nreplicating the small mass of Mars requires modification to standard planet\nformation models.

The\n  case of a single planet Abstract: A large planet orbiting a star in a protoplanetary disk opens a density gap\nalong its orbit due to the strong disk-planet interaction and migrates with the\ngap in the disk. It is expected that in the ideal case, a gap-opening planet\nmigrates at the viscous drift speed, which is referred to as type II migration.\nHowever, recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that in general, the\ngap-opening planet is not locked to the viscous disk evolution. A new physical\nmodel is required to explain the migration speed of such a planet. For this\nreason, we re-examined the migration of a planet in the disk, by carrying out\nthe two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a wide parameter range. We have\nfound that the torque exerted on the gap-opening planet depends on the surface\ndensity at the bottom of the gap. The planet migration slows down as the\nsurface density of the bottom of the gap decreases. Using the gap model\ndeveloped in our previous studies, we have constructed an empirical formula of\nthe migration speed of the gap-opening planets, which is consistent with the\nresults given by the hydrodynamic simulations performed by us and other\nresearchers. Our model easily explains why the migration speed of the\ngap-opening planets can be faster than the viscous gas drift speed.

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

Methods: Owing to the long,\nunknown period, standard follow-up methods needed to be adapted. The transit\nwas fitted using Namaste, and the radial velocity slope was measured and\ncompared to a grid of planet-like orbits with varying masses and periods.

As a result, both Jovian and Neptunian Trojans share a common\norigin with the primordial disk population, whose other surviving members\nconstitute today's trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations. The cold classical\nTNOs are ultra-red, while the dynamically excited \"hot\" population of TNOs\ncontains a mixture of ultra-red and blue objects. In contrast, Jovian and\nNeptunian Trojans are observed to be blue. While the absence of ultra-red\nJovian Trojans can be readily explained by the sublimation of volatile material\nfrom their surfaces due to the high flux of solar radiation at 5AU, the lack of\nultra-red Neptunian Trojans presents both a puzzle and a challenge to formation\nmodels. In this work we report the discovery by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of\ntwo new dynamically stable L4 Neptunian Trojans,2013 VX30 and 2014 UU240, both\nwith inclinations i >30 degrees, making them the highest-inclination known\nstable Neptunian Trojans. We have measured the colors of these and three other\ndynamically stable Neptunian Trojans previously observed by DES, and find that\n2013 VX30 is ultra-red, the first such Neptunian Trojan in its class. As such,\n2013 VX30 may be a \"missing link\" between the Trojan and TNO populations. Using\na simulation of the DES TNO detection efficiency, we find that there are 162\n+/- 73 Trojans with Hr < 10 at the L4 Lagrange point of Neptune. Moreover, the\nblue-to-red Neptunian Trojan population ratio should be higher than 17:1. Based\non this result, we discuss the possible origin of the ultra-red Neptunian\nTrojan population and its implications for the formation history of Neptunian\nTrojans. \n\n"}

Additionally, we searched in the literature for local clouds in the\nline of sight of the stars, and looked for the presence of similar absorption\nfeatures in nearby stars. Our study concludes that while all the objects\npresent interstellar absorptions in their spectra, three objects show features\nmore compatible with circumstellar origin: HD 110058 presents a stable\ncircumstellar absorption, while HR 4796 and c Aql present variable absorption\nfeatures likely due to exocometary activity.

The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII.

FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au.

An atmosphere reaches chemical equilibrium if\nthe rates of the forward and backward chemical reactions converge to the same\nvalue.

When the first planet\nreaches the inner edge of the disk its migration stops and the second planet is\nlocked in resonance. We detail the resonant trapping comparing semi-analytical\nformulae and numerical simulations in the case of two equal-mass coplanar\nplanets trapped in first order resonances. We describe the family of resonant\nstable equilibrium points (zero-amplitude libration orbits) using expanded and\nnon-expanded Hamiltonians. We show that during convergent migration the planets\nevolve along these families of equilibria. Eccentricity damping from the disk\nleads to a final equilibrium configuration that we predict analytically. The\nfact that observed multi-exoplanetary systems are rarely seen in resonances\nsuggests that the resonant configurations achieved by migration can become\nunstable after the removal of the disk. We probe the stability of the\nresonances as a function of planetary mass. To do this, we fictitiously\nincrease the masses of the planets, adiabatically maintaining the low-amplitude\nlibration regime until instability.

This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic.

We\nre-calculated the stellar and disk properties from the newly available GAIA DR2\nand related these properties with the disk categories. More than a half of our\nsample shows disk sub-structures.

Faint disks are typically found around young stars and typically\nhost no cavity. There is a possible dichotomy in the near-IR excess of sources\nwith spiral-disks (high) and ring-disks (low). Like spirals, shadows are\nassociated with a high near-IR excess. If we account for the pre-main sequence\nevolutionary timescale of stars with different mass, spiral arms are likely\nassociated to old disks.

Recent work by Shallue &\nVanderburg (2018) successfully used state-of-the-art deep learning models to\nautomatically classify Kepler transit signals as either exoplanets or false\npositives; our application of their model yielded 95.8% accuracy and 95.5%\naverage precision. Here we expand upon that work by including additional\nscientific domain knowledge into the network architecture and input\nrepresentations to significantly increase overall model performance to 97.5%\naccuracy and 98.0% average precision. Notably, we achieve 15-20% gains in\nrecall for the lowest signal-to-noise transits that can correspond to rocky\nplanets in the habitable zone. We input into the network centroid time-series\ninformation derived from Kepler data plus key stellar parameters taken from the\nKepler DR25 catalogue.

We seek to characterize the CN emission from 94 Class II disks in the\nLupus star forming region, compare it to observations in other regions, and\ninterpret our observations with a grid of models. The CN emission morphology is\ndiscussed for two primordial disks, Sz 71 and Sz 98, and modeled in more\ndetail. ALMA observed CN N=3-2 in Lupus disks down to sensitivities better than\nprevious surveys. Models constructed with the physico-chemical code DALI are\nused to study the integrated fluxes of the disks and resolved emission of CN in\ndisks without (dust) substructures. We find that CN N=3-2 is bright, and\ndetected in 38% of sources, but its disk-integrated flux is not strongly\ncorrelated to either $^{13}$CO or continuum flux. Compared to pre-ALMA\nsingle-dish surveys, no significant difference in the CN flux distributions in\nLupus and Taurus-Auriga is found, although $\\rho$ Ophiuchus disks may be\nfainter on average. We find ring-shaped CN emission with peak radii of ~50 AU\nin two resolved disks. We conclude that a large fraction of sources is faint in\nCN; only exponential gas surface density cutoffs at $R_{c} \\leq 15$ AU can\nreconcile observations with models. This is the first observational evidence of\nsuch a compact gas disk population in Lupus.

Six previously unidentified waves in Saturn's middle\n  C ring Abstract: Recent studies of stellar occultations observed by the Visual and Infrared\nMapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft have demonstrated\nthat multiple spiral wave structures in Saturn's rings are probably generated\nby normal-mode oscillations inside the planet. Wavelet-based analyses have been\nable to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation\nrate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical\ntools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave\nactually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at\n1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.\nFurthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave\npatterns with 6, 7, 8 and 9 spiral arms rotating around the planet at 1538.2\ndegrees/day, 1492.5 degrees/day, 1454.2 degrees/day and 1421.8 degrees/day,\nrespectively.

However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3.

On\naccount of these observational restrictions, a stellar atmosphere model may be\nused to compute the stellar extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 100 - 912 \\AA) spectrum.\nWe present a case study of the ultra-cool M8 dwarf star, TRAPPIST-1, which\nhosts seven transiting short-period terrestrial sized planets whose atmospheres\nwill be probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. We construct semi-empirical\nnon-LTE model spectra of TRAPPIST-1 that span EUV to infrared wavelengths (100\n\\AA\\ - 2.5 $\\mu$m) using the atmosphere code PHOENIX. These upper-atmosphere\nmodels contain prescriptions for the chromosphere and transition region and\ninclude newly added partial frequency redistribution capabilities. In the\nabsence of broadband UV spectral observations, we constrain our models using\nHST Ly$\\alpha$ observations from TRAPPIST-1 and GALEX FUV and NUV photometric\ndetections from a set of old M8 stars ($>$1 Gyr).

Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier\nspectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious\nplanetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in\nthe case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV\nplanet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of\nobservational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun. \n\n"}

Here we show, using the first three-dimensional\ninterior structure simulations of ultra-short-period tidally distorted rocky\nexoplanets, that KOI 1843.03 may be shaped like an American football, elongated\nalong the planet-star axis with an aspect ratio of up to 1.79. Furthermore, for\nKOI 1843.03 to have avoided tidal disruption (wherein the planet is pulled\napart by the tidal gravity of its host star) on such a close-in orbit, KOI\n1843.03 must be as iron-rich as Mercury (about 66% by mass iron compared to\nMercury's 70% by mass iron, Hauck et al. 2013). Of the ultra-short-period\n($P_\\mathrm{orb} \\lesssim 1$ day) planets with physically-meaningful\nconstraints on their densities characterized to date, just under half (4 out of\n9) are iron-enhanced. As more are discovered, we will better understand the\ndiversity of rocky planet compositions and the variety of processes that lead\nto planetary iron enhancement. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.11231", "contents": "Title: Minerva-Australis I: Design, Commissioning, & First Photometric Results Abstract: The Minerva-Australis telescope array is a facility dedicated to the\nfollow-up, confirmation, characterisation, and mass measurement of bright\ntransiting planets discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS) -- a category in which it is almost unique in the southern hemisphere.\nIt is located at the University of Southern Queensland's Mount Kent Observatory\nnear Toowoomba, Australia. Its flexible design enables multiple 0.7m robotic\ntelescopes to be used both in combination, and independently, for\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy and precision photometry of TESS transit planet\ncandidates. Minerva-Australis also enables complementary studies of exoplanet\nspin-orbit alignments via Doppler observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffect, radial velocity searches for non-transiting planets, planet searches\nusing transit timing variations, and ephemeris refinement for TESS planets. In\nthis first paper, we describe the design, photometric instrumentation,\nsoftware, and science goals of Minerva-Australis, and note key differences from\nits Northern hemisphere counterpart -- the Minerva array. We use recent transit\nobservations of four planets--WASP-2b, WASP-44b, WASP-45b, and HD 189733b to\ndemonstrate the photometric capabilities of Minerva-Australis. \n\n"}
