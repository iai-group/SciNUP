First, we find that\nbidisperse, disordered foams exhibit strongly rate dependent and inhomogeneous\n(shear banded) velocity profiles, while monodisperse, ordered foams are also\nshear banded, but essentially rate independent. Second, we introduce a simple\nmodel based on balancing the averaged drag forces between the bubbles and the\ntop plate and the averaged bubble-bubble drag forces. This model captures the\nobserved rate dependent flows, and the rate independent flows. Third, we\nperform independent rheological measurements, both for ordered and disordered\nsystems, and find these to be fully consistent with the scaling forms of the\ndrag forces assumed in the simple model, and we see that disorder modifies the\nscaling. Fourth, we vary the packing fraction $\\phi$ of the foam over a\nsubstantial range, and find that the flow profiles become increasingly shear\nbanded when the foam is made wetter.

However, the latter is restricted to\nelectrostatic interactions between charges and dipole moments.

However,\nDRMG suffers from inherent accuracy restrictions when multiple states are\ninvolved due to multi-state targeting and also the approximate representation\nof the Hamiltonian and other operators.

Furthermore, by using the Matrix Product Operator (MPO)\nformalism, one can exactly represent the Hamiltonian and other operators. The\nMPO approach allows 1D Hamiltonians to be templated using a small set of finite\nstate automaton rules without reference to the particular microscopic degrees\nof freedom.

Abstract: Microbiology is the science of microbes, particularly bacteria. Many bacteria\nare motile: they are capable of self-propulsion. Among these, a significant\nclass execute so-called run-and-tumble motion: they follow a fairly straight\npath for a certain distance, then abruptly change direction before repeating\nthe process. This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is\ndiffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically,\nmotility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local\nenvironment and hence can vary in space. When they do so, even if a steady\nstate is reached, this is not generally invariant under time-reversal: the\nprinciple of detailed balance, which restores the microscopic time-reversal\nsymmetry of systems in thermal equilibrium, is mesoscopically absent in motile\nbacteria. This lack of detailed balance (allowed by the flux of chemical energy\nthat drives motility) creates pitfalls for the unwary modeller.

Recently, an\nensemble theory of stealthy hyperuniform ground states was formulated to\npredict the structure and thermodynamics that was shown to be in excellent\nagreement with corresponding computer simulation results in the canonical\nensemble (in the zero-temperature limit). In this paper, we provide details and\njustifications of the simulation procedure, which involves performing molecular\ndynamics simulations at sufficiently low temperatures and minimizing the energy\nof the snapshots for both the high-density disordered regime, where the theory\napplies, as well as lower densities. We also use numerical simulations to\nextend our study to the lower-density regime. We report results for the pair\ncorrelation functions, structure factors, and Voronoi cell statistics. In the\nhigh-density regime, we verify the theoretical ansatz that stealthy disordered\nground states behave like \"pseudo\" disordered equilibrium hard-sphere systems\nin Fourier space. These results show that as the density decreases from the\nhigh-density limit, the disordered ground states in the canonical ensemble are\ncharacterized by an increasing degree of short-range order and eventually the\nsystem undergoes a phase transition to crystalline ground states.

The challenge arises because in\nconventional thermodynamics the potentials are required to scale linearly with\nextensive variables like volume, which does not allow for a general treatment\nof boundary effects.

The subgroups form a rich hierarchy and allow\nfor many different phases of matter with orientational order.

Abstract: Classical particle systems characterized by continuous size polydispersity,\nsuch as colloidal materials, are not straightforwardly described using\nstatistical mechanics, since fundamental issues may arise from particle\ndistinguishability. Because the mixing entropy in such systems is divergent in\nthe thermodynamic limit we show that the configurational entropy estimated from\nstandard computational approaches to characterize glassy states also diverges.\nThis reasoning would suggest that polydisperse materials cannot undergo a glass\ntransition, in contradiction to experiments. We explain that this argument\nstems from the confusion between configurations in phase space and states\ndefined by free energy minima, and propose a simple method to compute a finite\nand physically meaningful configurational entropy in continuously polydisperse\nsystems.

Here, we perform the first quantum\nsimulation explorations of the combination of artificial gauge fields and\ndisorder. Using synthetic lattice techniques based on parametrically-coupled\natomic momentum states, we engineer zigzag chains with a tunable homogeneous\nflux. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the applied flux leads to\nanalogs of spin-orbit coupling and spin-momentum locking, which we observe\ndirectly through the chiral dynamics of atoms initialized to single lattice\nsites. We additionally introduce precisely controlled disorder in the site\nenergy landscape, allowing us to explore the interplay of disorder and large\neffective magnetic fields. The combination of correlated disorder and\ncontrolled intra- and inter-row tunneling in this system naturally supports\nenergy-dependent localization, relating to a single-particle mobility edge. We\nmeasure the localization properties of the extremal eigenstates of this system,\nthe ground state and the most-excited state, and demonstrate clear evidence for\na flux-dependent mobility edge.

The turbulent\nviscosity in such disks must be hydrodynamic in origin, not\nmagnetohydrodynamic. We investigate the growth of hydrodynamic perturbations in\na linear shear flow sandwiched between two parallel walls. The unperturbed flow\nis similar to plane Couette flow but with a Coriolis force included. Although\nthere are no exponentially growing eigenmodes in this system, nevertheless,\nbecause of the non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, it is possible to have a\nlarge transient growth in the energy of perturbations. For a constant angular\nmomentum disk, we find that the perturbation with maximum growth has a\nwave-vector in the vertical direction. The energy grows by more than a factor\nof 100 for a Reynolds number R=300 and more than a factor of 1000 for R=1000.\nTurbulence can be easily excited in such a disk, as found in previous numerical\nsimulations. For a Keplerian disk, on the other hand, similar vertical\nperturbations grow by no more than a factor of 4, explaining why the same\nsimulations did not find turbulence in this system. However, certain other\ntwo-dimensional perturbations with no vertical structure do exhibit modest\ngrowth. For the optimum two-dimensional perturbation, the energy grows by a\nfactor of ~100 for R~10^4.5 and by a factor of 1000 for R~10^6. It is\nconceivable that these two-dimensional disturbances might lead to\nself-sustained turbulence. The Reynolds numbers of cold astrophysical disks are\nmuch larger even than 10^6, therefore, hydrodynamic turbulence may be possible\nin disks. \n\n"}

For the lowest shear rates investigated, we find the growth laws for the\ntwo principal axis $R_\\perp (t) \\sim constant$, $R_\\parallel(t) \\sim t$, while\nthe mean orientation of the domains with respect to the flow is inversely\nproportional to the strain. This implies that when hydrodynamics is neglected a\nshear flow does not stop the domain growth process. We investigate also the\npossibility of dynamic scaling, and show that only a non trivial form of\nscaling holds, as predicted by a recent analytical approach to the case of a\nnon-conserved order parameter. We show that a simple physical argument may\naccount for these results. \n\n"}

Empirical prompt and\n  dynamical trap model Abstract: The present paper proposes a novel interpretation of the widely scattered\nstates (called synchronized traffic) stimulated by Kerner's hypotheses about\nthe existence of a multitude of metastable states in the fundamental diagram.\nUsing single vehicle data collected at the German highway A1, temporal velocity\npatterns have been analyzed to show a collection of certain fragments with\napproximately constant velocities and sharp jumps between them. The particular\nvelocity values in these fragments vary in a wide range. In contrast, the flow\nrate is more or less constant because its fluctuations are mainly due to the\ndiscreteness of traffic flow.\n  Subsequently, we develop a model for synchronized traffic that can explain\nthese characteristics. Following previous work (I.A.Lubashevsky, R.Mahnke,\nPhys. Rev. E v. 62, p. 6082, 2000) the vehicle flow is specified by car\ndensity, mean velocity, and additional order parameters $h$ and $a$ that are\ndue to the many-particle effects of the vehicle interaction. The parameter $h$\ndescribes the multilane correlations in the vehicle motion. Together with the\ncar density it determines directly the mean velocity. The parameter $a$, in\ncontrast, controls the evolution of $h$ only. The model assumes that $a$\nfluctuates randomly around the value corresponding to the car configuration\noptimal for lane changing. When it deviates from this value the lane change is\ndepressed for all cars forming a local cluster. Since exactly the overtaking\nmanoeuvres of these cars cause the order parameter $a$ to vary, the evolution\nof the car arrangement becomes frozen for a certain time. In other words, the\nevolution equations form certain dynamical traps responsible for the long-time\ncorrelations in the synchronized mode. \n\n"}

In the first model a \\pm\nJ-distribution of the bonds is chosen, in the second model a Gaussian\ndistribution. In both cases the first two moments of the distribution are\nchosen to be J_0=-1, Delta J=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the Potts\nspins can occur. We find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glass\nsusceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, and\nthat the specific heat has only a smooth Schottky-like peak. These results can\nbe understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters of\nspins. Hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at any\nnonzero temperature. Consistent with these findings, only very minor size\neffects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the models\nremain very short. We also compute for both models the time auto-correlation\nfunction C(t) of the Potts spins. While in the Gaussian model C(t) shows a\nsmooth uniform decay, the correlator for the \\pm J model has several distinct\nsteps. These steps correspond to the breaking of bonds in small clusters of\nferromagnetically coupled spins (dimers, trimers, etc.). The relaxation times\nfollow simple Arrhenius laws, with activation energies that are readily\ninterpreted within the cluster picture, giving evidence that the system does\nnot have a dynamic transition at a finite temperature.

Ageing phenomena are observed during\nthis ever-lasting non-equilibrium evolution. A simple instance of such a\nbehaviour is provided by the dynamics that takes place when a system is\nquenched from its high-temperature phase to the critical point. The aim of this\nreview is to summarize the various numerical and analytical results that have\nbeen recently obtained for this case. Particular emphasis is put to the\nfield-theoretical methods that can be used to provide analytical predictions\nfor the relevant dynamical quantities. Fluctuation-dissipation relations are\ndiscussed and in particular the concept of fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR)\nis reviewed, emphasizing its connection with the definition of a possible\neffective temperature. The Renormalization-Group approach to critical dynamics\nis summarized and the scaling forms of the time-dependent non-equilibrium\ncorrelation and response functions of a generic observable are discussed. From\nthem the universality of the associated FDR follows as an amplitude ratio. It\nis then possible to provide predictions for ageing quantities in a variety of\ndifferent models.

In the adiabatic limit (small $\\omega_0$), the chain is\nexpected to spontaneously dimerize and open a spin gap, while the phonons\nbecome static. In the antiadiabatic limit (large $\\omega_0$), phonons are\nexpected to give rise to frustration, so that dimerization and formation of\nspin-gap are obtained only when the spin-phonon interaction is large enough. We\nstudy this crossover using bosonization technique. The effective action is\nsolved both by the Self Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA)and by\nRenormalization Group (RG) approach starting from a bosonized description. The\nSCHA allows to analyze the lowfrequency regime and determine the coupling\nconstant associated with the spin-Peierls transition. However, it fails to\ndescribe the SU(2) invariant limit. This limit is tackled by the RG. Three\nregimes are found.
