For spins in the opposite direction the waves\nare evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the\nscattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is\nperpendicular to the Rashba field.

Although for certain parameters this reduction of the AHE\ncan be approximated as $\\sigma_{xy}\\thicksim\\sigma_{xx}^{\\varphi}$ with\n$\\varphi$ varying around 1.6, this is found not to be true in general as\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ can go through a change in sign as a function of disorder\nstrength in some cases. The reduction region in which the quasiparticle\napproximation is meaningful is relatively narrow; therefore, a theory with a\nwider range of applicability is called for. By considering the higher order\nskew scattering processes, we resolve some discrepancies between the AHE\nresults obtained by using the Keldysh, Kubo and Boltzmann approaches. We also\nshow that similar higher order processes are important for the AMR when the\nnonvertex and vertex parts cancel each other. We calculate the AMR in\nanisotropic systems properly taking into account the anisotropy of the\nnon-equilibrium distribution function. These calculations confirm recent\nfindings on the unreliability of common approximations to the Boltzmann\nequation. \n\n"}

Recent work has shown that by weakening the role of the\nmeasurement in preparing eigenstates of the variable it is in fact possible to\nmeasure all nonlocal observables instantaneously by exploiting entanglement.\nHowever, for these measurement schemes to succeed with certainty an infinite\namount of entanglement must be distributed initially and all this entanglement\nis necessarily consumed. In this work we sharpen the characterisation of\ninstantaneous nonlocal measurements by explicitly devising schemes in which\nonly a finite amount of the initially distributed entanglement is ever\nutilised. This enables us to determine an upper bound to the average\nconsumption for the most general cases of nonlocal measurements. This includes\nthe tasks of state verification, where the measurement verifies if the system\nis in a given state, and verification measurements of a general set of\neigenstates of an observable.

In particular, for topological superconductors (or\nsuperfluids) with time-reversal symmetry which lack SU(2) spin rotation\nsymmetry (e.g. due to spin-orbit interactions), such as the B phase of $^3$He,\nthe thermal response is the only probe which can detect the non-trivial\ntopological character through transport. We show that, for such topological\nsuperconductors, applying a temperature gradient produces a thermal- (or mass-)\nsurface current perpendicular to the thermal gradient. Such charge, thermal, or\nmagnetic dipole responses provide a definition of topological insulators and\nsuperconductors beyond the single-particle picture.

This situation was\nnot foreseen because excitons are light-mass boson-like particles with a\ncondensation expected to occur around a few Kelvins. An explanation can be\nfound in the underlying fermionic nature of excitons which rules their\ncondensation. Precisely, it was recently predicted that, at accessible\nexperimental conditions, the exciton condensate shall be \"gray\" with a dominant\ndark part coherently coupled to a weak bright component through fermion\nexchanges. This counter-intuitive quantum condensation, since excitons are\nmostly known for their optical activity, directly follows from the excitons\ninternal structure which has an optically inactive, i.e., dark, ground state.\nHere, we report compelling evidence for such a \"gray\" condensate. We use an\nall-optical approach in order to produce microscopic traps which confine a\ndense exciton gas that yet exhibits an anomalously weak photo-emission at\nsub-Kelvin temperatures. This first fingerprint for a \"gray\" condensate is then\nconfirmed by the macroscopic spatial coherence and the linear polarization of\nthe weak excitonic photoluminescence emitted from the trap, as theoretically\npredicted. \n\n"}

We show that\nfermionic systems can have edge phases with only bosonic low-energy excitations\nand discuss a fermionic generalization of the relation between bulk topological\nspins and the central charge. The latter follows from our demonstration that\nevery fermionic topological phase can be represented as a bosonic topological\nphase, together with some number of filled Landau levels. Our analysis shows\nthat every Abelian topological phase can be decomposed into a tensor product of\ntheories associated with prime numbers $p$ in which every quasiparticle has a\ntopological spin that is a $p^n$-th root of unity for some $n$.

We use Wilson-Dirac Hamiltonian for\nfermions, and non-compact action for the gauge field.

In the case of chirality pumping in\nparallel electric and magnetic fields, electric field is screened by the\nproduced on-shell fermions and the accumulation of chirality is hence stopped.\nIn the case of evolution with initially present chirality imbalance, axial\ncharge tends to transform to helicity of electromagnetic field.

Abstract: On the surface of 2D Topological insulators occur 1D quantum spin Hall(QSH)\nedge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which\noccur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is\nbecause of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge\nmodes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing\ndirections. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than\ncharge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to\ndisorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent\nand spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge\nmodes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic\nscattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge\nmodes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH\nedge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge\nmodes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall\nedge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a\nsingle disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune\nto disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall\nresistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.\nIn case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while\nquantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a\nfinite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the\ninelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip\nand without spin-flip scattering. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry\ncan have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in\nquantum Hall case. \n\n"}

It is shown here that the same experiment can be viewed in two\ndifferent ways, depending on which basis of the which-way detector states one\nchooses to look at. In one view, the loss of interference arises due to the\nentanglement of the two paths of the particle with two orthogonal states of the\nwhich-way detector. In another view, the loss of interference can be\ninterpreted as arising from random momentum kicks of magnitude $h/2d$ received\nby the particle, $d$ being the slit separation. The same scenario is shown to\nhold for a three-slit interference experiment. The random momentum kicks for\nthe three-slit case are of two kinds, of magnitude $\\pm h/3d$.

However, the pair of photons\nare emitted isotropically in all directions, thus limiting the collection\nefficiency to a fraction of a percent. Moreover, strain and structural\nasymmetry in quantum dots lift the degeneracy of the intermediate exciton\nstates in the cascade, thus degrading the measured entanglement fidelity.

We consider\nthe SYK model in the framework of a many-body Altland-Zirnbauer classification\nthat sees the system as belonging to one of eight (real) symmetry classes\ndepending on the value of $k\\mod 8$.

Our purpose in this chapter is to provide an intuitive explanation\nfor the observed I-V characteristics using simple models to illustrate the\nbasic physics. In contrast to the MOSFET, whose I-V is largely dominated by\nclassical electrostatics, the I-V characteristics of molecules is determined by\na more interesting interplay between nineteenth century physics\n(electrostatics) and twentieth century physics (quantum transport) and it is\nimportant to do justice to both aspects.\n  We start with a qualitative discussion of the main factors affecting the I-V\ncharacteristics of molecular conductors, using a simple toy model to illustrate\ntheir role. Including the effects of: (1) Shift in the energy level due to\ncharging effects and (2) broadening of the energy levels due to the coupling to\nthe two contacts we obtain realistic I-V plots, even though the toy model\nassumes that conduction takes place independently through individual molecular\nlevels.

In particular, the validity of the\nmodel was investigated in relation with the statistical properties of the\nconductance in open chaotic cavities. In this article we investigate further\nthe validity of the maximum-entropy model, by comparing the theoretical\npredictions with the results of computer simulations, in which the Schroedinger\nequation is solved numerically inside the cavity for one and two open channels\nin the leads; we analyze, in addition to the conductance, the zero-frequency\nlimit of the shot-noise power spectrum. We also obtain theoretical results for\nthe ensemble average of this last quantity, for the orthogonal and unitary\ncases of the circular ensemble and an arbitrary number of channels. Generally\nspeaking, the agreement between theory and numerics is good. In some of the\ncavities that we study, short paths consist of whispering gallery modes, which\nwere excluded in previous studies. These cavities turn out to be all the more\ninteresting, as it is in relation with them that we found certain systematic\ndiscrepancies in the comparison with theory. We give evidence that it is the\nlack of stationarity inside the energy interval that is analyzed, and hence the\nlack of ergodicity that gives rise to the discrepancies. Indeed, the agreement\nbetween theory and numerical simulations is improved when the energy interval\nis reduced to a point and the statistics is then collected over an ensemble. It\nthus appears that the maximum-entropy model is valid beyond the domain where it\nwas originally derived. An understanding of this situation is still lacking at\nthe present moment. \n\n"}

Since the two sets of two-level\nsystems are coupled indirectly through the oscillator, excitation transfer from\none set of two-level systems to the other is possible. In addition, the\nexcitation energy from the two-level systems may be exchanged with the\noscillator coherently, even though the oscillator energy may be orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the two-level system transition energy. In the lossless\ncase, we demonstrate these effects numerically, and also use an approximate\ndiagonalization to show that these effects are expected from the model\nHamiltonian.\n  We augment the model to include loss effects, and show that loss enhances the\nexcitation transfer effect by breaking the severe cancelation between different\npaths that occurs in the lossless case. We describe a simple approximate model\nwavefunction appropriate when the loss increases rapidly with energy. Within\nthis model approximation, we present numerical and analytical results for\nexcitation transfer and energy transfer rates, showing that they are greatly\nincreased.\n  Our study of these models is motivated in part by claims of excess heat\nproduction in electrochemical experiments in heavy water.

The\nrandom gauge coupling at each plaquette takes the value J with the probability\n1-p and -J with p. This model exhibits a confinement-Higgs phase transition.

One of\nthe main advantages of this approach is that searching for the extension can be\ncast as a convex optimization problem known as a semidefinite program (SDP).\nWhenever an extension does not exist, the dual optimization constructs an\nexplicit entanglement witness for the particular state. These separability\ntests can be ordered in a hierarchical structure whose first step corresponds\nto the well-known Positive Partial Transpose (Peres-Horodecki) criterion, and\neach test in the hierarchy is at least as powerful as the preceding one.
