The extinction\nprofile of this shadow matches the profile derived from 2MASS photometry at the\nouter edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of ~32 visual magnitudes at\nthe center. The corresponding mass of CB190 is ~10 Msun. Our 12CO and 13CO J =\n2-1 data over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show a\ntemperature ~10 K. The thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for\nthe dust. The molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains.\nWe estimate a distance to CB190 of 400 pc using the spectroscopic parallax of a\nstar associated with the globule. Bonnor-Ebert fits to the density profile, in\nconjunction with this distance, yield xi_max = 7.2, indicating that CB190 may\nbe unstable. The high temperature (56 K) of the best fit Bonnor-Ebert model is\nin contradiction with the CO and thermal continuum data, leading to the\nconclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fall\ncollapse.

Numerical calculations reveal that the\nstriking features in NGC 6782 can be reproduced provided that the gas flow is\ngoverned by the gravitational potential associated with a slowly rotating\nstrong bar.

In this paper, we analyze the\ndistribution of dark matter and semianalytical galaxies in the Millennium\nSimulation to investigate these problems. Applying the same density field\nreconstruction schemes as used for the overall matter distribution to the\nmatter locked in halos we study the mass contribution of halos to the total\nmass budget at various background field densities, i.e., the conditional halo\nmass function. In this context, we present a simple fitting formula for the\ncumulative mass function accurate to ~ 5% for halo masses between 10^{10} and\n10^{15}Msol/h.

Strong parton energy loss has been observed in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions as evidenced by the a large suppression of the yield\nof high pT hadrons as compared to the expected yield based on measurements in\np+p collisions. Moreover, measurements of back-to-back correlations of charged\nhadrons suggest that jet shapes are strongly modified modified by the medium.\nThe quantitative interpretation of single and di-hadron measurements is,\nhowever, complicated by the fact that the initial parton energy is unknown. A\nmore informative measurement would be one in which the initial parton energy is\nknown, allowing the determination of the fragmentation function, which may be\neffectively modified from its vacuum form by the presence of the medium. Two\nmeasurements in which the initial parton energy may be estimated are discussed\nin these proceedings: jet reconstruction and two- particle correlations using\ndirect photons. Jet reconstruction in nuclear collisions is challenging due to\nthe large background of soft particles, fluctuations of which give rise to fake\njets. Direct photons can be used to estimate the initial parton energy of the\nrecoil jet without recourse to jet reconstruction algorithms. However, such\nstudies suffer from a smaller rate and the direct photon signal must be\ndisentangled from a large background of decay photons. We present jet\nreconstruction results which use an algorithm suitable for a high multiplicity\nenvironment. We also present results of two-particle correlations using direct\nphotons.

They are optically-thin to their own radiation\nand cool inefficiently. The optically-thick interior in contrast is heated only\nweakly, by re-emission from the atmosphere. The interior is colder than a\nclassical viscous model, and isothermal.\n  The magnetic fields support an extended atmosphere that absorbs the starlight\n1.5 times higher than the hydrostatic viscous model.

The Gromov-Witten potentials of X are\ngenerating functions for the Gromov-Witten invariants of X: they are formal\npower series, sometimes in infinitely many variables, with Taylor coefficients\ngiven by Gromov-Witten invariants of X. It is natural to ask whether these\nformal power series converge. In this paper we describe and analyze various\nnotions of convergence for Gromov-Witten potentials.

The candidate has a MB\nluminosity of -5.2 +/- 0.4 mag and a B-I color of 0.1+/-0.3 mag. If confirmed\nby future observations, this would be the first direct detection for a\nprogenitor of a Type Ib. Fitting a power law to the early light curve, we find\nan extrapolated explosion date around 1.1 days before our first detection. We\nsee no evidence of shock cooling. The pre-explosion detection limits constrain\nthe radius of the progenitor to be smaller than a few solar radii. iPTF13bvn is\nalso detected in cm and mm-wavelengths.

A compressed sensing (CS)\nreconstruction algorithm seeks to recover a structured signal acquired using a\nsmall number of randomized measurements. Typical CS reconstruction algorithms\ncan be cast as iteratively estimating a signal from a perturbed observation.\nThis paper answers a natural question: How can one effectively employ a generic\ndenoiser in a CS reconstruction algorithm? In response, we develop an extension\nof the approximate message passing (AMP) framework, called Denoising-based AMP\n(D-AMP), that can integrate a wide class of denoisers within its iterations.

We describe the propagation of free\nenergy in phase space using forwards and backwards propagating Hermite modes\nrecently developed for gyrokinetics [Schekochihin et al. (2014)]. The change in\nthe electric field corresponds to the net Hermite flux via a free energy\nevolution equation. In linear Landau damping, decay in the electric field\ncorresponds to forward propagating Hermite modes; in nonlinear damping, the\ninitial decay is followed by a growth phase characterised by the generation of\nbackwards propagating Hermite modes by the nonlinear term. The free energy\ncontent of the backwards propagating modes increases exponentially until\nbalancing that of the forward propagating modes. Thereafter there is no\nsystematic net Hermite flux, so the electric field cannot decay and the\nnonlinearity effectively suppresses Landau damping.

To optimally estimate sparse principal\nsubspaces, we propose a two-stage computational framework named \"tighten after\nrelax\": Within the 'relax' stage, we approximately solve a convex relaxation of\nsparse PCA with early stopping to obtain a desired initial estimator; For the\n'tighten' stage, we propose a novel algorithm called sparse orthogonal\niteration pursuit (SOAP), which iteratively refines the initial estimator by\ndirectly solving the underlying nonconvex problem.

I use three techniques:\nthe numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion, and the perturbative\nRedfield and Foerster theories, the latter of which ignores quantum coherence\nin the transfer. Both of the approximate methods perform very well - and while\noscillations in site populations (a hallmark of coherence) are present in the\nexact transfer dynamics and absent in the dynamics of Foerster theory, the\nlatter gives a reasonable prediction of transfer rates and steady-state\npopulations, despite being incoherent - suggesting that coherence is not vital\nfor the dynamics of transfer.

Such `dark' vortices could play a phenomenological role in models with\nboth cosmic strings and a dark gauge sector.

For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at\n1.37 < z < 2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer\nmetallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron and Herschel/PACS\n100 and 160 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron\nluminosities (L(7.7)) and total IR luminosities (L(IR)), respectively. We find\nsignificant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected\nSFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O32) emission-line ratio. The\nlatter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends\nindicate a paucity of PAH emission in low metallicity environments with harder\nand more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly\nlower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to\nolder galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB\nstars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of ~\n2 for galaxies with masses $M_* < 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, compared to the more\nmassive ones. We demonstrate that commonly-used conversions of L(7.7) (or 24\nmicron flux density; f(24)) to L(IR) underestimate the IR luminosity by more\nthan a factor of 2 at $M_*$ ~ $10^{9.6-10.0} M_{\\odot}$. We adopt a\nmass-dependent conversion of L(7.7) to L(IR) with L(7.7)/L(IR)= 0.09 and 0.22\nfor $M_* < 10^{10}$ and $> 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, respectively. Based on the new\nscaling, the SFR-$M_*$ relation has a shallower slope than previously derived.\nOur results also suggest a higher IR luminosity density at z ~ 2 than\npreviously measured, corresponding to a ~ 30% increase in the SFR density. \n\n"}

In particular, we give a detailed description of\nthe topology of their connected components. More precisely, consider a \"Julia\ncontinuum\" C of such a function, i.e. the closure in the Riemann sphere of a\ncomponent of the Julia set. We show that infinity is a terminal point of C, and\nthat C has span zero in the sense of Lelek; under a mild geometric assumption\non the function C is arc-like. (Whether every span zero continuum is also\narc-like was a famous question in continuum theory, only recently resolved in\nthe negative.) Conversely, we construct a single disjoint-type entire function\nwith the remarkable property that each arc-like continuum with at least one\nterminal point is realised as a Julia continuum. The class of arc-like continua\nwith terminal points is uncountable. It includes, in particular, the\nsin(1/x)-curve, the Knaster buckethandle and the pseudo-arc, so these can all\noccur as Julia continua of a disjoint-type entire function.\n  We give similar descriptions of the possible topology of Julia continua that\ncontain periodic points or points with bounded orbits, and answer a question of\nBara\\'nski and Karpi\\'nska by showing that Julia continua need not contain\npoints that are accessible from the Fatou set.

Through detailed simulations, in comparison\nwith appropriate analytical modelling, it is shown that within classical\nelectrodynamics, and for the reduced separations explored here, fluorescence\nenhancement factors of the order of $10^{5}$ can be achieved, with a divergent\nbehaviour as the particle touching regime is approached. This remarkable\nprediction is mainly governed by the dramatic increase in excitation rate\ntriggered by the corresponding field enhancement inside the gaps. Nevertheless,\nonce nonclassical corrections are included, the amplification factors decrease\nby up to two orders of magnitude and a saturation regime for narrower gaps is\nreached. These nonclassical limitations are demonstrated by simulations based\non the generalised nonlocal optical response theory, which accounts in an\nefficient way not only for nonlocal screening, but also for the enhanced Landau\ndamping near the metal surface.

The hash calculation allows extremely fast\npacket forwarding and provides flow `stickiness', meaning that all packets\nbelonging to the same flow get dispatched to the same server. Unfortunately,\nsuch static hashing may not yield an optimal degree of load balancing, e.g.,\ndue to variations in server processing speeds or traffic patterns. On the other\nhand, dynamic schemes, such as the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) scheme,\nprovide a natural way to mitigate load imbalances, but at the expense of\nstickiness violation.\n  In the present paper we examine the fundamental trade-off between stickiness\nviolation and packet-level latency performance in large-scale data centers.

Moreover, relaxing the stickiness\nrequirement by a minuscule amount is highly effective in clipping the tail of\nthe latency distribution.

Specifically, DCRNN\ncaptures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph,\nand the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with\nscheduled sampling.

However, most\nredundancy-based program repair techniques do not reason about the repair\ningredients---the code that is reused to craft a patch. We aim to reason about\nthe repair ingredients by using code similarities to prioritize and transform\nstatements in a codebase for patch generation. Our approach, DeepRepair, relies\non deep learning to reason about code similarities. Code fragments at\nwell-defined levels of granularity in a codebase can be sorted according to\ntheir similarity to suspicious elements (i.e., code elements that contain\nsuspicious statements) and statements can be transformed by mapping\nout-of-scope identifiers to similar identifiers in scope.

Our comparative experiments were executed\non six open-source Java projects including 374 buggy program revisions and\nconsisted of 19,949 trials spanning 2,616 days of computation time.\nDeepRepair's search strategy using code similarities generally found compilable\ningredients faster than the baseline, jGenProg, but this improvement neither\nyielded test-adequate patches in fewer attempts (on average) nor found\nsignificantly more patches than the baseline. Although the patch counts were\nnot statistically different, there were notable differences between the nature\nof DeepRepair patches and baseline patches. The results demonstrate that our\nlearning-based approach finds patches that cannot be found by existing\nredundancy-based repair techniques. \n\n"}

We show that ac\nelectric current, via N\\'eel spin orbit torques, can lock the phase of a steady\nrotating N\\'eel vector whose precession is controlled by a dc spin current. In\nthe phase-locking regime the frequency of the incoming ac signal coincides with\nthe frequency of autooscillations which for typical antiferromagnets fall into\nthe THz range. The frequency of autooscillations is proportional to the\nprecession-induced tilting of the magnetic sublattices related to the so-called\ndynamical magnetization.

In this paper we present ManifoldNet, a\nnovel method to encourage learning of manifold-aware representations. Our\napproach segments the input manifold into a set of fragments. By assigning the\ncorresponding segmentation id as a pseudo label to every sample, we convert the\nproblem of preserving the local manifold structure into a point-wise\nclassification task. Due to its unsupervised nature, the segmentation tends to\nbe noisy. We mitigate this by introducing ensemble manifold segmentation (EMS).\nEMS accounts for the manifold structure by dividing the training data into an\nensemble of classification training sets that contain samples of local\nproximity. CNNs are trained on these ensembles under a multi-task learning\nframework to conform to the manifold. ManifoldNet can be trained with only the\npseudo labels or together with task-specific labels. We evaluate ManifoldNet on\ntwo different tasks: network imitation (distillation) and semi-supervised\nlearning.

The replicated databases scenario was considered by Sun and Jafar,\n2016, where $N$ databases can store the same $K$ messages completely. A PIR\nscheme was developed to achieve the optimal download cost given by $\\left(1+\n\\frac{1}{N}+ \\frac{1}{N^{2}}+ \\cdots + \\frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\\right)$. In this work,\nwe consider the problem of PIR from storage constrained databases. Each\ndatabase has a storage capacity of $\\mu KL$ bits, where $L$ is the size of each\nmessage in bits, and $\\mu \\in [1/N, 1]$ is the normalized storage. On one\nextreme, $\\mu=1$ is the replicated databases case.

We aim to characterize the optimal download cost versus storage\ntrade-off for any storage capacity in the range $\\mu \\in [1/N, 1]$. For any\n$(N,K)$, we show that the optimal trade-off between storage, $\\mu$, and the\ndownload cost, $D(\\mu)$, is given by the lower convex hull of the $N$ pairs\n$\\left(\\mu= \\frac{t}{N},D(\\mu) = \\left(1+ \\frac{1}{t}+ \\frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \\cdots\n+ \\frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\\right)\\right)$ for $t=1,2,\\ldots, N$.

In general, it is well-known that any online routing\nstrategy performs very poor in the worst case. The main difficulty are\nuncovered regions within the wireless ad hoc network, which we denote as radio\nholes. Complex shapes of radio holes, for example zig-zag-shapes, make local\ngeometric routing even more difficult, i.e., forwarded messages in direction to\nthe destination might get stuck in a dead end or are routed along very long\ndetours, when there is no knowledge about the ad hoc network. To obtain\nknowledge about the position and shape of radio holes, we make use of a hybrid\nnetwork approach. This approach assumes that we can not just make use of the ad\nhoc network but also of some cellular infrastructure, which is used to gather\nknowledge about the underlying ad hoc network. Communication via the cellular\ninfrastructure incurs costs as cell phone providers are involved. Therefore, we\nuse the cellular infrastructure only to compute routing paths in the ad hoc\nnetwork. The actual data transmission takes place in the ad hoc network. In\norder to find good routing paths we aim at computing an abstraction of the ad\nhoc network in which radio holes are abstracted by bounding boxes. The\nadvantage of bounding boxes as hole abstraction is that we only have to\nconsider a constant number of nodes per hole. We prove that bounding boxes are\na suitable hole abstraction that allows us to find $c$-competitive paths in the\nad hoc network in case of non-intersecting bounding boxes. In case of\nintersecting bounding boxes, we show via simulations that our routing strategy\nsignificantly outperforms the so far best online routing strategies for\nwireless ad hoc networks. Finally, we also present a routing strategy that is\n$c$-competitive in case of pairwise intersecting bounding boxes. \n\n"}

I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an\norder of magnitude lower than the linear theory Jeans mass, and that even if\none defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the\nevolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass,\nwhich corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are\nsmoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the\ncharacteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on\nstructure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a\nsingle characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In\ncontrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal\nhistory of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it\naccounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas\ndistribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic\nsuppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to\nfind an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total\nmass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple\nfitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass.

Abstract: The spectral energy distributions of galactic black holes in the low/hard\nstate and of low-luminosity AGN possess many common features, the most\nprominent being: compact, flat (or inverted) spectrum radio cores with high\nbrightness temperatures; excess red and infrared emission, often correlated\nwith the radio flux; an extremely weak (or absent) quasi-thermal hump and a\nhard X-ray power-law with high energy cut-off. These sources are thought to be\naccreting at low rates and advection (or convection) dominated accretion flows\nare usually considered the best candidates to explain them. Here we present an\nalternative possibility, involving strong, unbound, magnetic coronae generated\nby geometrically thin, optically thick accretion discs at low accretion rates.\nFirst we show that, if angular momentum transport in the disc is due to\nmagnetic turbulent stresses, the magnetic energy density and effective viscous\nstresses inside the disc are proportional to the geometric mean of the total\n(gas plus radiation) and gas pressure. Therefore the corona is less powerful in\na radiation pressure dominated disc, and the relative fraction of the power\nliberated in the corona increases as the accretion rate decreases. Furthermore,\nwe discuss reasons why energetically dominant coronae are ideal sites for\nlaunching powerful jets/outflows, both MHD and thermally driven. In analysing\nthe spectral properties of such coronal outflow dominated accretion discs, we\nreach the important conclusion that if the jet/outflow is, as is likely,\nradiatively inefficient, then so is the source overall, even without advection\nof energy into the black hole being relevant for the dynamics of the accretion\nflow. \n\n"}

Starting from high-precision nucleon-nucleon (NN)\ninteractions, wave functions of 7Be and 8B bound states are obtained in basis\nspaces up to 10 hbar Omega and used to calculate channel cluster form factors\n(overlap integrals) of the 8B ground state with 7Be+p. Due to the use of the\nharmonic oscillator (HO) basis, the overlap integrals have incorrect asymptotic\nproperties. We fix this problem in two alternative ways. First, by a\nWoods-Saxon (WS) potential solution fit to the interior of the NCSM overlap\nintegrals. Second, by a direct matching with the Whittaker function. The\ncorrected overlap integrals are then used for the 7Be(p,gamma)8B S-factor\ncalculation. We study the convergence of the S-factor with respect to the NCSM\nHO frequency and the model space size. Our S-factor results are in agreement\nwith recent direct measurement data.

The point of departure is a historical\nreview of four decades of string theory within the broader context of six\ndecades of failed attempts at an autonomous S-matrix approach to particle\ntheory. The central message, contained in sections 5 and 6, is that string\ntheory is not what its name suggests, namely a theory of of objects in\nspacetime whose localization is string- instead of point-like. Contrary to\npopular opinion the oscillators corresponding to the Fourier models of a\nquantum mechanical string do not cause a stringlike spatial extension of the\nobject under discussion and neither does the \"range space\" of a chiral\nconformal QFT acquire the interpretation of string-like localized quantum\nmatter. Rather the superstring represents a solution of a problem which enjoyed\nsome popularity in the 60s: the construction of infinite component wave\nfunction with a (realistic) mass/spin spectrum. The mass/spin tower \"sits\" over\none point and does not arise from a string in spacetime.

Quantum computation has stimulated much recent interest in\nalgorithms factoring unitary evolutions of an n-qubit state space into\ncomponent two-particle unitary evolutions. In the absence of symmetry, Shende,\nMarkov and Bullock use Sard's theorem to prove that at least C 4^n two-qubit\nunitary evolutions are required, while Vartiainen, Moettoenen, and Salomaa\n(VMS) use the QR matrix factorization and Gray codes in an optimal order\nconstruction involving two-particle evolutions. In this work, we note that\nSard's theorem demands C d^{2n} two-qudit unitary evolutions to construct a\ngeneric (symmetry-less) n-qudit evolution. However, the VMS result applied to\nvirtual-qubits only recovers optimal order in the case that d is a power of\ntwo. We further construct a QR decomposition for d-multi-level quantum logics,\nproving a sharp asymptotic of Theta(d^{2n}) two-qudit gates and thus closing\nthe complexity question for all d-level systems (d finite.)
