Abstract: With the advent of high-throughput profiling methods, interest in reverse\nengineering the structure and dynamics of biochemical networks is high.\nRecently an algorithm for reverse engineering of biochemical networks was\ndeveloped by Laubenbacher and Stigler. It is a top-down approach using time\ndiscrete dynamical systems. One of its key steps includes the choice of a term\norder. The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets\nto be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets. We found\nminimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be\nreverse engineered display. Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which\nwe characterized using a geometric property called \"general position\".\nMoreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets,\nprovided a codimensional condition is fulfilled. In addition, we present a\ngeneralization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term\norder. For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the\ncorrect model, provided the data set used is optimal. We analyzed the\nasymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of\nvariables n (i.e. interacting chemicals). Unfortunately, this formula converges\nto zero as fast as r^(q^n), where q is a natural number and 0<r<1. Therefore,\neven if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders\nare overcome, the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible, unless\nprodigious amounts of data are available.

Part II Abstract: Boolean networks have been the object of much attention, especially since S.\nKauffman proposed them in the 1960's as models for gene regulatory networks.\nThese systems are characterized by being defined on a Boolean state space and\nby simultaneous updating at discrete time steps. Of particular importance for\nbiological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is\nbounded by a fixed constant, as was stressed by Kauffman in his original\npapers.\n  An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule\nout exponentially long periodic orbits in the system. In this paper we consider\ncooperative systems, i.e. systems with positive feedback interconnections among\nall variables, which in a continuous setting guarantees a very stable dynamics.\nIn Part I of this paper we presented a construction that shows that for an\narbitrary constant 0<c<2 and sufficiently large n there exist n-dimensional\nBoolean cooperative networks in which both the indegree and outdegree of each\nfor each variable is bounded by two (bi-quadratic networks) and which\nnevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n.\n  In this part, we prove an inverse result showing that for sufficiently large\nn and for 0<c<2 sufficiently close to 2, any n-dimensional cooperative,\nbi-quadratic Boolean network with a cycle of length at least c^n must have a\nlarge proportion of variables with indegree 1.

In [25] and [26] the\nauthors showed that with the help of a multi-scale analysis stochastic systems\nwith both continuous variables and finite state spaces can be approximated by\ndynamical systems whose leading order time evolution is given by a combination\nof ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and Markov chains.

Observational studies of the blazar sequence have, in\ngeneral, neglected the effect of Doppler boosting.

We\nstart by measuring the distributions of avalanche and transient times in Random\nBoolean Networks (RBNs) and in the \\emph{Drosophila} polarity network by exact\nenumeration. A transient time is the duration of the transient from a starting\nstate to an attractor. An avalanche is a special transient which starts as\nsingle Boolean element perturbation of an attractor state. Significant\ndifferences at short times between the avalanche and the transient times for\nRBNs with small connectivity $K$ -- compared to the number of elements $N$ --\nindicate that attractors tend to cluster in configuration space. In addition,\none bit flip has a non-negligible chance to put an attractor state directly\nonto another attractor. This clustering is also present in the segment polarity\ngene network of \\emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, suggesting that this may be a\nrobust feature of biological regulatory networks. We also define and measure a\nbranching ratio for the state space networks and find evidence for a new time\nscale that diverges roughly linearly with $N$ for $2\\leq K \\ll N$. Analytic\narguments show that this time scale does not appear in the random map nor can\nthe random map exhibit clustering of attractors.

Even for the simplest type of graph representation, this reduction\ncan be done in several ways. We investigate different simple network\nrepresentations by testing how well they encode information about one\nbiologically important network structure -- network modularity (the propensity\nfor edges to be cluster into dense groups that are sparsely connected between\neach other).

It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by\nsimply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much\nharder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating\ntheir similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is\ncomputationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger\nthe number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more\nlikely it is that the networks will truly be similar.\n  We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that\nimposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In\nparticular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of\nnodes 'touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes\n'touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic\nsubgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure\nconsists of 73 graphlet degree distributions (GDDs) of graphlets with 2-5\nnodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e.\ngraphlets).

It is generally expected that as density increases,\nthe electron chemical potential will increase and new degrees of freedom will\nemerge as mu_e becomes comparable to their energy scales. Assuming the\nelectrical neutrality and beta equilibrium for the stellar matter, we have\nstudied how the density dependence of lepton chemical potentials varies for\ndifferent models of nuclear interactions that are constrained by experiments up\nto nuclear matter density, n_0, but extrapolate differently(unconstrained)\nbeyond n_0 and calculated the relative abundances of nucleons(neutron and\nproton) and leptons(electron and muon) and their density dependencies. We find\nthat the density dependence of the electron chemical potential is strongly\ndependent on the structure of the nuclear symmetry energy relevant to\nsoftness/stfness of the nuclear matter EOS that measures the energy relevant to\nthe neutron-proton asymmetry. As a consequence, the relative abundances of\nneutrons, protons, electrons, and muons as well as the kaon condensation are\nstrongly dependent on the nuclear symmetry energy.

The applications include chemical and metabolic systems, food webs as\nwell as social networks. Lately, it was found that many of these networks\ndisplay some common topological features, such as high clustering, small\naverage path length (small world networks) and a power-law degree distribution\n(scale free networks). The topological features of a network are commonly\nrelated to the network's functionality. However, the topology alone does not\naccount for the nature of the interactions in the network and their strength.\nHere we introduce a method for evaluating the correlations between pairs of\nnodes in the network. These correlations depend both on the topology and on the\nfunctionality of the network. A network with high connectivity displays strong\ncorrelations between its interacting nodes and thus features small-world\nfunctionality. We quantify the correlations between all pairs of nodes in the\nnetwork, and express them as matrix elements in the correlation matrix. From\nthis information one can plot the correlation function for the network and to\nextract the correlation length. The connectivity of a network is then defined\nas the ratio between this correlation length and the average path length of the\nnetwork. Using this method we distinguish between a topological small world and\na functional small world, where the latter is characterized by long range\ncorrelations and high connectivity. Clearly, networks which share the same\ntopology, may have different connectivities, based on the nature and strength\nof their interactions. The method is demonstrated on metabolic networks, but\ncan be readily generalized to other types of networks. \n\n"}

We highlight that this\nresult would have profound consequences for both eternal inflation and the\npredictivity of standard inflation. We find a different result. We consider two\nsets of theories: one where the inflaton has a large cubic self-interaction and\none where the inflaton interacts gravitationally with N massless spectator\nscalar fields. We find that there is a logarithmic running but of the form\nlog(H/mu), where H is the Hubble constant during inflation. We find this result\nin three independent ways: by performing the calculation with a sharp cutoff in\nfrequency-momentum space, in dimensional regularization and by the simple\nprocedure of making the loop integral dimensionless.

This information is\ndefined in such a way that a network with random coloration (but keeping the\nrelative number of nodes with different colors the same) has zero color\ninformation content. Thus, colored motif information captures the\nexceptionality of coloring in the motifs that is maintained via selection. We\nstudy the motif information content of the C. elegans brain as well as the\nevolution of colored motif information in networks that reflect the interaction\nbetween instructions in genomes of digital life organisms. While we find that\ncolored motif information appears to capture essential functionality in the C.\nelegans brain (where the color assignment of nodes is straightforward) it is\nnot obvious whether the colored motif information content always increases\nduring evolution, as would be expected from a measure that captures network\ncomplexity.

Adleman, Cheng, Goel,\nand Huang (\"Running Time and Program Size for Self-Assembled Squares\", STOC\n2001) showed how to assemble an n x n square in O(n) time in the seeded aTAM\nusing O(log n / log log n) unique tile types, where both of these parameters\nare optimal. They asked whether the hierarchical aTAM could allow a tile system\nto use the ability to form large assemblies in parallel before they attach to\nbreak the Omega(n) lower bound for assembly time. We show that there is a tile\nsystem with the optimal O(log n / log log n) tile types that assembles an n x n\nsquare using O(log^2 n) parallel \"stages\", which is close to the optimal\nOmega(log n) stages, forming the final n x n square from four n/2 x n/2\nsquares, which are themselves recursively formed from n/4 x n/4 squares, etc.\nHowever, despite this nearly maximal parallelism, the system requires\nsuperlinear time to assemble the square.

Our analysis, based on analytical calculations and\nsimulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene\nexpression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and Weber's\nlaw, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network\nto the host gene. A fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of\nthese functions. Interestingly, they are all related to gene expression\nhomeostasis, in agreement with the increasing evidence suggesting a role of\nmicroRNA regulation in conferring robustness to biological processes. In\naddition to model analysis, we present a list of bioinformatically predicted\ncandidate circuits in human for future experimental tests. Conclusions: The\nresults presented here suggest a potentially relevant functional role for\nnegative self-regulation via intronic microRNAs, in particular as a homeostatic\ncontrol mechanism of gene expression. Moreover, the map of circuit functions in\nterms of experimentally measurable parameters, resulting from our analysis, can\nbe a useful guideline for possible applications in synthetic biology. \n\n"}

Our hypothesis is that an internal\nskeleton may have evolved from a bilaterally symmetric ancestor with an\nexternal skeleton. By growing the organism inside-out an external skeleton\nbecomes an internal skeleton. Our hypothesis is supported by a computational\ntheory of bilateral symmetry that allows us to model and simulate this process.\nInside-out development is achieved by an orientation switch. Given the\ndevelopment of two bilateral founder cells that generate a bilateral organism,\na mutation that reverses the internal mirror orientation of those bilateral\nfounder cells leads to inside-out development. The new orientation is\nepigenetically inherited by all progeny. A key insight is that each cell\ncontained in the newly evolved organism with the internal skeleton develops\naccording to the very same downstream developmental control network that\ndirects the development of its exoskeletal ancestor. The networks and their\ngenomes are are identical, but the interpretation is different because of the\ncell's inverted orientation. The result is inside-out bilateral symmetric\ndevelopment generating an inside-out organism with an internal skeleton. \n\n"}

When exposed to a high-dimensional signal S, a system of interest\ncomputes a representation R of that signal which is then observed through a\nnoisy measurement M. From a large number of signals and measurements, we wish\nto infer the \"filter\" that maps S to R. However, the standard method for\nsolving such problems, likelihood-based inference, requires perfect a priori\nknowledge of the \"noise function\" mapping R to M. In practice such noise\nfunctions are usually known only approximately, if at all, and using an\nincorrect noise function will typically bias the inferred filter. Here we show\nthat, in the large data limit, this need for a pre-characterized noise function\ncan be circumvented by searching for filters that instead maximize the mutual\ninformation I[M;R] between observed measurements and predicted representations.\nMoreover, if the correct filter lies within the space of filters being\nexplored, maximizing mutual information becomes equivalent to simultaneously\nmaximizing every dependence measure that satisfies the Data Processing\nInequality. It is important to note that maximizing mutual information will\ntypically leave a small number of directions in parameter space unconstrained.\nWe term these directions \"diffeomorphic modes\" and present an equation that\nallows these modes to be derived systematically. The presence of diffeomorphic\nmodes reflects a fundamental and nontrivial substructure within parameter\nspace, one that is obscured by standard likelihood-based inference. \n\n"}

A particularly simple and\nelegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and\ncoworkers (Biop. J., 2008).

In this paper, we present a novel method for\ncharacterizing the steady states of mass action systems. Our method explicitly\nlinks a network's capacity to permit a particular class of steady states,\ncalled toric steady states, to topological properties of a related network\ncalled a translated chemical reaction network. These networks share their\nreaction stoichiometries with their source network but are permitted to have\ndifferent complex stoichiometries and different network topologies.

We propose almost blank\nresource block (ABRB) for interference control in HetNet. When an ABRB is\nscheduled in a macro BS, a resource block (RB) with blank payload is\ntransmitted and this eliminates the interference from this macro BS to the pico\nBSs. We study a two timescale hierarchical radio resource management (RRM)\nscheme for HetNet with dynamic ABRB control. The long term controls, such as\ndynamic ABRB, are adaptive to the large scale fading at a RRM server for\nco-Tier and cross-Tier interference control. The short term control (user\nscheduling) is adaptive to the local channel state information within each BS\nto exploit the multi-user diversity. The two timescale optimization problem is\nchallenging due to the exponentially large solution space. We exploit the\nsparsity in the interference graph of the HetNet topology and derive structural\nproperties for the optimal ABRB control.

In many settings, knowledge is\navailable concerning relevant chemical kinetics.

The spatial variation of chromatin density within\nmouse olfactory sensory neurons is determined from soft X-ray tomography\nreconstructions of five nuclei. We show that there is a division of the nuclear\nspace into regions of low-density euchromatin and high-density heterochromatin.\nVolume exclusion experienced by a diffusing protein caused by this varying\ndensity of chromatin is modeled by a repulsive potential. The value of the\npotential at a given point in space is chosen to be proportional to the density\nof chromatin at that location. The constant of proportionality, called the\nvolume exclusivity, provides a model parameter that determines the strength of\nvolume exclusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the mean time for a\nprotein to locate a binding site localized in euchromatin is minimized for a\nfinite, non-zero volume exclusivity. For binding sites in heterochromatin, the\nmean time is minimized when the volume exclusivity is zero (the protein\nexperiences no volume exclusion).

In this formalism the U-duality symmetry of\nM-theory or T-duality symmetry of Type II string theory becomes manifest upon\nextending coordinates that describe a background.\n  The effective potential of Double Field Theory is formulated only up to a\nboundary term and thus does not capture possible topological effects that may\ncome from a boundary. By introducing a generalised normal we derive a\nmanifestly duality covariant boundary term that reproduces the known\nGibbons-Hawking action of General Relativity, if the section condition is\nimposed. It is shown that the full potential can be represented as a sum of the\nscalar potential of gauged supergravity and a topological term that is a full\nderivative.

Traditionally such networks were modeled\ndeterministically, but it is now well-established that when reactant copy\nnumbers are small, the random timing of the reactions create internal noise\nthat can significantly affect the macroscopic properties of the system. To\nunderstand the role of noise and quantify its effects, stochastic models are\nnecessary. In the stochastic setting, the population is described by a\nprobability distribution, which evolves according to a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations known as the Chemical Master Equation (CME). This set is\ninfinite in most cases making the CME practically unsolvable. In many\napplications, it is important to determine if the solution of a CME has a\nglobally attracting fixed point.

GRNs alone cannot explain the evolution of multicellular life in the\nCambrian Explosion. Networks are based on addressing systems which are used to\nconstruct network links. The more complex the network the greater the number of\nlinks and the larger the required address space. It has been assumed that\ncombinations of transcription factors generate a large enough address space to\nform GRNs that are complex enough to control the development of complex\nmulticellular life. However, it is shown in this article that transcription\nfactors do not have sufficient combinatorial power to serve as the basis of an\naddressing system for regulatory control of genomes in the development of\ncomplex organisms. It is proven that given $n$ transcription factor genes in a\ngenome and address combinations of length $k$ then there are at most $n/k$\nk-length transcription factor addresses in the address space. The complexity of\nembryonic development requires a corresponding complexity of control\ninformation in the cell and its genome.

Both PMUs\nand state estimators are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is\ncrucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of an agent\nmaliciously tampering with the data---for both preventing attacks that may lead\nto blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control tasks of current and\nfuture grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme\nbased on Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the Conditional\nCovariance Test (CCT) to learn the structure of the grid. Using the DC power\nflow model, we show that under normal circumstances, and because of\nwalk-summability of the grid graph, the Markov graph of the voltage angles can\nbe determined by the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between\ncalculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Local\ngrid topology is available online from the protection system and we exploit it\nto check for mismatch. Should a mismatch be detected, we use correlation\nanomaly score to detect the set of attacked nodes. Our method can detect the\nmost recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge\nof bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state\nestimator, damaging power network observatory, control, monitoring, demand\nresponse and pricing schemes.

Recent studies in Naked Mole Rat (NMR) and long- lived sea\nurchin showed that the level of gene expression changes with age is lower than\nin other organisms.

Therefore,\nthe lifelong transcriptional stability of an organism may be a key determinant\nof longevity. However, the exact relation between genetic network stability,\nstress-resistance and aging has not been defined. We analyze the stability of a\nsimple genetic- network model of a living organism under the influence of\nexternal and endogenous factors.

But, they then\nevaluate quality of their alignments via some other measure that is different\nthan the node conservation measure used to guide the alignment construction\nprocess. Typically, one measures the amount of conserved edges, but only after\nalignments are produced. Hence, a recent attempt aimed to directly maximize the\namount of conserved edges while constructing alignments, which improved\nalignment accuracy.

To\naddress this question, we examine stability properties of a generic gene\nregulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that many characteristics of aging and\nthe associated population mortality rate emerge as inherent properties of the\ncritical dynamics of gene regulation and metabolic levels. Based on the\nanalysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and metabolic profiles in\nDrosophila melanogaster, we explicitly show that the underlying GRNs are nearly\ncritical and inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as aging in\nthe form of distortion of gene expression and metabolic profiles with age, and\ncauses the characteristic increase in mortality rate with age as described by a\nform of the Gompertz law.

We present a\ntractable biophysical model of global crosstalk, where many genes are\nsimultaneously regulated by many TFs. We show that in the simplest regulatory\nscenario, a lower bound on crosstalk severity can be analytically derived\nsolely from the number of (co)regulated genes and a suitable parameter that\ndescribes binding site similarity.

We develop an experimentally feasible control framework\nfor nonlinear dynamical networks that exhibit multistability (multiple\ncoexisting final states or attractors), which are representative of, e.g., gene\nregulatory networks (GRNs). The control objective is to apply parameter\nperturbation to drive the system from one attractor to another, assuming that\nthe former is undesired and the latter is desired. To make our framework\npractically useful, we consider RESTRICTED parameter perturbation by imposing\nthe following two constraints: (a) it must be experimentally realizable and (b)\nit is applied only temporarily. We introduce the concept of ATTRACTOR NETWORK,\nin which the nodes are the distinct attractors of the system, and there is a\ndirectional link from one attractor to another if the system can be driven from\nthe former to the latter using restricted control perturbation. Introduction of\nthe attractor network allows us to formulate a controllability framework for\nnonlinear dynamical networks: a network is more controllable if the underlying\nattractor network is more strongly connected, which can be quantified. We\ndemonstrate our control framework using examples from various models of\nexperimental GRNs. A finding is that, due to nonlinearity, noise can\ncounter-intuitively facilitate control of the network dynamics. \n\n"}

Here, we use mathematical modeling to show that,\nadditionally, the cell cycle generically influences circadian clocks in a\nnon-specific fashion: The regular, discrete jumps in gene-copy number arising\nfrom DNA replication during the cell cycle cause a periodic driving of the\ncircadian clock, which can dramatically alter its behavior and impair its\nfunction.

This has\nmotivated numerous coarse-grained schemes, where the \"fast\" reactions are\napproximated either using Langevin dynamics or deterministically. While such\napproaches provide a good approximation when all reactants are abundant, the\napproximation breaks down when one or more species exist only in small\nconcentrations and the fluctuations arising from the discrete nature of the\nreactions becomes significant. This is particularly problematic when using such\nmethods to compute statistics of extinction times for chemical species, as well\nas simulating non-equilibrium systems such as cell-cycle models in which a\nsingle species can cycle between abundance and scarcity. In this paper, a\nhybrid jump-diffusion model for simulating well- mixed stochastic kinetics is\nderived. It acts as a bridge between the Gillespie SSA and the chemical\nLangevin equation. For low reactant reactions the underlying behaviour is\npurely discrete, while purely diffusive when the concentrations of all species\nis large, with the two different behaviours coexisting in the intermediate\nregion. A bound on the weak error in the classical large volume scaling limit\nis obtained, and three different numerical discretizations of the\njump-diffusion model are described. The benefits of such a formalism are\nillustrated using computational examples. \n\n"}

Many important interactions are conserved\nacross a large variety of species. The need to maintain interaction leads to a\nhigh degree of co-evolution between residues in the interface between partner\nproteins. The inference of protein-protein interaction networks from the\nrapidly growing sequence databases is one of the most formidable tasks in\nsystems biology today. We propose here a novel approach based on the\nDirect-Coupling Analysis of the co-evolution between inter-protein residue\npairs. We use ribosomal and trp operon proteins as test cases: For the small\nresp. large ribosomal subunit our approach predicts protein-interaction\npartners at a true-positive rate of 70% resp. 90% within the first 10\npredictions, with areas of 0.69 resp. 0.81 under the ROC curves for all\npredictions. In the trp operon, it assigns the two largest interaction scores\nto the only two interactions experimentally known. On the level of residue\ninteractions we show that for both the small and the large ribosomal subunit\nour approach predicts interacting residues in the system with a true positive\nrate of 60% and 85% in the first 20 predictions. We use artificial data to show\nthat the performance of our approach depends crucially on the size of the joint\nmultiple sequence alignments and analyze how many sequences would be necessary\nfor a perfect prediction if the sequences were sampled from the same model that\nwe use for prediction. Given the performance of our approach on the test data\nwe speculate that it can be used to detect new interactions, especially in the\nlight of the rapid growth of available sequence data. \n\n"}

The precision of gradient\nsensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in\nthe gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of\nconcentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests\nthat precision should also increase with detector length in the direction\ntransverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the\nnoise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the\nprecision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest\ngradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason\nis that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured\nconcentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these\nmeasurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between\nthe measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We\ndemonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional\nexcitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the\nbenefit of transverse averaging.

We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random\nbursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle.\nFormulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are\nderived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and\nstochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions\nfrom bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules\nbetween daughter cells. These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off:\ncell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty\nexpression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We\ninvestigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell\ncycle that minimize the stochastic component.

These paths are different in stars with\ndifferent magnetospheres and periods of rotation. External field lines of the\nmagnetosphere may inflate and produce favorable conditions for outflows from\nthe disk-magnetosphere boundary. Outflows can be particularly strong in the\npropeller regime, wherein a star rotates more rapidly than the inner disk.\nOutflows may also form at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of slowly rotating\nstars, if the magnetosphere is compressed by the accreting matter. In isolated,\nstrongly magnetized stars, the magnetic field can influence formation and/or\npropagation of stellar wind outflows.

All moiety conservation relations can be represented as nonnegative\ninteger vectors in the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix\ncorresponding to a biochemical network.

Despite its simple\nstructure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for\nmost systems.

The stationary distributions of CMEs are seldom\nsolvable analytically, and numerical methods typically produce estimates with\nuncontrolled errors. Here, we introduce mathematical programming approaches\nthat yield approximations of these distributions with computable error bounds\nwhich enable the verification of their accuracy. First, we use semidefinite\nprogramming to compute increasingly tighter upper and lower bounds on the\nmoments of the stationary distributions for networks with rational\npropensities.

Its physical interpretation, however, is unclear, although\nit has been used as a metric for the sensing performance of the downstream\nsubsystem.

The stars are surrounded by a\ndebris disk which displays a ring-like morphology and strong asymmetries at\nmultiple scales. We aim at studying the likelihood of a scenario where the\nplanet formed closer to the stars in the disk, underwent inward disk-induced\nmigration, and got scattered away by the binary star before being stabilized by\na close encounter (fly-by). We performed semi-analytical calculations and\nnumerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the\nplanet and the two stars. We accounted for the migration as a simple force. We\nstudied the LCC kinematics to set constraints on the local density of stars,\nand therefore on the fly-by likelihood. We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet.

This motivated the development of conversion methods for\nmultilevel to Boolean models. In particular, Van Ham's method has been shown to\nyield a one-to-one, neighbour and regulation preserving dynamics, making it the\nde facto standard approach to the problem. However, Van Ham's method has\nseveral drawbacks: most notably, it introduces vast regions of \"non-admissible\"\nstates that have no counterpart in the multilevel, original model. This raises\nspecial difficulties for the analysis of interaction between variables and\ncircuit functionality, which is believed to be central to the understanding of\ndynamic properties of logical models.

Methods exist to measure the GO\nsimilarity between two proteins in isolation, but pairs of proteins in a\nnetwork alignment are not isolated: each pairing is implicitly dependent upon\nevery other pairing via the alignment itself. Current methods fail to take into\naccount the frequency of GO terms across the networks, and attempt to account\nfor common GO terms in an ad hoc fashion by imposing arbitrary rules on when to\n\"allow\" GO terms based on their location in the GO hierarchy, rather than using\nreadily available frequency information in the PPI networks themselves. Here we\ndevelop a new measure, NetGO, that naturally weighs infrequent, informative GO\nterms more heavily than frequent, less informative GO terms, without requiring\narbitrary cutoffs. In particular, NetGO down-weights the score of frequent GO\nterms according to their frequency in the networks being aligned.

With the advancement of strand-displacement DNA computing, a large\nclass of abstract biochemical networks may be physically realized using DNA\nmolecules. Methods for systematic design of the abstract systems with\nprescribed behaviors have been predominantly developed at the (less-detailed)\ndeterministic level. However, stochastic effects, neglected at the\ndeterministic level, are increasingly found to play an important role in\nbiochemistry. In such circumstances, methods for controlling the intrinsic\nnoise in the system are necessary for a successful network design at the\n(more-detailed) stochastic level.

First, that the ratio between cell density and\ndilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired\nmetabolic properties invariant across perfusion systems. This conclusion is\nrobust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model\nby the negative feedback loop on cell growth due to toxic byproduct\naccumulation.

Most general results concerning CRNs are limited to restricted\ncases where a topological characteristic known as deficiency takes value 0 or\n1. Here we derive equations of motion for fluctuation moments at all orders for\nstochastic CRNs at general deficiency. We show, for the case of the mass-action\nrate law, that the generator of the stochastic process acts on the hierarchy of\nfactorial moments with a finite representation. Whereas simulation of\nhigh-order moments for many-particle systems is costly, this representation\nreduces solution of moment hierarchies to a complexity comparable to solving a\nheat equation. At steady states, moment hierarchies for finite CRNs interpolate\nbetween low-order and high-order scaling regimes, which may be approximated\nseparately by distributions similar to those for deficiency-0 networks, and\nconnected through matched asymptotic expansions. In CRNs with multiple stable\nor metastable steady states, boundedness of high-order moments provides the\nstarting condition for recursive solution downward to low-order moments,\nreversing the order usually used to solve moment hierarchies.

The metric of net synergy, conceived as the difference between\nsynergistic and redundant information, is capable of detecting synergy,\nredundancy and, information independence among stochastic variables. And it can\nbe quantified, as it is done here, using appropriate combinations of different\nShannon mutual information terms. Utilisation of such a metric in network\nmotifs with the nodes representing different biochemical species, involved in\ninformation sharing, uncovers rich store for interesting results.

However, while\nparticle-based models guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately\ndescribe the microscopic dynamics at very low copy numbers, the algorithms used\nto simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational efficiency\nand accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact\nalgorithm that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system\ninto M<N analytically tractable one- and two-particle systems; the analytical\nsolutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement an event-driven\nparticle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and\nspace while retaining access to their state variables at any moment.

For addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes\nthe approach of two-stream collaborative learning with spatial-temporal\nattention (TCLSTA), which consists of two models: (1) Spatial-temporal\nattention model: The spatial-level attention emphasizes the salient regions in\nframe, and the temporal-level attention exploits the discriminative frames in\nvideo.

Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug\ninteractions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another\ndrug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex\nrelationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small\nclinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an\nimportant challenge with significant implications for patient mortality.

It has been shown that the coherent type-1 feedforward loop with\nan AND logic at the output (or C1-FFL for short) can be used to discriminate a\npersistent input signal from a transient one. This has been done by modelling\nthe C1-FFL, and then use the model to show that persistent and transient input\nsignals give, respectively, a non-zero and zero output. Instead of assuming the\nstructure of C1-FFL, this paper shows that it is possible to deduce the C1-FFL\nmodel from the requirement of discriminating a persistent signal.

A good multiple-network alignment (MNA), by considering the data\nrelated to several species, provides a deep understanding of biological\nnetworks and system-level cellular processes. With the massive amounts of\navailable PPI data and the increasing number of known PPI networks, the problem\nof MNA is gaining more attention in the systems-biology studies.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new scalable and accurate algorithm, called\nMPGM, for aligning multiple networks. The MPGM algorithm has two main steps:\n(i) SEEDGENERATION and (ii) MULTIPLEPERCOLATION. In the first step, to generate\nan initial set of seed tuples, the SEEDGENERATION algorithm uses only protein\nsequence similarities.

This yields a theoretically motivated adaptive\nadvantage to being near the critical value of one, at the boundary between\norder and chaos. Here, we measure average sensitivity for 66 publicly available\nBoolean network models describing the function of gene regulatory circuits\nacross diverse living processes. We find the average sensitivity values for\nthese networks are clustered around unity, indicating they are near critical.\nIn many types of random networks, mean connectivity <K> and the average\nactivity bias of the logic functions <p> have been found to be the most\nimportant network properties in determining average sensitivity, and by\nextension a network's criticality. Surprisingly, many of these gene regulatory\nnetworks achieve the near-critical state with <K> and <p> far from that\npredicted for critical systems: randomized networks sharing the local causal\nstructure and local logic of biological networks better reproduce their\ncritical behavior than controlling for macroscale properties such as <K> and\n<p> alone.

Because experiments can be\ncostly and time-consuming it is desirable to determine experiments providing\nthe most useful information. If a sequence of experiments is to be performed,\nexperimental design is needed to determine the order. A classical approach is\nto maximally reduce the overall uncertainty in the model, meaning maximal\nentropy reduction. A recently proposed method takes into account both model\nuncertainty and the translational objective, for instance, optimal structural\nintervention in gene regulatory networks, where the aim is to alter the\nregulatory logic to maximally reduce the long-run likelihood of being in a\ncancerous state.

Later, in 2014, the notion of a strongly\nendotactic network was introduced in order to generalize the previous results\nfrom weakly reversible networks with a single linkage class to this wider\nfamily of networks. The point of view of this later work was more geometric and\nalgebraic in nature. The notion of strongly endotactic networks was later used\nin 2018 to prove a large deviation principle for a class of stochastically\nmodeled reaction networks.\n  We provide an analytical characterization of strongly endotactic networks in\nterms of tier structures. By doing so, we shed light on the connection between\nthe two points of view, and also make available a new proof technique for the\nstudy of strongly endotactic networks. We show the power of this new technique\nin two distinct ways. First, we demonstrate how the main previous results\nrelated to strongly endotactic networks, both for the deterministic and\nstochastic modeling choices, can be quickly obtained from our characterization.\nSecond, we demonstrate how new results can be obtained by proving that a\nsub-class of strongly endotactic networks, when modeled stochastically, is\npositive recurrent. Finally, and similarly to recent independent work by Agazzi\nand Mattingly, we provide an example which closes a conjecture in the negative\nby showing that stochastically modeled strongly endotactic networks can be\ntransient (and even explosive). \n\n"}

The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of\na delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis\nmore involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic\ntime-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be\nexactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any\ndelay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the\naddition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of\nstochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution\narbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,\ntherefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction\nnetworks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if\nthe non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more\ndifficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results\ntell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their\ndistribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.\nWe also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the\nmoment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared\nto the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed\nstochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is\nconsidered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that\nthe delay-free network satisfy the conditions of ergodicity and\noutput-controllability. \n\n"}

Thus, simpler models\nconsisting of only the dominant subsystems can be assembled into hybrid,\npiecewise smooth models, which approximate the behavior of the initial system.\nBy combining the detection of dominated terms with symbolic bounds propagation,\nwe show how to approximate the original model by an assembly of simpler models,\nconsisting in ordinary differential equations that provide time-dependent lower\nand upper bounds for the concentrations of the initial models species. Our\nmethod provides sound interval bounds for the concentrations of the chemical\nspecies, and hence can serve to evaluate the faithfulness of\ntropicalization-based reduction heuristics for ODE models of biochemical\nreduction systems. The method is tested on several case studies. \n\n"}

These clocks are intrinsically subject to thermal fluctuations, so\nthat the duration of a full oscillation cycle is random. Their success in\ncarrying out their biological function is thought to depend on the degree to\nwhich these fluctuations in the cycle period can be suppressed. Biochemical\noscillators also require a constant supply of free energy in order to break\ndetailed balance and maintain their cyclic dynamics. For a given free energy\nbudget, the recently discovered `thermodynamic uncertainty relation' yields the\nmagnitude of period fluctuations in the most precise conceivable free-running\nclock. In this paper, we show that computational models of real biochemical\nclocks severely underperform this optimum, with fluctuations several orders of\nmagnitude larger than the theoretical minimum. We argue that this suboptimal\nperformance is due to the small number of internal states per molecule in these\nmodels, combined with the high level of thermodynamic force required to\nmaintain the system in the oscillatory phase.

Until recently, most\nstudies have focused on the azimuthal structure of electron vortex beams with\nwell-defined orbital angular momentum. To unambiguously define real\nelectron-beam states and realise them in the laboratory, the radial structure\nmust also be specified. Here we use a specific set of orthonormal modes of\nelectron (vortex) beams to describe both the radial and azimuthal structures of\narbitrary electron wavefronts. The specific beam states are based on truncated\nBessel beams localised within the lens aperture plane of an electron\nmicroscope. We show that their Fourier transform set of beams can be realised\nat the focal planes of the probe-forming lens using a binary computer generated\nelectron hologram. Using astigmatic transformation optics, we demonstrate that\nthe azimuthal indices of the diffracted beams scale with the order of the\ndiffraction through phase amplification. However, their radial indices remain\nthe same as those of the encoding beams for all the odd diffraction orders or\nare reduced to the zeroth order for the even-order diffracted beams.

Abstract: We address the issue of accuracy in recovering density profiles from\nobservations of rotation curves of galaxies. We ``observe'' and analyze our\nmodels in much the same way as observers do the real galaxies. We find that the\ntilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotational\nvelocity. In some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flat\ncore, while in reality it does not. We identify three effects, which explain\nthe systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) bar. The\npresence of even a small non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotation\nvelocity. In the case of a disk with a bar, the underestimate of the circular\nvelocity is larger due to a combination of non-circular motions and random\nvelocities. Signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surface\nbrightness profiles of the model galaxies. The variation of inclination angle\nand isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of bar\npresence than the surface brightness profiles. The systematic biases in the\ncentral ~ 1 kpc of galaxies are not large. Each effect separately gives\ntypically a few kms error, but the effects add up. In some cases the error in\ncircular velocity was a factor of two, but typically we get about 20 percent.\nThe result is the false inference that the density profile of the halo flattens\nin the central parts. Our observations of real galaxies show that for a large\nfraction of galaxies the velocity of gas rotation (as measured by emission\nlines) is very close to the rotation of stellar component (as measured by\nabsorption lines).

We investigate how the systematic\nproperties of BCGs depend on stellar mass and on their privileged location near\nthe cluster center. The groups and clusters that we study are drawn from the C4\ncatalogue of Miller et al.

Since\nthe SDSS photometric pipeline tends to underestimate the luminosities of large\ngalaxies in dense environments, we have developed a correction for this effect\nwhich can be readily applied to the published catalog data. We find that BCGs\nare larger and have higher velocity dispersions than non-BCGs of the same\nstellar mass, which implies that BCGs contain a larger fraction of dark matter.\nIn contrast to non-BCGs, the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of BCGs does not\nvary as a function of galaxy luminosity. Hence BCGs lie on a different\nfundamental plane than ordinary elliptical galaxies. BCGs also follow a steeper\nFaber-Jackson relation than non-BCGs, as suggested by models in which BCGs\nassemble via dissipationless mergers along preferentially radial orbits.

Here we examine a model where the concentrations of p53\nisoforms are regulated by Mdm22, Arf, Siah, and beta-catenin. The extent of DNA\ndamage is signalled through the switch-like activity of a DNA damage sensor,\nthe DNA-dependent protein kinase Atm. This switch is responsible for initiating\nand terminating oscillations in p53 concentration. The strength of the DNA\ndamage signal modulates the number of oscillatory waves of p53 and Mdm22 but\nnot the frequency or amplitude of oscillations{a result that recapitulates\nexperimental findings.

This robustness makes the technique\nuseful in the analysis of molecular biological models in which there is large\nuncertainty regarding the values of kinetic and other parameters. However,\nverifying the conditions needed in order to apply the SGT is not always easy.\nThis paper provides an approach to the verification of the needed properties,\nand illustrates the approach through an application to a classical model of\ncircadian oscillations, as a nontrivial ``case study,'' and also provides a\ntheorem in the converse direction of predicting oscillations when the SGT\nconditions fail. \n\n"}

Mutations\nchange the connections and the functions of the nodes. Our fitness criterion is\nthe robustness of the dynamical attractors against small perturbations. We find\nthat with this fitness criterion the global maximum is always reached and that\nthere is a huge neutral space of 100% fitness.

As with the algorithm in [N. Kashtan\net al., Bioinformatics 20, 1746 (2004)], it provides a weighted sample, but the\ncomputation of the weights is much faster (linear in the size of subgraphs,\ninstead of super-exponential). This allows subgraphs with up to ten or more\nnodes to be sampled with very high statistics, from arbitrarily large networks.\nUsing this together with a heuristic algorithm for rapidly classifying\nisomorphic graphs, we present results for two protein interaction networks\nobtained using the TAP high throughput method: one of Escherichia coli with 230\nnodes and 695 links, and one for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with roughly\nten times more nodes and links. We find in both cases that most connected\nsubgraphs are strong motifs (Z-scores >10) or anti-motifs (Z-scores <-10) when\nthe null model is the ensemble of networks with fixed degree sequence. Strong\ndifferences appear between the two networks, with dominant motifs in E. coli\nbeing (nearly) bipartite graphs and having many pairs of nodes which connect to\nthe same neighbors, while dominant motifs in yeast tend towards completeness or\ncontain large cliques. We also explore a number of methods that do not rely on\nmeasurements of Z-scores or comparisons with null models. For instance, we\ndiscuss the influence of specific complexes like the 26S proteasome in yeast,\nwhere a small number of complexes dominate the $k$-cores with large k and have\na decisive effect on the strongest motifs with 6 to 8 nodes. We also present\nZipf plots of counts versus rank. They show broad distributions that are not\npower laws, in contrast to the case when disconnected subgraphs are included. \n\n"}

Using the framework of\ndeterministic discrete dynamical models, we characterize the dynamical\nmodifications in response to structural perturbations in the network\nconnectivities. In particular, we focus on how perturbations affect the set of\nfixed points and sizes of the basins of attraction. Our approach uses two\nanalytical measures: the basin entropy $H$ and the perturbation size $\\Delta$,\na quantity that reflects the distance between the set of fixed points of the\nperturbed network to that of the unperturbed network. Applying our approach to\nthe yeast-cell cycle network introduced by Li \\textit{et al.} provides a low\ndimensional and informative fingerprint of network behavior under large classes\nof perturbations.

Rate equations are suitable\nwhen the concentrations of the relevant molecules in a cell are large and\nfluctuations are negligible. However, when some of the proteins in the circuit\nappear in low copy numbers, fluctuations become important and the rate\nequations fail. In this case stochastic methods, such as direct numerical\nintegration of the master equation or Monte Carlo simulations are required.\nHere we present deterministic and stochastic simulations of the autorepressor,\nthe switch and the repressilator.

From SIMAP we construct the protein\nhomology network, where the proteins are the nodes and the links represent\nhomology relationships. With more than 5 million nodes and about 70 10^9 edges\nit is the greatest protein homology network ever been builded. We describe the\nbasic features and we perform a global statistical analysis of the network.\nStarting from the Smith-Waterman similarity score, we define for each edge a\nweight w to measure the similarity distance between two nodes. Keeping only\nedges with a weigth greater than a minimal w_min, and by varying w_min we build\na family of networks with different degree of similarity. We investigate the\ndistribution of connected components (clusters) of the networks at different\nw_min and in particular we find a behaviour similar to a phase transition\nguided by the formation of a giant component. Moreover we study selected\nsequence features and protein domains of protein pairs that connect different\nclusters in the networks at different level of similarity.

{"id": "quant-ph/0204104", "contents": "Title: Causal Quantum Theory and the Collapse Locality Loophole Abstract: Causal quantum theory is an umbrella term for ordinary quantum theory\nmodified by two hypotheses: state vector reduction is a well-defined process,\nand strict local causality applies. The first of these holds in some versions\nof Copenhagen quantum theory and need not necessarily imply practically\ntestable deviations from ordinary quantum theory. The second implies that\nmeasurement events which are spacelike separated have no non-local\ncorrelations. To test this prediction, which sharply differs from standard\nquantum theory, requires a precise theory of state vector reduction.\n  Formally speaking, any precise version of causal quantum theory defines a\nlocal hidden variable theory. However, causal quantum theory is most naturally\nseen as a variant of standard quantum theory. For that reason it seems a more\nserious rival to standard quantum theory than local hidden variable models\nrelying on the locality or detector efficiency loopholes.\n  Some plausible versions of causal quantum theory are not refuted by any Bell\nexperiments to date, nor is it obvious that they are inconsistent with other\nexperiments. They evade refutation via a neglected loophole in Bell experiments\n-- the {\\it collapse locality loophole} -- which exists because of the possible\ntime lag between a particle entering a measuring device and a collapse taking\nplace. Fairly definitive tests of causal versus standard quantum theory could\nbe made by observing entangled particles separated by $\\approx 0.1$ light\nseconds. \n\n"}
