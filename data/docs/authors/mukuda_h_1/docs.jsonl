This paper demonstrates, using a combination of new ARPES measurements\nand quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product\nof matrix element effects, but rather represents a cross-over from a\nquasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence\nbands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in\nboth hole- and electron-doped cuprates.

The first paradox concerns the\napparent non-existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket.

One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics.

Recently, the importance of phase fluctuation of\nthe superconducting order parameter has gained significant support from various\nexperiments. However, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the\nsurprisingly soft phase remains one of the most important unsolved puzzles.\nHere, opposite to the standard BCS starting point, we propose a simple,\nsolvable low-energy model in the strong coupling limit, which maps the\nsuperconductivity literally into a well-understood physics of superfluid in a\nspecial dilute bosonic system of local pairs of doped holes. In the\nprototypical material (La$_{1-\\delta}$Sr$_\\delta$)$_2$CuO$_4$, without use of\nany free parameter, a $d$-wave superconductivity is obtained for doping above\n$\\sim 5.2\\%$, below which unexpected incoherent $p$-wave pairs dominate.\nThroughout the whole underdoped region, very soft phases are found to originate\nfrom enormous mass enhancement of the pairs.

Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave\nsuperconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor, and (b)\npair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction.\nAs is now well known, such systems in the form of a 2D film or 1D nano-wires in\na wire-network can be used for topological quantum computation. When the\nexternal Zeeman splitting $\\Gamma$ crosses a critical value $\\Gamma_c$, the\nsystem passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological\nsuperconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) we consider in this paper the\npair potential $\\Delta$ is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the\ntopological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological\nquantum critical point at $\\Gamma_c = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\mu^2}$, where $\\mu (>>\n\\Delta)$ is the chemical potential. On the other hand, since $\\Gamma_c >>\n\\Delta$, the Zeeman splitting required for the topological phase ($\\Gamma >\n\\Gamma_c$) far exceeds the value ($\\Gamma \\sim \\Delta$) above which an s-wave\npair potential is expected to vanish (and the system to become\nnon-superconducting) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling.

In this paper we address the question of how a\npure s-wave pair potential can survive a strong Zeeman field to give rise to a\ntopological superconducting phase.

Other ways of probing the HO are via\nRh-doping and very large magnetic fields.

An overall phase diagram for\nthe alkaline iron selenides has been proposed, in which the orbital-selective\nMott phase connects between the superconducting phase and the Mott-insulating\nparent state. \n\n"}

Band insulators and superfluids are,\nhowever, fundamentally different: while the former exist in the absence of\ninter-particle interactions, the latter are broken symmetry states that owe\ntheir very existence to such interactions. In particular, unlike the static\nenergy gap of a band insulator, the gap in a superfluid is due to a dynamical\norder parameter that is subject to both thermal and quantum fluctuations. In\nthis work, we explore the consequences of bulk quantum fluctuations of the\norder parameter in the $B$ phase of superfluid $^3$He on the topologically\nprotected Majorana surface states. Neglecting the high-energy amplitude modes,\nwe find that one of the three spin-orbit Goldstone modes in $^3$He-$B$ couples\nto the surface Majorana fermions.

The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates. The answer lies in the key observation that strings which are 1-d\nobjects can be used to describe physics in $d$ dimensions.

As the Mott phase is approached, the core size as defined\nfrom the supercurrent diverges, the coupling between superflow and\nquasiparticles vanishes, and the magnitude of the nondissipative time\nderivative dramatically increases. The dissipation due to a moving vortex is\nfound to vary as the third power of the doping. The upper critical field and\nthe size of the critical regime in which paraconductivity may be observed are\nestimated, and found to be controlled by the supercurrent length scale. \n\n"}

The model describes two kinds of hole states localized\neither inside the stripes or in the antiferromagnetic domains between the\nstripes. The characteristic energy difference between these two kinds of states\nis identified with the pseudogap.

The model predictions for the\ntunneling characteristics and for the dependence of the critical temperature on\nthe superfluid density show good quantitative agreement with a number of\nexperiments.

In this article, we review\nthese recent developments. Following a description of the real-space DMRG\nmethod, we discuss the key steps that were undertaken to modify it for use on\nfinite Fermi systems and then describe its applications to Quantum Chemistry,\nultrasmall superconducting grains, finite nuclei and two-dimensional electron\nsystems. We also describe a recent development which permits symmetries to be\ntaken into account consistently throughout the DMRG algorithm. We close with an\noutlook for future applications of the method. \n\n"}

The\nsame requirement applied to a non-relativistic particle with odd degrees of\nfreedom gives rise to supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Coupling classical\nnon-relativistic superparticle to a `U(1) gauge field', one can arrive at the\nquantum dynamical supersymmetry. This consists in supersymmetry appearing at\nspecial values of the coupling constant characterizing interaction of a system\nof boson and fermion but disappearing in a free case. Possible relevance of\nthis phenomenon to high-temperature superconductivity is speculated. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0702032", "contents": "Title: Two-level systems driven by large-amplitude fields Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a two-level system subject to driving by\nlarge-amplitude external fields, focusing on the resonance properties in the\ncase of driving around the region of avoided level crossing. In particular, we\nconsider three main questions that characterize resonance dynamics: (1) the\nresonance condition, (2) the frequency of the resulting oscillations on\nresonance and (3) the width of the resonance. We identify the regions of\nvalidity of different approximations. In a large region of the parameter space,\nwe use a geometric picture in order to obtain both a simple understanding of\nthe dynamics and quantitative results. The geometric approach is obtained by\ndividing the evolution into discrete time steps, with each time step described\nby either a phase shift on the basis states or a coherent mixing process\ncorresponding to a Landau-Zener crossing. We compare the results of the\ngeometric picture with those of a rotating-wave approximation. We also comment\nbriefly on the prospects of employing strong driving as a useful tool to\nmanipulate two-level systems. \n\n"}
