Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

This result\nnot only supports the earlier finding that the azimuthal and polar widths of\nthese subbeams narrow with distance (as R^(-3) and R^(-1), respectively), but\nalso implies that the boundary contribution to the solution of the wave\nequation governing the radiation field does not always vanish in the limit\nwhere the boundary tends to infinity. There is a fundamental difference between\nthe classical expressions for the retarded potential and field: while the\nboundary contribution for the potential can always be made zero via a gauge\ntransformation preserving the Lorenz condition, that for the field may be\nneglected only if it diminishes with distance faster than the contribution of\nthe source density in the far zone. In the case of a rotating superluminal\nsource, however, the boundary term in the retarded solution for the field is by\na factor of order R^(1/2) larger than the source term of this solution in the\nlimit, which explains why an argument based on the solution of the wave\nequation governing the field that neglects the boundary term (such as that\npresented by J.

Given\nthat the distribution of the radiation field of an accelerated superluminal\nsource in the far zone is not known a priori, the only way to calculate the\nfree-space radiation field of such sources is via the retarded solution for the\npotential.

Abstract: Most multi-planetary systems are characterized by hot-Jupiters close to their\ncentral star, moving on eccentric orbits. From a dynamical point of view,\ncompact multi-planetary systems form a specific class of the general N-body\nproblem (where N>=3). Moreover, extrasolar planets are found in prograde orbits\nabout their host star, and often in mean motion resonances (MMR). In a first\nstep, we study theoretically a new stabilizing mechanism suitable for compact\ntwo-planet systems. This mechanism involves counter-revolving orbits forming a\nretrograde MMR. In a second step, we investigate the feasibility of planetary\nsystems hosting counter-revolving planets. Dynamical stability, observations,\nand formation processes of these systems are analyzed and discussed. To\ncharacterize the dynamical behavior of multi-dimensional planetary systems, we\napply our technique of global dynamics analysis based on the MEGNO indicator\n(Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) that provides the fine\nstructure of the phase space. In a few cases of possible counter-revolving\nconfigurations, we carry out new fits to the observations using the Pikaia\ngenetic algorithm.

Canonical understanding of the radio gaps invokes either blocking of\nthe back-flowing lobe plasma by the denser interstellar medium (ISM) of the\nhost galaxy, or \"squeezing\" of the radio bridge in the middle through buoyancy\nforce exerted by either the ISM or the surrounding intra-cluster medium (ICM).\nThese pictures encounter difficulties in explaining situations where the\nsharp-edged radio gaps associated with non-cluster radio galaxies have widths\nrunning into several tens (even hundreds) of kiloparsecs.

High resolution observations of the rotation curves for dark\nmatter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that galactic dark\nmatter halos have a density profile with a flat central core, whereas N-body\nstructure formation simulations predict a divergent (cuspy) density profile at\nthe center. It has been proposed that this problem can be resolved by stellar\nfeedback driving turbulent gas motion that erases the initial cusp. However,\nstrong gravitational lensing prefers a cuspy density profile for galactic\nhalos. In this paper, we use the most recent high resolution observations of\nthe rotation curves of LSB galaxies to fit the core size as a function of halo\nmass, and compare the resultant lensing probability to the observational\nresults for the well defined combined sample of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey\n(CLASS) and Jodrell Bank/Very Large Array Astrometric Survey (JVAS).

The very steep emissivity index is created predominantly by the\ntorque exerted at the inner edge of the disc.

In contrast to many previously\npublished studies, our approach allows us to include returning radiation that\nis deflected by the strong-field gravity of the BH and scatters off of the disk\nbefore reaching a distant observer. Although carrying a relatively small\nfraction of the total observed flux, the scattered radiation tends to be highly\npolarized and in a direction perpendicular to the direct radiation.

Thus it has characteristics similar to those of\nz~2 submm galaxies (SMGs), with a mix of starburst and obscured AGN signatures.\nThis demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restricted\nto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) QSOs at z~5, but was also\noccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the Universe was less than\n10% of its current age.

Given a hydrodynamic\nsimulation of a galaxy, this model can calculate a realistic 2-dimensional\nultraviolet--submillimeter spectral energy distribution of the galaxy,\nincluding emission lines from HII regions, from any viewpoint. To model the\nemission from star-forming regions, the MAPPINGSIII photoionization code is\nused.

Using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of disc\ngalaxies, the output broad-band images and spectral energy distributions are\ncompared with observed galaxies from the multiwavelength SINGS and SLUGS galaxy\nsurveys.

This linear response\nframework is used to investigate both the importance of quantum backreaction\nand the validity of the semi-classical approximation in cosmology. The full\nvariation of the stress tensor, delta T^a_b contains two kinds of terms: (1)\nthose that depend explicitly upon the linearized metric variation delta g_{cd}\nthrough the [T^a_b, T^{cd}] causal response function; and (2) state dependent\nvariations, independent of delta g_{cd}.

A core of initial radius 1-1.5 pc\nevolves to a size of approximately 0.5 pc after 10 Gyr, roughly the size of the\nobserved core. The absence of a Bahcall-Wolf cusp is naturally explained in\nthese models, without the need for fine-tuning or implausible initial\nconditions. In the absence of a cusp, the time for a 10-solar-mass black hole\nto spiral in to the Galactic center from an initial distance of 5 pc can be\nmuch greater than 10 Gyr. Assuming that the stellar black holes had the same\nphase-space distribution initially as the stars, their density after 5-10 Gyr\nis predicted to rise very steeply going into the stellar core, but could remain\nsubstantially below the densities inferred from steady-state models that\ninclude a steep density cusp in the stars.

Abstract: For any assumed stellar Initial Mass Function, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) gives a precise determination of the stellar mass function of galaxies\nfor 10^8 M_sun < M_* < 10^12 M_sun. Within the concordance LCDM cosmology, the\nMillennium simulations give a precise halo mass function for all halos within\nwhich galaxies can form. Under the plausible hypothesis that the stellar mass\nof a galaxy is an increasing function of the maximum mass ever attained by its\nhalo, these combine to give halo mass as a function of stellar mass. The result\nagrees quite well with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a function\nof stellar mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal and\nthe satellite dynamics of SDSS galaxies. For M_* ~ 5.5 x 10^10 M_sun, the\nstellar mass usually assumed for the Milky Way, the implied halo mass is ~ 2 x\n10^12 M_sun, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences from\nthe MW/M31 Timing Argument. The fraction of the baryons associated with each\nhalo which are present as stars in its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20%\nat masses somewhat below that of the Milky Way, and falls rapidly at both\nhigher and lower masses. These conversion efficiencies are lower than in almost\nall recent high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that these\nare not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxy\npopulation. When inserted in the Millennium-II Simulation, our derived relation\nbetween stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass autocorrelation\nfunction in excellent agreement with that measured directly in the SDSS.

The remaining three disk\nmaser candidates were identified in monitoring of known sources: NGC449,\nNGC2979, NGC3735. We also confirm a previously marginal case in UGC4203. For\nthe disk maser candidates reported here, inferred rotation speeds are 130-500\nkms^{-1}.

The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry.

Abstract: Luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs) are a diverse class of galaxies\ncharacterized by high luminosities, blue colors, and high surface brightnesses.\nResiding at the high luminosity, high mass end of the blue sequence, LCBGs sit\nat the critical juncture of galaxies that are evolving from the blue to the red\nsequence. Yet we do not understand what drives the evolution of LCBGs, nor how\nthey will evolve. Based on single-dish HI observations, we know that they have\na diverse range of properties. LCBGs are HI-rich with M(HI)=10^{9-10.5} M(sun),\nhave moderate M(dyn)=10^{10-12} M(sun), and 80% have gas depletion timescales\nless than 3 Gyr. These properties are consistent with LCBGs evolving into\nlow-mass spirals or high mass dwarf ellipticals or dwarf irregulars. However,\nLCBGs do not follow the Tully-Fisher relation, nor can most evolve onto it,\nimplying that many LCBGs are not smoothly rotating, virialized systems. GMRT\nand VLA HI maps confirm this conclusion revealing signatures of recent\ninteractions and dynamically hot components in some local LCBGs, consistent\nwith the formation of a thick disk or spheroid. Such signatures and the high\nincidence of close companions around LCBGs suggest that star formation in local\nLCBGs is likely triggered by interactions. The dynamical masses and apparent\nspheroid formation in LCBGs combined with previous results from optical\nspectroscopy are consistent with virial heating being the primary mechanism for\nquenching star formation in these galaxies. \n\n"}

The observed high-z LGRB\nrate shows significant excess over that estimated from the star formation\nhistory. We investigate what may be responsible for this high productivity of\nGRBs at high-z through Monte Carlo simulations, with effective Swif/BAT trigger\nand redshift detection probabilities based on current Swift/BAT sample and\nCGRO/BATSE LGRB sample. We compare our simulations to the Swift observations\nvia log N-log P, peak luminosity (L) and redshift distributions. In the case\nthat LGRB rate is purely proportional to the star formation rate (SFR), our\nsimulations poorly reproduce the LGRB rate at z>4, although the simulated log\nN-log P distribution is in good agreement with the observed one. Assuming that\nthe excess of high-z GRB rate is due to the cosmic metallicity evolution or\nunknown LGRB rate increase parameterized as (1+z)^delta, we find that although\nthe two scenarios alone can improve the consistency between our simulations and\nobservations, incorporation of them gives much better consistency.

The generalized shear term represents\nparticles' memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories and\ndepends on the inertial particle pair dispersion backward in time. The\nimportance of this backward dispersion in determining the particle relative\nvelocity is emphasized. We find that our model with a two-phase separation\nbehavior, an early ballistic phase and a later tracer-like phase, as found by\nrecent simulations for the forward (in time) dispersion of inertial particle\npairs, gives good fits to the measured relative speeds from simulations at low\nReynolds numbers. In the monodisperse case with identical particles, the\ngeneralized acceleration term vanishes and the relative velocity is determined\nby the generalized shear term. At large Reynolds numbers, our model gives a\n$St^{1/2}$ dependence of the relative velocity on the Stokes number $St$ in the\ninertial range for both the ballistic behavior and the Richardson separation\nlaw.

Abstract: While Bayesian model selection is a useful tool to discriminate between\ncompeting cosmological models, it only gives a relative rather than an absolute\nmeasure of how good a model is. Bayesian doubt introduces an unknown benchmark\nmodel against which the known models are compared, thereby obtaining an\nabsolute measure of model performance in a Bayesian framework. We apply this\nnew methodology to the problem of the dark energy equation of state, comparing\nan absolute upper bound on the Bayesian evidence for a presently unknown dark\nenergy model against a collection of known models including a flat LambdaCDM\nscenario. We find a strong absolute upper bound to the Bayes factor B between\nthe unknown model and LambdaCDM, giving B < 3.

The recent Fermi-LAT\nobservations of prompt GeV emission from several bright GRBs have leaded to\nconclusions of unexpectedly large LFs, $\\Gamma>10^3$. Here we revisit this\nproblem with two main concerns. (1) With one-zone assumption where all photons\nare assumed to be generated in the same region (radius) and time, we {\\em\nself-consistently} calculate the $\\gamma\\gamma$ optical depth by adopting a\ntarget photon spectrum with HE cutoff. We find that this might be important\nwhen the GRB LF is below a few hundreds. (2) Recent Fermi-LAT observations\nsuggest that the bulk MeV-range and HE ($\\ga100$ MeV) emission may arise from\ndifferent regions.

The time-averaged continuum emission is\nwell fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index Gamma = 1.75 and from\nconsideration of the Fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be\n350 keV < E < 25 MeV. Line emission from both near-neutral iron K_alpha at 6.39\nkeV and highly ionised iron, from Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi), is strongly detected\nin the Suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observations\nwith Chandra and XMM-Newton. We find the centroid energies for the Fe_(xxv) and\nFe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 keV and 6.95 keV respectively, with the latter\nappearing to be resolved in the Suzaku spectrum. We show that the Fe_(xxv) and\nFe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of column\ndensity N_(H) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). A Compton reflection component, e.g.,\noriginating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a Compton-thick torus,\nappears either very weak or absent in this AGN, subtending < 1 sr to the X-ray\nsource, consistent with previous findings. Indeed the absence of either neutral\nor ionised Compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic Fe K\nsignatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretion\ndisc is absent in this source. Instead, the accretion disc could be truncated\nwith the inner regions perhaps replaced by a Compton-thin Radiatively\nInefficient Accretion Flow.

Without outflows, our simulations fail\nto yield enough wide DLAs, as in previous studies. With outflows, predicted DLA\nkinematics are in much better agreement with observations.

In this model, DLAs typically arise a few kpc away from galaxies that\nwould be identified in emission. Narrow DLAs can arise from any halo and galaxy\nmass, but wide ones only arise in halos with mass >10^11 Mo, from either large\ncentral or small satellite galaxies.

Rotationally induced mixing in the MS progenitors of the\nsupergiants may be a significant cause of the nitrogen excesses. When comparing\nour results with predictions of the theory developed for stars with the mixing,\nwe find that the bulk of the supergiants (28 of 30) show the N enrichment that\ncan be expected (i) either after the MS phase for stars with the initial\nrotational velocities v0 = 200-400 km s-1, (ii) or after the first dredge-up\nfor stars with v0 = 50-400 km s-1.

We suggest that synchrotron\nemission of 10 - 100 TeV electrons and positrons (e+/-) can contribute to this\nemission, because starbursts have strong magnetic fields. We consider three\nsources of e+/- at these energies: (1) primary electrons directly accelerated\nby supernova remnants; (2) pionic secondary e+/- created by inelastic\ncollisions between CR protons and gas nuclei in the dense ISMs of starbursts;\n(3) pair e+/- produced between the interactions between 10 - 100 TeV gamma-rays\nand the intense far-infrared (FIR) radiation fields of starbursts. We create\none-zone steady-state models of the CR population in the Galactic Center (R <=\n112 pc), NGC 253, M82, and Arp 220's nuclei, assuming a power law injection\nspectrum for electrons and protons. We compare these models to extant radio and\nGeV and TeV gamma-ray data for these starbursts, and calculate the diffuse\nsynchrotron X-ray and Inverse Compton (IC) luminosities of these starbursts. If\nthe primary electron spectrum extends to ~PeV energies and has a\nproton/electron injection ratio similar to the Galactic value, we find that\nsynchrotron contributes 2 - 20% of their unresolved, diffuse hard X-ray\nemission. Inverse Compton emission is likewise a minority of the unresolved\nX-ray emission in these starbursts, from 0.1% in the Galactic Center to 10% in\nArp 220's nuclei. We also model generic starbursts, including submillimeter\ngalaxies, in the context of the FIR--X-ray relation, finding that up to 2% in\nthe densest starbursts with our fiducial assumptions. Neutrino and TeV\ngamma-ray data can further constrain the synchrotron X-ray emission of\nstarbursts.

This explains the surprisingly low\nattenuation observed for distant blazars, because the production of secondary\ngamma rays occurs, on average, much closer to Earth than the distance to the\nsource.

Understanding the EoR is difficult since whilst it is galaxy\nevolution which drives reionization, reionization itself influences galaxy\nevolution through feedback effects. Unraveling the interplay of reionization\nand galaxy evolution is further complicated by of a lack of understanding of\nthe metal enrichment and dust distribution in high redshift galaxies. To this\nend, a class of galaxies called Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) have been gaining\nenormous popularity as probes of all these three processes.

For\ngalactic black hole X-ray binaries XMM-Newton spectra during hard state also\nreveal the presence of a relativistic iron emission line and a thermal\ncomponent, interpreted as an indication for a weak inner cool accretion disk\nunderneath a hot corona. These thermal components were found after the\ntransition from soft to hard spectral state and can be understood as sustained\nby re-condensation of gas from an advection-dominated flow (ADAF) onto the\ndisk. In view of the similarity of accretion flows around stellar mass and\nsupermassive black holes we discuss whether the broad iron emission lines in\nSeyfert 1 AGN can be understood as arising from a similar accretion flow\ngeometry. We derive Eddington-scaled accretion rates for Seyfert galaxies with\nstrong lines in samples of Miller (2007) and Nandra et al. (2007).

We designate this region as the star forming (SF) disk, in which metals\nare produced from supernova explosions (SNexp) while at the same time inflows\nare driven by SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the SMBHs. In\nthis paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection\nis established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk.\nWe find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different\npositions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves\nfor steady-state AGNs. Metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can be\nused as a probe of the SF disk age during one episode of SMBH activity.

The V-I vs I-K' colour-colour\ndiagram is found to break the age-metallicity degeneracy present in optical\ncolours, as I-K' primarily measures a populations' metallicity and is\nrelatively insensitive, unlike optical spectroscopy, to the effect of hot\nhorizontal branch (HB) stars, known to be present in massive old GCs. We derive\nGCs' photometric age, Z and masses. In general, metal-poor ([Z/H]<-0.7dex) GCs\nare older than more metal-rich GCs. For the most massive GCs (M>6x10^5 M_sol)\nin NGC 3610 with available spectroscopic data, photometric ages are older by ~2\nGyr, and this difference is more pronounced for the metal-poor GCs. However,\nphotometric and spectroscopic metallicities are in good agreement.

Abstract: The presence of 6Li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars is usually\ninferred from the detection of a subtle extra depression in the red wing of the\n7Li doublet line at 670.8 nm. However, the intrinsic line asymmetry caused by\nconvective flows in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishable\nfrom the asymmetry produced by a weak 6Li blend on a (presumed) symmetric 7Li\nprofile. Previous determinations of the 6Li/ 7Li isotopic ratio based on 1D\nmodel atmospheres, ignoring the convection-induced line asymmetry, must\ntherefore be considered as upper limits. By comparing synthetic 1D LTE and 3D\nnon-LTE line profiles of the Li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differential\neffect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6Li abundance as a\nfunction of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. As expected, we\nfind that the asymmetry effect systematically reduces the resulting 6Li/7Li\nratios. Depending on the stellar parameters, the 3D-1D offset in 6Li/7Li ranges\nbetween -0.005 and -0.020.

The power spectrum has a small\noscillatory component that does not decay away during inflation, with a period\nset approximately by the light-crossing time of the compact dimension(s). Since\nthe ingredients are fluxes threading compact dimensions, this mechanism fits\nnaturally into the string landscape, but does not appear to suffer from the eta\nproblem or require fine-tuning (beyond the usual anthropic requirement of small\nvacuum energy after reheating). \n\n"}

In the proposed scenario, the plateau state is caused by a strong wind\ngenerated by the heating of the star atmosphere by nonthermal particles\naccelerated at the jet-star interaction region. The flare itself could be\nproduced by a few clouds of matter lost by the red giant after the initial\nimpact of the jet.

The\nvelocity dispersions and stacked particle velocity distributions of the parent\ndark matter (DM) halos are compared to the corresponding cluster dispersions\nand galaxy velocity distribution. We find a clear bias between the halo and the\nsemi-analytic galaxy cluster velocity dispersion on the order of sigma gal /\nsigma DM = 0.87-0.95 and a distinct difference in the stacked galaxy and DM\nparticle velocity distribution.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of linking the\ncircular velocity of galaxies, as determined from the Fundamental Plane and\nTully-Fisher relations, to the slope of the IMF with parameterizations guided\nby several of these studies. For each empirical relation, we generate stellar\nmasses of ~600,000 SDSS galaxies at z ~ 0.1, by fitting the optical photometry\nto large suites of synthetic stellar populations that sample the full range of\ngalaxy parameters. We generate stellar mass functions and examine the\nstellar-to-halo mass relations using sub-halo abundance matching. At the\nmassive end, the stellar mass functions become a power law, instead of the\nfamiliar exponential decline. As a result, it is a generic feature of these\nmodels that the central galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation is significantly\nflatter at high masses (slope ~ -0.3 to -0.4) than in the case of a universal\nIMF (slope ~ -0.6). We find that regardless of whether the IMF varies\nsystematically in all galaxies or just early types, there is still a\nwell-defined peak in the central stellar-to-halo mass ratio at halo masses of ~\n10E12 solar masses. In general, the IMF variations explored here lead to\nsignificantly higher integrated stellar densities if the assumed dependence on\ncircular velocity applies to all galaxies, including late-types; in fact the\nmore extreme cases can be ruled out, as they imply an unphysical situation in\nwhich the stellar fraction exceeds the universal baryon fraction. \n\n"}

This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source\nluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases which\ncould affect conclusions in studies. METHODS. We study IR-selected AGN in the\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey (COSMOS).\nThe AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into\nunobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical\nspectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic\nluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take\nthe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different\nmethods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies,\nwe also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing\nsource AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population\n(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing\nobscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of the\nobscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted\ntype-1/type-2 classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN\nIR-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured AGN, but only at\nintermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN IR-selection\nis more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are\nintrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in\nmore type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is.

The pulse reaches\nmaximum intensity at the Peak Plateau, then undergoes a Rapid Decay. The decay\ngradually slows into an Extended Tail.

The inner boundary of the\nsimulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is\nresolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined\nself-consistently. In analogy to previous works, we assume that the specific\nangular momentum of the galaxy is low. It is well-known that when the accretion\nrates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion\nmodes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes,\nrespectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than\nthat from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher Compton\ntemperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according to\nprevious theoretical works. Such a difference of the Compton temperature\nbetween the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected in\nprevious works. Significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found\nas a result of the stronger Compton heating and accretion becomes more chaotic.\nMore importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth\nand AGN duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored model\nparameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with\ndecreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being $\\simeq 10^{-3.5}$) and\nX-ray Compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although models\nwith fixed mechanical efficiency and Compton temperature can be found that are\nsatisfactory as well.

Among the halo-based method, we further consider two different schemes\nthat aim at reproducing the observed properties of DLAs by distributing HI\ninside halos: one of this results in a much higher bias for DLAs, in agreement\nwith recent observations, which boosts the 21 cm power spectrum by a factor\n$\\sim 4$ with respect to the other recipe. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum\nfrom the simulated HI distribution and calculate the expected signal for both\nSKA1-mid and SKA1-low configurations at $2.4 \\leq z \\leq 4$. We find that SKA\nwill be able to detect the 21 cm power spectrum, in the non-linear regime, up\nto $k\\sim 1\\,h$/Mpc for SKA1-mid and $k\\sim 5\\,h$/Mpc for SKA1-low with 100\nhours of observations.

Abstract: The success of precision cosmology depends not only on accurate observations,\nbut also on the theoretical model - which must be understood to at least the\nsame level of precision. Subtle relativistic effects can lead to biased\nmeasurements if they are neglected. One such effect gives a systematic shift in\nthe distance-redshift relation away from its background value, due to the non-\nlinear relativistic conservation of total photon flux. We also show directly\nhow this shift follows from a fully relativistic analysis of the geodesic\ndeviation equation. We derive the expectation value of the shift using\nsecond-order perturbations about a concordance background, and show that the\ndistance to last scattering is increased by 1%. We argue that neglecting this\nshift could lead to a significant bias in the background cosmological\nparameters, because it alters the meaning of the background model. A naive\nadjustment of CMB parameter estimation if this shift is really a correction to\nthe background would raise the H0 value inferred from the CMB by 5%,\npotentially removing the tension with local measurements of H0. Other CMB\nparameters which depend on the distance would also be shifted by ~1sigma when\ncombined with local H0 data. While our estimations rely on a simplistic\nanalysis, they nevertheless illustrate that accurately defining the background\nmodel in terms of the expectation values of observables is critical when we aim\nto determine the model parameters at the sub-percent level. \n\n"}

In this study, we\ncalculate mass flux of the outward motion of compact grains and porous dust\naggregates by the radiation pressure. The radiation pressure force for porous\ndust aggregates is calculated using the T-Matrix Method for the Clusters of\nSpheres.

Abstract: An increasing number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are\ndiscovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light\ncurves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability\nmechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up\nto Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether\nPISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light\ncurve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of\nmacroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting\nobservational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN\nevolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova\nevolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The\ngreatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an\nextreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the\nhydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of\nchemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric\ntemperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider\nrange of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light\ncurves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two\nwell-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme\nchemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore,\nalternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still\nto be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe. \n\n"}

Abstract: Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous\ninfrared galaxies identified by the WISE mission from their very red mid-IR\ncolors, and characterized by hot dust temperatures ($T>60~\\rm K$). Several\nstudies have shown clear evidence that the IR emission in these objects is\npowered by a highly dust-obscured AGN that shows close to Compton-thick\nabsorption at X-ray wavelengths. Thanks to the high AGN obscuration, the host\ngalaxy is easily observable, and has UV/optical colors usually consistent with\nthose of a normal galaxy. Here we discuss a sub-population of 8 Hot DOGs that\nshow enhanced rest-frame UV/optical emission. We discuss three scenarios that\nmight explain the excess UV emission: (i) unobscured light leaked from the AGN\nby reflection over the dust or by partial coverage of the accretion disk; (ii)\na second unobscured AGN in the system; or (iii) a luminous young starburst.\nX-ray observations can help discriminate between these scenarios. We study in\ndetail the blue excess Hot DOG WISE J020446.13-050640.8, which was\nserendipitously observed by Chandra/ACIS-I for 174.5 ks. The X-ray spectrum is\nconsistent with a single, hyper-luminous, highly absorbed AGN, and is strongly\ninconsistent with the presence of a secondary unobscured AGN. Based on this, we\nargue that the excess blue emission in this object is most likely either due to\nreflection or a co-eval starburst. We favor the reflection scenario as the\nunobscured star-formation rate needed to power the UV/optical emission would be\n$\\gtrsim 1000~\\rm M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$. Deep polarimetry observations could\nconfirm the reflection hypothesis. \n\n"}

This has long been\nthought to be due to the high-ionization lines of the BLR arising in a wind of\nwhich the far side of the outflow is blocked from our view by the accretion\ndisc. Evidence for and against the disc-wind model is discussed. The biggest\nproblem for the model is that velocity-resolved reverberation mapping\nrepeatedly fails to show the expected kinematic signature of outflow of the\nBLR. The disc-wind model also cannot readily reproduce the red side of the line\nprofiles of high-ionization lines.

Unlike GS3, GSS carries out the physical modeling on the server\nside in Java, and communicates with the JavaScript and HTML client via an\nasynchronous HTTP request. I also describe other improvements beyond GS3 such\nas more realistic modeling physics and use of the HTML <canvas> element for\nhigher quality plotting and rendering of results, and include a comparison to\nPhoenix modeling. I also present LineListServer, a Java code for converting\ncustom ASCII line lists in NIST format to the byte data type file format\nrequired by GSS so that users can prepare their own custom line lists. I\npropose a standard for marking up and packaging model atmosphere and spectrum\nsynthesis output for data transmission and storage that will facilitate a\nweb-based approach to stellar atmospheric modeling and spectrum synthesis.

In particular, we\ndiscuss how molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the\nproperties of astromaterials to interpret observations of white dwarfs and\nneutron stars.

Improving RAVE red giants spectroscopy using\n  asteroseismology from K2 Campaign 1 Abstract: We present a set of 87 RAVE stars with detected solar like oscillations,\nobserved during Campaign 1 of the K2 mission (RAVE K2-C1 sample). This dataset\nprovides a useful benchmark for testing the gravities provided in RAVE Data\nRelease 4 (DR4), and is key for the calibration of the RAVE Data Release 5\n(DR5).

Our strategy\nensures highly consistent values among all stellar parameters, leading to more\naccurate chemical abundances. A comparison of the chemical abundances obtained\nhere with and without the use of seismic log(g) information has shown that an\nunderestimated (overestimated) gravity leads to an underestimated\n(overestimated) elemental abundance (e.g. [Mg/H] is underestimated by ~0.25 dex\nwhen the gravity is underestimated by 0.5 dex). We then perform a comparison\nbetween the seismic gravities and the spectroscopic gravities presented in the\nRAVE DR4 catalogue, extracting a calibration for log(g) of RAVE giants in the\ncolour interval 0.50<(J - Ks)<0.85.

Due to the ultra-light boson mass, the SFDM could\nform Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the very early Universe, which are\ninterpreted as the dark matter haloes.

In the present paper I focus on the collisionless\nexcitation of eccentricities and inclinations by gravitational interactions in\na planetary system, the prototype of such a dynamics being the future planet\ntrajectories in the solar system. I thus address the statistical mechanics of\nthe planetary orbits in the solar system and try to reproduce the PDFs\nnumerically constructed by Laskar (2008). I show that the microcanonical\nensemble of the Laplace-Lagrange theory accurately reproduce the statistics of\nthe giant planet orbits. To model the inner planets I then investigate the\nansatz of equiprobability in the phase space constrained by the secular\nintegrals of motion. The eccentricity and inclination PDFs of Earth and Venus\nare reproduced with no free parameters. Within the limitations of a stationary\nmodel, the predictions also show a reasonable agreement with Mars PDFs and that\nof Mercury inclination. The eccentricity of Mercury demands in contrast a\ndeeper analysis. I finally revisit Laskar's random walk approach to the time\ndependence of the inner planet PDFs.

The bar in the thin\ndisc component is $\\sim$50\\% stronger than the thick disc bar and is more\nelongated, with an axis ratio almost half that of the thick disc bar. The thin\ndisc b/p bulge has a pronounced X-shape, while the thick disc b/p is weaker\nwith a rather boxy shape. This leads to the signature of the b/p bulge in the\nthick disc to be weaker and further away from the plane than in the thin disc.\nRegarding the kinematics, we find that the los velocity of thick disc stars in\nthe outer parts of the b/p bulge can be \\emph{larger} than that of thin disc\nstars, by up to 40\\% and 20\\% for side-on and Milky Way-like orientations of\nthe bar respectively. This is due to the different orbits followed by thin and\nthick disc stars in the bar-b/p region, which are affected by the fact that: i)\nthin disc stars are trapped more efficiently in the bar - b/p instability and\nthus lose more angular momentum than their thick disc counterparts and ii)\nthick disc stars have large radial excursions and therefore stars from large\nradii with high angular momenta can be found in the bar region.

Reduction of O star wind mass-loss\n  rates in global models Abstract: We calculate global (unified) wind models of main-sequence, giant, and\nsupergiant O stars from our Galaxy. The models are calculated by solving\nhydrodynamic, kinetic equilibrium (also known as NLTE) and comoving-frame (CMF)\nradiative transfer equations from the (nearly) hydrostatic photosphere to the\nsupersonic wind. For given stellar parameters, our models predict the\nphotosphere and wind structure and in particular the wind mass-loss rates\nwithout any free parameters. Our predicted mass-loss rates are by a factor of\n2--5 lower than the commonly used predictions. A possible cause of the\ndifference is abandoning of the Sobolev approximation for the calculation of\nthe radiative force, because our models agree with predictions of CMF NLTE\nradiative transfer codes. Our predicted mass-loss rates agree nicely with the\nmass-loss rates derived from observed near-infrared and X-ray line profiles and\nare slightly lower than mass-loss rates derived from combined UV and H$\\alpha$\ndiagnostics. The empirical mass-loss rate estimates corrected for clumping may\ntherefore be reconciled with theoretical predictions in such a way that the\naverage ratio between individual mass-loss rate estimates is not higher than\nabout $ 1.6 $.

The free-energy density is minimized with\nrespect to the individual equilibrium densities of all heavy nuclei and the\nnuclear composition.

This\nevolution is explained by fast \"in-situ\" star formation at high-$z$ followed by\na late mass assembly mostly driven by minor mergers that deposit stars\nprimarily in the outer halo. We aim to identify structural components of the\nHydra I cD galaxy NGC 3311 to investigate the connection between the central\ngalaxy and the surrounding stellar halo. We map the line-of-sight velocity\ndistribution (LOSVD) using MUSE pointings covering NGC 3311 out to $25$ kpc.\nCombining photometric and spectroscopic data, we model the LOSVD maps using a\nfinite mixture distribution, including four non-concentric, nearly isothermal\nspheroids, with different line-of-sight systemic velocities $V$, velocity\ndispersions $\\sigma$, and higher order Gauss-Hermite moments $h_3$ and $h_4$.\nThe comparison of the correlations between $h_3$ and $h_4$ with $V/\\sigma$ with\nsimulations indicates that NGC 3311 assembled mainly through dry mergers. The\n$\\sigma$ profile rises to $\\simeq 400$ km s$^{\\text -1}$ at 20 kpc indicating\nthat stars there were stripped from progenitors orbiting in the cluster core.\nThe finite mixture distribution modeling supports three inner components\nrelated to the central galaxy and a fourth component with large effective\nradius ($51$ kpc) and velocity dispersion ($327$ km s$^{\\text{-1}}$) consistent\nwith a cD envelope. We find that the cD envelope is offset from the center of\nNGC 3311 both spatially (8.6 kpc) and in velocity ($\\Delta V = 204$\nkms$^{-1}$), but coincide with the cluster core X-ray isophotes and the mean\nvelocity of galaxies.

The cD envelope of NGC 3311 is\ndynamically associated with the cluster core, which in Hydra I is in addition\ndisplaced from the cluster center, presumably due to a recent subcluster\nmerger. \n\n"}

The system expands with period ratios increasing and mean\neccentricities decreasing with time. This evolution is largely driven by tides\nacting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones. In order\nthat deviations from commensurability become significant only on $Gy$ time\nscales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the\nplanets has to be such that $Q' > \\sim 10^{2-3}.$ At the same time, if we start\nwith two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one,\n$Q'$ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly\nexceeding) $10^{2-3}$ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the\nobserved configuration.

For stars with a relative\nerror in total proper motion below $10 \\%$, the mass range extends to ~$10\nM_{\\odot}$ but peaks at ~$1$ $M_\\odot$.

The main insight from this study is\nthat LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing\nM*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and\nmetallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and\nvice versa. Furthermore, we find that the bulge-to-disk age and metallicity\ncontrast, as well as the bulge-to-disk mass ratio increase with M*T, raising\nfrom, respectively, ~0 Gyr, 0 dex and 0.25 to ~3 Gyr, ~0.3 dex and 0.67 across\nthe mass range covered by our sample. Whereas gas excitation in lower-mass\nbulges is invariably dominated by star formation (SF), LINER- and\nSeyfert-specific emission-line ratios were exclusively documented in high-mass,\nhigh-S* bulges. The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves\nand in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that\nthese components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a\ncontinuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics.

We find that ETGs\ntypically show a kinematic transition between inner regions and halo. Estimated\ntransition radii in units of Re anticorrelate with stellar mass. SRs have\nincreased but still modest rotational support at large radii, while most of the\nFRs show a decrease in rotation, due to the fading of the stellar disk in the\nouter, more slowly rotating spheroid. 30% of the FRs are dominated by rotation\nalso at large radii.

The\nrelative contribution of accretion events with low VMRs is highest for the halo\npopulation of blue GCs and gradually decreases for red GCs and accreted stars.\nAs a consequence of the reduced efficiency of dynamical friction on minor\nmergers, our populations of cosmologically accreted blue GCs are systematically\nmore spatially extended and have higher velocity dispersions than for red GCs,\nin agreement with observations.

We measure the flux of the four\nstellar emission features detected in the COS spectrum (CII, CIII, CIV, SiIV).\nComparing the CII/CIV flux ratio measured for WASP-18 with that derived from\nspectra of nearby stars with known age, we see that the far-UV spectrum of\nWASP-18 resembles that of old ($>$5 Gyr), inactive stars, in stark contrast\nwith its young age. We conclude that WASP-18 has an intrinsically low activity\nlevel, possibly caused by star-planet tidal interaction, as suggested by\nprevious studies. Re-scaling the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match\nthe flux of the SiIV line, yields an XUV integrated flux at the planet orbit of\n10.2 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.

Several mechanisms have been proposed\nfor producing them, including the interaction of the Galaxy's super-massive\nblack hole (SMBH) with a binary; rapid mass-loss from a companion to a star in\na short-period binary; the tidal disruption of an infalling galaxy and finally\nejection from the Large Magellanic Cloud. While previously discovered\nhigh-velocity early-type stars are thought to be the result of an interaction\nwith the SMBH, the origin of high-velocity late type stars is ambiguous. The\nsecond data release of Gaia (DR2) enables a unique opportunity to resolve this\nambiguity and determine whether any late-type candidates are truly unbound from\nthe Milky Way. In this paper, we utilize the new proper motion and velocity\ninformation available from DR2 to re-evaluate a collection of historical data\ncompiled on the newly-created Open Fast Stars Catalog. We find that almost all\npreviously-known high-velocity late-type stars are most likely bound to the\nMilky Way. Only one late-type object (LAMOST J115209.12+120258.0) is unbound\nfrom the Galaxy.

External perturbations from satellite\ngalaxies can also have a role, causing dynamical heating of the Galaxy,\nring-like structures in the disk and correlations between different components\nof the stellar velocity. These perturbations can also cause 'phase wrapping'\nsignatures in the disk, such as arched velocity structures in the motions of\nstars in the Galactic plane.

We therefore present a new study of the\nkinematics of the MW dwarf galaxies. We use the Gaia DR2 for those dwarfs that\nhave been spectroscopically observed in the literature. We derive systemic PMs\nfor 39 galaxies and galaxy candidates out to 420 kpc, and generally find good\nconsistency for the subset with measurements available from other studies.

The stars in\nthe reddest-color sequence are likely dominated by the dynamically-hot tail of\nthe thick disk population. Information from Nissen & Schuster (2010) and from\nthe APOGEE survey suggests that stars in the blue-color sequence have elemental\nabundance patterns that can be explained by this population having a relatively\nlow star-formation efficiency during its formation. In dynamical and orbital\nspaces, such as the `Toomre diagram', the two sequences show a significant\noverlap, but with a tendency for stars on the blue-color sequence to dominate\nregions with no or retrograde rotation and high total orbital energy. In the\nplane defined by the maximal vertical excursion of the orbits versus their\napocenters, stars of both sequences redistribute into discrete wedges.

Because the limiting distance to which BBHs are detected\ndepends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected\nbinaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider\nthe mass and redshift distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate\ndensity, ${dN}/{dm_1\\,dm_2\\,dz}$.

Here report\nan analysis of the kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars\nin a relatively large volume around the Sun that are mainly linked to two major\nGalactic components, the thick disk and the stellar halo. We demonstrate that\nthe inner halo is dominated by debris from an object which at infall was\nslightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we refer to as\nGaia-Enceladus. The stars originating in Gaia-Enceladus cover nearly the full\nsky, their motions reveal the presence of streams and slightly retrograde and\nelongated trajectories. Hundreds of RR Lyrae stars and thirteen globular\nclusters following a consistent age-metallicity relation can be associated to\nGaia-Enceladus on the basis of their orbits. With an estimated 4:1 mass-ratio,\nthe merger with Gaia-Enceladus must have led to the dynamical heating of the\nprecursor of the Galactic thick disk and therefore contributed to the formation\nof this component approximately 10 Gyr ago. These findings are in line with\nsimulations of galaxy formation, which predict that the inner stellar halo\nshould be dominated by debris from just a few massive progenitors. \n\n"}

The most\nprecise SFHs are usually derived from deep but not very spatially extended\nphotometric data; this might alter the ratio of old to young stars when age\ngradients are present.

As a main-sequence star passes too\nclose by an IMBH it might be tidally captured and disrupted. We study the\nlong-term accretion and observational consequence of such tidal disruption\nevents. The disruption radius is hundreds to thousands of the BH's\nSchwarzschild radius, so the circularization of the falling-back debris stream\nis very inefficient due to weak general relativity effects. Due to this and a\nhigh mass fallback rate, the bound debris initially goes through a ~10 yr long\nsuper-Eddington accretion phase.

Faint\nspirals appear in the number density of stars projected onto the $z-v_z$ plane,\nwhich can be explained by a simple model for phase wrapping. More prominent\nspirals are seen when bins across the $z-v_z$ plane are coloured by median\n$v_R$ or $v_\\phi$. We use both toy model and fully self-consistent simulations\nto show that the spirals develop naturally from vertical bending oscillations\nof a stellar disc. The underlying physics follows from the observation that the\nvertical energy of a star (essentially, its \"radius\" in the $z-v_z$ plane)\ncorrelates with its angular momentum or, alternatively, guiding radius.\nMoreover, at fixed physical radius, the guiding radius determines the azimuthal\nvelocity.

From all this, estimates were derived for the isotropic\nH-ionizing radiation produced in the jet termination regions, at $z\\sim 6$,\nthrough inverse Compton scattering off CMB photons. We find that the\ntermination regions of the jets of active galactic nuclei may have radiated\nmost of their energy in the form of H-ionizing radiation at $z\\sim 6$. For\ntypical black-hole mass functions at that redshift, under the considered\nconditions (long-lasting, common, and very active galactic nuclei with jets),\nthe contribution of these jets to maintain (and possibly enhance) the\nionization of H may have been non-negligible. We conclude that the termination\nregions of jets from active galactic nuclei could have had a significant role\nin the reionization of the Universe at $z\\gtrsim 6$. \n\n"}

However, it has so far been lacking in a robust method to extract\nquantitative constraints on temperature structure and molecular/atomic\nabundances. In this work we present a novel Bayesian atmospheric retrieval\nframework applicable to high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS)\nthat relies upon the cross-correlation between data and models to extract the\nplanetary spectral signal.

As the previous\nalgorithm had to assume that the spectral parameters are uniform over the full\nsky (or some significant fraction of the sky), it resulted in a bias in the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio parameter $r$ estimated from foreground-cleaned\npolarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The new algorithm,\n\"Delta-map method\", accounts for spatially varying spectra to first order in\nperturbation. The only free parameters are the cosmological parameters such as\n$r$ and the sky-averaged foreground parameters. We show that a cleaned CMB map\nis the maximum likelihood solution to first order in perturbation, and derive\nthe posterior distribution of $r$ and the sky-averaged foreground parameters\nusing Bayesian statistics.

In this range, the DWT covariance gives a lossless\nestimation of the power spectrum, which is equal to the corresponding Fourier\npower spectrum banded with a logarithmical scaling. In the scale range, in\nwhich the scale-scale correlation is significant, the accuracy of a power\nspectrum detection depends on the scale-scale or band-band correlations. This\nis, for a precision measurements of the power spectrum, a measurement of the\nscale-scale or band-band correlations is needed.

In our\nsimulations all relevant physical effects, such as baryon-antibaryon\nannihilations, production of secondary particles during annihilations, baryon\ndiffusion, and hydrodynamic processes are coupled to the nuclear reaction\nnetwork. We identify two dominant effects, according to the typical spatial\ndimensions of the domains. Small antimatter domains are dissipated via neutron\ndiffusion prior to He4 synthesis at T_He4 \\approx 80 keV, leading to a\nsuppression of the primordial He4 mass fraction. Larger domains are dissipated\nbelow T_He4 via a combination of proton diffusion and hydrodynamic expansion.\nIn this case the strongest effects on the elemental abundances are due to\nanti-p He4 annihilations, leading to an overproduction of He3 relative to H2\nand to overproduction of Li6 via non-thermal nuclear reactions. Both effects\nmay result in light element abundances deviating substantially from the\nstandard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis yields and from the observationally inferred\nvalues.

We\ninvestigate a mechanism which can lead to observable emission of such electron\npopulations: synchrotron-self Comptonization (SSC). The inverse Compton (IC)\nscattering can shift an otherwise unobservable low-frequency 10 kHz-10 MHz\nphotons into observable radio, infrared (IR) or even more energetic wave-bands.\nThe resulting emission should be polarized. We also consider IC scattering of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the cosmic radio background (CRB).\nElectron spectral aging due to synchrotron, IC and adiabatic losses or gains\ninfluences the resulting spectrum. The predicted radiation spectrum is a strong\nfunction of the history of the source, of the low energy spectrum of\nrelativistic electrons, and of redshift. It has typically two maxima, and a\ndecrement in between at CMB frequencies. Detection will give a sensitive probe\nof the environment of radio galaxies.

The possible transport mechanisms and the possible fates of the excess\nangular momentum are discussed, and it is argued that transport processes in\ndisks are probably not sufficient by themselves to solve the angular momentum\nproblem, while tidal interactions with other stars in forming binary or\nmultiple systems are likely to be of very general importance in redistributing\nangular momentum during the star formation process. Most, if not all, stars\nprobably form in binary or multiple systems, and tidal torques in these systems\ncan transfer much of the angular momentum from the gas around each forming star\nto the orbital motions of the companion stars. Tidally generated waves in\ncircumstellar disks may contribute to the overall redistribution of angular\nmomentum. Stars may gain much of their mass by tidally triggered bursts of\nrapid accretion, and these bursts could account for some of the most energetic\nphenomena of the earliest stages of stellar evolution, such as jet-like\noutflows. If tidal interactions are indeed of general importance,\nplanet-forming disks may often have a more chaotic and violent early evolution\nthan in standard models, and shock heating events may be common.

Radiative\n  Mechanism and Physical Constraints on the Source Abstract: (ABBREVIATED) The extraordinary 1998 August 27 giant flare places strong\nconstraints on the physical properties of its source, SGR 1900+14. We make\ndetailed comparisons of the published data with the magnetar model. The giant\nflare evolved through three stages, whose radiative mechanisms we address in\nturn. A triggering mechanism is proposed, whereby a helical distortion of the\ncore magnetic field induces large-scale fracturing in the crust and a twisting\ndeformation of the crust and exterior magnetic field. The envelope of the\npulsating tail of the August 27 flare can be accurately fit, after ~40 s, by\nthe contracting surface of a relativistically hot, but inhomogeneous, trapped\nfireball. We quantify the effects of direct neutrino-pair emission, thereby\ndeducing a lower bound ~ 10^{32} G-cm^3 to the magnetic moment of the confining\nfield. The radiative flux during the intermediate ~40 s of the burst appears to\nexceed the trapped fireball fit. The spectrum and lightcurve of this smooth\ntail are consistent with heating in an extended pair corona, possibly powered\nby continuing seismic activity in the star. We consider in detail the critical\nluminosity, below which a stable balance can be maintained between heating and\nradiative cooling in a confined, magnetized pair plasma; but above which the\nconfined plasma runs away to local thermodynamic equilibrium. In the later\npulsating tail, the best fit temperature equilibrates at a value which agrees\nwell with the regulating effect of photon splitting. The remarkable four-peaked\nsubstructure within each 5.16-s pulse provides strong evidence for the presence\nof higher magnetic multipoles in SGR 1900+14. The corresponding collimation of\nthe X-ray flux is related to radiative transport in a super-QED magnetic field. \n\n"}

At shorter\nwavelengths, however, the 60-micron CBR intensity reported by Finkbeiner et al.\nis less easily accounted for.

We propose and test three explanations, each\ninvolving additional populations not readily detected in existing submm-wave\nsurveys.

The\nspectra are well fit when a broad, Gaussian-shaped absorption line with sigma =\n100 eV and centered at an energy of 300 eV is added to an absorbed blackbody\nmodel. The resulting equivalent width of the line is -150 eV. However, the\nspectral resolution at these low energies of the EPIC detectors and the lower\nstatistical quality and restricted energy band of the RGS instruments are not\nsufficient to exclude even broader lines at energies down to 100 eV or several\nunresolved lines. The most likely interpretation of the absorption feature is a\ncyclotron absorption line produced by protons in the magnetic field of the\nneutron star.

By employing publicly available X-ray and\noptical data and catalogues we discover 68 type 2 AGN candidates. The X-ray\npowers of these sources are estimated by using a previously known correlation\nbetween X-ray luminosity and X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. Thirty-one of our\ncandidates have high estimated powers (Lx > 10^44 erg/s) and therefore qualify\nas optically obscured quasars, the so-called ``QSO 2''. Based on the derived\nX-ray powers, our candidates are likely to be at relatively high redshifts, z ~\n3, with the QSO 2 at z ~ 4. By going ~ 3 magnitudes fainter than previously\nknown type 2 AGN in the two GOODS fields we are sampling a region of redshift -\npower space which was previously unreachable with classical methods. Our method\nbrings to 40 the number of QSO 2 in the GOODS fields, an improvement of a\nfactor ~ 4 when compared to the only 9 such sources previously known.

This raises the question - how does our \"best-fit\" equation of state\nrelate to the true function, which may vary with redshift.

Consequentially, the sensitivity to w at high redshift is enhanced beyond\nthat of supernovae studies, and is comparable, if not higher, than lensing of\nthe CMB.

We\nfind slight but significant variations in the spectral shape, with values of\n$\\alpha_x$ ranging from $\\sim 1.2-1.6$. We use VLA radio observations, as well\nas HST imaging and polarimetry data, to examine the jet's broad-band spectrum\nand inquire as to the nature of particle acceleration in the jet. As shown in\nprevious papers, a simple continuous injection model for synchrotron-emitting\nknots, in which both the filling factor, $f_{acc}$, of regions within which\nparticles are accelerated and the energy spectrum of the injected particles are\nconstant, cannot account for the X-ray flux or spectrum. Instead, we propose\nthat $f_{acc}$ is a function of position and energy and find that in the inner\njet, $f_{acc} \\propto E_\\gamma^{-0.4 \\pm 0.2} \\propto E_e^{-0.2 \\pm 0.1}$, and\nin knots A and B, $f_{acc} \\propto E_\\gamma^{-0.7 \\pm 0.2} \\propto E_e^{-0.35\n\\pm 0.1}$, where $E_\\gamma$ is the emitted photon energy and and $E_e$ is the\nemitting electron energy.

There is a strong correlation between the peaks of X-ray emission and\nminima of optical percentage polarization, i.e., regions where the jet magnetic\nfield is not ordered. We suggest that the X-ray peaks coincide with shock waves\nwhich accelerate the X-ray emitting electrons and cause changes in the\ndirection of the magnetic field; the polarization is thus small because of beam\naveraging. \n\n"}

When corrected from extragalactic absorption by the\ndiffuse infrared background (DIrB), the SSC one-zone models require very high\nLorentz factor (around 50) to avoid strong gamma-gamma absorption. However, the\nstatistics on beamed vs. unbeamed objects, as well as the luminosity contrast,\nfavors much lower Lorentz factor of the order of 3. In this paper, we show that\nfor the special case of Markarian 501, the need for very high Lorentz factor is\nunavoidable for all one-zone models where all photons are assumed to be\nproduced at the same location at the same time.

This metallicity break is accompanied by\na change in the size-luminosity relation for compact objects, as deduced from\nHST-imaging: for M_V<-11 mag, r_h scales with luminosity, while for M_V>-11\nmag, r_h is almost luminosity-independent. We therefore assume a limiting\nabsolute magnitude of M_V=-11 mag between UCDs and globular clusters. The mean\nmetallicity of five Fornax dE,N nuclei included in our study is about 0.8 dex\nlower than that of the UCDs, at 4.5 sigma significance. Because of this large\nmetallicity discrepancy we disfavor the hypothesis that most of the Fornax UCDs\nare the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped dE,Ns. Our metallicity estimates for\nUCDs are closer to but slightly below those derived for young massive clusters\n(YMCs) of comparable masses. We therefore favor a scenario where most UCDs in\nFornax are successors of merged YMCs produced in the course of violent\ngalaxy-galaxy mergers. It is noted that in contrast to that, the properties of\nVirgo UCDs are more consistent with the stripping scenario, suggesting that\ndifferent UCD formation channels may dominate in either cluster. \n\n"}

We study the influence of CRs on weakly magnetized relativistic\ncollisionless shocks and apply our results to external shocks in gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) afterglows. The common view is that the transverse Weibel\ninstability (TWI) generates a small-scale magnetic field that facilitates\ncollisional coupling and thermalization in the shock transition. The TWI field\nis expected to decay rapidly, over a finite number of proton plasma skin depths\nfrom the transition. However, the synchrotron emission in GRB afterglows\nsuggests that a strong and persistent magnetic field is present in the plasma\nthat crosses the shock; the origin of this field is a key open question. Here\nwe suggest that the common picture involving TWI demands revision. Namely, the\nCRs drive turbulence in the shock upstream on scales much larger than the skin\ndepth. This turbulence generates a large-scale magnetic field that quenches TWI\nand produces a magnetized shock. The new field efficiently confines CRs and\nenhances the acceleration efficiency. The CRs modify the shocks in GRB\nafterglows at least while they remain relativistic. The origin of the magnetic\nfield that gives rise to the synchrotron emission is plausibly in the CR-driven\nturbulence. We do not expect ultrahigh energy cosmic ray production in external\nGRB shocks. \n\n"}

{"id": "astro-ph/0601056", "contents": "Title: Implications of the Early X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves of Swift GRBs Abstract: According to current models, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced when the\nenergy carried by a relativistic outflow is dissipated and converted into\nradiation. The efficiency of this process, $\\epsilon_\\gamma$, is one of the\ncritical factors in any GRB model. The X-ray afterglow light curves of Swift\nGRBs show an early stage of flat decay. This has been interpreted as reflecting\nenergy injection. When combined with previous estimates, which have concluded\nthat the kinetic energy of the late ($\\gtrsim 10$ hr) afterglow is comparable\nto the energy emitted in gamma-rays, this interpretation implies very high\nvalues of $\\epsilon_\\gamma \\gtrsim 0.9$. Such a high efficiency is hard to\nreconcile with most models, including in particular the popular internal-shocks\nmodel. We re-analyze the derivation of the kinetic energy from the afterglow\nX-ray flux and re-examine the resulting estimates of the efficiency. We confirm\nthat, if the flatt decay arises from energy injection and the pre-Swift\nbroad-band estimates of the kinetic energy are correct, then $\\epsilon_\\gamma\n\\gtrsim 0.9$. We point out, however, that another interpretation of the\nflattish decay - a variable X-ray afterglow efficiency (e.g., due to a time\ndependence of afterglow shock microphysical parameters) - is possible. We also\nshow that direct estimates of the kinetic energy from the late X-ray afterglow\nflux are sensitive to the assumed values of the shock microphysical parameters\nand suggest that broad-band afterglow fits might have underestimated the\nkinetic energy (e.g., by overestimating the fraction of electrons that are\naccelerated to relativistic energies). Either one of these possibilities\nimplies a lower gamma-ray efficiency, and their joint effect could conceivably\nreduce the estimate of the typical $\\epsilon_\\gamma$ to $\\sim 0.1-0.5$. \n\n"}

However, recent\nanalyses of structure on galactic and sub-galactic scales have suggested\ndiscrepancies and stimulated numerous alternative proposals including, e.g.\nSelf-Interacting dark matter, Self-Annihilating dark matter, Decaying dark\nmatter, to name just a few.

The required weakness of the DM particle interactions is\nguaranteed by a small geometrical factor of the composite objects with a large\nbaryon charge rather than by a weak coupling constant of a new field. We argue\nthat the interaction between hadronic matter and composite dark objects does\nnot spoil the desired properties of the latter as cold matter.

The unique combination of large area and depth provided\nby this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and has\nallowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sources\nout to z~2 with good statistical accuracy.\n  In agreement with previous studies we find that the characteristic luminosity\nof the near-infrared luminosity function brightens by 1 magnitude between z=0\nand z~2, while the total density decreases by a factor ~2.

In chronological order they are: the burst\ntail, the \"hump\", the standard decay, and the post jet-break decay.\n  The large-angle emission produced during the burst, but arriving at observer\nlater, is consistent with the GRB tail decay for less than half of bursts. The\nforward-shock synchrotron emission from a very narrow jet (half-angle less than\n1 deg) is consistent with the decay of 75 percent of GRB tails. The\nforward-shock inverse-Compton emission from a narrow jet that does not expand\nsideways also accommodates the decay of 80 percent of GRB tails.\n  The X-ray light-curve hump can be attributed to an increasing kinetic energy\nper solid angle of the forward-shock region visible to the observer. This\nincrease could be due to the emergence of the emission from an outflow seen\nfrom a location outside its opening. However, the correlations among the hump\ntiming, flux, and decay index expected in this model are not confirmed by\nobservations. Thus, the increase in the forward-shock kinetic energy is more\nlikely caused by some incoming ejecta arriving at the shock during the\nafterglow phase.\n  The jet interpretation for the burst tails and the energy injection scenario\nfor the hump lead to a double-jet outflow structure consisting of a narrow GRB\njet which precedes a wider afterglow outflow of lower kinetic energy per solid\nangle but higher total energy.

We construct the mass function of these merging satellites,\nand calculate the main orbital parameters for the accreted lumps. The average\ncircularity of the orbits is epsilon = 0.5, while either radial or almost\ncircular orbits are equally avoided. More massive satellites move along\nslightly more eccentric orbits, with lower specific angular momentum and a\nsmaller pericentre. We find that the infall of satellites onto the main cluster\nprogenitor has a very anisotropic distribution. This anisotropy is to a large\nextent responsible for the shape and orientation of the final cluster and of\nits velocity ellipsoid. At the end of the simulations, the major axis of the\ncluster is aligned both with that of its velocity ellipsoid, and with the major\naxis of the ellipsoid defined by the satellite infall pattern, to 30 degrees on\naverage. We also find that, in lower mass clusters, a higher fraction of the\nfinal virial mass is provided by small, dense satellites. These sink to the\ncentre of the parent cluster and so enhance its central density. This mechanism\nis found to be partially responsible for the correlation between halo masses\nand characteristic overdensities, recently highlighted by Navarro, Frenk &\nWhite (1996). \n\n"}

Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts\nfrom the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 micron and 240 micron data, we\nhave constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map can\nbe converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The result of these\nmanipulations is a map with DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution.\n  To generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light\ncontamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is\ndone via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden-\nDwingeloo map of H_I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a\nsuitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no\nsignificant CIB is detected. In the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where the\nzodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux\nlevels of 32 \\pm 13 nW/m^2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 \\pm 4 nW/m^2/sr at 240\nmicron (95% confidence).

By analyzing the asymptotical\nbehaviour of the outflows it is found that they attain a variety of shapes such\nas conical, paraboloidal or cylindrical. However, non cylindrical asymptotics\ncan be achieved only when the magnetic pinching is negligible and the outflow\nis overpressured on its symmetry axis. In cylindrical jet-type asymptotics, the\noutflowing plasma reaches an equilibrium wherein it is confined by magnetic\nforces or gas pressure gradients, while it is supported by centrifugal forces\nor gas pressure gradients.

We present here a study of the radiative evolution of circular (i.e.,\nconstant Boyer-Lindquist coordinate radius), non-equatorial Kerr black hole\norbits.

Such a starting point\nis in close analogy with the Standard Big Bang (SBB) model. The topology of the\nUniverse is assumed to be toroidal in all nine spatial dimensions and is filled\nwith a gas of p-branes. The dynamics of winding modes allow, at most, three\nspatial dimensions to become large, thus explaining the origin of our\nmacroscopic 3+1-dimensional Universe. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of\nthe loitering phase of BGC. We do so by including into the equations of motion\nthat describe the dilaton gravity background some new equations which determine\nthe annihilation of string winding modes into string loops. Specific solutions\nare found within the model that exhibit loitering, i.e. the Universe\nexperiences a short phase of slow contraction during which the Hubble radius\ngrows larger than the physical extent of the Universe. As a result the brane\nproblem (generalized domain wall problem) in BGC is solved.

Abstract: Assuming that Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is the correct theory of gravity\non all length scales we use analytical results from nonperturbative\nrenormalization group (RG) equations as well as experimental input in order to\ncharacterize the special RG trajectory of QEG which is realized in Nature and\nto determine its parameters. On this trajectory, we identify a regime of scales\nwhere gravitational physics is well described by classical General Relativity.\nStrong renormalization effects occur at both larger and smaller momentum\nscales. The latter lead to a growth of Newton's constant at large distances. We\nargue that this effect becomes visible at the scale of galaxies and could\nprovide a solution to the astrophysical missing mass problem which does not\nrequire any dark matter. We show that an extremely weak power law running of\nNewton's constant leads to flat galaxy rotation curves similar to those\nobserved in Nature. Furthermore, a possible resolution of the cosmological\nconstant problem is proposed by noting that all RG trajectories admitting a\nlong classical regime automatically give rise to a small cosmological constant. \n\n"}
