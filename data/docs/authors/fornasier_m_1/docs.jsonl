We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods.

It is an approach based on\nanother known universal dynamics: The evolutionary dynamics first conceived by\nDarwin and Wallace, referring to as Darwinian dynamics in the present paper,\nhas been found to be universally valid in biology; The statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics, while enormously successful in physics, have been in an\nawkward situation of wanting a consistent dynamical understanding; Here we\npresent from a formal point of view an exploration of the connection between\nthermodynamics and Darwinian dynamics and a few related topics. We first show\nthat the stochasticity in Darwinian dynamics implies the existence temperature,\nhence the canonical distribution of Boltzmann-Gibbs type. In term of relative\nentropy the Second Law of thermodynamics is dynamically demonstrated without\ndetailed balance condition, and is valid regardless of size of the system.

In the present\npaper, we pursue our investigation of the augmented formulation and we\nintroduce a new coupling framework which is now based on the so-called thick\ninterface model.

In the noise-free setting we derive a general expression on the\nnumber of measurements needed to ensure that a unique solution can be found in\na stable way, that depends on the set T through a natural complexity parameter.\nThis parameter can be computed explicitly for many sets T of interest. For\nexample, for k-sparse inputs we show that O(k\\log(n/k)) measurements are\nneeded, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n) measurements suffice. In the\nnoisy case, we show that if one can find a value for which the empirical risk\nis bounded by a given, computable constant (that depends on the set T), then\nthe error with respect to the true input is bounded above by an another,\nclosely related complexity parameter of the set.

Customers of\ndifferent types arrive to a system with an infinite number of servers. A server\npacking configuration is the vector $k = (k_i)$, where $k_i$ is the number of\ntype-$i$ customers that the server \"contains\". Packing constraints are\ndescribed by a fixed finite set of allowed configurations. Upon arrival, each\ncustomer is placed into a server immediately, subject to the packing\nconstraints; the server can be idle or already serving other customers. After\nservice completion, each customer leaves its server and the system.\n  It was shown recently that a simple real-time algorithm, called Greedy, is\nasymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing $\\sum_k X_k^{1+\\alpha}$ in\nthe stationary regime, as the customer arrival rates grow to infinity.

It is now\nwell-established that, for small population sizes, stochastic models for\nbiochemical reaction networks are necessary to capture randomness in the\ninteractions. The tools for analyzing such models, however, still lag far\nbehind their deterministic counterparts. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\ndeveloping a constructive framework for examining the long-term behavior and\nstability properties of the reaction dynamics in a stochastic setting. In\nparticular, we address the problems of determining ergodicity of the reaction\ndynamics, which is analogous to having a globally attracting fixed point for\ndeterministic dynamics. We also examine when the statistical moments of the\nunderlying process remain bounded with time and when they converge to their\nsteady state values.

We consider networks where each node has\nexclusive access to a cost function, and design algorithms that make all nodes\ncooperate to find the minimum of the sum of all the cost functions. Several\nproblems in signal processing, control, and machine learning can be posed as\nsuch optimization problems. Given that communication is often the most\nenergy-consuming operation in networks, it is important to design\ncommunication-efficient algorithms. The main contributions of this thesis are a\nclassification scheme for distributed optimization and a set of corresponding\ncommunication-efficient algorithms.\n  The class of optimization problems we consider is quite general, since each\nfunction may depend on arbitrary components of the optimization variable, and\nnot necessarily on all of them. In doing so, we go beyond the common assumption\nin distributed optimization and create additional structure that can be used to\nreduce the number of communications. This structure is captured by our\nclassification scheme, which identifies easier instances of the problem, for\nexample the standard distributed optimization problem, where all functions\ndepend on all the components of the variable.\n  In our algorithms, no central node coordinates the network, all the\ncommunications occur between neighboring nodes, and the data associated with\neach node is processed locally. We show several applications including average\nconsensus, support vector machines, network flows, and several distributed\nscenarios for compressed sensing. We also propose a new framework for\ndistributed model predictive control. Through extensive numerical experiments,\nwe show that our algorithms outperform prior distributed algorithms in terms of\ncommunication-efficiency, even some that were specifically designed for a\nparticular application. \n\n"}

Such inference comes about naturally in the study of\ninverse problems of recovering continuous (infinite dimensional) coefficient\nfunctions from ordinary or partial differential equations (ODE, PDE), a problem\nwhich is typically ill-posed. Regularization of these problems using $L^2$\nfunction spaces (Tikhonov regularization) is equivalent to Bayesian\nprobabilistic inference, using a Gaussian prior. The Bayesian interpretation of\ninverse problem regularization is useful since it allows one to quantify and\ncharacterize error and degree of precision in the solution of inverse problems,\nas well as examine assumptions made in solving the problem -- namely whether\nthe subjective choice of regularization is compatible with prior knowledge.\nUsing path-integral formalism, Bayesian inference can be explored through\nvarious perturbative techniques, such as the semiclassical approximation, which\nwe use in this manuscript.

Given multiple matches computed between a\nfew object pairs in isolation, the goal is to recover an entire collection of\nmaps that are (1) globally consistent, and (2) close to the provided maps ---\nand under certain conditions provably the ground-truth maps. Despite recent\nadvances on this problem, the best-known recovery guarantees are limited to a\nsmall constant barrier --- none of the existing methods find theoretical\nsupport when more than $50\\%$ of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover,\nprior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically\nmore demanding to match instances that are only partially similar to each\nother.\n  In this paper, we develop an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that\nexhibit only partial similarities, given a few pairwise matches that are\ndensely corrupted.

Given a finite horizon $[0,T]$ and a low-mode truncation of the\nPDE, a PM provides an approximate parameterization of the uncontrolled high\nmodes by the controlled low ones so that the unexplained high-mode energy is\nreduced, in an $L^2$-sense, when this parameterization is applied. Analytic\nformulas of such PMs are derived by application of the method of pullback\napproximation of the high-modes (Chekroun, Liu, and Wang, 2013,\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.3896v1.pdf). These formulas allow for an effective\nderivation of reduced ODE systems, aimed to model the evolution of the low-mode\ntruncation of the controlled state variable, where the high-mode part is\napproximated by the PM function applied to the low modes. A priori error\nestimates between the resulting PM-based low-dimensional suboptimal controller\n$u_R^\\ast$ and the optimal controller $u^*$ are derived. These estimates\ndemonstrate that the closeness of $u_R^\\ast$ to $u^*$ is mainly conditioned on\ntwo factors: (i) the parameterization defect of a given PM, associated\nrespectively with $u_R^\\ast$ and $u^*$; and (ii) the energy kept in the high\nmodes of the PDE solution either driven by $u_R^\\ast$ or $u^*$ itself. The\npractical performances of such PM-based suboptimal controllers are numerically\nassessed for various optimal control problems associated with a Burgers-type\nequation. The numerical results show that a PM-based reduced system allows for\nthe design of suboptimal controllers with good performances provided that the\nassociated parameterization defects and energy kept in the high modes are small\nenough, in agreement with the rigorous results. \n\n"}

An important practical issue is the\nspecification of appropriate boundary conditions on this boundary, often\nconditions of complete transparency. Attention to this issue has been paid\nelsewhere, and here we consider a different, although related, issue: far-field\nsignal recovery. Namely, from smooth data recorded on the outer boundary we\nwish to recover the far-field signal which would reach arbitrarily large\ndistances. These signals encode information about interior scatterers and often\ncorrespond to actual measurements. This article expresses far-field signal\nrecovery in terms of time-domain convolutions, each between a solution\nmultipole moment recorded at the boundary and a sum-of-exponentials kernel.\nEach exponential corresponds to a pole term in the Laplace transform of the\nkernel, a finite sum of simple poles. Greengard, Hagstrom, and Jiang have\nderived the large-$\\ell$ (spherical-harmonic index) asymptotic expansion for\nthe pole residues, and their analysis shows that, when expressed in terms of\nthe exact sum-of-exponentials, large-$\\ell$ signal recovery is plagued by\ncancellation errors. Nevertheless, through an alternative integral\nrepresentation of the kernel and its subsequent approximation by a {\\em\nsmaller} number of exponential terms (kernel compression), we are able to\nalleviate these errors and achieve accurate signal recovery.

The aim of\nthis paper is to show the existence of orbits whose angular momentum performs\narbitrary excursions in a large region. In particular, there exist diffusive\norbits, that is, with a large variation of angular momentum.\n  The leading idea of the proof consists in analysing parabolic motions of the\ncomet. By a well-known result of McGehee, the union of future (resp. past)\nparabolic orbits is an analytic manifold. In a properly chosen coordinate\nsystem these manifolds are stable (resp. unstable) manifolds of a manifold at\ninfinity $P_\\infty$, which we call manifold at parabolic infinity.\n  On this manifold, it is possible to define two scattering maps, which contain\nthe map structure of the homoclinic trajectories to it, i.e. orbits parabolic\nboth in the future and the past.

It turns out that the system\nstate, which is the transformer hot-spot (HS) temperature here, can be\nexpressed as a function of the sequence of control variables; the cost function\nis then seen to be convex in the control for typical values for the model\nparameters.

The control task is to enforce the system state\nto follow a prescribed desired trajectory as closely as possible. The concept\nof so-called exactly realizable trajectories is proposed. For exactly\nrealizable desired trajectories exists a control signal which enforces the\nstate to exactly follow the desired trajectory. For a given affine control\nsystem, these trajectories are characterized by the so-called constraint\nequation. This approach does not only yield an explicit expression for the\ncontrol signal in terms of the desired trajectory, but also identifies a\nparticularly simple class of nonlinear control systems. Based on that insight,\nthe regularization parameter is used as the small parameter for a perturbation\nexpansion. This results in a reinterpretation of affine optimal control\nproblems with small regularization term as singularly perturbed differential\nequations. The small parameter originates from the formulation of the control\nproblem and does not involve simplifying assumptions about the system dynamics.\nCombining this approach with the linearizing assumption, approximate and partly\nlinear equations for the optimal trajectory tracking of arbitrary desired\ntrajectories are derived. For vanishing regularization parameter, the state\ntrajectory becomes discontinuous and the control signal diverges. On the other\nhand, the analytical treatment becomes exact and the solutions are exclusively\ngoverned by linear differential equations. Thus, the possibility of linear\nstructures underlying nonlinear optimal control is revealed. This fact enables\nthe derivation of exact analytical solutions to an entire class of nonlinear\ntrajectory tracking problems with affine controls.

The first\ncontribution of this paper is a precise mathematical definition of the\n\"extended support\" (associated to the noise-free image) of TV denoising. It is\nintuitively the region which is unstable and will suffer from the staircasing\neffect. We highlight in several practical cases, such as the indicator of\nconvex sets, that this region can be determined explicitly. Our second and main\ncontribution is a proof that the TV denoising method indeed restores an image\nwhich is exactly constant outside a small tube surrounding the extended\nsupport. The radius of this tube shrinks toward zero as the noise level\nvanishes, and are able to determine, in some cases, an upper bound on the\nconvergence rate. For indicators of so-called \"calibrable\" sets (such as disks\nor properly eroded squares), this extended support matches the edges, so that\ndiscontinuities produced by TV denoising cluster tightly around the edges.

In fact, the adventure really started with\na rather thoroughfull series of five papers by Cockburn and Shu in the late\n80's [7, 5, 9, 6, 8]. Then, the fame of the method, which could be seen as a\ncompromise between Finite Elements (the center of the method being a weak\nformulation) and Finite Volumes (the basis functions are defined cell-wise, the\ncells being the elements of the primal mesh) increased and slowly investigated\nsuccessfully all the domains of Partial Differential Equations numerical\nintegration. In particular, one can cite the ground papers for the common\ntreatment of convection-diffusion equations [4, 3] or the treatment of pure\nelliptic equations [2, 17]. For more information on the history of\nDiscontinuous Galerkin method, please refer to section 1.1 of [15]. Today, DG\nmethods are widely used in all kind of manners and have applications in almost\nall fields of applied mathematics. (TODO: cite applications and\nstructured/unstructured meshes, steady/unsteady, etc...). The methods is now\nmature enough to deserve entire text books, among which I cite a reference book\non Nodal DG Methods by Henthaven and Warburton [15] with the ground basis of DG\nintegration, numerical analysis of its linear behavior and generalization to\nmultiple dimensions.

{"id": "1610.05335", "contents": "Title: Bounding averages rigorously using semidefinite programming: mean\n  moments of the Lorenz system Abstract: We describe methods for proving bounds on infinite-time averages in\ndifferential dynamical systems. The methods rely on the construction of\nnonnegative polynomials with certain properties, similarly to the way nonlinear\nstability can be proved using Lyapunov functions. Nonnegativity is enforced by\nrequiring the polynomials to be sums of squares, a condition which is then\nformulated as a semidefinite program (SDP) that can be solved computationally.\nAlthough such computations are subject to numerical error, we demonstrate two\nways to obtain rigorous results: using interval arithmetic to control the error\nof an approximate SDP solution, and finding exact analytical solutions to\nrelatively small SDPs. Previous formulations are extended to allow for bounds\ndepending analytically on parametric variables. These methods are illustrated\nusing the Lorenz equations, a system with three state variables $(x,y,z)$ and\nthree parameters $(\\beta,\\sigma,r)$. Bounds are reported for infinite-time\naverages of all eighteen moments $x^ly^mz^n$ up to quartic degree that are\nsymmetric under $(x,y)\\mapsto(-x,-y)$. These bounds apply to all solutions\nregardless of stability, including chaotic trajectories, periodic orbits, and\nequilibrium points. The analytical approach yields two novel bounds that are\nsharp: the mean of $z^3$ can be no larger than its value of $(r-1)^3$ at the\nnonzero equilibria, and the mean of $xy^3$ must be nonnegative. The interval\narithmetic approach is applied at the standard chaotic parameters to bound\neleven average moments that all appear to be maximized on the shortest periodic\norbit. Our best upper bound on each such average exceeds its value on the\nmaximizing orbit by less than 1%. Many bounds reported here are much tighter\nthan would be possible without computer assistance. \n\n"}

The IB\nformulation uses an Eulerian representation of the fluid and a Lagrangian\nrepresentation of the structure. The Lagrangian and Eulerian frames are coupled\nby integral transforms with delta function kernels. The discretized IB\nequations use approximations to these transforms with regularized delta\nfunction kernels to interpolate the fluid velocity to the structure, and to\nspread structural forces to the fluid. It is well-known that the conventional\nIB method can suffer from poor volume conservation since the interpolated\nLagrangian velocity field is not generally divergence-free, and so this can\ncause spurious volume changes. In practice, the lack of volume conservation is\nespecially pronounced for cases where there are large pressure differences\nacross thin structural boundaries. The aim of this paper is to greatly reduce\nthe volume error of the IB method by introducing velocity-interpolation and\nforce-spreading schemes with the properties that the interpolated velocity\nfield in which the structure moves is at least C1 and satisfies a continuous\ndivergence-free condition, and that the force-spreading operator is the adjoint\nof the velocity-interpolation operator.

Further, the new method provides smoother Lagrangian forces (tractions)\nthan traditional IB methods. The method presented here is restricted to\nperiodic computational domains.

A learning algorithm may use a large hypothesis space, but the\nlimited number of iterations controls its model capacity and generalization\nerror. The impacts of stochastic gradient methods on generalization error for\nnon-convex learning problems not only have important theoretical consequences,\nbut are also critical to generalization errors of deep learning.\n  In this paper, we study the generalization errors of Stochastic Gradient\nLangevin Dynamics (SGLD) with non-convex objectives. Two theories are proposed\nwith non-asymptotic discrete-time analysis, using Stability and PAC-Bayesian\nresults respectively. The stability-based theory obtains a bound of\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{n}L\\sqrt{\\beta T_k}\\right)$, where $L$ is uniform Lipschitz\nparameter, $\\beta$ is inverse temperature, and $T_k$ is aggregated step sizes.\nFor PAC-Bayesian theory, though the bound has a slower $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ rate,\nthe contribution of each step is shown with an exponentially decaying factor by\nimposing $\\ell^2$ regularization, and the uniform Lipschitz constant is also\nreplaced by actual norms of gradients along trajectory.

Here we create the\nmathematical framework necessary to understand these phenomenon more broadly,\nregardless of the particular evolution equation. We study micro and macro\nevents in one-parameter families of curves and surfaces, corresponding to\nbifurcations triggering the jumps in $N(t)$ and $N^{\\Delta}(t)$. We show that\nthe intuitive picture developed for curvature-driven flows is not only correct,\nit has universal validity, as long as the evolving surface $r$ is smooth. In\nthis case, bifurcations associated with $r$ and $r^{\\Delta}$ are coupled to\nsome extent: resonance-like phenomena in $N^{\\Delta}(t)$ can be used to\nforecast downward jumps in $N(t)$ (but not upward jumps). Beyond proving\nrigorous results for the $\\Delta \\to 0$ limit on the nontrivial interplay\nbetween singularities in the discrete and continuum approximations we also show\nthat our mathematical model is structurally stable, i.e. it may be verified by\ncomputer simulations. \n\n"}

This set-up is analogous to a\ntelephone system where a transmitter signals a phone call to a receiver through\na \"ring\" and, after the random delay required to establish the connection; the\nreceiver is aware of the \"ring\" being received. Since there is no data payload\nexchange between the sensor and the controller, this set-up provides an\nabstraction for performing event-triggering control with zero-payload rate.

The approach relies on two main elements, namely, 1) A\nsmooth time-windowing methodology that enables accurate band-limited\nrepresentations for arbitrarily-long time signals, and 2) A novel Fourier\ntransform approach which, in a time-parallel manner and without causing\nspurious periodicity effects, delivers numerically dispersionless\nspectrally-accurate solutions. A similar hybrid technique can be obtained on\nthe basis of Laplace transforms instead of Fourier transforms, but we do not\nconsider the Laplace-based method in the present contribution.

One of the critical\ningredients and novelties of our method is the borrowing of inverse scattering\ntechniques in the theory of wave propagation to the body generation.

This practice improves the\noriginal operator splitting approach in the Monte Carlo method, such as the\nseparated treatment of particle transport and collision. As a result, with the\nvariation of the ratio between numerical time step and local photon's collision\ntime, different transport physics can be fully captured in a single\ncomputation.

Our algorithm\nis built on the possibility of representing arbitrary distributions as\nfunctions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We use this foundation to\nformulate chance constrained optimization as one of minimizing the distance\nbetween a desired distribution and the distribution of the constraint functions\nin the RKHS. We provide a systematic way of constructing the desired\ndistribution based on a notion of scenario approximation. Furthermore, we use\nthe kernel trick to show that the computational complexity of our reformulated\noptimization problem is comparable to solving a deterministic variant of the\nchance-constrained optimization. We validate our formulation on two important\nrobotic/control applications: (i) reactive collision avoidance of mobile robots\nin uncertain dynamic environments and (ii) inverse dynamics based path tracking\nof manipulators under perception uncertainty. In both these applications, the\nunderlying chance constraints are defined over highly non-linear and non-convex\nfunctions of the uncertain parameters and possibly also decision variables. We\nalso benchmark our formulation with the existing approaches in terms of sample\ncomplexity and the achieved optimal cost highlighting significant improvements\nin both these metrics. \n\n"}

However, conventional solution approaches\noften rely on accurate estimates of uncertainty distributions, which may not\nexist. When the distributions are not known but can be limited to a set of\nplausible distributions, termed an ambiguity set, distributionally robust (DR)\noptimization can be used to ensure that chance constraints hold for all\ndistributions in that set. However, DR OPF yields conservative solutions if the\nambiguity set is too large. In this paper, we assess the value of using both\nmoment and unimodality information, which shrinks the ambiguity set and reduces\nconservatism, in DR OPF problems. Most practical uncertainty distributions in\npower systems are unimodal. Exact reformulations, approximations, and efficient\nsolving techniques were developed in a previous paper. This paper develops an\noptimal parameter selection approach that searches for an optimal\napproximation, significantly improving the computational efficiency and\nsolution quality.

The application of HUM crucially depends\non the spectral properties of the linearized NLS operator which are given in\ndetail. \n\n"}

It shows that even at branched point, as long as the\nnormalized energy is small enough, we have the energy decay estimate. Combined\nwith the previous work by Chun-Chi Lin, we get our first estimate that m-2\ndimensional Hausdorff measure of singular set is zero. Furthermore, by looking\nat the tangent map and using dimension reduction argument, we show that the\nsingular set is at least of codimension 3. \n\n"}

We construct a finite\ndifference method of the first order, by a combination of the upwind method,\nfor PDEs, and by a direct quadrature, for the boundary condition.

Numerical results for two problems, whose analytical\nsolutions are known in closed form, illustrate the theoretical finding. \n\n"}
