Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star\nformation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and\nintracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

The distinguishing property\nof the model is that the large ``stellar'' radius of 160 AU required to prevent\nadiabatic losses is not the true stellar radius, but rather, the radius of an\nopaque, unbound circumstellar envelope, created when 10 Msun was ejected in the\ndecade before the supernova in an eruption analogous to that of eta Carinae.\nThe supernova light is produced primarily by diffusion of thermal energy\nfollowing the passage of the blast wave through this shell. This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution. In\nour model, the weaker CSM interaction giving rise to SN2006gy's characteristic\nType IIn spectrum and soft X-rays is not linked to the power source of the\nvisual continuum; instead, it arises after the blast wave breaks free of the\nopaque shell into the surrounding wind.

Observationally, an increase in the\ndistance along the line-of-sight corresponds to an earlier cosmic time at which\nthe properties of the surveyed galaxy population may change. The effect of\nobserving a survey volume along the light-cone must be considered in the regime\nwhere the mass function of galaxies varies exponentially with redshift. This\noccurs when the halos under consideration are rare, that is either when they\nare very massive or observed at high-redshift. While the effect of the\nlight-cone is negligible for narrow-band surveys of Lyman-alpha emitters, it\ncan be significant for drop-out surveys of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) where\nthe selection functions of the photometric bands are broad. Since there are\nexponentially more halos at the low-redshift end of the survey, the\nlow-redshift tail of the selection function contains a disproportionate\nfraction of the galaxies observed in the survey.

We study the broadband emission of these\nsecondary pairs in the stellar photon and magnetic fields. Under certain\nassumptions on the stellar wind and the magnetic field in the surroundings of a\nmassive hot star, we calculate the steady state energy distribution of\nsecondary pairs created in the system and its radiation from radio to\ngamma-rays. Under the ambient magnetic field, possibly high enough to suppress\nelectromagnetic (EM) cascading, the energy of secondary pairs is radiated via\nsynchrotron and single IC scattering producing radio-to-gamma-ray radiation.\nThe synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) is hard, peaks around X-ray\nenergies, and becomes softer. The IC SED is hard as well and peaks around 10\nGeV, becoming also softer at higher energies due to synchrotron loss dominance.\nThe radio emission from secondary pairs is moderate and detectable as a\npoint-like and/or extended source. In X-rays, the secondary pair synchrotron\ncomponent may be dominant.

By comparing the iron abundances [Fe/H]\nwith calcium triplet (CaT) metallicities we show that the empirical CaT\ntechnique yields good agreement with the high-resolution data for [Fe/H]>-2\ndex, but tends to deviate at lower metallicities. We identify two metal poor\nstars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. These stars are found to\nhave enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios similar to those of stars in the Milky Way\nhalo. However, the bulk of the Carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/Fe]\nabundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One\nof our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost\nall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such a low\n[alpha/Fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an\nincomplete mixing of single Type Ia and II SNe events into the ISM. Our derived\nelement ratios are consistent with the episodic and extended SF in Carina known\nfrom its color-magnitude diagram. We find a considerable star-to-star scatter\nin the abundance ratios. This suggests that Carina's SF history varies with\nposition within the galaxy, with incomplete mixing. Alternatively, the SF rate\nis so low that the high-mass stellar IMF is sparsely populated, as\nstatistically expected in low-mass star clusters, leading to real scatter in\nthe resultant mass-integrated yields.

In our scenario, the KK protons (the KK\nexcited quarks/gluons within protons) within the framework of universal extra\ndimensions (UEDs), are produced by high energy p + p collisions in Fermi\naccelerated environments, with protonic isotropic spectrum d N / d E \\propto\nE^-2 up to at least 10^18 eV.

Thus far, claimed\ndetections of this emission in Coma are controversial (Fusco-Femiano et al.\n2004; Rossetti & Molendi 2004).

We fail to find statistically significant evidence for\nnon-thermal emission in the spectra, which are better described by only a\nsingle or multi-temperature model for the ICM. Including systematic\nuncertainties, we derive a 90% upper limit on the flux of non-thermal emission\nof 6.0x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 keV, for photon index of 2.0), which implies a\nlower limit on the cluster-averaged magnetic field of B>0.15 microG.

When computed correctly\nin the framework of excursion set theory, in fact, the \"local\" contribution\nvanishes (for all odd-point correlators the contribution of the image gaussian\ncancels the Press-Schechter contribution rather than adding up), and the result\ncomes entirely from non-trivial memory terms which are absent in PS theory.\nHowever it turns out that, in the limit of large halo masses, where the effect\nof non-Gaussianity is more relevant, these memory terms give a contribution\nwhich is the the same as that computed naively with PS theory, plus subleading\nterms depending on derivatives of the three-point correlator.

An analytical model including the main beam plasma instabilities is\ndeveloped. The full 3D dielectric tensor is thus explained for a cold\nrelativistic electron beam passing through a cold plasma, accounting for a\nguiding magnetic field, a return electronic current and moving protons.\nConsidering any orientations of the wave vector allows to retrieve the most\nunstable mode for any parameters set. An unified description of the\nFilamentation (Weibel), Two-Stream, Buneman, Bell instabilities (and more) is\nthus provided, allowing for the exact determination of their hierarchy in terms\nof the system parameters. For relevance to both real situations and PIC\nsimulations, the electron-to-proton mass ratio is treated as a parameter, and\nnumerical calculations are conducted with two different values, namely 1/1836\nand 1/100. In the system parameters phase space, the shape of the domains\ngoverned by each kind of instability is far from being trivial. For low density\nbeams, the ultra-magnetized regime tends to be governed by either the\nTwo-Stream or the Buneman instabilities.

The relation does not depend on cosmology, total lens\nmass, concentration or redshifts of the the lens and the lensed object.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail.

We develop a new algorithm to reconstruct\nthe gravitational potential of the Bullet Cluster, based on a non-uniform\nadaptive grid, combining strong and weak gravitational lensing data derived\nfrom deep HST/ACS F606W-F775W-F850LP and ground-based imaging. We exploit this\nimproved mass map to study z~5-6 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), which we detect\nas dropouts. One of the LBGs is multiply imaged, providing a geometric\nconfirmation of its high redshift, and is used to further improve our mass\nmodel. We quantify the uncertainties in the magnification map reconstruction in\nthe intrinsic source luminosity, and in the volume surveyed, and show that they\nare negligible compared to sample variance when determining the luminosity\nfunction of high-redshift galaxies. With shallower and comparable magnitude\nlimits to HUDF and GOODS, the Bullet cluster observations, after correcting for\nmagnification, probe deeper into the luminosity function of the high redshift\ngalaxies than GOODS and only slightly shallower than HUDF.

We find that the distribution of ages is bimodal\nwith a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ~\n2.5Gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. This is analogue to 'red\nsequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containing\nboth early and late type galaxies. The fraction of the young, rejuvenated\ngalaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing\nenvironmental density up to about 45 per cent. The rejuvenated galaxies have\nlower alpha/Fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoing\nstar formation through their emission line spectra.

{"id": "1004.3874", "contents": "Title: Loss of halo triaxiality due to bar formation Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations indicate that the dark matter haloes of\ngalaxies should be generally triaxial. Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

We use archival Hubble Space Telescope H-band images\nand Spitzer Space Telescope 3.6 micron wavelength images, both calibrated to\n2MASS K_s band, to penetrate the prominent dust lane in NGC 4565. We find a\nhigh surface brightness, central stellar component that is clearly distinct\nfrom the boxy bar and from the disk. Its brightness profile is a Sersic\nfunction with index n = 1.55 +- 0.07 along the major axis and 1.33 +- 0.12\nalong the minor axis. Therefore it is a pseudobulge. It is much less luminous\nthan the boxy bar, so the true pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the\ngalaxy is PB/T = 0.06 +- 0.01, much less than the previously believed value of\nB/T = 0.4 for the boxy bulge. We infer that published B/T luminosity ratios of\nedge-on galaxies with boxy bulges have been overestimated.

How these\ncool outflows arise is still in question. Hot gas from supernovae has long been\nsuspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendency\nto destroy the cool gas as the latter is accelerated. We propose a modification\nof the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty.\n  Star formation is observed to take place in clusters; in a given galaxy, the\nbulk of the star formation is found in the ~20 most massive clusters. We show\nthat, for L* galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with M>10^6 M_sun\nis able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circular\nvelocity of the disk galaxy. This cool gas can travel above the galactic disk\nin less than 2 Myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.\nOnce above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, and\nsupernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, which\ndrive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. Because the\nradiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gas\nis more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction if\nthey do eventually encounter hot gas. Therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,\nradiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. We identify these\ncluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. Another implication of\nour model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, are\nable to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism. We\nfind that the critical star formation rates above which large scale cool\noutflows will be launched to be ~0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2, which is in good agreement\nwith observations. \n\n"}

We carefully consider\ncorrelation functions of galaxies selected from both photometric and\nspectroscopic data, and cross-correlations between them, to obtain multiple\nmeasurements of the large-scale bias. We find, for our most robust analyses, a\nstrong increase in bias with luminosity for the most luminous galaxies, an\nintermediate regime where bias does not evolve strongly over a range of two\nmagnitudes in galaxy luminosity, and no evidence for an upturn in bias for\nfainter red galaxies.

We test closures for the turbulence energy\ncascade by filtering data from high-resolution simulations of forced isothermal\nand adiabatic turbulence. Optimal properties and an excellent correlation are\nfound for a linear combination of the eddy-viscosity closure that is employed\nin LES of weakly compressible turbulence and a term that is non-linear in the\nJacobian matrix of the velocity. Using this mixed closure, the SGS turbulence\nenergy model is validated in LES of turbulence with stochastic forcing. It is\nfound that the SGS model satisfies several important requirements: 1. The mean\nSGS turbulence energy follows a power law for varying grid scale. 2. The root\nmean square (RMS) Mach number of the unresolved velocity fluctuations is\nproportional to the RMS Mach number of the resolved turbulence, independent of\nthe forcing. 3.

The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. An\ninner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and creates\nadditional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. An\nouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster\ngas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. We describe\ncomputations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shocked\ncluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.\nRelativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interacting\nwith small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities. The\nevolution of Cygnus A is governed almost entirely by cosmic ray energy flowing\nfrom the hotspots. Mass flowing into hotspots from the jets is assumed to be\nsmall, greatly reducing the mass of gas flowing back along the jet, common in\nprevious calculations, that would disrupt the spatial segregation of\nsynchrotron-loss ages observed inside FR II radio lobes.

Here we present the results from the\nfirst radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulation including ionization\nfeedback, comparing an RMHD model of a 1000 M_sol rotating cloud to earlier\nradiation gas dynamical models with the same initial density and velocity\ndistributions. We find that despite starting with a strongly supercritical mass\nto flux ratio, the magnetic field has three effects. First, the field offers\nlocally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,\nsubstantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to\nthe gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the\ncollapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for\naccretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final\nmass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound\nup by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. However, this flow never\nachieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for two\nreasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central\nregions where the protostars form, and the expanding H II regions tend to\nfurther disrupt the field geometry.

We present new measurements of total stellar mass\n(M_star), H-alpha emission line strength (EW(H-alpha)), and specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) for the 94 galaxies published in H.-W.

The\nstrong dependence of R_MgII on M_star is most naturally explained, if more\nmassive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed MgII\nabsorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formation\nin the galaxies. The additional scaling relation of R_MgII with sSFR can be\nunderstood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburst\noutflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos.\nThe latter is motivated by the well-known sSFR--M_star} inverse correlation in\nfield galaxies.

For 14\nobjects we estimated dynamical masses suggesting no dark matter (DM) in 12 of\nthem and no more than 40 per cent DM mass fraction in the remaining two, in\ncontrast to findings for several UCDs in the Virgo cluster.

In these models, a tachyonic instability at\nthe end of inflation leads to a succession of exponentially large increases and\n\\emph{decreases} of the inflaton fluctuations as the inflaton condensate\noscillates around the minimum of its potential. The net effect is a competition\nbetween low-momentum modes which grow and decrease significantly, and modes\nwith higher momenta which grow less but also decrease less. We develop an\nanalytical description of this process, which is analogous to the quantum\nmechanical problem of tunneling through a volcano-shaped potential. Depending\non the parameters, preheating may be so efficient that it completes in less\nthan one oscillation of the inflaton condensate. Preheating after small field\ninflation may also be followed by a long matter-dominated stage before the\nuniverse thermalizes, depending on the energy scale of inflation and the\ndetails of the inflaton interactions. Finally, another feature of these models\nis that the spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations at the end of preheating may\nbe peaked around the Hubble scale. In fact, because preheating starts when the\nsecond slow-roll parameter $|\\eta|$ becomes of order unity while the first\nslow-roll parameter $\\epsilon$ is still much smaller than one, the universe is\nstill inflating during preheating and the modes amplified by the initial\ntachyonic instability leave the Hubble radius.

We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation\nto investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion\nand to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop\nin the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global\ncold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas\nconsumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode\n(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never\nexceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks\nat z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant\nthereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global\naccretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo\naccretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN\nfeedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered\nhaloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.\nConsequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode\nwould become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in\nthe cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep. \n\n"}

We show that\nsuch disruptions naturally occur in the framework of the Tidal Downsizing\nhypothesis for planet formation. We find that the characteristic planet-star\nseparation at which such \"hot disruptions\" occur is $R \\approx 0.03-0.2$ AU.\nThis result is independent of the planet's embryo mass but is dependent on the\naccretion rate in the disc. At high accretion rates, $\\dot M \\simgt\n10^{-6}\\msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryo is unable to contract quickly enough and is\ndisrupted.

Further, for survey forecasts and optimisation it is\nusually assumed the power-spectra covariance matrix is diagonal in\nFourier-space. But in the low-redshift Universe, non-linear mode-coupling will\ntend to correlate small-scale power, moving information from lower to\nhigher-order moments of the field. This movement of information will change the\npredictions of cosmological parameter accuracy.

We formulate a\nsystematic theoretical framework of entropy-based statistical mechanics for\nspherically symmetric collisionless self-gravitating systems. We use an\napproach that is very different from that of the conventional statistical\nmechanics of short-range interaction systems. We demonstrate that the\nequilibrium states of self-gravitating systems consist of both mechanical and\nstatistical equilibria, with the former characterized by a series of\nvelocity-moment equations and the latter by statistical equilibrium equations,\nwhich should be derived from the entropy principle. The velocity-moment\nequations of all orders are derived from the steady-state collisionless\nBoltzmann equation. We point out that the ergodicity is invalid for the whole\nself-gravitating systems, but it can be re-established locally. Based on the\nlocal ergodicity, using Fermi-Dirac-like statistics, with the nondegenerate\ncondition and the spatial independence of the local microstates, we rederive\nthe Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This is consistent with the validity of the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation, and should be the correct entropy form for\ncollisionless self-gravitating systems. Apart from the usual constraints of\nmass and energy conservation, we demonstrate that the series of moment or\nvirialization equations must be included as additional constraints on the\nentropy functional when performing the variational calculus; this is an\nextension to the original prescription by White & Narayan.

In this work, we present a model for the small-scale\ndynamo that takes into account the slope of the turbulent velocity spectrum\nv(l) ~ l^theta, where l and v(l) are the size of a turbulent fluctuation and\nthe typical velocity on that scale. The time evolution of the fluctuation\ncomponent of the magnetic field, i.e., the small-scale field, is described by\nthe Kazantsev equation. We solve this linear differential equation for its\neigenvalues with the quantum-mechanical WKB-approximation. The validity of this\nmethod is estimated as a function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. We\ncalculate the minimal magnetic Reynolds number for dynamo action, Rm_crit,\nusing our model of the turbulent velocity correlation function.

We address in a consistent fashion\nthe coupling between the day and the night sides of a planet by means of model\natmosphere calculations with heat redistribution. We assume that strong\nconvection leads to the same entropy on the day and night sides and that\ngravity is the same on both hemispheres. We argue that the core cooling rates\nfrom the two hemispheres of a strongly irradiated planet may not be the same\nand that the difference depends on several important parameters. If the\nday-night heat redistribution is very efficient or if it takes place at the\nlarge optical depth, then the day-side and the night-side cooling may be\ncomparable. However, if the day-night heat transport is not efficient or if it\ntakes place at a shallow optical depth then there can be a large difference\nbetween the day- and the night-side cooling and the night side will cool more\nefficiently.

The standard\nprocedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data and\nthus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which are\nusually subtle in low surface brightness systems. Taking advantage of the fact\nthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce\ndiscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the\nFourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of\nsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark\nmatter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. In addition to strong mass loss and\nrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation\nthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first\npericenter passage. These tidally induced bars persist for a few Gyr before\nbeing shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strong\nenough. We test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape of\nnearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the Milky Way. We detect inner bars in\nUrsa Minor, Sagittarius, LMC and possibly Carina. In addition, six out of\neleven studied dwarfs show elongated stellar distributions in the outer parts\nthat may signify transition to tidal tails.

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains. \n\n"}

Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the\nenergy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor\n~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of\nthe swept-up material. Energy-conserving outflows driven by fast AGN winds\n(v_in~0.1c) may therefore explain the momentum fluxes Pdot>>L_AGN/c of\ngalaxy-scale outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and ULIRGs. Shocked\nwind bubbles expanding normal to galactic disks may also explain the\nlarge-scale bipolar structures observed in some systems, including around the\nGalactic Center, and can produce significant radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray\nemission.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates.

We resolve this long-standing problem and find that\nHe in the GRB's host HII region is responsible for most of the absorption. We\nshow that the X-ray absorbing column density (N_Hx) is correlated with both the\nneutral gas column density and with the optical afterglow extinction (Av). This\ncorrelation explains the connection between dark bursts and bursts with high\nN_Hx values. From these correlations we exclude an origin of the X-ray\nabsorption which is not related to the host galaxy, i.e. the intergalactic\nmedium or intervening absorbers are not responsible. We find that the\ncorrelation with the dust column has a strong redshift evolution, whereas the\ncorrelation with the neutral gas does not. From this we conclude that the\ncolumn density of the X-ray absorption is correlated with the total gas column\ndensity in the host galaxy rather than the metal column density, in spite of\nthe fact that X-ray absorption is typically dominated by metals. The strong\nredshift evolution of N_Hx/Av is thus a reflection of the cosmic metallicity\nevolution of star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the absorption of X-rays\nin GRB afterglows is caused by He in the HII region hosting the GRB. While dust\nis destroyed and metals are stripped of all of their electrons by the GRB to\ngreat distances, the abundance of He saturates the He-ionising UV continuum\nmuch closer to the GRB, allowing it to remain in the neutral or singly-ionised\nstate.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit).

Abstract: We investigate the large-scale clustering and gravitational interaction of\nbaryons and dark matter (DM) over cosmic time using a set of collisionless\nN-body simulations. Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct\nprimordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe\nphysics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an\nunconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on\nat least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any\nscale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two\nspecies at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how\nthe primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are\nprogressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the\nBAO signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in\nthat of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low\nredshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of\nbaryons and DM differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0. The differences in\nthe amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10% at z\n= 9 and 1% at z = 0. These discrepancies are, however, smaller than effects\nexpected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the\npower spectrum and in the BAO peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected given\nthe precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys. Hence, our results\nvalidate the standard practice of modelling the observed galaxy distribution\nusing predictions for the total mass clustering in the Universe. \n\n"}

Our results are as\nfollows: a) Contrary to the results from our previous study, where all stellar\nparticles injected energy at a rate corresponding to a star of ~ 10 Msun, the\ndense gas is now completely evacuated from 10-pc regions around the stars\nwithin 10-20 Myr, suggesting that this feat is accomplished essentially by the\nmost massive stars. b) At the scale of the whole numerical simulations, the\ndense gas mass is reduced by up to an order of magnitude, although star\nformation (SF) never shuts off completely, indicating that the feedback\nterminates SF locally, but new SF events continue to occur elesewhere in the\nclouds. c) The SF efficiency (SFE) is maintained globally at the ~ 10% level,\nalthough locally, the cloud with largest degree of focusing of its accretion\nflow reaches SFE ~ 30%. d) The virial parameter of the clouds approaches unity\nbefore the stellar feedback begins to dominate the dynamics, becoming much\nlarger once feedback dominates, suggesting that clouds become unbound as a\nconsequence of the stellar feedback. e) The erosion of the filaments that feed\nthe star-forming clumps produces chains of isolated dense blobs reminiscent of\nthose observed in the vicinity of the dark globule B68. \n\n"}

Application in the\n  redshift range 0-1.1 Abstract: Long Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) are related to the final stages of evolution of\nmassive stars.

The relation between the rate of\nLGRBs in a given galaxy and its SFR (that we call the LGRB \"bias\") may be\ncomplex, as we have indications that the LGRB hosts are not perfect analogues\nto the general population of SFGs. In this work, we try to quantify the\ndependence of the LGRB bias on physical parameters of their host galaxy such as\nthe SFR or the stellar mass. We propose an empirical method based on the\ncomparison of stellar mass functions (and SFR distributions) of LGRB hosts and\nof SFGs in order to find how the bias depends on the stellar mass or the SFR.\nBy applying this method to a sample of LGRB hosts at redshifts lower than 1.1,\nwhere the properties of SFGs are well established, and where the properties of\nLGRB host galaxies can be deduced from observations (for stellar masses larger\nthan 10**9.25 Msun and SFR larger than 1.8 Msun / yr), we find that the LGRB\nbias depends on both the stellar mass and SFR. We find that the bias decreases\nwith the SFR, i.e. we see no preference for highly SFGs, once taken into\naccount the larger number of massive stars in galaxies with larger SFR. We do\nnot find any trend with the specific star formation rate (SSFR) but the\ndynamical range in SSFR in our study is narrow. Although through an indirect\nmethod, we relate these trends to a possible decrease of the LGRBs rate / SFR\nratio with the metallicity. The method we propose suggests trends that may be\nuseful to constrain models of LGRB progenitors, showing a clear decrease of the\nLGRB bias with the metallicity.

Simulations and test observations demonstrate feasibility Abstract: The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a new low frequency interferomeric\nradio telescope. The MWA is the low frequency precursor to the Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) and is the first of three SKA precursors to be operational,\nsupporting a varied science mission ranging from the attempted detection of the\nEpoch of Reionisation to the monitoring of solar flares and space weather. We\nexplore the possibility that the MWA can be used for the purposes of Space\nSituational Awareness (SSA). In particular we propose that the MWA can be used\nas an element of a passive radar facility operating in the frequency range 87.5\n- 108 MHz (the commercial FM broadcast band). In this scenario the MWA can be\nconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM\nbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. The FM broadcasts\npropagate into space, are reflected off debris in Earth orbit, and are received\nat the MWA. The imaging capabilities of the MWA can be used to simultaneously\ndetect multiple pieces of space debris, image their positions on the sky as a\nfunction of time, and provide tracking data that can be used to determine\norbital parameters. Such a capability would be a valuable addition to\nAustralian and global SSA assets, in terms of southern and eastern hemispheric\ncoverage. We provide a feasibility assessment of this proposal, based on simple\ncalculations and electromagnetic simulations that shows the detection of\nsub-metre size debris should be possible (debris radius of >0.5 m to ~1000 km\naltitude). We also present a proof-of-concept set of observations that\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, based on the detection and\ntracking of the International Space Station via reflected FM broadcast signals\noriginating in south-west Western Australia.

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions. This may be due\nto the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism. \n\n"}

This arises from the\nsteepening of the effective potential as it interpolates between a flat\ninflationary plateau and the high barrier separating us from our parent vacuum.\nWe demonstrate that these two effects can be parametrically separated in\nangular scale.\n  Observationally, the steepening effect appears to be excluded at large l; but\nit remains consistent with the slight lack of power below l about 30 found by\nthe WMAP and Planck collaborations.

We study here the robustness of these tests to the presence of DE\ndensity, velocity, and anisotropic stress perturbations. We find that the\ndispersion in the growth index parameter remains small enough to distinguish\nbetween extreme cases of DE models and some commonly used modified gravity\nmodels. The sign of the slope parameter for a redshift dependent growth index\nwas found to be inconsistent as an additional test in extreme cases of DE\nmodels with perturbations. Next, we studied the effect of DE perturbations on\nthe modified growth (MG) parameters that enter the perturbed Einstein\nequations. We find that while the dark energy perturbations affect the MG\nparameters, the deviations remain smaller than those due to modified gravity\nmodels. Additionally, the deviations due to DE perturbations with a non-zero\neffective sound speed occur at scale ranges that are completely different than\nthose due to some modified gravity models such as the $f(R)$ models. In the\ncase of modified gravity models with zero anisotropic stress at late times, the\nsimultaneous determination of the effective dark energy equation of state and\nthe MG parameters can provide the distinction between these models and DE. The\ngrowth index test was found to be the most robust to these perturbations. The\nscale dependence of the MG parameters in some cases of modified gravity\nconstitute a clear-cut discriminant regardless of any DE perturbations. In\nsummary, we find that the currently proposed cosmological tests to distinguish\nbetween DE and modified gravity are robust to DE perturbations even for extreme\ncases. This is certainly the case even for DE models with equations of state of\nDE that fall well outside of current cosmological constraints. \n\n"}

The common practice is to\naugment an external calibration solution using a known reference signal with an\ninternal calibration on the unknown measurement signal itself. Contemporary\nself-calibration schemes try to find a self-consistent solution for signal and\ncalibration by exploiting redundancies in the measurements. This can be\nunderstood in terms of maximizing the joint probability of signal and\ncalibration. However, the full uncertainty structure of this joint probability\naround its maximum is thereby not taken into account by these schemes.\nTherefore better schemes -- in sense of minimal square error -- can be designed\nby accounting for asymmetries in the uncertainty of signal and calibration.

This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source\nluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases which\ncould affect conclusions in studies. METHODS. We study IR-selected AGN in the\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey (COSMOS).\nThe AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into\nunobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical\nspectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic\nluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take\nthe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different\nmethods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies,\nwe also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing\nsource AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population\n(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing\nobscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of the\nobscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted\ntype-1/type-2 classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN\nIR-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured AGN, but only at\nintermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN IR-selection\nis more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are\nintrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in\nmore type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is.

While more and more\nmultiwave observations of magnetars are available, unfortunately, we see\naccumulating failed predictions of the traditional magnetar model. These\nchallenges urge rethinking of magnetar. Wind braking of magnetars is one of the\nalternative modelings.

For radio emission from a helical magnetic field,\nthe polarization as a function of the square of the wavelength becomes\nasymmetric with respect to zero.

M87 and its Globular\n  Clusters Abstract: We study the Globular Cluster (GC) system of the nearby elliptical galaxy M87\nusing the newly available dataset with accurate kinematics (Strader et\nal.2011). We find evidence for three distinct sub-populations of GCs in terms\nof colours, kinematics and radial profiles. We show that a decomposition into\nthree populations (blue, intermediate and red GCs) is statistically preferred\nto one with two or four populations, and relate them to the stellar profile. We\nexploit the sub-populations to derive dynamical constraints on the mass and\nDark Matter (DM) content of M87 out to $\\sim100$ kpc. We use a class of global\nmass-estimators (from Paper I), obtaining mass measurements at different\nlocations. M87's DM fraction changes from $\\approx$0.2 at the starlight's\neffective radius (6 kpc) to $\\approx$0.95 at the distance probed by the most\nextended, blue GCs (135 kpc). We supplement this with \\textit{virial\ndecompositions}, exploiting the dynamical model to produce a separation into\nmultiple components. These yield the luminous mass as $5.5^{+1.5}_{-2.0}\\times\n10^{11}M_\\odot$ and the DM within 135 kpc as $8.0^{+1.0}_{-4.0}\\times\n10^{12}M_\\odot.$ The inner DM density behaves as $\\rho \\sim r^{-\\gamma}$ with\n$\\gamma\\approx 1.6$. This is steeper than the cosmologically preferred cusp\n$\\rho \\sim r^{-1},$ providing evidence of DM contraction.

The centrally concentrated red GCs\nexhibit tangential anisotropy, consistent with radial-orbit depletion by tidal\nshredding.

Optically thin regime Abstract: An accurate treatment of the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) in\nhydrodynamic galaxy simulations requires that we follow not only the thermal\nevolution of the gas, but also the evolution of its chemical state, including\nits molecular chemistry, without assuming chemical (including ionisation)\nequilibrium. We present a reaction network that can be used to solve for this\nthermo-chemical evolution. Our model follows the evolution of all ionisation\nstates of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling rate, along with important\nmolecules such as H2 and CO, and the intermediate molecular species that are\ninvolved in their formation (20 molecules in total). We include chemical\nreactions on dust grains, thermal processes involving dust, cosmic ray\nionisation and heating and photochemical reactions. We focus on conditions\ntypical for the diffuse ISM, with densities of 10^-2 cm^-3 < nH < 10^4 cm^-3\nand temperatures of 10^2 K < T < 10^4 K, and we consider a range of radiation\nfields, including no UV radiation. In this paper we consider only gas that is\noptically thin, while paper II considers gas that becomes shielded from the\nradiation field. We verify the accuracy of our model by comparing chemical\nabundances and cooling functions in chemical equilibrium with the\nphotoionisation code Cloudy.

This new model is used to investigate the effect of such a\nfeedback on shaping the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution. Star\nformation activity is significantly suppressed in dwarf galaxies by the new\nfeedback effect, and the faint-end slope of local luminosity functions can be\nreproduced with a reasonable strength of supernova feedback, which is in\ncontrast to the previous models that require a rather extreme strength of\nsupernova feedback.

Because of the\ndense circumstellar medium, the shocked region is assumed to be radiative and\nmake a thin dense shell. The model is based on the conservation of momentum in\nthe shocked dense shell. However, the analytic model was mentioned to neglect\nthe 'snow-plow' phase of the shocked dense shell by Ofek et al. (2014). The\n'snow-plow' or momentum-conserving phase refers to the period in which the\nmomentum injection from the supernova ejecta is almost terminated and the\nradiative shocked dense shell keeps moving due only to the momentum previously\nprovided by the supernova ejecta. In this Note, I clarify that the analytic\nmodel of Moriya et al. (2013) does take the 'snow-plow' phase into account and\nthe criticism of Ofek et al. (2014) is incorrect.

We implement a new galaxy-wide stellar initial\nmass function (Top Heavy Integrated Galaxy Initial Mass Function, TH-IGIMF) in\nthe semi-analytic model SAG and evaluate its impact on the chemical evolution\nof galaxies. The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key\nto reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation. Massive galaxies reach\nhigher [a/Fe] abundance ratios because they are characterized by more top-heavy\nIMFs as a result of their higher SFR. As a consequence of our analysis, the\nvalue of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the\nembedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the\nTH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively.\nA mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a\nuniversal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF.

We characterize the magnitude of these\ncontributions at third-order in perturbation theory by identifying the\ncoefficients of the non-local invariant operators, and extend our calculation\nto include non-local (Lagrangian) terms induced by a peak constraint.

We focus on haloes\nidentified at redshift z_id=0 and show that the classic ellipsoidal collapse\nmodel systematically overestimates their collapse times. If one imposes that\nhalo collapse takes place at z_id, this model requires starting from a\nsignificantly lower linear density contrast than what is measured in the\nsimulations at the locations of halo formation. We attempt to explain this\ndiscrepancy by testing two key assumptions of the model. First, we show that\nthe tides felt by collapsing haloes due to the surrounding large-scale\nstructure evolve non-linearly. Although this effect becomes increasingly\nimportant for low-mass haloes, accounting for it in the ellipsoidal collapse\nmodel only marginally improves the agreement with N-body simulations. Second,\nwe track the time evolution of the physical volume occupied by forming haloes\nand show that, after turnaround, it generally stabilizes at a well-defined\nredshift, z_c>z_id, contrary to the basic assumption of extended\nPress-Schechter theory based on excursion sets. We discuss the implications of\nthis result for understanding the origin of the mass-dependence and scatter in\nthe linear threshold for halo formation.

Methods: The properties of the dust are derived from the\nwavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddened\nType Ia SN: 1986G, 2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J. [...] Results: All four objects\nare characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios\n(R_V) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized by\nvery blue polarization peaks. In all cases the polarization position angle is\nwell aligned with the local spiral structure. While SN~1986G is compatible with\nthe most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the Galaxy,\nSN2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J show unprecedented behaviours.

The polarization properties can be interpreted\nin terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. The anomalous\nbehaviour is apparently associated with the properties of the galactic\nenvironment in which the SN explode, rather than with the progenitor system\nfrom which they originate.

The AM originates in co-planar\nstreams of cold gas and merging galaxies tracing cosmic-web filaments, and it\nundergoes four phases of evolution. (I) Outside the halo virial radius ($R_{\\rm\nv}\\!\\sim\\!100\\,{\\rm kpc}$), the elongated streams gain AM by tidal torques with\na specific AM (sAM) $\\sim\\!1.7$ times the dark-matter (DM) spin due to the gas'\nhigher quadrupole moment. This AM is expressed as stream impact parameters,\nfrom $\\sim\\!0.3R_{\\rm v}$ to counter rotation. (II) In the outer halo, while\nthe incoming DM mixes with the existing halo of lower sAM to a spin\n$\\lambda_{\\rm dm}\\!\\sim\\!0.04$, the cold streams transport the AM to the inner\nhalo such that their spin in the halo is $\\sim\\!3\\lambda_{\\rm dm}$. (III) Near\npericenter, the streams dissipate into an irregular rotating ring extending to\n$\\sim\\!0.3R_{\\rm v}$ and tilted relative to the inner disc. Torques exerted\npartly by the disc make the ring gas lose AM, spiral in, and settle into the\ndisc within one orbit. The ring is observable with 30\\% probability as a damped\nLyman-$\\alpha$ absorber. (IV) Within the disc, $<\\!0.1R_{\\rm v}$, torques\nassociated with violent disc instability drive AM out and baryons into a\ncentral bulge, while outflows remove low-spin gas, introducing certain\nsensitivity to feedback strength. Despite the different AM histories of gas and\nDM, the disc spin is comparable to the DM-halo spin. Counter rotation can\nstrongly affect disc evolution. \n\n"}

Recent studies have pointed out that extracting\nmerger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial;\ndifferent tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. These\ndifferences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used as\ninput for models of galaxy formation. We investigate the impact of different\nhalo merger trees on a semi-analytic model.

The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of\nsatellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different\nconstruction methods.

We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies.

We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of\nthe 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel\ndetector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional\ndecorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically\ndifferent method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which\nwe call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect\nvery effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the\nfluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and\nvalidate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to\nprevious analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in\nSpitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be\nintractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b\neclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating\ninefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong\nmolecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5\nmicron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by\nSpitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy.

We study the cluster A209 by using the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic data\ncombined with Subaru photometry, yielding to 1916 cluster members down to a\nstellar mass of 10^{8.6} Msun.

The stellar mass function of the star-forming\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passive\ngalaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. The color distribution of the\nintra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. The\nanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies have\ntangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the BCG. The mass-size\nrelation of low-mass passive ETGs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,\nand its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies.

The comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profiles\nindicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction. Our results are\nconsistent with a scenario in which the \"environmental quenching\" of low-mass\ngalaxies is due to mechanisms such as harassment out to R200, starvation and\nram-pressure stripping at smaller radii, as supported by the analysis of the\nmass function, of the dynamical orbits and of the mass-size relation of passive\nearly-types in different regions.

One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,\nrequiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of\nlight species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain\naxion-driven inflation. Here we show that there is no such problem when we\ncorrectly renormalize models with many light species, taking the {\\it physical}\nPlanck scale to be $M^2_{pl} \\gtrsim N {\\cal M}_{UV}^2$, where ${\\cal M}_{UV}$\nis the cutoff for the QFT coupled to semiclassical quantum gravity. The number\nof light species then cancels out of the gravitational entropy of de Sitter or\nnear-de Sitter backgrounds at leading order. Working in detail with $N$ scalar\nfields in de Sitter space, renormalized to one loop order, we show that the\ngravitational entropy automatically obeys the covariant entropy bound.\nFurthermore, while the axion decay constant is a strong coupling scale for the\naxion dynamics, we show that it is {\\it not} in general the cutoff of 4d\nsemiclassical gravity.

It is the earliest known galaxy\nwhere the interstellar medium (ISM) has been detected; dust emission was\ndetected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also\nunusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is\ntherefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical\ngalaxy at this redshift. We observed A1689-zD1 with ALMA in bands 6 and 7 and\nwith the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in band $Q$. To study the structure of\nA1689-zD1, we map the mm thermal dust emission and find two spatial components\nwith sizes about $0.4-1.7$\\,kpc (lensing-corrected). The rough spatial\nmorphology is similar to what is observed in the near-infrared with {\\it HST}\nand points to a perturbed dynamical state, perhaps indicative of a major merger\nor a disc in early formation.

Although an\nincreasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void\nstudies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position\nerrors of $\\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable.

It presents a rich molecular chemistry\ncharacterized by large abundances of deuterated and complex molecules.\nFurthermore, it hosts an extremely young Class 0 object and one candidate to\nFirst Hydrostatic Core (FHSC). Our aim was to determine the cosmic ray\nionization rate and the depletion factors in this extremely young star forming\nregion. We carried out a spectral survey towards Barnard 1b as part of the IRAM\nLarge program ASAI using the IRAM 30-m telescope at Pico Veleta (Spain). This\nprovided a very complete inventory of neutral and ionic C-, N- and S- bearing\nspecies with, up to our knowledge, the first secure detections of the\ndeuterated ions DCS+ and DOCO+. We used a state-of-the-art\npseudo-time-dependent gas-phase chemical model to determine the value of the\ncosmic ray ionization rate and the depletion factors. The observational data\nwere well fitted with $\\zeta_{H_2}$ between 3E-17 s$^{-1}$ and 1E-16 s$^{-1}$.\nElemental depletions were estimated to be ~10 for C and O, ~1 for N and ~25 for\nS. Barnard B1b presents similar depletions of C and O than those measured in\npre-stellar cores. The depletion of sulfur is higher than that of C and O but\nnot as extreme as in cold cores. In fact, it is similar to the values found in\nsome bipolar outflows, hot cores and photon-dominated regions. Several\nscenarios are discussed to account for these peculiar abundances. We propose\nthat it is the consequence of the initial conditions (important outflows and\nenhanced UV fields in the surroundings) and a rapid collapse (~0.1 Myr) that\npermits to maintain most S- and N-bearing species in gas phase to great optical\ndepths. The interaction of the compact outflow associated with B1b-S with the\nsurrounding material could enhance the abundances of S-bearing molecules, as\nwell. \n\n"}

Since most of the\nelements visible in X-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse\n(SNcc) supernovae, measuring their abundances gives us direct information on\nthe nucleosynthesis products of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star\nformation peak (z ~ 2-3).

Abstract: Galaxy observations and N-body cosmological simulations produce conflicting\ndark matter halo density profiles for galaxy central regions. While simulations\nsuggest a cuspy and universal density profile (UDP) of this region, the\nmajority of observations favor variable profiles with a core in the center. In\nthis paper, we investigate the convergency of standard N-body simulations,\nespecially in the cusp region, following the approach proposed by\n\\protect{\\citep{13}}. We simulate the well known Hernquist model using the SPH\ncode Gadget-3 and consider the full array of dynamical parameters of the\nparticles. We find that, although the cuspy profile is stable, all integrals of\nmotion characterizing individual particles suffer strong unphysical variations\nalong the whole halo, revealing an effective interaction between the test\nbodies. This result casts doubts on the reliability of the velocity\ndistribution function obtained in the simulations. Moreover, we find unphysical\nFokker-Planck streams of particles in the cusp region. The same streams should\nappear in cosmological N-body simulations, being strong enough to change the\nshape of the cusp or even to create it. Our analysis, based on the Hernquist\nmodel and the standard SPH code, strongly suggests that the UDPs generally\nfound by the cosmological N-body simulations may be a consequence of numerical\neffects. A much better understanding of the N-body simulation convergency is\nnecessary before a 'core-cusp problem' can properly be used to question the\nvalidity of the CDM model. \n\n"}

Given the depth and area of\nASPECS, we would expect to tentatively detect 35 galaxies extrapolating the\nMeurer z~0 IRX-beta relation to z>~2 (assuming T_d~35 K). However, only 6\ntentative detections are found at z>~2 in ASPECS, with just three at >3sigma.\nSubdividing z=2-10 galaxies according to stellar mass, UV luminosity, and\nUV-continuum slope and stacking the results, we only find a significant\ndetection in the most massive (>10^9.75 Msol) subsample, with an infrared\nexcess (IRX=L_{IR}/L_{UV}) consistent with previous z~2 results.

These\nresults demonstrate the relevance of stellar mass for predicting the IR\nluminosity of z>~2 galaxies.

We use these results to revisit recent\nestimates of the z>~3 SFR density.

We find that a reduced quasar background brings the column\ndensity predictions into better agreement with recent data.

We improve the treatment of dust\ngrowth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the\ntemperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From\ndetailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si/H]_{gas}\nmeasured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average\n[Si/H]_{gas} and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical\nconstraint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that\ndecreases with the gas temperature. The synthetic relation constructed from the\nspatial dust distribution reproduces the slope of -0.5 of the observed relation\nin cold clouds. This slope is steeper than that for the warm medium and is\nexplained by the dust growth. We find that it occurs for all adopted values of\nthe minimum grain size a_{min} from 1 to 5nm. For the classical cut-off of\na_{min}=5 nm, the ion-grain interactions result in longer growth timescales and\nhigher [Si/H]_{gas} than the observed values.

For dust, we consider a simplified model of grain size\ndistribution by representing the entire range of grain sizes with large and\nsmall grains. We include dust production in stellar ejecta, dust destruction by\nsupernova (SN) shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain\ndisruption by shattering.

The\nnon-thermal WIMP becomes important when the reheating temperature is well below\nthe freeze-out temperature. Usually, two limiting cases have been considered.\nOne is that the produced high energetic dark matter particles are quickly\nthermalized due to the elastic scattering with background radiations. The\ncorresponding relic abundance is determined by the thermally averaged\nannihilation cross-section at the reheating temperature. The other one is that\nthe initial abundance is too small for the dark matter to annihilate so that\nthe final relic is determined by the initial amount itself. We study the\nregions between these two limits, and show that the relic density depends not\nonly on the annihilation rate, but also on the elastic scattering rate.\nEspecially, the relic abundance of the p-wave annihilating dark matter\ncrucially relies on the elastic scattering rate because the annihilation\ncross-section is sensitive to the dark matter velocity.

We show that instantaneous\nmasses and maximum circular velocities of individual subhaloes are extremely\nnoisy, despite the use of a sophisticated, phase-space-based halo finder. We\nalso show that subhaloes experience frequent penetrating encounters with other\nsubhaloes (on average about one per dynamical time), and that subhaloes whose\napo-center lies outside the virial radius of their host (the 'ejected' or\n'backsplash' haloes) experience tidal forces that modify their orbits. This\nresults in an average fractional subhalo exchange rate among host haloes of\nroughly 0.01 per Gyr (at the present time). In addition, we show that there are\nthree distinct disruption channels; one in which subhaloes drop below the mass\nresolution limit of the simulation, one in which subhaloes merge with their\nhost halo largely driven by dynamical friction, and one in which subhaloes\nabruptly disintegrate.

During de-Sitter expansion there is an equilibrium solution for\nthe spectator field which is often used to estimate the stochastic distribution\nduring slow-roll inflation.

Abstract: A large fraction of baryons predicted from the standard cosmology has been\nmissing observationally. Although previous numerical simulations have indicated\nthat most of the missing baryons reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nWarm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), it is generally very difficult to detect\nsignatures from such a diffuse gas. In this work, we focus on the hyperfine\ntransition of neutral hydrogen (HI) called 21-cm line as a tool to trace the\nWHIM. For the purpose, we first construct the map of the 21-cm signals by using\nthe data provided by the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation\nproject, Illustris, in which detailed processes affecting the dynamical and\nthermal evolution of the WHIM are implemented. From the comparison with the\nconstructed 21-cm signal map with the expected noise level of the Square\nKilometre Array phase 1 mid-frequency instrument (SKA1-mid), we find that the\n21-cm signals from the filamentary structures at redshifts z=0.5-3 are\ndetectable with the SKA1-mid if we assume the angular resolution of\n\\Delta\\theta > 10 arcmin and the observing time of t_obs > 100 hours.

In the case\nof chameleon theories, the screening has two contributions -- self-screening,\nwhich is due to the mass of an object itself, and environmental screening,\nwhich is caused by the surrounding matter -- which are often entangled, with\nthe second contribution being more crucial for less massive objects. A\nquantitative understanding of the effect of the environment on the screening\ncan prove critical in observational tests of such theories using systems such\nas the Local Group and dwarf galaxies, for which the environment may be\ninferred in various ways.

This behaviour is well captured by simplified screen models.\nScatter in the IRX-beta relation is dominated by three major effects: (i) older\nstellar populations drive galaxies below the relations defined for local\nstarbursts due to a reddening of their intrinsic UV SEDs; (ii) complex\ngeometries in high-z heavily star forming galaxies drive galaxies toward blue\nUV slopes owing to optically thin UV sightlines; (iii) shallow extinction\ncurves drive galaxies downward in the IRX-beta plane due to lowered NUV/FUV\nextinction ratios. We use these features of the UV slopes of galaxies to derive\na fitting relation that reasonably collapses the scatter back toward the\ncanonical local relation. Finally, we use these results to develop an\nunderstanding for the location of two particularly enigmatic populations of\ngalaxies in the IRX-beta plane: z~2-4 dusty star forming galaxies, and z>5 star\nforming galaxies. \n\n"}

In two-dimensional systems, Alfv\\'enic outflows expel\nenergetic electrons into flux ropes where they become trapped and disconnected\nfrom acceleration regions. However, in three-dimensional systems these flux\nropes develop axial structure that enables particles to leak out and return to\nacceleration regions.

In the canonical\ntruncated disk model of moderately low accretion rate systems, gas in the inner\nregion of the accretion disk occupies a hot, radiatively inefficient phase,\nwhich leads to a geometrically thick disk, while the gas in the outer region\noccupies a cooler, radiatively efficient phase that resides in the standard\ngeometrically thin disk. Observationally, there is strong empirical evidence to\nsupport this phenomenological model, but a detailed understanding of the\ndynamics of truncated disks is lacking. We present a well-resolved viscous,\nhydrodynamic simulation that uses an ad hoc cooling prescription to drive a\nthermal instability and, hence, produce the first sustained truncated accretion\ndisk.

On large scales about one percent\nof the total lensing-induced B-mode amplitude is expected to be due to this\neffect. However, the photon emission angle does remain orthogonal to the\nperturbed last-scattering surface due to time delay, and half of the\nlarge-scale emission-angle B modes cancel with B modes from time delay to give\na total contribution of about half a percent.

The total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity is key for this analysis but\npoorly constrained in normal (main-sequence) star-forming z > 5 galaxies where\noften only one single FIR point is available. To better inform estimates of the\nFIR luminosity, we construct a sample of local galaxies and three low-redshift\nanalogs of z > 5 systems. The trends in this sample suggest that normal\nhigh-redshift galaxies have a warmer infrared (IR) SED compared to average z <\n4 galaxies that are used as prior in these studies. The blue-shifted peak and\nmid-IR excess emission could be explained by a combination of a larger fraction\nof the metal-poor inter-stellar medium (ISM) being optically thin to\nultra-violet (UV) light and a stronger UV radiation field due to high star\nformation densities.

We propose\nthat this relation could arise from collisional interactions between baryons\nand dark matter (DM) particles, without the need for modification of gravity or\nad hoc feedback processes. We assume that these interactions satisfy the\nfollowing three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is\ncomparable to the dynamical time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy\nwith baryons due to elastic collisions; (iii) the product between the baryon-DM\ncross section and the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely\nproportional to the DM number density. We present an example of a particle\nphysics model that gives a DM-baryon cross section with the desired density and\nvelocity dependence. Direct detection constraints require our DM particles to\nbe either very light ($m << m_b$) or very heavy ($m >> m_b$), corresponding\nrespectively to heating and cooling of DM by baryons. In both cases, our\nmechanism applies and an equilibrium configuration can in principle be reached.\nHere, we focus on the heavy DM/cooling case as it is technically simpler.

The updated model for MACS\nJ0025.4-1222 suggests a substantially smaller critical area than previously\nestimated. For MACS J0159.8-0849 and Abell 697 we find a single peak and\nrelatively regular morphology, revealing fairly relaxed clusters.

If an\ninner Lindblad resonance (ILR) lies within the disk, ingoing waves are robustly\nexcited, and the angular-momentum flux they carry is independent of Mach\nnumber. But in most CVs, the ILR lies outside the disk. The wave flux and its\nscaling with Mach number are then very sensitive to conditions near the disk\nedge. If the temperature and sound speed vanish there, excitation tends to be\nexponentially suppressed. If the Mach number remains finite in the outer parts\nbut the radial and vertical density scale lengths become comparable due to\nsubkeplerian rotation, resonance can occur with acoustic-cutoff and\nstratification frequencies. These previously neglected resonances excite waves,\nbut the Mach-number scaling remains very steep if the radial scale length\ndecreases gradually.

In this way, this result\ngeneralizes those previously obtained for the growth of matter overdensities in\nthe case of minimal $f(T)$ gravity.

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary\nsystems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those\nfound around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to\nbe extremely rare in such environments. \n\n"}

The first one is a known visual binary\nADS 4022, and we found that it is a quadruple system, composed of two\nspectroscopic binaries, one of which shows eclipses. None of the systems was\npreviously recognized as a spectroscopic binary.\n  We collected a number of high-resolution optical and IR spectra to calculate\nthe radial velocities (RVs) and later combined them with MITSuME and ASAS\nphotometry. The IR spectra were crucial for secure identification of the cooler\ncomponents' lines. RV measurements were done with the TODCOR technique, and RV\ncurves modelled with our own procedure V2FIT. Light curve modelling was\nperformed with JKTEBOP and PHOEBE codes. Temperatures and metallicities of two\nsystems were estimated from spectra. For the ADS 4022 system we also used the\narchival WDS data and new SOAR observations in order to derive the orbit of the\nvisual pair for the first time.

After the dynamical friction phase, when the two SMBHs become\ngravitationally bound to each other, and a brief stage of initial rapid\nhardening, the orbit gradually continues to shrink due to three-body\ninteractions with stars that enter the loss cone of the binary. Using the\nstellar-dynamical Monte Carlo code Raga, we explore the co-evolution of the\nbinary SMBH and the nuclear star cluster in this slow stage, for various\ncombinations of parameters (geometry of the star cluster, primary/secondary\nSMBH mass, initial eccentricity, inclusion of stellar captures/tidal\ndisruptions). We compare the rates of stellar captures in galactic nuclei\ncontaining a binary to those of galaxies with a single SMBH. At early times,\nthe rates are substantially higher in the case of a binary SMBH, but\nsubsequently they drop to lower levels. Only in triaxial systems both the\nbinary hardening rates and the capture rates remain sufficiently high during\nthe entire evolution. We find that the hardening rate is not influenced by star\ncaptures, nor does it depend on eccentricity; however, it is higher when the\ndifference between the black hole masses is greater. We confirm that the\neccentricity of the binary tends to grow, which may significantly shorten the\ncoalescence time due to earlier onset of gravitational-wave emission. We also\nexplore the properties of the orbits entering the loss cone, and demonstrate\nthat it remains partially full throughout the evolution in the triaxial case,\nbut significantly depleted in the axisymmetric case. Finally, we study the\ndistribution of ejected hypervelocity stars and the corresponding mass deficits\nin the central parts of the galaxies hosting a binary, and argue that the\nmissing mass is difficult to quantify observationally. \n\n"}

I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an\norder of magnitude lower than the linear theory Jeans mass, and that even if\none defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the\nevolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass,\nwhich corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are\nsmoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the\ncharacteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on\nstructure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a\nsingle characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In\ncontrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal\nhistory of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it\naccounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas\ndistribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic\nsuppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to\nfind an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total\nmass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple\nfitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass.

The method relies upon the observation that all\nrich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequence\nof early-type galaxies. The emerging picture is that all rich clusters contain\na core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies which are coeval\nand formed at high redshifts. The proposed search method exploits this strong\nempirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity.\nThe fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters,\ncluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normal\ngalaxies at lower redshifts. A simple color cut thus virtually eliminates all\nforeground contamination, even at significant redshifts. In this paper, one of\na series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques of\nthe method in detail, and contrast the method with those used by other authors.\nWe provide a brief demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique using\nreal redshift data, and from this conclude that the method offers a powerful\nyet simple way of identify galaxy clusters.

In this brief review I discuss and summarize the redshift\ninformation which has been gleaned to date for the ~ 50 bright sub-mm sources\nwhich have been uncovered via the six main classes of survey performed with\nSCUBA on the JCMT over the last 2-3 years. Despite the biases inherent in some\nof these surveys, and the crudeness of the redshift information available in\nothers, I conclude that all current information suggests that only 10-15 % of\nluminous sub-mm sources lie at z < 2, and that the median redshift of this\npopulation is z ~ 3. I suggest that such a high median redshift is arguably not\nunexpected given current theories designed to explain the correlation between\nblack-hole mass and spheroid mass found at low redshift. In such scenarios,\npeak AGN emission is expected to correspond to, or even to cause termination of\nmajor star-formation activity in the host spheroid. In contrast, maximum dust\nemission is expected to occur roughly half-way through the star-formation\nprocess. Given that optical emission from bright quasars peaks at z = 2.5,\ndust-emission from massive ellipticals might be reasonably expected to peak at\nsome point in the preceding ~ 1 Gyr, at z ~ 3.

We find that most prescriptions give broadly\nsimilar results: the ratio of cold gas to stars in the final galaxies is\nprimarily controlled by the range of gas densities where star formation is\nallowed to proceed efficiently. In the absence of feedback, the fraction of gas\nthat cools is much too high resulting, for example, in a K-band luminosity\nfunction that is much brighter than observed. This problem is ameliorated by\nincluding a feedback model which either imparts radial kinetic perturbations to\ngalactic gas or directly reheats such material and prevents it from cooling for\na certain period of time. In both these models, a significant fraction of cold\ngas is heated and expelled from haloes with an efficiency that varies inversely\nwith with halo circular velocity. Increasing the resolution of a simulation\nallows a wider dynamic range in mass to be followed, but the average properties\nof the resolved galaxy population remain largely unaffected.

One possible\nexplanation for this is that the gas mass fraction is not constant across\nclusters of different temperature, as is usually assumed. Observationally,\nhowever, there is no compelling evidence for gas mass fraction variation,\nespecially in the case of hot clusters. Seeking an alternative physical\nexplanation for the observed trends, we investigate the role in the cluster gas\nmass - temperature relation of the preheating of the intracluster medium by\nsome arbitrary source for clusters with emission-weighted mean temperatures of\ngreater than about 3 keV. Making use of the physically-motivated, analytic\nmodels developed in 2002 by Babul and coworkers, we find that preheating does,\nindeed, lead to a steeper relation.

However, in apparent conflict with these\nstudies, we argue that a ``high'' level of entropy injection is required to\nmatch observations. In particular, an entropy floor of greater than about 300\nkeV cm^2 is required. We also present a new test, namely, the study of the\nrelation within different fixed radii. This allows one to indirectly probe the\ndensity profiles of clusters, since it samples different fractions of the\nvirial radius for clusters of different temperature.

The\nstudy covers the frequency range from 82 GHz to 354 GHz and includes 80\ntransitions of 19 molecules. 1.3 mm continuum data of the nuclear source are\nalso presented.

Abstract: There is mounting evidence that long duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are\nproduced by ultra-relativistic jets of ordinary matter which are ejected in\ncore collapse supernova (SN) explosions. Such jets are extremely efficient\ncosmic ray (CR) accelerators which can accelerate the swept up ambient\nparticles on their way to the highest observed CR energies. The bulk of the jet\nkinetic energy is used to accelerate CRs while only a tiny fraction is used to\nproduce the GRB and its afterglow. Here we use the remarkably successful\ncannonball (CB) model of GRBs to show that the bipolar jets from SN explosions,\nwhich produce GRBs most of which are not beamed towards Earth, can be the main\norigin of cosmic rays at all energies. The model explains very simply the\nelemental composition of CRs and their observed spectra at all energies. In\nparticular it explains the origin of the CR knees and ankle. Above the CR\nankle, the Galactic magnetic fields can no longer delay the free escape of\nultra-high energies CRs (UHECR) from the Galaxy, and the CRs from the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), which were injected there by SN jets from all the\ngalaxies and isotropized there by the IGM magnetic fields, dominate the\nGalactic CR spectrum. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect due to the\ninteraction of UHECRs with the microwave background radiation is expected. The\nCR nuclei which diffuse out of galaxies, or are directly deposited in the IGM\nby the relativistic SN jets, may be the origin of the IGM magnetic fields.\nInverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR)\nby the CR electrons in the IGM produces the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground radiation (GBR). \n\n"}

The\nhigh incidence of pc-scale radio nuclei, with implied brightness temperatures\nof the order of 10E7 K, and sub-parsec jets argue for accreting black holes in\n50% of all LLAGNs; there is no evidence against all LLAGNs being mini-AGNs.The\ndetected parsec-scale radio nuclei are preferentially found in massive\nellipticals and in type 1 nuclei (i.e. nuclei with broad Halpha emission).

We show that if the near infrared background has a stellar origin,\nmetal-free stars are not the only explanation of the excess near infrared\nbackground; stars with metals (e.g. Z=1/50 Z_sun) can produce the same amount\nof background intensity as the metal-free stars.

While the star formation rate at z=7-15 inferred from the current data\nis significantly higher than the local rate at z<5, it does not rule out the\nstellar origin of the cosmic near infrared background. In addition, we show\nthat a reasonable initial mass function, coupled with this star formation rate,\ndoes not over-produce metals in the universe in most cases, and may produce as\nlittle as less than 1 % of the metals observed in the universe today. \n\n"}

Using\nhigh-resolution SPH simulations, we follow the black hole dynamics in the early\nphase when gas-dynamical friction acts on the black holes individually, and\ncontinue our simulation until they form a close binary. We find that in the\nearly sinking the black holes lose memory of their initial orbital eccentricity\nif they co-rotate with the gaseous disc, forming a binary with a low\neccentricity, consistent with zero within our numerical resolution limit. The\ncause of circularization resides in the rotation present in the gaseous\nbackground where dynamical friction operates. Circularization may hinder\ngravitational waves from taking over and leading the binary to coalescence. In\nthe case of counter-rotating orbits the initial eccentricity does not decrease,\nand the black holes may bind forming an eccentric binary. When dynamical\nfriction has subsided, for equal mass black holes and regardless their initial\neccentricity, angular momentum loss, driven by the gravitational torque exerted\non the binary by surrounding gas, is nevertheless observable down to the\nsmallest scale probed. In the case of unequal masses, dynamical friction\nremains efficient down to our resolution limit, and there is no sign of\nformation of any ellipsoidal gas distribution that may further harden the\nbinary. During inspiral, gravitational capture of gas by the black holes occurs\nmainly along circular orbits: eccentric orbits imply high relative velocities\nand weak gravitational focusing.

It is shown that while the Casimir\nenergy gives rise to accelerating Universe, the cosmological constant term is\nstill required.

However, difficulties in calibrating the relation between the\ncluster observable and halo mass, and the lack of completeness information,\nmake this technique particularly susceptible to systematic errors. Here we\nargue that a cluster abundance analysis using statistical weak lensing on the\nstacked clusters leads to a robust lower limit on the amplitude of\nfluctuations. The method compares the average weak lensing signal measured\naround the whole cluster sample to a theoretical prediction, assuming that the\nclusters occupy the centers of all of the most massive halos above some minimum\nmass threshold. If the amplitude of fluctuations is below a certain limiting\nvalue, there are too few massive clusters in this model and the theoretical\nprediction falls below the observations. Since any effects that modify the\nmodel assumptions can only decrease the theoretical prediction, the limiting\namplitude becomes a robust lower limit.

In a log-log plot, this relation reduces to\na hyperplane (i.e., a plane in a four dimensional configuration space) which we\ndubbed the {\\it Sersic Virial Hyperplane} (SVH).

This N-body experiment simulates almost the full ``Hubble\nVolume'' of the universe, thus, for the first time, it allowed for an accurate\nanalysis of the cosmic distribution function, and, in particular, of its\nvariance (Delta A)^2, the cosmic error. The resulting detailed knowledge about\nthe shape of Upsilon is crucial for likelihood analyses. The measured cosmic\nerror agrees remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of Szapudi &\nColombi (1996) and Szapudi, Bernardeau & Colombi (1998) in the weakly\nnon-linear regime, while the predictions are slightly above the measurements in\nthe highly nonlinear regime. When the relative cosmic error is small, (Delta\nA/A)^2, function Upsilon is nearly Gaussian.

This correlation is stronger than\nexpected based on the analysis of the Hipparcos catalog. We predict the\nparallaxes of individual cluster members, pi_pm, from their Hipparcos proper\nmotions, assuming that all cluster members have the same space velocity. We\ncompare pi_pm with their Hipparcos parallaxes, pi_Hip, and find that there are\nsignificant spatial correlations in pi_Hip. We derive a distance modulus to the\nPleiades of 5.58 +- 0.18 mag using the radial-velocity gradient method. This\nvalue, agrees very well with the distance modulus of 5.60 +- 0.04 mag\ndetermined using the main-sequence fitting technique, compared with the value\nof 5.33 +- 0.06 inferred from the average of the Hipparcos parallaxes of the\nPleiades members. We show that the difference between the main-sequence fitting\ndistance and the Hipparcos parallax distance can arise from spatially\ncorrelated errors in the Hipparcos parallaxes of individual Pleiades members.\nAlthough the Hipparcos parallax errors towards the Hyades are spatially\ncorrelated in a manner similar to those of the Pleiades, the center of the\nHyades is located on a node of this spatial structure. Therefore, the parallax\nerrors cancel out when the average distance is estimated, leading to a mean\nHyades distance modulus that agrees with the pre-Hipparcos value. We speculate\nthat these spatial correlations are also responsible for the discrepant\ndistances that are inferred using the mean Hipparcos parallaxes to some open\nclusters. Finally, we note that our conclusions are based on a purely geometric\nmethod and do not rely on any models of stellar isochrones. \n\n"}

As initial conditions, we adopt models of\ncorotational and irrotational binary neutron stars in a quasi-equilibrium state\nwhich are obtained using the conformal flatness approximation for the three\ngeometry as well as an assumption that a helicoidal Killing vector exists. In\nthis paper, we pay particular attention to the final product of the\ncoalescence. We find that the final product depends sensitively on the initial\ncompactness parameter of the neutron stars : In a merger between sufficiently\ncompact neutron stars, a black hole is formed in a dynamical timescale. As the\ncompactness is decreased, the formation timescale becomes longer and longer. It\nis also found that a differentially rotating massive neutron star is formed\ninstead of a black hole for less compact binary cases, in which the rest mass\nof each star is less than 70-80% of the maximum allowed mass of a spherical\nstar. In the case of black hole formation, we roughly evaluate the mass of the\ndisk around the black hole.

The required kinetic energy dominated modes can occur either\nas a field rolls down an exponential (or steeper) potential, or in the\noscillation of a field about the minimum of a steep power-law potential.
