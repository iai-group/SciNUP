In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios.

In particular, we\nexamine the participant eccentricity, which quantifies the eccentricity of the\ninitial source shape by the major axes of the ellipse formed by the interaction\npoints of the participating nucleons. We show that reasonable variation of the\ndensity parameters in the Glauber calculation, as well as variations in how\nmatter production is modeled, do not significantly modify the already\nestablished behavior of the participant eccentricity as a function of collision\ncentrality. Focusing on event-by-event fluctuations and correlations of the\ndistributions of participating nucleons we demonstrate that, depending on the\nachieved event-plane resolution, fluctuations in the elliptic flow magnitude\n$v_2$ lead to most measurements being sensitive to the root-mean-square, rather\nthan the mean of the $v_2$ distribution.

Instead, we keep all terms in the\nmoment expansion. The reduction of the degrees of freedom is done by\nidentifying the microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation and\nconsidering only the slowest ones. In addition, the equations of motion for the\ndissipative quantities are truncated according to a systematic power-counting\nscheme in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds number.

The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter.

Purpose: We question the extent of jet-related\n(\"nonflow\") bias in and hydrodynamic \"flow\" interpretations of $v_2$\nmeasurements. Method: We introduce two-dimensional (2D) model fits to angular\ncorrelation data that distinguish accurately between jet-related correlation\ncomponents and a {\\em nonjet azimuth quadrupole} that might represent \"elliptic\nflow\" if that were relevant. We compare measured jet-related and \"flow\"-related\ndata systematics and determine the jet-related contribution to $v_2$\nmeasurements.

Cumulant analysis provides a mathematical tool to\ndecompose those initial fluctuations in terms of radial and azimuthal\ncomponents. It is usually thought that a specified order of azimuthal cumulant,\nfor the most part, linearly produces flow harmonic of the same order. In this\nwork, we carry out a systematic study on the connection between cumulants and\nflow harmonics using a hydrodynamic code called NeXSPheRIO. We conduct three\ntypes of calculations, by explicitly decomposing the initial conditions into\ncomponents corresponding to a given eccentricity and studying the out-coming\nflow through hydrodynamic evolution. It is found that for initial conditions\ndeviating significantly from Gaussian, such as those from NeXuS, the linearity\nbetween eccentricities and flow harmonics partially breaks down. Combining with\nthe effect of coupling between cumulants of different orders, it causes the\nproduction of extra flow harmonics of higher orders.

While some studies have found a good overall\nagreement between the nuclear PDFs and the neutrino data, others have claimed\nfor an incompatibility.

Witten's classic argument that\nbaryons and interacting systems of baryons can be described in a mean-field\napproximation with each of the quarks moving in an average potential due to the\nremaining quarks is heuristic. It is important to justify this heuristic\ndescription for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting\nbaryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the\npossibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up\nthe entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful\nstates coupled together to make a color-singlet state. In this work, we provide\na formal justification of this heuristic prescription. In order to do this, we\nstart by taking the heavy quark limit, thus effectively reducing the problem to\na many-body quantum mechanical system. This problem can be formulated in terms\nof integrals over coherent states, which for this problem are simple Slater\ndeterminants. We show that for the many-body problem, the support region for\nthese integrals becomes narrow at large $N_c$, yielding an energy which is\nwell-approximated by a single coherent state---that is a mean-field\ndescription.

As compared to the original BK-JIMWLK\nevolution, the new evolution is remarkably different: the plasma saturation\nmomentum evolves much faster with increasing energy (or decreasing Bjorken's\n$x$) than the corresponding scale for a shockwave (nucleus).

In this\npaper, we work in the rigid-spacetime approximation and consider field\ntrajectories within the single-field attractor, which is a generic feature of\nthese models. We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter\nspace in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and\nsemi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is\ncharacterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large\nvalues of the nonminimal couplings, $\\xi_I \\gg 1$, in which the dominant\ninstability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers\n$k \\rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\\xi_I$ regime is not reached until\n$\\xi_I \\geq {\\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\\xi_I \\sim {\\cal\nO}(1 - 10)$, the resonance structure depends strongly on wavenumber and\ncouplings.

As a sequel of our preceding work that aim to demystifying the\nuniversal near-the-origin behavior of the atomic Schr\\\"{o}dinger and\nKlein-Gordon wave functions, the goal of this work is to demonstrate that,\nwithin the nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT) tailored for\nCoulombic atoms, the universal logarithmic divergence of the Dirac wave\nfunctions can be accounted by the perturbatively calculable Wilson coefficient\nemerging from the operator product expansion (OPE) of the electron and the\nnucleus fields.

If a flaton field is trapped at the origin in the early\nuniverse, one expects `thermal inflation' to take place before it rolls away to\nthe true vacuum, because the finite-temperature correction to the potential\nwill hold it at the origin until the temperature falls below $1\\TeV$ or so. In\nthe first part of the paper, that expectation is confirmed by an estimate of\nthe finite temperature corrections and of the tunneling rate to the true\nvacuum, paying careful attention to the validity of the approximations that are\nused. The second part of the paper considers topological defects which may be\nproduced at the end of an era of thermal inflation. If the flaton fields\nassociated with the era are GUT higgs fields, then its end corresponds to the\nGUT phase transition. In that case monopoles (as well as GUT higgs particles)\nwill have to be diluted by a second era of thermal inflation.

The proton fraction is determined by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy whose density dependence may be constrained by measuring the neutron\nradius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Such a measurement is necessary for a\nreliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present\nin the neutron star. A large neutron radius in 208Pb implies a stiff symmetry\nenergy that grows rapidly with density, thereby favoring a high proton fraction\nand allowing direct URCA cooling. Predictions for the neutron radius in 208Pb\nare correlated to the proton fraction in dense matter by using a variety of\nrelativistic effective field-theory models. Models that predict a neutron (Rn)\nminus proton (Rp) root-mean-square radius in 208Pb to be Rn-Rp<0.20 fm have\nproton fractions too small to allow the direct URCA cooling of 1.4 solar-mass\nneutron stars.

This calculation is expected to be valid for energies\nbelow 100 MeV. Previous theoretical and experimental estimates for the\npolarizabilities are given. All diagrams are calculated by expanding the photon\nwavefunctions into partial waves and using realistic deuteron wavefunctions.\nThe Green's function for the intermediate state in the dispersive states is\ndetermined numerically. Pion-exchange, relativistic, and recoil corrections are\nalso included. The low-energy theorem is shown to be satisfied. The relative\neffects of the different terms as well as their effects on the determinations\nof the polarizabilities are discussed at energies of 49, 69, and 95 MeV.

Only the scalar diquark is retained, and it and\nthe quark are confined. A good description of the data requires a nonpointlike\ndiquark correlation with an electromagnetic radius of 0.8 r_pi. The composite,\nnonpointlike nature of the diquark is crucial. It provides for diquark-breakup\nterms that are of greater importance than the diquark photon absorption\ncontribution. \n\n"}

The first moments of the calculated structure functions fulfill the\nGerasimov-Drell-Hearn and Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rules within an error of\ntypically 5-10% for the proton.

For this potential a subtraction at a fixed energy can be used to\nrenormalize the amplitude and produce a finite solution to the integral\nequation for all energies. This can be done either algebraically or\nnumerically. In the latter case dimensional regularization can be implemented\nby solving the integral equation in a lower number of dimensions, fixing the\npotential strength, and computing the phase shifts, while taking the limit as\nthe number of dimensions approaches three. We demonstrate that these steps can\nbe carried out in a numerically stable way, and show that the results thereby\nobtained agree with those found when the renormalization is performed\nalgebraically to four significant figures. \n\n"}

Abstract: Highly excited many-particle states in quantum systems (nuclei, atoms,\nquantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers) can be ``chaotic''\nsuperpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants, products of\nspin or qubit states). This is a result of the very high energy level density\nof many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between\nparticles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A\ntime scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is\nthe qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1. At t <<\nt_c the entropy is small: S= n t^2 J^2 log_2(1/t^2 J^2), where J is the\ninter-qubit interaction strength. At t > t_c the number of ``wrong'' states\nincreases exponentially as 2^{S(t)} . Therefore, t_c may be interpreted as a\nmaximal time for operation of a quantum computer, since at t > t_c one has to\nstruggle against the second law of thermodynamics. At t >>t_c the system\nentropy approaches that for chaotic eigenstates. \n\n"}
