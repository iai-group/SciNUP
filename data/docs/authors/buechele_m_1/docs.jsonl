The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations\non the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead\nto an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \\ge 2$ while only\nthe $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore.

We consider two different\nbackground subtraction methods, an area-based one implemented through the\nFastJet pack- age and a pedestal subtraction method, that resemble the ones\nused by the experimental collaborations at the LHC. We also analyze different\nways of defining the optimal parame- ters in the second method. We use a toy\nmodel that easily allows variations of the background characteristics: average\nbackground level and fluctuations and azimuthal structure, but cross- checks\nare also done with a Monte Carlo simulator. Furthermore, we consider the\ninfluence of quenching using Q-PYTHIA on the dijet observables with the\ndifferent background subtrac- tion methods and, additionally, we examine the\nmissing momentum of particles. The average background level and fluctuations\naffect both single inclusive spectra and dijet asymmetries, although\ndifferently for different subtraction setups.

There have been great expectations of rich new\nphysics in the 0.1-1 TeV mass region: the Higgs boson (one or several),\nsupersymmetry, or perhaps new particles from the dark-matter family. It has\nbeen the general consensus that the best machine for the detailed study of new\nphysics to be discovered at the LHC would be an energy-frontier linear e+e-\ncollider. Physicists held their breath waiting for the results from the LHC. In\nsummer 2012, two LHC detectors, ATLAS and CMS, announced the discovery of a\nHiggs boson with the mass of 126 GeV and (still) nothing else. The absence of\nnew physics in the region below 1 TeV has changed the post-LHC collider R&D\npriorities and triggered a zoo of project proposals for the precision study of\nthe 126 GeV Higgs boson, possibly with further upgrades to higher energies.\nThis paper gives an overview of these projects; it is based largely on the\nreports presented at the first workshop on Higgs factories held at FNAL a few\ndays prior to the present workshop in Protvino. \n\n"}

His demise intrigues us\nstill today because of his seminal work, published the previous year, that\nestablished symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic\nparticle that is its own anti-particle.

In particular, the ability to relate experimental\nobservables to neutrino energy in previous experiments has relied solely on\ntheoretical models of neutrino-nucleus interactions, which currently suffer\nfrom very large theoretical uncertainties.\n  By observing charged current $\\nu_\\mu$ interactions over a continuous range\nof off-axis angles from 1 to 4 degrees, the nuPRISM water Cherenkov detector\ncan provide a direct measurement of the far detector lepton kinematics for any\ngiven set of oscillation parameters, which largely removes neutrino interaction\nmodeling uncertainties from T2K oscillation measurements. This naturally\nprovides a direct constraint on the relationship between lepton kinematics and\nneutrino energy.

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

Null results from LHC searches already\nseem to disfavor such partners if they are colored. Any partners with SM\ncharges and ~TeV masses will be exhaustively probed by the LHC and a future 100\nTeV collider. Therefore, we focus on neutral top partners. While these arise in\nTwin Higgs theories, we analyze neutral top partners as model-independently as\npossible using EFT and Simplified Model methods. We classify all perturbative\nneutral top partner structures in order to compute their irreducible low-energy\nsignatures at proposed future lepton and hadron colliders, as well as the\nirreducible tunings suffered in each scenario. Central to our theorem is the\nassumption that SM-charged BSM states appear in the UV completion of neutral\nnaturalness, which is the case in all known examples.

We\nconsider both the case where the excess is described by a narrow and a broad\nresonance. We also obtain model-independent constraints on the allowed\ncouplings and branching fractions to final states other than diphotons, by\nincluding the interplay with 8 TeV searches. These results can guide attempts\nto construct viable dynamical models of the resonance. Turning to specific\nmodels, our findings suggest that the anomaly cannot be accounted for by the\npresence of only an additional singlet or doublet spin-zero field and the\nStandard Model degrees of freedom; this includes all two-Higgs-doublet models.\nLikewise, heavy scalars in the MSSM cannot explain the excess if stability of\nthe electroweak vacuum is required, at least in a leading-order analysis.

The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination.

Abstract: Familiar factorized descriptions of classic QCD processes such as\ndeeply-inelastic scattering (DIS) apply in the limit of very large hard scales,\nmuch larger than nonperturbative mass scales and other nonperturbative physical\nproperties like intrinsic transverse momentum. Since many interesting DIS\nstudies occur at kinematic regions where the hard scale, $Q \\sim$ 1-2 GeV, is\nnot very much greater than the hadron masses involved, and the Bjorken scaling\nvariable $x_{bj}$ is large, $x_{bj} \\gtrsim 0.5$, it is important to examine\nthe boundaries of the most basic factorization assumptions and assess whether\nimproved starting points are needed. Using an idealized field-theoretic model\nthat contains most of the essential elements that a factorization derivation\nmust confront, we retrace the steps of factorization approximations and compare\nwith calculations that keep all kinematics exact. We examine the relative\nimportance of such quantities as the target mass, light quark masses, and\nintrinsic parton transverse momentum, and argue that a careful accounting of\nparton virtuality is essential for treating power corrections to collinear\nfactorization.

The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution.

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment.

The\nfirst step, however, is to understand the pion production reactions at the free\nnucleon level. We present an exhaustive study of the charged-current and\nneutral-current neutrino and antineutrino pion production off nucleons, paying\na special attention to the angular distributions of the outgoing pion. We show,\nusing general arguments, that parity violation and time-reversal odd\ncorrelations in the weak differential cross sections are generated from the\ninterference between different contributions to the hadronic current that are\nnot relatively real. Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of\nthe art, microscopic models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and\nwe also confront their predictions with polarized electron data, as a test of\nthe vector content of these models. We also illustrate the importance of\ncarrying out a comprehensive test at the level of outgoing pion angular\ndistributions, going beyond comparisons done for partially integrated cross\nsections, where model differences cancel to a certain extent. Finally, we\nobserve that all charged and neutral current distributions show sizable\nanisotropies, and identify channels for which parity violating effects are\nclearly visible. Based on the above results, we conclude that the use of\nisotropic distributions for the pions in the center of mass of the final\npion-nucleon system, as assumed by some of the Monte Carlo event generators,\nneeds to be improved by incorporating the findings of microscopic calculations. \n\n"}

Four major scientific goals are identified: the\ncharacterisation of the macroscopic long wavelength Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)\nproperties with unprecedented precision, the investigation of the microscopic\nparton dynamics underlying QGP properties, the development of a unified picture\nof particle production and QCD dynamics from small (pp) to large\n(nucleus--nucleus) systems, the exploration of parton densities in nuclei in a\nbroad ($x$, $Q^2$) kinematic range and the search for the possible onset of\nparton saturation. In order to address these scientific goals, high-luminosity\nPb-Pb and p-Pb programmes are considered as priorities for Runs 3 and 4,\ncomplemented by high-multiplicity studies in pp collisions and a short run with\noxygen ions.

The axial form factor in electron-nucleon scattering is complicated by\nthe presence of electro-weak radiative corrections that in principle need to be\ncalculated or separately measured, but this axial form factor is suppressed at\nforward angles.

We first present a model-independent analysis in which we\ndiagonalise each of these two mass matrix structures to leading order in\n$\\theta_{13}$ and extract the neutrino masses, mixing angles and phases. In\nthis analysis we express the MNS matrix to leading order in the small angle\n$\\theta_{13}$ including the neutrino {\\em and} charged lepton mixing angles and\nphases, the latter playing a crucial r\\^{o}le for allowing the inverted\nhierarchy case to be consistent with the LMA MSW solution.

The\nsplitting between the chiral doublers follows from a mixing between the light\nconstituent quark mass and the velocity of the heavy quark, and vanishes for a\nzero constituent quark mass. The general strictures of spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking constrain the axial charges in the chiral multiplet, and\nyield a mass splitting between the chiral doublers of about 345 MeV when the\npion coupling to the doublers is half its coupling to a free quark. The chiral\ncorrections are small. This phenomenon is generic and extends to all\nheavy-light hadrons. We predict the mass splitting for the chiral doublers of\nthe excited mesons (D1,D2).
