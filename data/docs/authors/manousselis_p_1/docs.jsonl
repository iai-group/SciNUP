{"id": "0704.1447", "contents": "Title: Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories? Abstract: In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do. \n\n"}

The dimming of distant Type\nIa supernovae suggests that the expansion rate is accelerating, as if driven by\nvacuum energy, and this has been indirectly substantiated through studies of\nangular anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of spatial\ncorrelations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of galaxies. However there is\nno compelling direct evidence yet for (the dynamical effects of) dark energy.\nThe precision CMB data can be equally well fitted without dark energy if the\nspectrum of primordial density fluctuations is not quite scale-free and if the\nHubble constant is lower globally than its locally measured value.

Specifically, we\nstudy a five-dimensional model cosmology in type IIB supergravity, where the\ndual theory is an unstable deformation of $\\N=4$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge\ntheory on $\\Rbar\\times S^3$. A one-loop computation shows that the coupling\ngoverning the instability is asymptotically free, so quantum corrections cannot\nturn the potential around. The big crunch singularity in the bulk occurs when a\nboundary scalar field runs to infinity, in finite time. Consistent quantum\nevolution requires that we impose boundary conditions at infinite scalar field,\ni.e. a self-adjoint extension of the system. We find that quantum spreading of\nthe homogeneous mode of the boundary scalar leads to a natural UV cutoff in\nparticle production as the wavefunction for the homogeneous mode bounces back\nfrom infinity.

This\nprevents the wave packet of the homogeneous boundary scalar to return close to\nits initial form.

If it is to preserve supersymmetry, the\nmembrane background must obey certain conditions. These conditions are\nexpressed as geometrical constraints on differential forms and as such, can be\ninterpreted as calibrations. Knowing the complete set of calibrations is the\nsame as satisfying all conditions needed for supersymmetry preservation. While\na purely geometric background is completely specified through standard\ncalibrations, in order to fully describe a flux background, we must also state\nits generalized calibrations. These can be found by probing the background with\nBPS branes. The logic is simple. Since a BPS probe is guaranteed to be stable,\nwe require that its volume be given by a calibrated form. This applies equally\nto both charged and uncharged probes; the former are stabilized by flux whereas\nthe latter achieve stability by minimizing their volumes. Volume-forms of\ncharged probes correspond to generalized calibrations and those of uncharged\nprobes, to standard calibrations. Previously geometries were probed only by\nuncharged branes. The calibrations that were found had then to be supplemented\nby additional conditions in order to guarantee supersymmetry preservation in\nbackgrounds with flux. Once the scope is broadened to include charged branes,\nthe 'missing conditions' (generalized calibrations) can also be recovered using\nthe probe analysis. We use this method to classify the backgrounds of wrapped\nM2-branes embedded in Calabi-Yau manifolds by specifying their calibrations. \n\n"}

In a\nspatial compactification and for heavy adjoint fermions, this enhancement leads\nto a calculable zero temperature quantum phase transition on R^3*S^1 driven by\na competition between the center-destabilizing gauge contribution and\ncenter-stabilizing LLL fermions. We also show that at a (formal) asymptotically\nlarge magnetic field, the adjoint fermions with arbitrarily large but fixed\nmass stabilize the center symmetry.

In many cases, the covariant entropy counts\nthis entropy--the degeneracy of emergent quantum field theories in full quantum\ngravity--with the entropy of particle excitations in each quantum field theory\ngiving only a tiny perturbation. In the Rindler description of a (black hole)\nhorizon, the relevant vacuum degrees of freedom manifest themselves as an extra\nhidden quantum number carried by the states representing the second exterior\nregion; this quantum number is invisible in the emergent quantum field theory.\nIn a distant picture, these states arise as exponentially degenerate ground and\nexcited states of the intrinsically quantum gravitational degrees of freedom on\nthe stretched horizon.

The rotation angle induced by the\ndynamical scalar field can be separated into the isotropic background part and\nthe anisotropic fluctuations. The effect of the background part has been be\nstudied in the previous work (Zhao & Li, arXiv:1402.4324). In this paper, we\nfocus on the influence of the anisotropies of the rotation angle. We first\nassume that the cosmic scalar field is massless, consistent with other works,\nwe find that the rotation spectrum can be quite large, which may be detected by\nthe potential CMB observations. However, if the scalar field is identified as\nthe quintessence field, by detailed discussing both the entropy and adiabatic\nperturbation modes for the first time, we find that the anisotropies of the\nrotation angle are always too small to be detectable.In addition, as the main\ngoal of this paper, we investigate the effect of rotated polarization power\nspectrum on the detection of relic gravitational waves. we find that, the\nrotated B-mode polarization could be fairly large, and comparable with those\ngenerated by the gravitational waves.

Satisfying scheme\ninvariance is a challenging problem for perturbative QCD (pQCD), since a\ntruncated perturbation series does not automatically satisfy the requirements\nof the renormalization group. Two distinct approaches for satisfying the RGI\nprinciple have been suggested in the literature. One is the \"Principle of\nMaximum Conformality\" (PMC) in which the terms associated with the\n$\\beta$-function are absorbed into the scale of the running coupling at each\nperturbative order; its predictions are scheme and scale independent at every\nfinite order. The other approach is the \"Principle of Minimum Sensitivity\"\n(PMS), which is based on local RGI; the PMS approach determines the optimal\nrenormalization scale by requiring the slope of the approximant of an\nobservable to vanish. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the\nPMC and PMS procedures by analyzing two physical observables $R_{e+e-}$ and\n$\\Gamma(H\\to b\\bar{b})$ up to four-loop order in pQCD.

The entanglement entropy can be\noperationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the state of the\nsubregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a\nreference party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other\nbulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information\ntheoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing that the length of more\ngeneral bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce a new\ntask called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary\nsubregion must be transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale\nin a way determined by the geometry of the bulk curve. Our main result is that\nthe cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions of\nconstrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the\nsigned length of the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative,\nconstrained state merging distills entanglement rather than consuming it. This\ndemonstration has two parts: first, we exhibit a protocol whose cost is the\nlength of the curve and second, we prove that this protocol is optimal in that\nit uses the minimum amount of entanglement.

Roughly speaking, it demands that the minimally charged\nstring coupled to the dual 2-form-field exists in the effective theory. Most\nnaively, such large-$f$ strings curve space too much to exist as static\nsolutions, thus ruling out large-$f$ axions. More conservatively, one might\nallow non-static string solutions to play the role of the required charged\nobjects. In this case, topological inflation would save the superplanckian\naxion. Furthermore, a large-$f$ axion may appear in the low-energy effective\ntheory based on two subplanckian axions in the UV.

The way of\nincorporating para-Grassmann numbers $\\xi_{k}$ into a general scheme of\nuniquantization is also offered. For parastatistics of order 2 a new fact is\nrevealed, namely, the trilinear relations containing both the para-Grassmann\nvariables $\\xi_{k}$ and the field operators $a_{k}$, $b_{m}$ under a certain\ninvertible mapping go over into the unitary equivalent relations, where\ncommutators are replaced by anticommutators and vice versa.

In the Landau gauge, the\nequations are free of renormalization constants, and the renormalization point\ndependence enters only through the renormalized coupling and the renormalized\npropagator functions.

We construct the most general\nform of the statistical operator allowed by the Poincare algebra and show that\nthere are no zero-mode related problems when describing phase transitions.

This\ninterpretation withstands a rather detailed scrutiny, including the magnitude\nof the static tension and of the B-I charge; and Polchinski's mixed\nDirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions for small perturbations of the string.\nThe latter arise dynamically from the full non-linear equations of motion.\nAlso, the Born-Infeld charge is shown to produce the correct form of dipole\nradiation under the influence of harmonic oscillations of the string.

{"id": "quant-ph/0307237", "contents": "Title: Strong Coupling Perturbation Theory in Quantum Mechanics Abstract: We present a full introduction to the recent devised perturbation theory for\nstrong coupling in quantum mechanics. In order to put the theory in a proper\nhistorical perspective, the approach devised in quantum field theory is rapidly\npresented, showing how it implies a kind of duality in perturbation theory,\nfrom the start. The approach of renormalization group in perturbation theory is\nthen presented. This method permits to resum secularities in perturbation\ntheory and makes fully algorithmical the resummation, transforming the\nperturbation calculations in a step by step computational procedure. The\ngeneral theorem on which is founded a proper application of the strong coupling\nexpansion, based on a result in the quantum adiabatic theory, is then exposed.\nThis theorem gives the leading order of a strong coupling expansion. Then,\nafter the introduction of the principle of duality in perturbation theory that\nputs in a proper context the quantum field theory method, the resulting theory\nof the strong coupling expansion and the free picture are presented. An\nalgorithm for the computation of the perturbation series is finally given. This\napproach has a lot of applications in fields as quantum optics, condensed\nmatter and so on, extending the original expectations of the quantum field\ntheory method. So, we give some examples of application for a class of\ntwo-level systems that, in recent years, proved to be extremely important. One\nof the most interesting concepts that can be obtained in this way is that of a\nQuantum Amplifier (QAMP) that permits to obtain an amplification to the\nclassical level of the quantum fluctuations of the ground state of a single\nradiation mode. \n\n"}

The starting point of our discussion is the novel exact\nsolution for the electromagnetic Casimir force in the configuration of a\ncylinder above a plate. The related work for the scalar Casimir effect in\nsphere-plate configuration is also considered, and the application region of\nthe proximity force theorem is discussed. Next we consider new experiments on\nthe measurement of the Casimir force between metals and between metal and\nsemiconductor. The complicated problem connected with the theory of the thermal\nCasimir force between real metals is analyzed in detail. The present situation\nregarding different theoretical approaches to the resolution of this problem is\nsummarized. We conclude with new constraints on non-Newtonian gravity obtained\nusing the results of latest Casimir force measurements and compare them with\nconstraints following from the most recent gravitational experiments. \n\n"}
