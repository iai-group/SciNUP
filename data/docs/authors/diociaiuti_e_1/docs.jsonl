Within current\nradiation detection technologies only Time Projection Chambers filled with low\npressure gas are capable of such measurement. Due to the character of the\nelectronic and nuclear stopping powers of low energy nuclear recoils in the\ngas, an asymmetric ionization charge distribution along their tracks may be\nexpected. Preliminary study of this effect, called Head-Tail, has been carried\nout here using the SRIM simulation program for Carbon and Sulfur in 40 Torr\ncarbon disulfide, as relevant to the DRIFT detector. Investigations were\nfocused on ion tracks projected onto the axis of the initial direction of\nmotion in the energy range between 10 and 400 keV.

However, if used alone, they\ndo not exhibit any feature that allows to discriminate an alpha energy deposit\nfrom a beta/gamma one.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of\nretarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in\ncontrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard\nMAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical\npower.

These\nsystem-dependent pre-pulses in the nanosecond and/or picosecond regimes are\noften intense enough to modify the target significantly by ionizing and forming\na plasma layer in front of the target. Time resolved interferometry offers a\nrobust way to characterize the expanding plasma during this period. We have\ndeveloped a novel pump-probe interferometry system for an ultra-intense laser\nexperiment that uses two short-pulse amplifiers synchronized by one ultra-fast\nseed oscillator to achieve 40-femtosecond time resolution over hundreds of\nnanoseconds, using a variable delay line and other techniques. The first of\nthese amplifiers acts as the pump and delivers maximal energy to the\ninteraction region. The second amplifier is frequency shifted and then\nfrequency doubled to generate the femtosecond probe pulse. After passing\nthrough the laser-target interaction region, the probe pulse is split and\nrecombined in a laterally sheared Michelson interferometer. Importantly, the\nfrequency shift in the probe allows strong plasma self-emission at the second\nharmonic of the pump to be filtered out, allowing plasma expansion near the\ncritical surface and elsewhere to be clearly visible in the interferograms.\nThree-phase reconstructions of the electron densities are then inferred by Abel\ninversion.

The CMS experiment\nhas been designed with a two-level trigger system: the Level 1 (L1) Trigger,\nimplemented on custom-designed electronics, and the High Level Trigger (HLT), a\nstreamlined version of the CMS reconstruction and analysis software running on\na computer farm. The software-base HLT requires a trade-off between the\ncomplexity of the algorithms, the sustainable output rate, and the selection\nefficiency. This is going to be even more challenging during Run II, with a\nhigher centre-of-mass energy, a higher instantaneous luminosity and pileup, and\nthe impact of out-of-time pileup due to the 25 ns bunch spacing. The online\nalgorithms need to be optimised for such a complex environment in order to keep\nthe output rate under control without impacting the physics efficiency of the\nonline selection. Tracking, for instance, will play an even more important role\nin the event reconstruction. In this poster we will present the performance of\nthe online track and vertex reconstruction algorithms, and their impact on the\nhadronic triggers that make use of b-tagging and of jets reconstructed with the\nParticle Flow technique.

These regions overlap, but each has\ndistinct spatial characteristics.\n  We have measured the core/halo using a 177MeV test beam offset in a water\ntank.

The dose spans five\norders of magnitude, and the transition from halo to aura is clearly visible.\n  We have performed model-dependent (MD) and model-independent (MI) fits to the\ndata. The MD fit separates the dose into core, elastic/inelastic nuclear,\nnonelastic nuclear and aura terms, and achieves a global rms measurement/fit\nratio of 15%.

The effects of resolution broadening from multiple scattering\ndiminish with increasing muon momentum. As the momentum of the muon increases,\nthe contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in\nthe muon spectrometer to resolve the image. The variance of the measured muon\nmomentum reaches a minimum and then increases with increasing muon momentum.\nThe impact of the increase in variance is to require a higher integrated muon\nflux to reduce fluctuations.

By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a\nfunction of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is\npossible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano.

The signal obtained from these\ndetectors depends first on the physics of the medium (the initial scintillation\nand ionization), and second how the physics of the detector manipulates the\nresulting photons and liberated electrons.

The most advanced of these proposals have very similar\nsetups, in which a proton beam strikes a target yielding neutrons which are\nabsorbed by a high isotopic purity 7Li converter, yielding 8Li whose resulting\ndecay yields the antineutrinos. In this note, we use FLUKA and GEANT4\nsimulations to investigate three proposed modifications of this standard\nproposal. In the first, the 7Li is replaced with 7Li compounds including a\ndeuterium moderator. In the second, a gap is placed between the target and the\nconverter to reduce the neutron bounce-back. Finally, we consider cooling the\nconverter with liquid nitrogen. We find that these modifications can increase\nthe antineutrino yield by as much as 50 percent.

A problematic\nbackground in such large granular detector arrays is posed by alpha particles.\nIn the Majorana Demonstrator, events have been observed that are consistent\nwith energy- degraded alphas originating on the passivated surface, leading to\na potential background contribution in the region-of-interest for neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay. However, it is also observed that when energy deposition\noccurs very close to the passivated surface, charges drift through the bulk\nonto that surface, and then drift along it with greatly reduced mobility. This\nleads to both a reduced prompt signal and a measurable change in slope of the\ntail of a recorded pulse. In this contribution we discuss the characteristics\nof these events and the development of a filter that can identify the\noccurrence of this delayed charge recovery, allowing for the efficient\nrejection of passivated surface alpha events in analysis. \n\n"}

For such a goal, it\nis mandatory to reach very low threshold in energy (at or below the keV level),\nvery low radioactive background (at a few counts/keV/kg/day), and high\ndetection mass (at or above the 100 kg scale).

The alternative, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) guarantees\nthe ordered delivery of data and automatically adjusts transmission to match\nthe capability of the transmission link. Nevertheless UDP is often favored over\nTCP due to its simplicity, small memory and instruction footprints. Both UDP\nand TCP are implemented in all larger operating systems and commercial embedded\nframeworks.

Abstract: A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle.\nIntroduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally\nhigh-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities.\nArgon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the\npurge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses\nthrough materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact\nwith the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation. \n\n"}

The\nanalytical model is exact for the modes involving only motion along and\nrotation about the longitudinal axis, and it gives a good approximate\ndescription of the transverse modes. These results show that the high-frequency\nbehavior of a multi-stage isolator is well characterized by the natural\nfrequencies of a single stage.
