Then the measured values\nof the flavor parameters do not lead to any fundamental symmetries, but are\nstatistical accidents; their precise values do not provide any insights into\nthe fundamental theory, rather the overall pattern of flavor reflects the\nunderlying landscape. We investigate whether random selection from the\nstatistics of a simple landscape can explain the broad patterns of quark,\ncharged lepton, and neutrino masses and mixings. We propose Gaussian landscapes\nas simplified models of landscapes where Yukawa couplings result from overlap\nintegrals of zero-mode wavefunctions in higher-dimensional supersymmetric gauge\ntheories. In terms of just five free parameters, such landscapes can account\nfor all gross features of flavor, including: the hierarchy of quark and charged\nlepton masses; small quark mixing angles, with 13 mixing less than 12 and 23\nmixing; very light Majorana neutrino masses, with the solar to atmospheric\nneutrino mass ratio consistent with data; distributions for leptonic 12 and 23\nmixings that are peaked at large values, while the distribution for 13 mixing\nis peaked at low values; and order unity CP violating phases in both the quark\nand lepton sectors.

{"id": "0709.0199", "contents": "Title: No de Sitter invariant vacuum in massive gravity theory with ghost Abstract: In this letter we point out that the massive gravity theory with a graviton\nghost mode in de Sitter background cannot possess a de Sitter invariant vacuum\nstate. In order to avoid a negative norm state, we must associate the creation\noperator of the ghost mode with a negative-energy mode function instead of a\npositive-energy one as the mode function. Namely, we have to adopt a different\nprocedure of quantization for a ghost. When a theory has a symmetry mixing a\nghost mode with ordinary non-ghost modes, the choice of a ghost mode is not\nunique. However, quantization of a ghost is impossible without specifying a\nchoice of ghost mode, which breaks the symmetry. For this reason, the vacuum\nstate cannot respect the symmetry. In the massive gravity theory with a\ngraviton ghost mode in de Sitter background, the ghost is the helicity-0 mode\nof the graviton. This ghost mode is mixed with the other helicity graviton\nmodes under the action of de Sitter symmetry. Therefore, there is no de Sitter\ninvariant vacuum in such models. This leads to an interesting possibility that\nnon-covariant cutoff of the low energy effective theory may naturally arise. As\na result, the instability due to the pair production of a ghost and normal\nnon-ghost particles gets much milder and that the model may escape from being\nrejected. \n\n"}

Assuming the perfect fluid\nto be radiation, we solve the coupled equations for the system numerically and\nstudy the evolution of the perturbations from the sub-Hubble to the\nsuper-Hubble scales. In particular, we analyze the effects of the transition\nfrom tachyon driven inflation to the radiation dominated epoch on the evolution\nof the large scale curvature and non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. We\nconsider two different tachyonic potentials and study the effects of two\npossible types of decay of the tachyon into radiation. We plot the spectrum of\ncurvature perturbations at the end of inflation as well as at the early stages\nof the radiation dominated epoch. We find that reheating does not affect the\namplitude of the curvature perturbations in any of these cases.

While the full dynamical complexity of\nhalo formation can only be revealed through N-body simulations, excursion set\ntheory provides a simple analytic framework for understanding various aspects\nof this complex process. In this series of paper we propose improvements of\nboth technical and conceptual aspects of excursion set theory, and we explore\nup to which point the method can reproduce quantitatively the data from N-body\nsimulations. In paper I of the series we show how to derive excursion set\ntheory from a path integral formulation.

The point in our prediction is, although the Unruh\neffect is only in the accelerating frame, if the appearance of the Brownian\nmotion rooted in the Unruh effect in the inertial frame can be predicted, the\nheat that the particle gets in its body by the Unruh effect in the accelerating\nframe could survive in the inertial frame.

The $N$-particle state can\nbe collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a\nsuperposition of a total ground state with energy $M = N m$ and a Planckian\ndistribution for $E > M$ at the same Hawking temperature. The partition\nfunction is then found to yield the usual area law for the entropy, with a\nlogarithmic correction related with the Hawking component. The backreaction of\nmodes with $\\omega > m$ is also shown to reduce the Hawking flux and the\nevaporation properly stops for vanishing mass. \n\n"}

First, we consider the Type B higher spin\ntheories, which have been conjectured to be dual to CFTs consisting of the\nsinglet sector of $N$ free fermion fields. In addition to the case of $N$ Dirac\nfermions, we carefully study the projections to Weyl, Majorana, symplectic, and\nMajorana-Weyl fermions in the dimensions where they exist. Second, we explore\ntheories involving elements of both Type A and Type B theories, which we call\nType AB. Their spectrum includes fields of every half-integer spin, and they\nare expected to be related to the $U(N)/O(N)$ singlet sector of the CFT of $N$\nfree complex/real scalar and fermionic fields.

In the conformal coupling case, the particle\nproduction is negligible.

The only caveat is the case where the particle mass is larger\nthan the bounce energy scale.

A fundamental cosmological constant,\nLambda, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms to\ngenerate an effective Lambda have been devised which postulate the existence of\na peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof).\nThese models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractive\npossibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state\n(EOS). Most, if not all, future experimental studies on precision cosmology\n(e.g. the SNAP and PLANCK projects) address very carefully the determination of\nan EOS parametrized ``a la quintessence''.

The evolution of the CC depends on the single\nparameter \\nu, which characterizes the running of the CC produced by the\nquantum effects of matter fields of the unknown high energy theory below the\nPlanck scale. The sign of \\nu indicates whether bosons or fermions dominate in\nthe running. The spectrum of perturbations is computed assuming an adiabatic\nregime and an isotropic stress tensor. Moreover, the perturbations of the CC\nterm are generated from the simplest covariant form suggested by the RG model\nunder consideration. The corresponding numerical analysis shows that for \\nu>0\nthere is a depletion of the matter power spectrum at low scales (large wave\nnumbers) as compared to the standard LCDM model, whereas for \\nu<0 there is an\nexcess of power at low scales. We find that the LSS data rule out the range\n|\\nu|> 10^{-4} while the values |\\nu|< 10^{-6} look perfectly acceptable.

In\nparticular, the radion disguised as the scalar fields Psi and Phi couples with\nthe sum of the traces of the energy momentum tensor on both branes. In the\ncourse of the derivation, it has been revealed that the radion plays an\nessential role to convert the non-local Einstein gravity with the generalized\ndark radiation to the local quasi-scalar-tensor gravity. For completeness, we\nalso derive the effective action for our theory by substituting the bulk\nsolution into the original action. It is also shown that the\nquasi-scalar-tensor gravity works as holograms at the low energy in the sense\nthat the bulk geometry can be reconstructed from the solution of the\nquasi-scalar-tensor gravity. \n\n"}
