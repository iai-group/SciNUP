The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the\nwell-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called\n`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,\nprovided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum\nuncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.\nHowever, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a\nsuperposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area\nlaw is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,\nso that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On\nascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to\nthe entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees\nof freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the\ncontributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for\nexcited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from\nthe area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the\nfar-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced\nover) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.\nAlthough most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a\nhypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we\nshow that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static\nasymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon. \n\n"}

The main characteristic of\nholographic Ricci dark energy is governed by a positive numerical parameter\n$\\alpha$ in the model. When $\\alpha<1/2$, the holographic Ricci dark energy\nwill exhibit a quintomlike behavior; i.e., its equation of state will evolve\nacross the cosmological-constant boundary $w=-1$. The parameter $\\alpha$ can be\ndetermined only by observations. Thus, in order to characterize the evolving\nfeature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe, it is of\nextraordinary importance to constrain the parameter $\\alpha$ by using the\nobservational data.

In\nclosed string field theory, the string field depends on all zero-modes and so\ncan be expanded to give an infinite set of fields on the doubled torus. We use\nthe string field theory to construct a theory of massless fields on the doubled\ntorus. Key to the consistency is a constraint on fields and gauge parameters\nthat arises from the L_0 - \\bar L_0=0 condition in closed string theory. The\nsymmetry of this double field theory includes usual and 'dual diffeomorphisms',\ntogether with a T-duality acting on fields that have explicit dependence on the\ntorus coordinates and the dual coordinates. We find that, along with gravity, a\nKalb-Ramond field and a dilaton must be added to support both usual and dual\ndiffeomorphisms. We construct a fully consistent and gauge invariant action on\nthe doubled torus to cubic order in the fields. We discuss the challenges\ninvolved in the construction of the full nonlinear theory.

If the replication distribution is sufficiently heavy\ntailed then the growth fluctuations are Levy distributed. We analyze the data\nfrom bird populations, firms, and mutual funds and show that our predictions\nmatch the data well, in several respects: Our theory results in a much better\ncollapse of the individual distributions onto a single curve and also correctly\npredicts the scaling of the standard deviation with size. To illustrate how\nthis can emerge from a collective microscopic dynamics we propose a model based\non stochastic influence dynamics over a scale-free contact network and show\nthat it produces results similar to those observed. We also extend the model to\ndeal with correlations between individual elements. Our main conclusion is that\nthe universality of growth fluctuations is driven by the additivity of growth\nprocesses and the action of the generalized central limit theorem. \n\n"}

We illustrate our general\nclaim with two classes of massive solutions in AdS4xCP3: one, previously known,\nwith N = 1 supersymmetry, and a new one with N = 2 supersymmetry. Both\nsolutions are dual to d = 3 Chern-Simons-matter theories. In both these massive\nexamples, as the rank N of the gauge group is increased, the dilaton initially\nincreases in the same way as in the corresponding massless case; before it can\nreach the M-theory regime, however, it enters a second regime, in which the\ndilaton decreases even as N increases.

One of the conditions for the SOC is the slow driving noise, which\nunambiguously suggests Stratonovich interpretation of the corresponding\nstochastic differential equation (SDE). This, in turn, necessitates the use of\nParisi-Sourlas-Wu stochastic quantization procedure, which straightforwardly\nleads to a model with BRST-exact action, i.e., to a W-TFT. In the parameter\nspace of the SDE, there must exist full-dimensional regions where the\nBRST-symmetry is spontaneously broken by instantons, which in the context of\nSOC are essentially avalanches. In these regions, the avalanche-type SOC\ndynamics is liberated from overwise a rightful dynamics-less W-TFT, and a\nGoldstone mode of Fadeev-Popov ghosts exists.

The information flow is conserved\nfor these routing models and governed by cyclic attractors. We consider two\nclasses of information flow, Markovian routing without memory and vertex\nrouting involving a one-step routing memory. Investigating the respective cycle\nlength distributions for complete graphs we find log corrections to power-law\nscaling for the mean cycle length, as a function of the number of vertices, and\na sub-polynomial growth for the overall number of cycles.\n  When observing experimentally a real-world dynamical system one normally\nsamples stochastically its phase space. The number and the length of the\nattractors are then weighted by the size of their respective basins of\nattraction. This situation is equivalent to `on the fly' generation of routing\ntables for which we find power law scaling for the weighted average length of\nattractors, for both conserved routing models. These results show that critical\ndynamical systems are generically not scale-invariant, but may show power-law\nscaling when sampled stochastically.

It has been proved that, assuming suitable mixing conditions for\nthe underlying dynamical systems, the extremes of a specific class of\nobservables are distributed according to the so called Generalized Extreme\nValue (GEV) distribution. Direct calculations show that in the case of\nquasi-periodic dynamics the block maxima are not distributed according to the\nGEV distribution. In this paper we show that, in order to obtain a universal\nbehaviour of the extremes, the requirement of a mixing dynamics can be relaxed\nif the Pareto approach is used, based upon considering the exceedances over a\ngiven threshold.

Here we build a quantitative\nequilibrium model of sovereign default risk that, for the first time, is able\nto determine if markets are consistently set by economic conditions. We show\nthat over the period 2001-2012, the annually-averaged long-term interest rates\nof Greek debt are quantitatively related to the ratio of debt to GDP. The\nrelationship shows that the market consistently expects default to occur if the\nGreek debt reaches twice the GDP. Our analysis does not preclude\nnon-equilibrium increases in interest rates over shorter timeframes. We find\nevidence of such non-equilibrium fluctuations in a separate analysis. According\nto the equilibrium model, the date by which a half-default must occur is March\n2013, almost one year after the actual debt write-down. Any acceleration of\ndefault by non-equilibrium fluctuations is significant for national and\ninternational interventions. The need for austerity or bailout costs would be\nreduced if market regulations were implemented to increase market stability to\nprevent short term interest rate increases. We similarly evaluate the timing of\nprojected defaults without interventions for Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy\nto be March 2013, April 2014, May 2014, and July 2016, respectively. All\ndefaults are mitigated by planned interventions. \n\n"}

This stage is manifest in\na potential in the equations for the Gaussian fluctuations during slow roll and\nmodify the power spectra of scalar perturbations via an initial condition\ntransfer function $\\mathcal{T}(k)$.

We propose a\nmethodology, inspired by statistical physics, that characterizes a model\nthrough its 'phase diagram' in the space of parameters. Our first motivation is\nto understand the large macro-economic fluctuations observed in the 'Mark I'\nABM. Our major finding is the generic existence of a phase transition between a\n'good economy' where unemployment is low, and a 'bad economy' where\nunemployment is high. We introduce a simpler framework that allows us to show\nthat this transition is robust against many modifications of the model, and is\ngenerically induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of\nfiring of the firms. The unemployment level remains small until a tipping\npoint, beyond which the economy suddenly collapses. If the parameters are such\nthat the system is close to this transition, any small fluctuation is amplified\nas the system jumps between the two equilibria. We have explored several\nnatural extensions of the model. One is to introduce a bankruptcy threshold,\nlimiting the leverage of firms. This leads to a rich phase diagram with, in\nparticular, a region where acute endogenous crises occur, during which the\nunemployment rate shoots up before the economy can recover. We also introduce\nsimple wage policies. This leads to inflation (in the 'good' phase) or\ndeflation (in the 'bad' phase), but leaves the overall phase diagram of the\nmodel essentially unchanged. We have also started exploring the effect of\nsimple monetary policies that attempt to contain rising unemployment and defang\ncrises. We end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of ABMs to\nmodel macroeconomic phenomena, in particular in view of the time needed to\nreach a steady state that raises the issue of ergodicity in these models. \n\n"}

The origin of the macroeconomic\ndynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth / capital\nof the wealthiest investors. - Economic cycles consist of a Schumpeter\n'creative destruction' pattern whereby the maxima are cusp-shaped while the\nminima are smooth. In between the cusps, the cycle consists of the sum of 2\n'crossing exponentials': one decaying and the other increasing.\n  This unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market\nfluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine\nconceptual synthesis between micro- and macroeconomics.

However, several studies have proved that real economic\nnetworks and multiplexes are topologically very different from configurations\ninferred only from node strengths.

In our investigation we focus on a community\ndetection algorithm which is identifying communities composed by both banks and\nfirms.

This is of\nparticular interest in finance, as the increasing complexity of financial\nsystems is coupled with information overload. Opinion formation, therefore, is\nnot always the result of optimal information processing. On the contrary,\nagents are boundedly rational and naturally tend to observe and imitate others\nin order to gain further insights. Hence, a certain degree of interaction,\nwhich can be envisioned as a network, occurs within the system. Opinions, the\ninteraction network and prices in financial markets are then heavily\nintertwined and influence one another. We build on previous contributions on\nadaptive systems, where agents have hetereogenous beliefs, and introduce a\ndynamic confidence network that captures the interaction and shapes the opinion\npatterns. The analytical framework we adopt for modeling the interaction is\nrooted in the opinion dynamics problem. This will allow us to introduce a\nnonlinear model where the confidence network, opinion dynamics and price\nformation coevolve in time. A key aspect of the model is the classification of\nagents according to their topological role in the network, therefore showing\nthat topology matters in determining how of opinions and prices will coevolve.\nWe illustrate the dynamics via simulations, discussing the stylized facts in\nfinance that the model is able to capture.

Two\nimportant models for the ITN structure, the classical gravity model of trade\n(more popular among economists) and the fitness model (more popular among\nnetworks scientists), are both limited to the characterization of only one\nrepresentation of the ITN. The gravity model satisfactorily predicts the volume\nof trade between connected countries, but cannot reproduce the observed missing\nlinks (i.e. the topology). On the other hand, the fitness model can\nsuccessfully replicate the topology of the ITN, but cannot predict the volumes.\nThis paper tries to make an important step forward in the unification of those\ntwo frameworks, by proposing a new GDP-driven model which can simultaneously\nreproduce the binary and the weighted properties of the ITN. Specifically, we\nadopt a maximum-entropy approach where both the degree and the strength of each\nnode is preserved.

This implies an\northogonality between stationary circulation $J^{ss}(x)$ and the gradient of\nstationary probability density $f^{ss}(x)>0$.

On the\nother hand, the concurrent participation of agents to discussions on different\ntopics induces each agent to develop a coherent set of opinions across all the\ntopics in which he is active. Moreover, the pervasive action of external\nstimuli, such as mass media, pulls the entire population towards a specific\nconfiguration of opinions on different topics. Here we propose a model in which\nagents with interrelated opinions, interacting on several layers representing\ndifferent topics, tend to spread their own ideas to their neighbourhood, strive\nto maintain internal coherence, due to the fact that each agent identifies\nmeaningful relationships among its opinions on the different topics, and are at\nthe same time subject to external fields, resembling the pressure of mass\nmedia.

The mere reason why that\nsubstitution was performed at all is that in the non -- Abelean case the volume\noperator, pivotal for the definition of the dynamics, is not diagonisable by\nanalytical methods. This, in contrast to the Abelean case, so far prohibited\nsemiclassical computations.

The ``holography'' is due to gauge symmetries\nthat tend to reduce the number of effective dimensions. Different 1T evolutions\n(i.e. different Hamiltonians) emerge from the same 2T theory when gauge fixing\nis done with different embeddings of d dimensions inside d+2 dimensions. Thus,\nin the 2T setting, the distinguished 1T which we call ``time'' is a gauge\ndependent concept. The 2T action has also a global SO(d,2) symmetry in flat\nspacetime, or a more general d+2 symmetry in curved spacetime, under which all\ndimensions are on an equal footing.

First, we study\nthe six cases m = 2, N = 2,...,7 by computing the the 3 x 3 Fisher information\nmatrices for the corresponding optimal measurements recently devised by Vidal\net al (quant-ph/9812068) for N = 2,...,7. We obtain simple polynomial\nexpressions for the (\"Gill-Massar\") traces of the products of the inverse of\nthe quantum Helstrom information matrix and these Fisher information matrices.\nThe six traces all have minima of 2 N -1 in the pure state limit, while for\nseparable measurements (quant-ph/9902063), the traces can equal N, but not\nexceed it. Then, the result of an analysis for m = 3, N = 2 leads us to\nconjecture that for optimal measurements for all m and N, the \"Gill-Massar\ntrace\" achieves a minimum of (2N-1)(m-1) in the pure state limit. \n\n"}
