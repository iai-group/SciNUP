We explore the possibility that they could be observably large\nin CMB, LSS, and Lyman-alpha data. We find that a k^3 component with a cutoff\nat some maximum k can modestly improve the fits (Delta chi^2=2.0, 5.4) of the\nlow multipoles (l ~ 10 - 50) or the second peak (l ~ 540) of the CMB angular\nspectrum when the three-year WMAP data are used. Moreover, the results from\nWMAP are consistent with the CBI, ACBAR, 2dFGRS, and SDSS data when they are\nincluded in the analysis. Including the SDSS galaxy clustering power spectrum,\nwe find weak positive evidence for the k^3 component at the level of Delta chi'\n= 2.4, with the caveat that the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum may\nnot be properly treated in the presence of the k^3 distortion.

Three physical degrees of\nfreedom are identified and it is shown that, in the case where matter is\ndescribed by a scalar field, they generalize the Mukhanov-Sasaki variables. In\norder to show that they are canonical variables, the action for the\ncosmological perturbations at second order is derived. Two major physical\nimprints of the primordial anisotropy are identified: (1) a scalar-tensor\n``see-saw'' mechanism arising from the fact that scalar, vector and tensor\nmodes do not decouple and (2) an explicit dependence of the statistical\nproperties of the density perturbations and gravity waves on the wave-vector\ninstead of its norm.

In case Hubble induced A-terms are present for these two flat\ndirections, their initial values are determined completely by the potential and\nthere are no ambiguities how they are mixed. Moreover, CP is violated even when\nthe Hubble parameter is large due to the Hubble induced A-term and cross\ncoupling in F-term, so that the lepton asymmetry is generated just after the\nend of inflation. As a result, compared with the case of single flat direction,\nthe resultant lepton-to-entropy ratio is enhanced by a factor of\n$H_{osc}/m_{3/2}$, where $H_{osc}$ is the Hubble parameter at the onset of\noscillation and $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass. However, when Hubble induced\nA-terms do not exist, there remains indefiniteness of initial phases and CP is\nviolated spontaneously by the phase difference between initial phase and\npotential minima of the hidden-sector induced A-terms.

In this paper we readdress this\nquestion using a combination of cosmological simulations of structure formation\nand extended Press-Schechter formalism and we show that the typical remnants of\nPopulation III stars are instead more likely to be found in a group\nenvironment, that is in dark matter halos of mass ~2x10^{13} h^{-1}M_sun.\nSimilarly, the descendants of the brightest z~6 QSOs are expected to be in\nmedium-sized clusters (mass of a few 10^{14} h^{-1}M_sun), rather than in the\nmost massive superclusters (M>10^{15} h^{-1}M_sun) found within the typical 1\nGpc^3 cosmic volume where a bright z~6 QSO lives. The origin of past claims\nthat the most massive clusters preferentially host these remnants is rooted in\nthe numerical method used to initialize their numerical simulations: Only a\nsmall region of the cosmological volume of interest was simulated with\nsufficient resolution to identify low-mass halos at early times, and this\nregion was chosen to host the most massive halo in the cosmological volume at\nlate times.

The best way to demonstrate this is by decomposing\nthe quasi-degenerate spectrum in to hierarchial and inverse-hierarchial mass\nmatrices, both with small mixing. Such a decomposition of the quasi-degenerate\nspectra is in fact very general and can be done irrespective of the mixing\npresent in the mass matrices.

As a promising contender for a unified theory at very high\nenergy scales, string theory is an obvious framework to look for the\ntheoretical foundations of inflation; we therefore try to determine the\ncharacteristic features of string-inspired inflationary scenarios, along with\ntheir observational consequences. In particular, we shall be interested in\nmodels of brane inflation, in which the inflaton field has non-canonical\ndymanics and where the era of reheating is interpreted as the mutual\nannihilation of (anti-)branes.\n  This document contains an introduction to cosmology and string theory as well\nas the model building efforts untertaken at their intersection in recent years.\nThe scientific articles published during the thesis are represented by a short\nsummary each and are available separately on the arXiv. \n\n"}

These effects may have striking consequences; for example, for\nresonantly-enhanced Sommerfeld annihilation, dark matter freezes out but may\nthen chemically recouple, implying highly suppressed indirect signals, in\ncontrast to naive expectations.

Such neutrinos would decouple early, with relic densities comparable\nto those of photons, but decay out of equilibrium, with consequent prodigious\nentropy generation prior to, or during, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).

However\nthere are novel features compared to both these models as follows: (i) If the\nadditional Abelian gauge group is unbroken then it can have a weaker gauge\ncoupling than in the E6SSM; (ii) If the additional Abelian gauge group is\nbroken then non-perturbative effects can violate the scale invariance of the\nNMSSM+ leading to a generalised model; (iii) Unification is achieved not at the\nfield theory level but at the F-theory level since the gauge couplings are\nsplit by flux effects, negating the need for any additional doublet states\nwhich are usually required; (iv) Proton decay is suppressed by the geometric\ncoupling suppression of a singlet state, a mechanism peculiar to F-theory,\nwhich effectively suppresses the coupling of the exotic charge -1/3 colour\ntriplet state D to quarks and leptons; (v) The D bar couples to left-handed\nleptoquarks, providing characteristic and striking signatures at the LHC. \n\n"}

A statistical anisotropy can be developed because of a cumulative\nanisotropic interaction induced by the background two-form field. The power\nspectrum of curvature perturbations has a prolate-type anisotropy, in contrast\nto the vector models having an oblate-type anisotropy.

We\npoint out that, in the presence of such a correlation, yet another kind of the\npost-recombination CMB temperature bispectra, the ISW-lensing bispectra, will\narise in the form of products of the auto- and cross-power spectra. We first\npresent an analytic method to calculate the autocorrelation of the temperature\nfluctuations induced by the strings, and the cross-correlation between the\ntemperature fluctuation and the lensing potential both due to the string\nnetwork. In our formulation, the evolution of the string network is assumed to\nbe characterized by the simple analytic model, the velocity-dependent one scale\nmodel, and the intercommutation probability is properly incorporated in orderto\ncharacterize the possible superstringy nature.

In the space spanned by the remaining\ninternal angle and the radial coordinate the branes admit two embeddings. The\nfirst one is U-shaped: the branes merge at some finite value of the radius. The\nsecond one is disconnected and extends along the entire radial direction at\nfixed angular separation. We interpret these two configurations as\ncorresponding to chiral-symmetry breaking and preserving phases, respectively.\nWe present a simple diagnostic tool to examine the classical stability of the\nembedding, based on the concavity/convexity conditions for the relevant\nthermodynamic potentials.

Motivated by the\nprofound importance of the discovery of gravitational waves from the early\nUniverse, we examine to what extent a combination of Galactic foregrounds and\nlensed E-modes could be responsible for the signal. We reanalyze the BICEP2\nresults and show that the 100x150 GHz and 150x150 GHz data are consistent with\na cosmology with r=0.2 and negligible foregrounds, but also with a cosmology\nwith r=0 and a significant dust polarization signal. We give independent\nestimates of the dust polarization signal in the BICEP2 region using four\ndifferent approaches. While these approaches are consistent with each other,\nthe expected amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum remains\nuncertain by about a factor of three. The lower end of the prediction leaves\nroom for a primordial contribution, but at the higher end the dust in\ncombination with the standard CMB lensing signal could account for the BICEP2\nobservations, without requiring the existence of primordial gravitational\nwaves. By measuring the cross-correlations between the pre-Planck templates\nused in the BICEP2 analysis and between different versions of a data-based\ntemplate, we emphasize that cross-correlations between models are very\nsensitive to noise in the polarization angles and that measured\ncross-correlations are likely underestimates of the contribution of foregrounds\nto the map. These results suggest that BICEP1 and BICEP2 data alone cannot\ndistinguish between foregrounds and a primordial gravitational wave signal, and\nthat future Keck Array observations at 100 GHz and Planck observations at\nhigher frequencies will be crucial to determine whether the signal is of\nprimordial origin.

SUSY also accomodates a weakly interacting cold dark matter (DM)\ncandidate in the form of a stable neutralino. In minimal realizations, the\nthus-far null results of direct DM searches, along with the DM relic abundance\nconstraint, introduce a level of fine-tuning as severe as the one due to the\nSUSY little hierarchy problem. We analyse the generic implications of new SUSY\nsectors parametrically heavier than the minimal SUSY spectrum, devised to\nincrease the Higgs boson mass, on this little neutralino DM problem. We focus\non the SUSY operator of smallest scaling dimension in an effective field theory\ndescription, which modifies the Higgs and DM sectors in a correlated manner.\nWithin this framework, we show that recent null results from the LUX experiment\nimply a tree-level fine-tuning for gaugino DM which is parametrically at least\na few times larger than that of the MSSM. Higgsino DM whose relic abundance is\ngenerated through a thermal freeze-out mechanism remains also severely\nfine-tuned, unless the DM lies below the weak boson pair-production threshold.\nAs in the MSSM, well-tempered gaugino-Higgsino DM is strongly disfavored by\npresent direct detection results. \n\n"}

The Weibel instability occurs in the\nplasma if there is an anisotropy in the particle distribution function of the\nparticles.

The simplest and most obvious UV complete model\nthat incorporates such signals is that it arises from a new singlet scalar (or\npseudo-scalar) coupled to a new electrically charged and colored heavy fermion.\nHere we show that these new fermions (and anti-fermions) would be produced in\nthe early universe, then form new color singlet heavy mesons with light quarks,\nobtain a non-negligible freeze-out abundance, and remain in kinetic equilibrium\nuntil decoupling. These heavy mesons possess interesting phenomenology,\ndependent on their charge, including forming new bound states with electrons\nand protons.

If the extended scalar sector\nparticipates in the electroweak symmetry breaking then these extra scalars need\nto couple with the known standard model particles. In this work, it has been\nshown that the vector boson scattering involving scalar boson exchanges provide\na complimentary way to direct search methods to probe into the scalar sector.\nAs different extended scalar sectors have similar types of scalar fields, e.g.,\nan extra $CP$-even Higgs, charged Higgs etc., these new physics models can give\nrise to the similar types of experimental signatures. It is possible to\ndistinguish between such models at various vector boson scattering processes by\nlooking at the resonances. Also, the shapes of the resonances can provide\nfurther insight to the relevant parameter space of these models.\n  As in the SM, the electroweak vacuum is metastable, it is important to\nexplore if an extended scalar has an answer in its reserve.

We\ndemonstrate that in the canonical string framework such a solution does not\nactually exist because an inconsistency arises between the renormalization\nproperties of the QCD S matrix at large $N$ -- a consequence of the asymptotic\nfreedom (AF) -- and the open/closed duality of the would-be string solution.\nSpecifically, the would-be open-string one-loop corrections to the tree\nglueball amplitudes must be ultraviolet (UV) divergent. Hence, naively, the\ninconsistency arises because these amplitudes are dual to tree closed-string\ndiagrams, which are universally believed to be both UV finite -- since they are\nclosed-string tree diagrams -- and infrared finite because of the glueball mass\ngap. In fact, the inconsistency follows from a low-energy theorem of the NSVZ\ntype that controls the renormalization in QCD-like theories. The inconsistency\nextends to the would-be canonical string for a vast class of 't Hooft large-$N$\nQCD-like theories including $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY QCD.

In this\nwork we compare this approach with a more sophisticated post-processing in\nwhich the observational uncertainties and selection effects (photometric,\nsurface gravity and effective temperature) are taken into account. We compare a\n`solar neighbourhood analogue' region in a model Milky Way-like galaxy\nsimulated with RAMSES-CH with fourth release Gaia-ESO survey data.

For mass in the 1.5-1.8 GeV range, the\nobserved DM relic abundance and the observed DM to ordinary matter ratio can\nemerge naturally. Dark matter freezes out before primordial nucleosynthesis and\ndoes not significantly impact primordial abundances, so the conventional\nargument that DM is non-baryonic does not apply.

In this model,\nseveral Higgs doublets are introduced to realize the realistic fermion mass\nmatrices, and the heavy Higgs doublets have flavor changing couplings with\nquarks and leptons. The LR symmetry is assumed to break down at high energy to\nrealize the Type-I seesaw mechanism. The supersymmetry breaking scale is\nexpected to be around 100 TeV to achieve the 125 GeV Higgs.

This suggests that\nthere could be a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty\nPrinciple or Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary\nparticles with $M < M_{P}$ and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the\npresence of $n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$ exceeding\nthe Planck length $R_P$, one expects $R_S \\propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R_P < R <\nR_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may be restored in some\ncircumstances because the {\\it effective} Compton wavelength of a particle\ndepends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is\nspherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \\propto M^{-1}$, as in the\n$3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the\nPlanck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black\nhole production at the LHC.

In\nthis case, the effective Planck length is increased even more but the Planck\nmass is unchanged, so that TeV quantum gravity is precluded and black holes\ncannot be generated in collider experiments. Nevertheless, the extra dimensions\ncould still have consequences for the detectability of black hole evaporations\nand the enhancement of pair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$.\nThough phenomenologically general for higher-dimensional theories, our results\nare shown to be consistent with string theory via the minimum positional\nuncertainty derived from $D$-particle scattering amplitudes. \n\n"}

We examine the roles played by LFUV NP and Lepton-Flavour Universal\n(LFU) NP altogether, providing new directions to identify the possible theory\nbeyond the SM responsible for the anomalies observed. New patterns of NP emerge\ndue to the possibility of allowing at the same time large LFUV and LFU NP\ncontributions to $C_{10\\mu}$, which provides a different mechanism to obey the\nconstraint from the $B_s \\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ branching ratio. In this landscape of\nNP, we discuss how to discriminate among these scenarios in the short term\nthanks to current and forthcoming observables. While the update of $R_K$ will\nbe a major milestone to confirm the NP origin of the flavour anomalies,\nadditional observables, in particular the LFUV angular observable $Q_5$, turn\nout to be central to assess the precise NP scenario responsible for the\nobserved anomalies. \n\n"}

Abstract: It is well established that the central deficit of dark matter (DM) observed\nin many dwarf galaxies disagrees with the cuspy DM haloes predicted in the\ncollision-less and cold DM (CDM) model. Plausible solutions to this problem are\nbased on an effective energy deposition into the central halo with an origin\nthat is either based on baryonic physics (e.g. supernova-driven gas blowouts;\nSNF) or on new DM physics (e.g. self-interacting DM, SIDM). We argue that the\nfundamental difference between the two is whether the process is impulsive or\nadiabatic, and explore novel ways to distinguishing them by looking at the\nresponse of stellar orbits. We perform idealised simulations of tracers\nembedded in a $1.48\\times 10^{10}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ spherical halo, and model the\ncreation of a $\\sim1$kpc DM matter core in SIDM with $\\sigma_T/m_{\\chi} =\n2\\,{\\rm cm}^2{\\rm g}^{-1}$ and through SNF by impulsively removing a mass\nequivalent to $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ of the halo's potential energy.

The adiabaticity\nof the SIDM case prevents tracers from changing their orbital family during\ncore formation whereas SNF separates tracers of initially the same family to a\nvariety of orbits. We show that these key features remain in a cosmological\nhalo, albeit for a few dynamical timescales.

For\nother redshift ranges the observable values may be degenerate with respect to\nthe cosmological parameter values and thus inefficient in constraining the\ngiven parameter. These are blind redshift ranges. We determine the optimum and\nthe blind redshift ranges of cosmological observables with respect to the\ncosmological parameters: matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$, equation of state\nparameter $w$ and a modified gravity parameter $g_a$ which parametrizes the\nevolution of an effective Newton's constant.

It is often argued that our existence\npre-selects regions where the cosmological constant is sufficiently small to\nallow galaxies like the Milky Way to form and intelligent life to emerge. Here\nwe propose a simple empirical test for this anthropic argument within the\nboundaries of the observable Universe.

The RG flow of these theories is studied by\nfield-theoretical approaches, computing and analyzing high-order perturbative\nseries, up to six loops. According to this RG analysis, the transition in QCD\ncan be continuous only for N_f=2. In this case it belongs to the 3D O(4)\nuniversality class.

We\ndemonstrate that in all these reactions there is a common suppression mechanism\nthat can be viewed, alternatively, as a consequence of a reduced survival\nprobability for large rapidity gap processes in nuclei, Sudakov suppression, an\nenhanced resolution of higher Fock states by nuclei, or an effective energy\nloss that rises linearly with energy. Our calculations agree with data. \n\n"}

Our analysis is based on a\nmanifestly gauge-invariant approach that we introduced recently. It deals with\ngauge-invariant Green's functions and provides a method to evaluate the\ncorresponding generating functional without fixing the gauge. First we show,\nfor the case where no fermions are included in the effective Lagrangian, that\nthe set of low-energy constants currently used in the literature is redundant.\nIn particular, by employing the equations of motion for the gauge fields one\ncan choose to remove two low-energy constants which contribute to the\nself-energies of the gauge bosons. If fermions are included in the effective\nfield theory analysis the situation is more involved. Even in this case,\nhowever, these contributions to the self-energies of the gauge bosons can be\nremoved. The relation of this result to the experimentally determined values\nfor the oblique parameters S, T, and U is discussed. In the second part of the\npaper we consider the matching relation between a full and an effective theory.\nWe show how the low-energy constants of the effective Lagrangian can be\ndetermined by matching gauge-invariant Green's functions in both theories.

For\n$9\\ge n\\ge3$, $M_n$ enumerates positive knots with $n$ crossings. Positive\nknots to which field theory assigns knot-numbers that are not MZVs first appear\nat 10 crossings.

Abstract: We compare the conventional description of the interaction of matter with the\nfour known forces in the standard model with an alternative Weyl description in\nwhich the chiral coupling is extended to include gravity. The two are\nindistinguishable at the low energy classical level of equations of motion, but\nthere are subtle differences at the quantum level when nonvanishing torsion and\nthe Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly is taken into account. The spin current and\nenergy-momentum of the chiral theory then contain non-Hermitian terms which are\nnot present in the conventional theory. In the chiral alternative, CPT\ninvariance is not automatic because chirality supersedes Hermiticity but full\nLorentz invariance holds. New fermion loop processes associated with the theory\nare discussed together with a perturbative regularization which explicitly\nmaintains the chiral nature and local symmetries of the theory. \n\n"}

Limiting our attention to the better understood case where NS-branes\ndo not intersect over a four dimensional surface gives some restrictions on the\ntheories, but still permits many examples, both anomalous and non-anomalous.

{"id": "hep-th/9906246", "contents": "Title: Remarks on the Racetrack Scheme Abstract: There are only a small number of ideas for stabilizing the moduli of string\ntheory. One of the most appealing of these is the racetrack mechanism, in which\na delicate interplay between two strongly interacting gauge groups fixes the\nvalue of the coupling constant. In this note, we explore this scenario. We find\nthat quite generally, some number of discrete tunings are required in order\nthat the mechanism yield a small gauge coupling. Even then, there is no sense\nin which a weak coupling approximation is valid. On the other hand, certain\nholomorphic quantities can be computed, so such a scheme is in principle\npredictive. Searching for models which realize this mechanism is thus of great\ninterest. We also remark on cosmology in these schemes. \n\n"}

In particular, the usual method of deriving\nparticle masses from logarithmic derivatives need to be modified. Similarly\nYukawa-like potentials of nuclear physics due to exchange of those mesons are\nsignificantly modified since the coupling to the decay products is strong. For\nexample, the large distance asymptotic changes, exp(-M_{min} r), where M_{min}\nis the sum of the decay product masses\n  (2 m_{\\pi}, 2 m_{e}, 2 m_{\\nu}). In the area M_{min}r<1the potential has a\nlong-range tail 1/r^3. Similar effects appear due to the virtual decays in the\nelecroweak sector of the Standard model.
