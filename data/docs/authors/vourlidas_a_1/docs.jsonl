I show that\nwith three bands only ({\\it gri}) it is possible to achieve results as accurate\nas the ones obtained by other techniques, generally based on more filters. In\nparticular, the use of the $(g-i)$ color helps improving the final redshifts\n(especially for clusters), as this color monotonically increases up to $z \\sim\n0.8$.

Outside the\nmain ring, while some systems exhibit smooth surface brightness profiles (SB)\nthat fall off roughly as r**-3.5, others display large luminosity drops at the\nring's outer edge and steeper radial SB profiles. We seek to understand this\ndiversity of outer edge profiles under the ``natural'' collisional evolution of\nthe system, without invoking external agents such as planets or gas. We use a\nstatistical code to follow the evolution of a collisional population, ranging\nfrom dust grains (submitted to radiation pressure) to planetesimals and\ninitially confined within a belt (the 'birth ring'). The system typically\nevolves toward a \"standard\" steady state, with no sharp edge and SB \\propto\nr**-3.5 outside the birth ring. Deviations from this standard profile, in the\nform of a sharp outer edge and a steeper fall-off, occur only when two\nparameters take their extreme values: 1) When the birth ring is so massive that\nit becomes radially optically thick for the smallest grains. However, the\nrequired disc mass is here probably too high to be realistic. 2) When the\ndynamical excitation of the dust-producing planetesimals is so low (<e> <0.01)\nthat the smallest grains, which otherwise dominate the total optical depth, are\npreferentially depleted. This low-excitation case, although possibly not\ngeneric, cannot be ruled out by observations. Our \"standard\" profile provides a\nsatisfactory explanation for a large group of debris discs with outer edges and\nSB falling as r**-3.5. Systems with sharper outer edges, barring other\nconfining agents, could still be explained by ``natural'' collisional evolution\nif their dynamical excitation is very low.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of the ISM and the formation of molecular\nhydrogen through numerical simulations of spiral galaxies. The model follows\nthe chemical, thermal and dynamical response of the disc to an external spiral\npotential. Self-gravity and magnetic fields are not included. The calculations\ndemonstrate that gas can cool rapidly when subject to a spiral shock. Molecular\nclouds in the spiral arms arise through a combination of compression of the ISM\nby the spiral shock and orbit crowding. These results highlight that local\nself-gravity is not required to form molecular clouds. Self-shielding provides\na sharp transition density, below which gas is essentially atomic, and above\nwhich the molecular gas fraction is >0.001. The timescale for gas to move\nbetween these regimes is very rapid (<~1 Myr). From this stage, the majority of\ngas generally takes between 10 to 20 Myr to obtain high H$_{2}$ fractions (>50\n%). Although our calculations are unable to resolve turbulent motions on scales\nsmaller than the spiral arm and do not include self-gravity. True cloud\nformation timescales are therefore expected to be even shorter.\n  The mass budget of the disc is dominated by cold gas residing in the spiral\narms.

Consequently, most of the volume in the interarm\nregions is filled with warm atomic gas. However, some cold spurs and clumps can\nsurvive in interarm regions for periods comparable to the interarm passage\ntimescale.

The relevant phases are prompt and steady-state convection, the\nstanding accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the\nstages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission.\nDowndrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star\n\"surface\" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find\nthat the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by\nextension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI\nmotions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz\nafter bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are primarily independent of these speeds, but are\nset by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy\nfrequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection. Consequently, the GW\ncharacteristic frequencies are dependent upon a combination of core structure\nattributes, specifically the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and details\nthat determine the gradients at the boundary, including the accretion-rate\nhistory, the EOS at subnuclear densities, and neutrino transport.

The\nquestion of how these stars came to be in such close proximity has implications\nfor our understanding of massive star formation and early cluster evolution. A\npromising route toward rapid mass segregation was proposed by McMillan et al.\n(2007), who showed that the merger product of faster-evolving sub clusters can\ninherit their apparent dynamical age from their progenitors. In this paper we\nbriefly consider this process at a size and time scale more suited for local\nand perhaps more typical star formation, with stellar numbers from the hundreds\nto thousands. We find that for reasonable ages and cluster sizes, the merger of\nsub-clusters can indeed lead to compact configurations of the most massive\nstars, a signal seen both in Nature and in large-scale hydrodynamic simulations\nof star formation from collapsing molecular clouds, and that sub-virial initial\nconditions can make an un-merged cluster display a similar type of mass\nsegregation. Additionally, we discuss a variation of the minimum spanning tree\nmass-segregation technique introduced by Allison et al. (2009). \n\n"}

We computed time\nseries of line profiles for evolved massive stars broadened by rotation and by\nhundreds of low-amplitude nonradial gravity-mode pulsations which are predicted\nto be excited for evolved massive stars.

In a model where the\ntotal ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity,\nwe find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4e-8 M_sun/yr, which is two orders of\nmagnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus it is clear\nthat the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This\ncan be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger\ncolumns (~1e22 cm^-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at\nlarger radius than the EUV can. The radial extent of the launching region of\nthe X-ray heated wind is 1-70AU compared with the pure EUV case where the\nlaunch region is concentrated around a few AU. When we couple our wind\nmass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as\nin the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner\nhole develops at ~ 1 AU at the point that the accretion rate in the disc drops\nbelow the wind mass loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is\nquickly removed in the final 15-20% of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent\nwith the 1e5 yr transitional timescale estimated from observations of T-Tauri\nstars. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to\nsome accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large\nX-ray luminosity of 2e30 erg/s; further modeling is required in order to\ninvestigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray\nluminosities in T-Tauri stars. \n\n"}

In general it\nconsists of two parts, one independent of and another one proportional to the\nmean magnetic field. The first part may be nonzero only in the presence of mhd\nturbulence, maintained, e.g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a\nbattery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The\nsecond part, which covers, e.g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale\ndynamos. Only a few examples of the aforementioned first part of mean\nelectromotive force have been discussed so far. It is shown that a mean\nelectromotive force proportional to the mean fluid velocity, but independent of\nthe mean magnetic field, may occur in an originally homogeneous isotropic mhd\nturbulence if there are nonzero correlations of velocity and electric current\nfluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field\nfluctuations.

Contributions to the mean electromotive force due to\ninhomogeneity of the turbulence are also considered.

We estimate an upper limit for\nthe abundance of Pop III star clusters which thus form in the reionized\nUniverse, as a function of redshift. Depending on the minimum DM halo mass for\nstar formation, between of the order of one and of the order of a thousand Pop\nIII star clusters per square degree may be observable at 2 <~ z <~ 7. Thus,\nthere may be a sufficient number density of Pop III star clusters for detection\nin surveys such as the Deep-Wide Survey (DWS) to be conducted by the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST).

This explicitly model-dependent approach is based on\nreadily-available observations, and results in small formal errors. Here I use\ntwo calibration samples of stars (eclipsing binaries and stars for which\nasteroseismic analyses are available) having well-determined masses and radii\nto estimate the accuracy and systematic errors inherent in the rho_* method.\nWhen matching to the Yonsei-Yale stellar evolution models, I find the most\nimportant systematic error results from selection bias favoring\nrapidly-rotating (hence probably magnetically active) stars among the eclipsing\nbinary sample. If unaccounted for, this bias leads to a mass-dependent\nunderestimate of stellar radii by as much as 4% for stars of 0.4 M_sun,\ndecreasing to zero for masses above about 1.4 M_sun. The asteroseismic sample\nsuggests (albeit with significant uncertainty) that systematic errors are small\nfor slowly-rotating, inactive stars. Systematic errors arising from failings of\nthe Yonsei-Yale models of inactive stars probably exist, but are difficult to\nassess because of the small number of well-characterized comparison stars\nhaving low mass and slow rotation. Poor information about [Z] is an important\nsource of random error, and may be a minor source of systematic error as well.\nWith suitable corrections for rotation, it is likely that systematic errors in\nthe rho_* method can be comparable to or smaller than the random errors,\nyielding radii that are accurate to about 2% for most stars. \n\n"}

In the community, some scientists have started doubting about the\nvalidity of the classical tools to analyze these very accurate light curves.\n  This work provides the asteroseismic community with answers to this question\nshowing that (1) it is physically possible for a star to excite at a time and\nwith the observed amplitudes such a large number of modes; and (2) that the\nkinetic energy accumulated in all those modes does not destroy the equilibrium\nof the star. Consequently, mathematical tools presently applied in the analyses\nof light curves can a priori be trusted. This conclusion is even more important\nnow, when a large amount of space data coming from Kepler are currently being\nanalyzed.\n  The power spectrum of different stellar cases, and the non-adiabatic code\nGraCo have been used to estimate the upper limit of the energy per second\nrequired to excite all the observed modes, and their total kinetic energy. A\nnecessary previous step for this study is to infer the relative radial\npulsational amplitude from the observed photometric amplitude, scaling our\nlinear pulsational solutions to absolute values.

The averaged field then obeys a\nLangevin-type equation into which short-scale fluctuations enter as a noise\nterm. We solve the Langevin equation for a inflaton field with Dirac Born\nInfeld (DBI) kinetic term perturbatively in the noise and use the result to\ndetermine the field value's Probability Density Function (PDF). In this\ncalculation, both the shape of the potential and the warp factor are arbitrary\nfunctions, and the PDF is obtained with and without volume effects due to the\nfinite size of the averaging domain. DBI kinetic terms typically arise in\nstring-inspired inflationary scenarios in which the scalar field is associated\nwith some distance within the (compact) extra dimensions. The inflaton's\naccessible range of field values therefore is limited because of the extra\ndimensions' finite size. We argue that in a consistent stochastic approach the\ndistance-inflaton's PDF must vanish for geometrically forbidden field values.\nWe propose to implement these extra-dimensional spatial restrictions into the\nPDF by installing absorbing (or reflecting) walls at the respective boundaries\nin field space. As a toy model, we consider a DBI inflaton between two\nabsorbing walls and use the method of images to determine its most general PDF.\nThe resulting PDF is studied in detail for the example of a quartic warp factor\nand a chaotic inflaton potential. The presence of the walls is shown to affect\nthe inflaton trajectory for a given set of parameters. \n\n"}

The fast-evolving light curve soon after\nthe outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and the\noverall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes of\nvariability of an extremely active LBV. However, the widths of the spectral\nlines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar to\nthose observed in Wolf-Rayet stars.

Observation of spectral splits in a future galactic\nsupernova signal is expected to throw light on the mass hierarchy pattern of\nthe neutrinos. However, since the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB)\ncomprises of a superposition of neutrino fluxes from all past supernovae, and\nsince different supernovae are expected to have slightly different initial\nfluxes, it is pertinent to check if the hierarchy dependent signature of\ncollective oscillations can survive this averaging of the flux spectra.

Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first\nphase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant\nnuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the\nneutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process. At the end of this\nphase, the abundances follow a steady beta flow for the hot r-process and a\nsteady flow of neutron captures and beta decays for the cold r-process. After\nneutrons are almost exhausted, matter decays to stability and our results show\nthat in both cases neutron captures are key for determining the final\nabundances, the position of the r-process peaks, and the formation of the\nrare-earth peak.

We have studied its importance on the period, the amplitude of the\nsolar cycle, and also in producing Maunder-like grand minima in these models.\nFirst, we model the periods of the last 23 sunspot cycles by varying the\nmeridional circulation speed. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,\nthen we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some\nextent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an\nadvection-dominated regime. \n\n"}

Our\ngoal is to test whether the de Jager et al. (1988) prescription, used in some\nstellar evolution models, is still valid in view of more recent mass-loss\ndeterminations. By considering 40 Galactic RSGs presenting an infrared excess\nand an IRAS 60-mu flux larger than 2 Jy, and assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio\nof 200, it is found that the de Jager rate agrees within a factor 4 with most\nMdot estimates based on the 60-mu signal. It is also in agreement with 6 of the\nonly 8 Galactic RSGs for which Mdot can be measured more directly through\nobservations of the circumstellar gas. The two objects that do not follow the\nde Jager prescription (by an order of magnitude) are mu Cep and NML Cyg. We\nhave also considered the RSGs of the Magellanic Clouds.

The observations\nwere carried out at the VLT and the Subaru Telescope at six epochs from April\nto August 2008, covering the plateau of the outburst and the fading phase to a\nquiescent state. The line flux of CO emission declines with the visual\nbrightness of the star and the continuum flux at 5 um, but composed of two\nsubcomponents that decay with different rates.

This object appears to be undergoing a major\nmerger. It is a double X-ray source and is detected in the radio at 1.4 GHz.\nThis paper investigates signatures of the interaction of the two components.\nRedshifts were measured to determine velocity dispersions and virial radii of\neach component. The technique of fuzzy clustering was used to assign membership\nweights to the galaxies in each clump. Using redshifts of 93 cluster members\nwithin 1.4 Mpc of the subcluster centres, the virial masses and anisotropy\nparameters are derived. 37% of the spectroscopically observed galaxies show\nemission lines and are predominantly star forming in the diagnostic diagram. No\nstrong AGN sources were found. The emission line galaxies tend to lie between\nthe two cluster centres with more near the SW clump. The luminosity functions\nof the two subclusters differ. The NE component is similar to many rich\nclusters, while the SW component has more faint galaxies. The NE clump's light\nprofile follows a single NFW profile with c = 10 while the SW is better fit\nwith an extended outer region and a compact inner core, consistent with\navailable X-ray data indicating that the SW clump has a cooling core.

Recent studies\nhave shown that magnetic braking is strong enough to suppress the formation of\nrotationally supported disks in the ideal MHD limit. Whether non-ideal MHD\neffects can enable disk formation remains unsettled. We carry out a first study\non how disk formation in magnetic clouds is modified by the Hall effect, the\nleast explored of the three non-ideal MHD effects in star formation (the other\ntwo being ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation). For illustrative\npurposes, we consider a simplified problem of a non-self-gravitating,\nmagnetized envelope collapsing onto a central protostar of fixed mass. We find\nthat the Hall effect can spin up the inner part of the collapsing flow to\nKeplerian speed, producing a rotationally supported disk. The disk is generated\nthrough a Hall-induced magnetic torque. Disk formation occurs even when the\nenvelope is initially non-rotating, provided that the Hall coefficient is large\nenough. When the magnetic field orientation is flipped, the direction of disk\nrotation is reversed as well. The implication is that the Hall effect can in\nprinciple produce both regularly rotating and counter-rotating disks around\nprotostars. We conclude that the Hall effect is an important factor to consider\nin studying the angular momentum evolution of magnetized star formation in\ngeneral and disk formation in particular. \n\n"}

We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock\naround its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For\nWASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.\nObservational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal\nvariations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock\nand the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's\nmagnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding\nambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the\nknown eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets. We show that, because the distance\nfrom the star changes along the orbit of an eccentric planet, the shock\ncharacteristics are modulated by orbital phase. We predict time offsets between\nthe beginnings of the near-UV and optical light curves that are, in general,\nless than the transit duration. Variations in shock characteristics caused in\neccentric systems can only be probed if the shock is observed at different\norbital phases, which is, in general, not the case for transit observations.\nHowever, non-thermal radio emission produced by the interaction of the star and\nplanet should be modulated by orbital phase. We also quantify the response of\nthe shock to variations in the coronal material itself due to, e.g., a\nnon-axisymmetric stellar corona, planetary obliquity, intrinsic variations of\nthe stellar magnetic field. Such variations do not depend on the system\neccentricity.

With the continuous high quality, spatial and\ntemporal resolution G-band data, we not only confirm the rapid decay of outer\npenumbrae and darkening of the central structure near the flaring neutral line,\nbut also unambiguously detect for the first time the enhancement of the sheared\nEvershed flow (average horizontal flow speed increased from 330+-3.1 to\n403+-4.6 m/s) along the neutral line right after the eruptive white-light\nflare.

The dense\ncores are identified in the simulated density data cube through a clumpfind\nalgorithm. We find that the core velocity dispersion does not show any clear\ndependence on the core size, in contrast to Larson's linewidth-size relation,\nbut consistent with recent observations. In the absence of a magnetic field,\nthe majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions. A\nmoderately-strong magnetic field reduces the dispersion to a subsonic or at\nmost transonic value typically. Most of the cores are out of virial\nequilibrium, with the external pressure dominating the self-gravity. The\nimplication is that the core evolution is largely controlled by the\noutflow-driven turbulence. Even an initially-weak magnetic field can retard\nstar formation significantly, because the field is amplified by the\noutflow-driven turbulence to an equipartition strength, with the distorted\nfield component dominating the uniform one. In contrast, for a\nmoderately-strong field, the uniform component remains dominant. Such a\ndifference in the magnetic structure is evident in our simulated polarization\nmaps of dust thermal emission; it provides a handle on the field strength.\nRecent polarization measurements show that the field lines in cluster-forming\nclumps are spatially well-ordered. It is indicative of a moderately-strong,\ndynamically important, field which, in combination with outflow feedback, can\nkeep the rate of star formation in embedded clusters at the\nobservationally-inferred, relatively-slow rate of several percent per free-fall\ntime. \n\n"}

They\nare the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon\ndistance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to\nbe candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy\nproduction rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long\nGRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view\nthat GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs.

Due to heating during the dynamical and viscous\nphases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, and\nradially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.\n  Following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near the\nenvelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convective\ncarbon-burning. If not, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the inner region of the\nenvelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of the\nenvelope, again yielding off-center burning. As a result, the long-term\nevolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous\ncalculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventually\nyielding a high-mass O/Ne WD or a collapse to a neutron star. During the\ncooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near the\nEddington limit. Given the double WD merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, tens of\nthese ~1e38 erg/s sources should exist in a Milky Way-type galaxy.\n  While the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physical\npicture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previous\nwork.

We have fitted the observed frequencies with theoretical\nfrequencies of axisymmetric modes in a grid of stellar models with dipole\nmagnetic fields. We find that, among models with a standard composition of\n$(X,Z) = (0.70,0.02)$ and with suppressed convection, eigenfrequencies of a\n$1.65\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ model with $\\log T_{\\rm eff} = 3.858$ and a polar\nmagnetic field strength of 4.1kG agree best with the observed frequencies. We\nidentify the observed pulsation frequency with the largest amplitude as a\ndeformed dipole ($\\ell = 1$) mode, and the four next-largest-amplitude\nfrequencies as deformed $\\ell = 2$ modes. These modes have a radial quasi-node\nin the outermost atmospheric layers ($\\tau \\sim 10^{-3}$).

In effect, this condition is equivalent\nto requiring the resulting disc be sufficiently extended in order to fragment,\nin line with studies of isolated discs. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nwith hybrid radiative transfer to investigate this claim, confirming that in\ngeneral, homogeneous spherical molecular clouds will produce fragmenting\nself-gravitating discs if the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to\ngravitational potential energy is greater than ~ 5e-3, where this result is\nrelatively insensitive to the initial thermal energy.

Specifically, we investigate the possibility of the\nvery massive star (VMS) VFTS 682 being a runaway member of R136. Recent\nobservations of the above VMS, by virtue of its isolated location and its\nmoderate peculiar motion, have raised the fundamental question whether isolated\nmassive star formation is indeed possible. We perform the first realistic\nN-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which\nall the massive stars are in primordial binary systems. These calculations\nconfirm that the dynamical ejection of a VMS from a R136-like cluster, with\nkinematic properties similar to those of VFTS 682, is common. Hence the\nconjecture of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to account for\nthis VMS. Our results are also quite consistent with the ejection of 30 Dor\n016, another suspected runaway VMS from R136. We further note that during the\nclusters' evolution, mergers of massive binaries produce a few single stars per\ncluster with masses significantly exceeding the canonical upper-limit of 150\nsolar mass.

The campaign was designed to\ncharacterize the behavior of energetic flare events, which routinely occur on M\ndwarfs, at IR wavelengths to milli-magnitude precision, and quantify to what\nextent such events might influence current and future efforts to detect and\ncharacterize extrasolar planets surrounding these stars. We detected and\ncharacterized four highly energetic optical flares having U-band total energies\nof ~7.8x10^30 to ~1.3x10^32 ergs, and found no corresponding response in the J,\nH, or Ks bandpasses at the precision of our data.

While the\nbest-fitting hosts of the dwarf spheroidals all have 12 < Vmax < 25 km/s, LCDM\nsimulations predict at least ten subhalos with Vmax > 25 km/s. These subhalos\nare also among the most massive at earlier times, and significantly exceed the\nUV suppression mass back to z ~ 10. No LCDM-based model of the satellite\npopulation of the Milky Way explains this result. The problem lies in the\nsatellites' densities: it is straightforward to match the observed Milky Way\nluminosity function, but doing so requires the dwarf spheroidals to have dark\nmatter halos that are a factor of ~5 more massive than is observed. Independent\nof the difficulty in explaining the absence of these dense, massive subhalos,\nthere is a basic tension between the derived properties of the bright Milky Way\ndwarf spheroidals and LCDM expectations.

An Analytic Model for Stellar Correlation\n  Functions Abstract: Recently, we have shown that if the ISM is governed by super-sonic turbulent\nflows, the excursion-set formalism can be used to calculate the statistics of\nself-gravitating objects over a wide range of scales. On the largest\nself-gravitating scales ('first crossing'), these correspond to GMCs, and on\nthe smallest non-fragmenting self-gravitating scales ('last crossing'), to\nprotostellar cores. Here, we extend this formalism to rigorously calculate the\nauto and cross-correlation functions of cores (and by extension, young stars)\nas a function of spatial separation and mass, in analogy to the cosmological\ncalculation of halo clustering. We show that this generically predicts that\nstar formation is very strongly clustered on small scales: stars form in\nclusters, themselves inside GMCs. Outside the binary-star regime, the projected\ncorrelation function declines as a weak power-law, until a characteristic scale\nwhich corresponds to the characteristic mass scale of GMCs. On much larger\nscales the clustering declines such that star formation is not strongly biased\non galactic scales, relative to the actual dense gas distribution. The precise\ncorrelation function shape depends on properties of the turbulent spectrum, but\nits qualitative behavior is quite general. The predictions agree well with\nobservations of young star and core autocorrelation functions over ~4 dex in\nradius. Clustered star formation is a generic consequence of supersonic\nturbulence if most of the power in the velocity field, hence the contribution\nto density fluctuations, comes from large scales.

Furthermore, if we restrict our analysis to stars with the most\naccurate iron abundances, ~20 FeI and at least three FeII measurements (15\nstars), we found that the range in iron abundances covered by Carina RGs (~1\ndex) agrees quite well with similar estimates based on high-resolution spectra. \n\n"}

An extrasolar Kuiper Belt at the height of\n  its dynamical activity Abstract: Fomalhaut is a young, nearby star that is suspected to harbor an infant\nplanetary system, interspersed with one or more belts of dusty debris.

The images show the main debris belt in great detail. Even at\nhigh spatial resolution, the belt appears smooth. The region in between the\nbelt and the central star is not devoid of material; thermal emission is\nobserved here as well. Also at the location of the star, excess emission is\ndetected.\n  We use a dynamical model together with radiative-transfer tools to derive the\nparameters of the debris disk. We include detailed models of the interaction of\nthe dust grains with radiation, for both the radiation pressure and the\ntemperature determination. Comparing these models to the spatially resolved\ntemperature information contained in the images allows us to place strong\nconstraints on the presence of grains that will be blown out of the system by\nradiation pressure. We use this to derive the dynamical parameters of the\nsystem.\n  The appearance of the belt points towards a remarkably active system in which\ndust grains are produced at a very high rate by a collisional cascade in a\nnarrow region filled with dynamically excited planetesimals. Dust particles\nwith sizes below the blow-out size are abundantly present. The equivalent of\n2000 one-km-sized comets are destroyed every day, out of a cometary reservoir\namounting to 110 Earth masses. From comparison of their scattering and thermal\nproperties, we find evidence that the dust grains are fluffy aggregates, which\nindicates a cometary origin. The excess emission at the location of the star\nmay be produced by hot dust with a range of temperatures, but may also be due\nto gaseous free-free emission from a stellar wind. \n\n"}

The difference between\nthe ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at DAZ white dwarfs, which\noften exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the DBZ\nstars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result from\nhigh-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected to\ndate. This paper explores the likelihood that such brief, intense accretion\nepisodes of gas-phase material can account for existing data. For reasonable\nassumptions about the circumstellar gas, accretion rates approaching or\nexceeding 1e15 g/s are possible, similar to rates observed in quiescent\ncataclysmic variables, and potentially detectable with future x-ray missions or\nwide-field monitoring facilities.

Transport to Earth through the\ninterstellar medium is expected to affect the cosmic ray properties as well.\nHowever, the observed anisotropy of TeV cosmic rays and its energy dependence\ncannot be explained with diffusion models of particle propagation in the\nGalaxy. Within a distance of a few parsec, diffusion regime is not valid and\nparticles with energy below about 100 TeV must be influenced by the heliosphere\nand its elongated tail. The observation of a highly significant localized\nexcess region of cosmic rays from the apparent direction of the downstream\ninterstellar flow at 1-10 TeV energies might provide the first experimental\nevidence that the heliotail can affect the transport of energetic particles. In\nparticular, TeV cosmic rays propagating through the heliotail interact with the\n100-300 AU wide magnetic field polarity domains generated by the 11 year\ncycles. Since the strength of non-linear convective processes is expected to be\nlarger than viscous damping, the plasma in the heliotail is turbulent.

We calculate the future\nevolution of the companion by injecting 2-6 10^47 ergs into the stellar\nevolution model of a 1 Msun donor star based on the post-explosion progenitors\nseen in simulations. We find that, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz collapse of the\nenvelope, the companion must become significantly more luminous (10 - 10^3\nLsun) for a long period of time (10^3 - 10^4 years).

We collect and summarize the magnetic field topology information\nobtained to date and present Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams for the stars in\nthe sample. Intriguingly, the large scale field topology of a given pre-main\nsequence (PMS) star is strongly dependent upon the stellar internal structure,\nwith the strength of the dipole component of its multipolar magnetic field\ndecaying rapidly with the development of a radiative core. Using the\nobservational data as a basis, we argue that the general characteristics of the\nglobal magnetic field of a PMS star can be determined from its position in the\nHR diagram. Moving from hotter and more luminous to cooler and less luminous\nstars across the PMS of the HR diagram, we present evidence for four distinct\nmagnetic topology regimes. Stars with large radiative cores, empirically\nestimated to be those with a core mass in excess of ~40 per cent of the stellar\nmass, host highly complex and dominantly non-axisymmetric magnetic fields,\nwhile those with smaller radiative cores host axisymmetric fields with field\nmodes of higher order than the dipole dominant (typically, but not always, the\noctupole).

A conducting fluid of magnetic Prandtl number Pm=0.01 is driven into\nmotion by the counter-rotation of the two hemispheric walls. The resulting flow\nis of von K\\'arm\\'an type, consisting of a layer of zonal velocity close to the\nouter wall and a secondary meridional circulation. Above a certain forcing\nthreshold, the mean flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric motions within an\nequatorial belt. For fixed forcing above this threshold, we have studied the\ndynamo properties of this flow. The presence of a conducting outer wall is\nessential to the existence of a dynamo at these parameters. We have therefore\nstudied the effect of changing the material parameters of the wall (magnetic\npermeability, electrical conductivity, and thickness) on the dynamo. In common\nwith previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the\nconductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large. However, we find that\nthe effect of these two parameters on the dynamo process are different and can\neven compete to the detriment of the dynamo. Our self-consistent approach allow\nus to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are\ntypically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial\ndipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce\na strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting\nouter wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside. The generation of\nthe axisymmetric poloidal field, on the other hand, occurs in the equatorial\nbelt and does not depend on the wall properties. \n\n"}

Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize\nmaps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and\nchaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape. We find that mass loss\nnon-adiabatically affects planet-planet interaction for the most massive\nprogenitor stars which avoid the supernova stage. For these cases, we present\nspecific examples of planetary escape. \n\n"}

The alternative picture was either reconnection due to the\nstochasticity of magnetic field lines in turbulence or the tearing instability\nof the thin current sheet.

The late-time evolution resembles generic turbulence\nwith -5/3 power spectrum and scale-dependent anisotropy, so I conclude that the\ntearing-driven reconnection becomes turbulent reconnection. The turbulence is\nlocal in scale, so microscopic diffusivity should not affect large-scale\nquantities.

Violent\nmergers of two carbon--oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are one candidate\nsuggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal SNe\nIa. Here, we simulate the merger of two CO WDs using a moving-mesh code that\nallows for the inclusion of thin helium (He) shells (0.01\\,\\msun) on top of the\nWDs, at an unprecedented numerical resolution. The accretion of He onto the\nprimary WD leads to the formation of a detonation in its He shell. This\ndetonation propagates around the CO WD and sends a converging shock wave into\nits core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-known\ndouble-detonation scenario for\n  He-accreting CO WDs. However, in contrast to that scenario where a massive He\nshell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the He\ndetonation is ignited dynamically.

However, we do not know\nto what extent the complex flux tube topology seen near the Sun survives as the\nwind expands into interplanetary space. In order to study the possible\nlong-distance connections between the corona and the heliosphere, we developed\nnew models of turbulence-driven solar wind acceleration along empirically\nconstrained field lines. We used a potential-field model of the Quiet Sun to\ntrace field lines into the ecliptic plane with unprecedented spatial resolution\nat their footpoints.

We detected a stable\nperiodicity of 0.114379(1) d, which we identified as being the binary's orbital\nperiod. The stronger photometric period around 0.12245 d, which had been\ndetected from the ground-based observation, was found to be variable, and we\nidentified this period as being the positive superhump period. This superhump\nperiod showed short-term (10-20 d) and strong variations in period most\nunexpectedly when the object entered a slightly faint state. The fractional\nsuperhump excess varied as large as ~30%. The variation of the period very well\ntraced the variation of the brightness of the system. The time-scales of this\nvariation of the superhump period was too slow to be interpreted as the\nvariation caused by the change in the disk radius due to the thermal disk\ninstability.

We use high-quality observations from CRISP at the SST to investigate\nsigns of these different kinetic modes in spicules on the disk. Earlier, rapid\nblue-shifted excursions (RBEs), short-lived absorption features in the blue\nwing of chromospheric spectral lines, were identified as the disk counterpart\nof type II spicules. Here we report the existence of similar absorption\nfeatures in the red wing of the Ca II 8542 and Halpha lines: rapid red-shifted\nexcursions (RREs). RREs are found over the whole solar disk and are located in\nthe same regions as RBEs: in the vicinity of magnetic field concentrations.\nRREs have similar characteristics as RBEs: they have similar lengths, widths,\nlifetimes, and average Doppler velocity. The striking similarity of RREs to\nRBEs implies that RREs are a manifestation of the same physical phenomenon and\nthat spicules harbour motions that can result in a net red-shift when observed\non-disk. We find that RREs are less abundant than RBEs and we interpret the\nhigher number of RBEs and the decreased imbalance towards the limb as an\nindication that field-aligned up-flows have a significant contribution to the\nnet Dopplershift.

The fact that most\nRBEs and RREs are observed in isolation agrees with the idea that transversal\nswaying motion is another important kinetic mode.

For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU).

Abstract: It has recently been proposed that one sub-class of type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) is sufficiently both distinct and common to be classified separately from\nthe bulk of SNe Ia, with a suggested class name of \"type Iax supernovae\" (SNe\nIax), after SN 2002cx. However, their progenitors are still uncertain. We study\nwhether the population properties of this class might be understood if the\nevents originate from a subset of sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions. In this\npotential progenitor population, a carbon--oxygen white dwarf (CO WD)\naccumulates a helium layer from a non-degenerate helium star; ignition of that\nhelium layer then leads to ignition of the CO WD. We incorporated detailed\nbinary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems into a binary\npopulation synthesis model to obtain rates and delay times for such events. The\npredicted Galactic event rate of these explosions is ~1.5\\times10^{-3}{yr}^{-1}\naccording to our standard model, in good agreement with the measured rates of\nSNe Iax. In addition, predicted delay times are ~70Myr-800Myr, consistent with\nthe fact that most of SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. If\nthe explosions are assumed to be double-detonations -- following current model\nexpectations -- then based on the CO WD masses at explosion we also estimate\nthe distribution of resulting SN brightness (-13 \\gtrsim M_{bol} \\gtrsim\n-19mag), which can reproduce the empirical diversity of SNe Iax. We speculate\non why binaries with non-degenerate donor stars might lead to SNe Iax if\nsimilar systems with degenerate donors do not. We suggest that the high mass of\nthe helium layer necessary for ignition at the lower accretion rates typically\ndelivered from non-degenerate donors might be necessary to produce SN\n2002cx-like characteristics, perhaps even by changing the nature of the CO\nignition. \n\n"}

The scalar degree of freedom is hidden in\nhigh-density environments because the effective mass of the chameleon scalar\ndepends on the trace of the stress-energy tensor. In the early Universe, when\nthe trace of the matter stress-energy tensor is nearly zero, the chameleon is\nvery light, and Hubble friction prevents it from reaching the minimum of its\neffective potential. Whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic,\nhowever, the trace of the stress-energy tensor is temporarily nonzero, and the\nchameleon begins to roll. We show that these \"kicks\" to the chameleon field\nhave catastrophic consequences for chameleon gravity. The velocity imparted to\nthe chameleon by the kick is sufficiently large that the chameleon's mass\nchanges rapidly as it slides past its potential minimum. This nonadiabatic\nevolution shatters the chameleon field by generating extremely high-energy\nperturbations through quantum particle production. If the chameleon's coupling\nto matter is slightly stronger than gravitational, the excited modes have\ntrans-Planckian momenta. The production of modes with momenta exceeding 1e7 GeV\ncan only be avoided for small couplings and finely tuned initial conditions.\nThese quantum effects also significantly alter the background evolution of the\nchameleon field, and we develop new analytic and numerical techniques to treat\nquantum particle production in the regime of strong dissipation. This analysis\ndemonstrates that chameleon gravity cannot be treated as a classical field\ntheory at the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and casts doubt on chameleon\ngravity's viability as an alternative to general relativity. \n\n"}

In this framework, an evolutionary track is determined by\nthree environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass M_c, the mean\nsurface density of the ambient star-forming clump Sigma_cl, and the\nrotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.\nEvolutionary sequences with various M_c, Sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed.

It is found that reconnection\nrates and out-of-plane currents in the $X$-point increase more rapidly and peak\nsooner in the closed boundary case, but higher values are reached in the open\nboundary case. The normalized reconnection rate is fast: 0.10-0.25.

Unfortunately, the accuracy of\nthis method rapidly deteriorates with increasing noise and thus calls for a\nmore robust procedure that combines signal detection and field estimation. We\nintroduce an estimation method that provides not only the effective or mean\nlongitudinal magnetic field from an observed Stokes V profile but also uses the\nnet absolute polarization of the profile to obtain an estimate of the apparent\n(i.e., velocity resolved) absolute longitudinal magnetic field.

The MIT bag model is used to model the equation of state\nof quark matter and the uniformly rotating stellar configurations are computed\nin full general relativity. The vertical epicyclic frequency and the related\nnodal precession rate of inclined orbits are very sensitive to the oblateness\nof the rotating star.

Sixty-eight times of minimum light with\naccuracies better than 10 s were used for the ephemeris computations. The best\nfit to those timings indicated that the orbital period of NY Vir has varied due\nto a combination of two sinusoids with periods of $P_3$=8.2 yr and $P_4$=27.0\nyr and semi-amplitudes of $K_3$=6.9 s and $K_4$=27.3 s, respectively. The\nperiodic variations most likely arise from a pair of light-time effects due to\nthe presence of third and fourth bodies that are gravitationally bound to the\neclipsing pair. We have derived the orbital parameters and the minimum masses,\n$M_3 \\sin i_3$ = 2.8 M$\\rm_{Jup}$ and $M_4 \\sin i_4$ = 4.5 M$\\rm_{Jup}$, of\nboth objects. A dynamical analysis suggests that the outer companion is less\nlikely to orbit the binary on a circular orbit.

WASP-85 b orbits its host star every 2.66 days,\nand has a mass of 1.25 M_Jup and a radius of 1.25 R_Jup. The host star is of G5\nspectral type, with magnitude V = 11.2, and lies 141 pc distant. The system has\na K-dwarf binary companion, WASP-85 B, at a separation of ~1.5\". The close\nproximity of this companion leads to contamination of our photometry,\ndecreasing the apparent transit depth that we account for during our analysis.\nAnalysis of the Ca II H+K lines shows strong emission that implies that both\nbinary components are strongly active. WASP-116 b is a warm, mildly inflated\nsuper-Saturn, with a mass of 0.59 M_Jup and a radius of 1.43 R_Jup. It was\ndiscovered orbiting a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28 dex), cool (T_eff = 5950 K) G0\ndwarf every 6.61 days. WASP-149 b is a typical hot Jupiter, orbiting a G6 dwarf\nwith a period of 1.33 days. The planet has a mass and radius of 1.05 M_Jup and\n1.29 R_Jup, respectively. The stellar host has an effective temperature of\nT_eff = 5750 K and has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.16 dex. WASP photometry of\nthe system is contaminated by a nearby star; we therefore corrected the depth\nof the WASP transits using the measured dilution. WASP-149 lies inside the\n'Neptune desert' identified in the planetary mass-period plane by Mazeh,\nHolczer & Faigler (2016).\n  We model the modulation visible in the K2 lightcurve of WASP-85 using a\nsimple three-spot model consisting of two large spots on WASP-85 A, and one\nlarge spot on WASP-85 B, finding rotation periods of 13.1+/-0.1 days for\nWASP-85 A and 7.5+/-0.03 days for WASP-85 B. We estimate stellar inclinations\nof I_A = 66.8+/-0.7 degrees and I_B = 39.7+/-0.2 degrees, and constrain the\nobliquity of WASP-85 A b to be psi<27 degrees. We therefore conclude that\nWASP-85 A b is very likely to be aligned. \n\n"}

In preliminary\nanalyses of the Herschel DEBRIS and DUNES surveys, Wyatt et al. (2012) and\nMarshall et al. (2014) identified a tentative correlation between debris and\nlow-mass planets. Here we use the cleanest possible sample out these surveys to\nassess the presence of such a correlation, discarding stars without known ages,\nwith ages < 1 Gyr and with binary companions <100 AU, to rule out possible\ncorrelations due to effects other than planet presence. In our sample of 204\nFGK stars, we do not find evidence that debris disks are more common or more\ndusty around stars harboring high-mass or low-mass planets compared to a\ncontrol sample without identified planets, nor that debris disks are more or\nless common (or more or less dusty) around stars harboring multiple planets\ncompared to single-planet systems.

Thus showing that ion currents play a significant role in\nout-of-plane magnetic structure generation in physically realistic scenarios.\nSimulations of different system sizes show that the width of the octupolar\nstructure remains the same and has a spacial extent of the order of the ion\ninertial length. The width of the structure thus appears to be independent on\nboundary condition effects. The length of the octupolar structure however\nincreases for greater domain sizes, prescribed by the external system size.\nThis was found to be a consequence of the structure of the in-plane magnetic\nfield in the outflow region halting the particle flow and thus terminating the\nin-plane currents that generate the out-of-plane field. The generation of\noctupolar magnetic field structure is also established in a tearing-mode\nreconnection scenario. The differences in the generation of the octupolar field\nand resulting qualitative differences between $X$-point collapse and\ntearing-mode are discussed. \n\n"}

Abstract: We report the discovery of a group of apparently young CoRoT red-giant stars\nexhibiting enhanced [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios (as determined from APOGEE\nspectra) with respect to Solar values. Their existence is not explained by\nstandard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and shows that the\nchemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more complex. We find\nsimilar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could be\nrobustly obtained, although in smaller relative numbers, which could explain\nwhy these stars have not received prior attention. The young [alpha/Fe]-rich\nstars are much more numerous in the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample\nthan in any other high-resolution sample available at present, as only CoRoGEE\ncan explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The\nkinematic properties of the young [$\\alpha$/Fe]-rich stars are not clearly\nthick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the Galactic\nmid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguing\nobservations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed close to the end\nof the Galactic bar, near corotation -- a region where gas can be kept inert\nfor longer times, compared to other regions shocked more frequently by the\npassage of spiral arms. Moreover, that is where the mass return from older\ninner-disc stellar generations should be maximal (according to an inside-out\ndisc-formation scenario), further diluting the in-situ gas. Other possibilities\nto explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are also\ndiscussed. \n\n"}

Using our numerical hydrodynamics\nmodel with improved disk thermal balance and star-disk interaction, we computed\nthe evolution of protostellar disks formed from the gravitational collapse of\nprestellar cores. In agreement with our previous studies, we find that cores of\nhigher initial mass and angular momentum produce disks that are more favorable\nto gravitational instability and fragmentation, while a higher background\nirradiation and magnetic fields moderate the disk tendency to fragment. The\nprotostellar accretion in our models is time-variable, thanks to the nonlinear\ninteraction between different spiral modes in the gravitationally unstable\ndisk, and can undergo episodic bursts when fragments migrate onto the star\nowing to the gravitational interaction with other fragments or spiral arms.\nMost bursts occur in the partly embedded Class I phase, with a smaller fraction\ntaking place in the deeply embedded Class 0 phase and a few possible bursts in\nthe optically visible Class II phase. The average burst duration and mean\nluminosity are found to be in good agreement with those inferred from\nobservations of FU-Orionis-type eruptions. The model predicts the existence of\ntwo types of bursts: the isolated ones, showing well-defined luminosity peaks\nseparated with prolonged periods (~ 10^4 yr) of quiescent accretion, and\nclustered ones, demonstrating several bursts occurring one after another during\njust a few hundred years.

The energy release and particle acceleration during\nreconnection have been proposed as a mechanism for producing high-energy\nemissions and cosmic rays. We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic\nsimulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the\nassociated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron\nplasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet\n($\\sigma \\equiv B^2/(4\\pi n_e m_e c^2) \\gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size. Eventually most of the available magnetic free energy is converted\ninto nonthermal particle kinetic energy. An analytic model is presented to\nexplain the key results and predict a general condition for the formation of\npower-law distributions. The development of reconnection in these regimes leads\nto relativistic inflow and outflow speeds and enhanced reconnection rates\nrelative to non-relativistic regimes. In the three-dimensional simulation, the\ninterplay between secondary kink and tearing instabilities leads to strong\nmagnetic turbulence, but does not significantly change the energy conversion,\nreconnection rate, or particle acceleration.

If a star explodes in a binary system, the early supernova light curve\ncan be brightened by the collision of the supernova ejecta with the companion\nstar. The early brightening can be observed when the observer is in the\ndirection of the hole created by the collision. Based on a population synthesis\nmodel, we estimate the fractions of core-collapse supernovae in which the\nlight-curve brightening by the collision can be observed. We find that 0.19% of\ncore-collapse supernova light curves can be observed with the collisional\nbrightening. Type Ibc supernova light curves are more likely to be brightened\nby the collision (0.53%) because of the high fraction of the progenitors being\nin binary systems and their proximity to the companion stars.

We\nprove through averaging that the potential secular eccentricity and inclination\nexcitation due to Yarkovsky drift can exceed that from Poynting-Robertson drag\nand radiation pressure by at least three orders of magnitude, possibly flinging\nasteroids which survive YORP spin-up into a widely dispersed cloud around the\nresulting white dwarf.

For the relatively slower CMEs, we find that\ndrag-based models initiated below heliocentric distances ranging from 15 to 50\n$R_{\\odot}$ cannot account for the observed CME trajectories.

The inside-out tomogram is constructed independently of the\nstandard tomogram by directly projecting phase-resolved spectra onto an\ninside-out velocity coordinate frame. For the inside-out framework, the\nzero-velocity origin is transposed to the outer circumference and the maximum\nvelocities to the origin of the velocity space. We test the technique on a\nsimulated system and two real systems with easily identifiable features, namely\nthe accretion disc and bright spot in WZ Sge, and spiral shocks in IP Peg. Our\ntests show that there is a redistribution of the relative brightness of\nemission components throughout the tomograms, i.e., where the standard\nframework tends to concentrate and enhance lower velocity features towards the\norigin, the inside-out velocity framework tends to concentrate and enhance\nhigher velocity features towards the origin. Conversely, the standard framework\ndisperses and smears the higher velocities farther away from the origin whereas\nthe inside-out framework disperses and smears the lower velocities. In\naddition, the projection of the accretion disc in velocity space now appears\ncorrectly orientated with the inner edge close to the maximum velocity origin\nand its outer edge closer to the zero-velocity outer circumference.\nFurthermore, the gas stream and secondary star are projected on the outside of\nthe disc with the bright spot of the stream-disc impact region on the disc's\nouter edge in the inside-out velocity space. \n\n"}

We show that\nanisotropic alpha particles can drive a parallel fire hose instability\nanalogous to that generated by protons, but that, remarkably, the instability\ncan be triggered also when the parallel plasma beta of alpha particles is below\nunity. The wave activity generated by the alpha anisotropy affects the\nevolution of the more abundant protons, leading to their anisotropic heating.\nWhen both ion species have sufficient parallel anisotropies both of them can\ndrive the instability, and we observe generation of two distinct peaks in the\nspectra of the fluctuations, with longer wavelengths associated to alphas and\nshorter ones to protons. If a non-zero relative drift is present, the unstable\nmodes propagate preferentially in the direction of the drift associated with\nthe unstable species.

The final Hamiltonian is obtained without assuming any\nequations of motions for the background variables.

Abstract: Collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) have recently been invoked as a possible\nmechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

The\nanalysis of the line profiles shows that the H and He broad components form in\nthe same region of the ejecta. By day +142, the Halpha profile dramatically\nchanges: the narrow P-Cygni profile disappears, and the Halpha is fitted by\nthree emission components, that will be detected over the remaining 15 yrs of\nthe SN monitoring campaign. Instead, the He I emissions become progressively\nnarrower and symmetric. A sudden increase in flux of all He I lines is observed\nbetween 300 and 600 days. Models show that the supernova luminosity is\nsustained by the interaction of low mass (~1.15 Msun) ejecta, expelled in a low\nkinetic energy (~ 1.6 x 10^50 erg) explosion, with highly asymmetric\ncircumstellar medium. The detection of Halpha emission in pre-explosion archive\nimages suggests that the progenitor was most likely a massive star (~25 Msun\nZAMS) that had lost a large fraction of its hydrogen envelope before explosion,\nand was hence embedded in a H-rich cocoon. The low-mass ejecta and modest\nkinetic energy of the explosion are explained with massive fallback of material\ninto the compact remnant, a 7-8 Msun black hole. \n\n"}

Abstract: Large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relative\nto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before\nreionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple\narguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in\nlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have\nimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely\nmetal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost\nimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is\ntoo low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars\nmay contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in\nlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)\ncan be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling\nabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard\ncore-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We\nalso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in\nthese species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are\ncorrelated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local\nsilicate grains. Meanwhile [Mg/Ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from pure\nSNe yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,\npreferentially in the [C/Fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. This suggests that (1)\ndust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light\nelement abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust\nwhere they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis. \n\n"}

The\ntwo stars are very similar in spectral type (F8 and F9), and their ~2700 AU\nseparation suggests their protoplanetary disks were likely not influenced by\nstellar interactions, but WASP-94Ab's orbit -- misaligned with the host star\nspin axis and likely retrograde -- points towards a dynamically active\nformation mechanism, perhaps different than that of WASP-94Bb, which is not\nmisaligned and has nearly circular orbit.

For a significant fraction of the free-floating planet (FFP)\nevents and all caustic-crossing planetary/binary events, these 2-D parallax\nmeasurements directly lead to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) of the lens object (or lens system). For even more events, the\ncomplementary ground-based observations will yield 1-D parallax measurements.\nTogether with the 1-D parallaxes from \\emph{WFIRST} alone, they can probe the\nentire mass range $M\\gtrsim M_\\oplus$. For luminous lenses, such 1-D parallax\nmeasurements can be promoted to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) by high-resolution imaging.

The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter.

We find that PMS stars\non Henyey tracks have, on average, lower fractional X-ray luminosities ($L_{\\rm\nX}/L_\\ast$) than those on Hayashi tracks, where this effect is driven by\nchanges in $L_{\\rm X}$.

However, the number of synthetic spectra\nneeded for a rectilinear grid grows exponentially with the label space\ndimensions, precluding the simultaneous and self-consistent fitting of more\nthan a few elemental abundances. Shortcuts such as fitting subsets of labels\nseparately can introduce unknown systematics and do not produce correct error\ncovariances in the derived labels. In this paper we present a new approach --\nCHAT (Convex Hull Adaptive Tessellation) -- which includes several new ideas\nfor inexpensively generating a sufficient stellar synthetic library, using\nlinear algebra and the concept of an adaptive, data-driven grid. A convex hull\napproximates the region where the data lie in the label space. A variety of\ntests with mock datasets demonstrate that CHAT can reduce the number of\nrequired synthetic model calculations by three orders of magnitude in an 8D\nlabel space. The reduction will be even larger for higher-dimensional label\nspaces. In CHAT the computational effort increases only linearly with the\nnumber of labels that are fit simultaneously. Around each of these grid points\nin label space an approximate synthetic spectrum can be generated through\nlinear expansion using a set of \"gradient spectra\" that represent flux\nderivatives at every wavelength point with respect to all labels. These\ntechniques provide new opportunities to fit the full stellar spectra from large\nsurveys with 15-30 labels simultaneously. \n\n"}

The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C279 is\none of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour. Our goal is to study\nthe observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a\ndeterministic origin of the polarization variability. We have combined multiple\ndata sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C279,\nyielding exceptionally well-sampled flux density and polarization curves that\ncover a period of 2008-2012. Several large EVPA rotations are identified in the\ndata. We introduce a quantitative measure for the EVPA curve smoothness, which\nis then used to test a set of simple random walk polarization variability\nmodels against the data. 3C279 shows different polarization variation\ncharacteristics during an optical low-flux state and a flaring state. The\npolarization variation during the flaring state, especially the smooth approx.\n360 degrees rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with the tested\nstochastic processes.

The radiative case shows\na much stronger swelling of the protostar for high accretion rates than the\nconvective case.

The\nevolution for convective structures is much less influenced by the\ninstantaneous accretion rate, and produces a monotonically increasing ionizing\nflux that can be many orders of magnitude smaller than in the radiative case.\nFor massive stars, it results in a delay of the HII region expansion by up to\n10,000 yr.

Besides BBHs, the most promising GW sources are the\ncoalescences of binary systems formed by two neutron stars or a neutron star\nand a black hole. These mergers are thought to be connected with short Gamma\nRay Bursts (GRBs), therefore combined observations of GW and electromagnetic\n(EM) signals could definitively probe this association. We present a detailed\nstudy on the expectations for joint GW and high-energy EM observations of\ncoalescences of binary systems of neutron stars with Advanced Virgo and LIGO\nand with the \\emph{Fermi} gamma-ray telescope. To this scope, we designed a\ndedicated Montecarlo simulation pipeline for the multimessenger emission and\ndetection by GW and gamma-ray instruments, considering the evolution of the GW\ndetector sensitivities.

Here we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the\nlargest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II\ntelescope.

The mass-to-light ratio is M/L=48 M_sun/L_sun, and the dark\nmatter fraction is 98 percent within the half-light radius. The high mass of\nDragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population.

For neutrino-driven\nexplosions the NS acceleration was shown to be mainly caused by the\ngravitational attraction of the anisotropically expelled inner ejecta, while\nhydrodynamic forces contribute on a subdominant level, and asymmetric neutrino\nemission plays only a secondary role. Two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations demonstrated that this gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain\nthe observed space velocities of young NSs up to more than 1000 km/s. Here, we\ndiscuss how the NS kick depends on the energy, ejecta mass, and asymmetry of\nthe SN explosion, and which role the compactness of the pre-collapse stellar\ncore plays for the momentum transfer to the NS. We also provide simple analytic\nexpressions for the NS velocity in terms of these quantities.

Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses.

Increasing the sample of FRBs with robust host galaxy associations\nis the key impetus behind on-going and upcoming searches and facilities. Here,\nwe quantify the robustness of FRB-host galaxy associations as a function of\nlocalization area and galaxy apparent magnitude. We also explore the use of FRB\ndispersion measures to constrain the source redshift, thereby reducing the\nnumber of candidate hosts. We further use these results to demonstrate that\neven in the absence of a robust unique association, a constraint can be placed\non the maximum luminosity of a host galaxy as a function of localization area\nand DM. We examine these results in the context of existing and future FRB\nfacilities. We find that localizations of $\\lesssim 0.5''$ are required for a\nchance coincidence probability of $\\lesssim 1\\%$ for dwarf galaxies at\n$z\\gtrsim 0.1$; if some hosts have luminosities of $\\sim L^*$, then\nlocalizations of up to $\\approx 3''$ may suffice at $z\\sim 0.1$ (but $\\lesssim\n1''$ at $z\\approx 1$).

Second, 12 chemical species were\ntreated in non-LTE. Pronounced non-LTE effects occur in individual spectral\nlines but, for the majority, the effects are moderate to small.

Starspot activity produces quasi-sinusoidal light curves whose phase and\namplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We\nused a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of\nthe light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of\nstarspots and their inferred size.

One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU\nOri-type stars (FUors) are thought to be the visible examples for objects in\nthe high accretion state. FUors are often surrounded by massive envelopes,\nwhich replenish the disk material and enable the disk to produce accretion\noutbursts. However, we have insufficient information on the envelope dynamics\nin FUors, about where and how mass transfer from the envelope to the disk\nhappens. Here we present ALMA observations of the FUor-type star V346 Nor at\n1.3 mm continuum and in different CO rotational lines. We mapped the density\nand velocity structure of its envelope and analyze the results using channel\nmaps, position-velocity diagrams, and spectro-astrometric methods. We found\nthat V346 Nor is surrounded by gaseous material on 10000 au scale in which a\nprominent outflow cavity is carved. Within the central $\\sim$700 au, the\ncircumstellar matter forms a flattened pseudo-disk where material is infalling\nwith conserved angular momentum.

The Novalikes MV Lyrae, BZ\n  Camelopardalis, and V592 Cassiopeiae Abstract: The standard disk is often inadequate to model disk-dominated cataclysmic\nvariables (CVs) and generates a spectrum that is bluer than the observed UV\nspectra [Puebla et al 2007]. X-ray observations of these systems reveal an\noptically thin boundary layer (BL) expected to appear as an inner hole in the\ndisk. Consequently, we truncate the inner disk. However, instead of removing\nthe inner disk, we impose the no-shear boundary condition at the truncation\nradius, thereby lowering the disk temperature and generating a spectrum that\nbetter fits the UV data. With our modified disk, we analyze the archival UV\nspectra of three novalikes that cannot be fitted with standard disks. For the\nVY Scl systems MV Lyr and BZ Cam, we fit a hot inflated white dwarf WD with a\ncold modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim $ a few $10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr). For V592 Cas,\nthe slightly modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr)\ncompletely dominates the UV. These results are consistent with Swift X-ray\nobservations of these systems [Balman et al 2014], revealing BLs merged with\nADAF-like flows and/or hot coronae, where the advection of energy is likely\nlaunching an outflow and heating the WD, thereby explaining the high WD\ntemperature in VY Scl systems. This is further supported by the fact that the\nX-ray hardness ratio increases with the shallowness of the UV slope in a small\nCV sample we examine. Furthermore, for 105 disk-dominated systems, the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra UV slope decreases in the same\norder as the ratio of the X-ray flux to optical/UV flux: from SU UMa's, to U\nGem's, Z Cam's, UX UMa's, and VY Scl's. \n\n"}

These flares were\nstudied by Kuznetsov et al. (2016) (Paper~I), and chosen here because of the\navailability of the vector magnetograms for their parent active regions (ARs)\nobtained with the SDO/HMI data. In Paper~I, based on the observations only, it\nwas suggested that a magnetic flux rope (MFR) might play an important role in\nthe process of generation of the HXR pulsations. The goal of the present paper\nis to test this hypothesis by using the extrapolation of magnetic field with\nthe non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) method. Having done this, we found that\nbefore each flare indeed there was an MFR elongated along and above a magnetic\npolarity inversion line (MPIL) on the photosphere. In two flare regions the\nsources of the HXR pulsations were located at the footpoints of different\nmagnetic field lines wrapping around the central axis, and constituting an MFR\nby themselves. In five other flares the parent field lines of the HXR\npulsations were not a part of an MFR, but surrounded it in the form of an\narcade of magnetic loops. These results show that, at least in the analyzed\ncases, the \"single flare loop\" models do not satisfy the observations and\nmagnetic field modeling, while are consistent with the concept that the HXR\npulsations are a consequence of successive episodes of energy release and\nelectron acceleration in different magnetic flux tubes (loops) of a complex AR.\nAn MFR could generate HXR pulsations by triggering episodes of magnetic\nreconnection in different loops in the course of its non-uniform evolution\nalong an MPIL.

The\nspectral character of these variations yields insight into the particle sizes\nand vertical structure of the clouds. Here we present the results of a high\nprecision, ground-based, near-infrared, spectral monitoring study of two\nmid-type L dwarfs that have variability reported in the literature, 2MASS\nJ08354256-0819237 and 2MASS J18212815+1414010, using the SpeX instrument on the\nInfrared Telescope Facility. By simultaneously observing a nearby reference\nstar, we achieve <0.15% per-band sensitivity in relative brightness changes\nacross the 0.9--2.4um bandwidth. We find that 2MASS J0835-0819 exhibits\nmarginal (< ~0.5% per band) variability with no clear spectral dependence,\nwhile 2MASS J1821+1414 varies by up to +/-1.5% at 0.9 um, with the variability\namplitude declining toward longer wavelengths. The latter result extends the\nvariability trend observed in prior HST/WFC3 spectral monitoring of 2MASS\nJ1821+1414, and we show that the full 0.9-2.4 um variability amplitude spectrum\ncan be reproduced by Mie extinction from dust particles with a log-normal\nparticle size distribution with a median radius of 0.24 um. We do not detect\nstatistically significant phase variations with wavelength. The different\nvariability behavior of 2MASS J0835-0819 and 2MASS J1821+1414 suggests\ndependencies on viewing angle and/or overall cloud content, underlying factors\nthat can be examined through a broader survey. \n\n"}

Motivated by the\ntransition region in the solar atmosphere the temperature and density ratio of\nthe plasmas is chosen as 100 and 0.01, respectively. For better understanding\nof studied processes we make two types of computations: a) without any\ninteractions among plasma particles (free expansion) and b) with the full\nelectromagnetic interactions. In both the cases we found that the flux of cold\nplasma electrons and protons from colder plasma to hotter one dominates over\nthe flux of hot plasma electrons and protons in the opposite direction. Thus,\nthe plasma in the hotter part of the system becomes colder and denser during\ntime evolution. In the case without any interactions among particles the cold\nplasma electrons and protons freely penetrate into the hot plasma. But, the\ncold plasma electrons are faster than cold plasma protons and therefore they\npenetrate deeper into the hotter part of the system than the protons. Thus, the\ncooling of the electron and proton components of the plasma in the hotter part\nof the system is different. On the other hand, in the case with the\nelectromagnetic interactions, owing to the plasma property, which tries to keep\nthe total electric current constant everywhere (close to zero in our case), the\ncold plasma electrons penetrate into the hotter part of the system together\nwith the cold plasma protons. The plasma waves generated at the transition\nregion during these processes reduce the number of electrons escaping from the\nhot plasma into the colder one. Therefore these waves support a temperature\njump between hot and cold plasma. \n\n"}

For this\npurpose, a novel iterative method for deriving a self-consistent steady-state\nstructure of RRMS is developed, based on a Monte-Carlo code that solves the\ntransfer of photons subject to Compton scattering and pair\nproduction/annihilation. Systematic study is performed by imposing various\nupstream conditions which are characterized by the following three parameters:\nthe photon-to-baryon inertia ratio $\\xi_{u *}$, the photon-to-baryon number\nratio $\\tilde{n}$, and the shock Lorentz factor $\\gamma_u$. We find that the\nproperties of RRMSs vary considerably with these parameters. In particular,\nwhile a smooth decline in the velocity, accompanied by a gradual temperature\nincrease is seen for $\\xi_{u*} \\gg 1$, an efficient bulk Comptonization, that\nleads to a heating precursor, is found for $\\xi_{u*} \\lesssim 1$.

Rotation critically influences\nthe mass of the exploding cores, the mass and chemical composition of the\nenvelopes and the types of supernovae, as well as the properties of the\nremnants and the chemical yields. In the formation of gamma-ray bursts,\nrotation and the properties of rotating stars appear as the key factor. In\nbinaries, the interaction between axial rotation and tidal effects often leads\nto interesting and unexpected results. Rotation plays a key role in shaping the\nevolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars with very low metallicities\n(metallicity below about the Small Magellanic Cloud metallicity down to\nPopulation III stars). At solar and higher metallicities, the effects of\nrotation compete with those of stellar winds. In close binaries, the\nsynchronisation process can lock the star at a high rotation rate despite\nstrong mass loss and thus both effects, rotation and stellar winds, have a\nstrong impact.

By studying the arrival times of the p-mode maxima and\nminima through the O-C method, in a previous article the presence of a planet\nwas inferred with an orbital period of 3.2 yr and a minimum mass of 3.2 M_Jup.\nHere we present an updated O-C analysis using a larger data set of 1066 hours\nof photometric time series (~2.5x larger in terms of the number of data\npoints), which covers the period between 1999 and 2012 (compared with 1999-2006\nof the previous analysis). Up to the end of 2008, the new O-C diagram of the\nmain pulsation frequency (f1) is compatible with (and improves) the previous\ntwo-component solution representing the long-term variation of the pulsation\nperiod (parabolic component) and the giant planet (sine wave component). Since\n2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation\nperiod (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of\nregime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between\ndifferent pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the\nO-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1\nand f2 differ or at least agree less well than before. The nice agreement found\npreviously was a coincidence due to various small effects that are carefully\nanalysed. Now, with a larger dataset, the presence of a planet is more\nuncertain and would require confirmation with an independent method.

Stellar-mass primordial black holes\n(PBHs) are subject to less robust constraints than other mass ranges and might\nbe connected to gravitational-wave signals detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). New methods are therefore necessary to\nconstrain the viability of compact objects as a DM candidate.

Current SNe datasets constrain compact objects to\nrepresent less than 35.2% (Joint Lightcurve Analisis) and 37.2% (Union 2.1) of\nthe total matter content in the universe, at 95% confidence-level. The results\nare valid for masses larger than $\\sim 0.01M_\\odot$ (solar-masses), limited by\nthe size SNe relative to the lens Einstein radius.

If the PBHs all have a\nsimilar mass and make a small contribution to the dark matter, then the seed\neffect dominates on small scales, in which case PBHs could seed the\nsupermassive black holes in galactic nuclei or even galaxies themselves.

Abstract: In the Hall magnetohydrodynamics, the onset condition of the Kelvin Helmholtz\ninstability is solely determined by the Hall effect and is independent of the\nnature of shear flows. In addition, the physical mechanism behind the super and\nsub Alfvenic flows becoming unstable is quite different: the high frequency\nright circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic\nflows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave\nbecomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate\nof the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than\nthe corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the\nHall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)\nchannel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become\nKelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller\nthan the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of\nthe flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the\ninduction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a\nnew overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin\nHelmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the\nadvection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven\nMach number and is independent of the Hall diffusion coefficient. Further, the\ngrowth rate in this case linearly increase with the Alfven frequency with\nsmaller slope for sub Alfvenic flows. \n\n"}

First are modes associated with attractors\nof characteristics that are made of thin shear layers closely following the\nperiodic orbit traced by the characteristic attractor. Second are modes made of\nshear layers that connect the critical latitude singularities of the two\nhemispheres of the inner boundary of the spherical shell.

The\nresulting separation distribution in the ONC drops sharply outside 60\\,au.\nThese findings are consistent with a scenario in which the initial multiplicity\nproperties, set by the star formation process itself, are identical in the ONC\nand in other SFRs and subsequently altered by the cluster's dynamical\nevolution.

These results, however, raise anew the\nquestion of the origin of field stars as the tight binaries we have discovered\nwill not be destroyed as the ONC dissolves into the galactic field. It thus\nappears that most field stars formed in regions differ from well-studied SFRs\nin the Solar neighborhood, possibly due to changes in core fragmentation on Gyr\ntimescales. \n\n"}

Recent observations have suggested that\nneutron stars and perhaps even black holes receive large velocity kicks at\nbirth. Such natal kicks and the sudden mass loss can significantly alter the\norbital configuration of the system. Here we derive general analytical\nexpressions that describe the effects of natal kicks in binaries on\nhierarchical triple systems. We explore several proof-of-concept applications\nsuch as black hole and neutron stars binaries and X-ray binaries with either\nstellar or Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) companions on a wide orbit. Kicks can\ndisrupt the hierarchical configuration, although it is harder to escape the\npotential well of an SMBH. Some binary systems do escape the SMBH system\nresulting in hyper-velocity binary system. Furthermore, kicks can result in\nincreasing or decreasing the orbital separations. Decreasing the orbital\nseparation may have significant consequences in these astrophysical systems.\nFor example, shrinking the separation post-supernova kick can lead to the\nshrinking of an inner compact binary that then may merge via Gravitational Wave\n(GW) emission. This process yields a supernova that is shortly followed by a\npossible GW-LIGO event. Interestingly, we find that the natal kick can result\nin shrinking the outer orbit, and the binary may cross the tertiary Roche\nlimit, breaking up the inner binary.

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data.

This is the first evidence of multiple stellar\npopulations in a Galactic open cluster. By using high-resolution VLT spectra we\nprovide direct evidence that the multiple sequences along the CMD correspond to\nstellar populations with different rotation rates. Specifically, the blue MS is\nformed of slow-rotating stars, while red-MS stars are fast rotators. Moreover,\nwe exploit photometry from Gaia DR2 to show that three Galactic open clusters,\nnamely NGC2099, NGC2360, and NGC2818, exhibit the eMSTO, thus suggesting that\nit is a common feature among these objects. Our previous work on the Large\nMagellanic Cloud star cluster NGC1818 shows that slowly and fastly-rotating\nstars populate the blue and red MS observed in its CMD.

These exospheres are formed by surface\nparticles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar\nwind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are\ndriven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained\nby Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most\nwell constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii. For planet b, the column density of OI\nalong the line of sight reaches 10^{13}/cm2, with the highest values found\nahead of its orbital motion.

Models typically include energy injection from\nsupernovae as the dominant form of stellar feedback, often in some form of\nsub-grid recipe. However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback\n(stellar winds or radiation) is necessary in high-resolution simulations of\ngalaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Following these processes is computationally\nchallenging, so many prescriptions model this feedback approximately,\naccounting for the local destruction of dense gas clouds around newly formed\nstars in lieu of a full radiative transfer calculation. In this work we examine\nhigh resolution simulations (1.8~pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed\nstellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis. By following stellar ionizing\nradiation with an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, we test its\nimportance in regulating star formation and driving outflows in this galaxy. We\nfind that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate (SFR) by\nover a factor of 5, and is necessary to produce the ISM conditions needed for\nsupernovae to drive significant outflows. We find that a localized\napproximation for radiation feedback is sufficient to regulate the SFR on short\ntimescales, but does not allow significant outflows. Short and long range\nradiation effects are both important in driving the evolution of our\nlow-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy.

These speeds are two\norders of magnitude faster than the escape speed from a warm supergiant, and\n5-10 times faster than winds from O-type or Wolf-Rayet stars.

Abstract: Two fundamental properties of stellar magnetic fields have been determined by\nobservations for solar-like stars with different Rossby numbers (Ro), namely,\nthe magnetic field strength and the magnetic cycle period. The field strength\nexhibits two regimes: 1) for fast rotation it is independent of Ro, 2) for slow\nrotation it decays with Ro following a power law. For the magnetic cycle period\ntwo regimes of activity, the active and inactive branches, also have been\nidentified. For both of them, the longer the rotation period, the longer the\nactivity cycle. Using global dynamo simulations of solar like stars with Rossby\nnumbers between ~0.4 and ~2, this paper explores the relevance of rotational\nshear layers in determining these observational properties. Our results,\nconsistent with non-linear alpha^2-Omega dynamos, show that the total magnetic\nfield strength is independent of the rotation period. Yet at surface levels,\nthe origin of the magnetic field is determined by Ro. While for Ro<1 it is\ngenerated in the convection zone, for Ro>1 strong toroidal fields are generated\nat the tachocline and rapidly emerge towards the surface. In agreement with the\nobservations, the magnetic cycle period increases with the rotational period.\nHowever, a bifurcation is observed for Ro~1, separating a regime where\noscillatory dynamos operate mainly in the convection zone, from the regime\nwhere the tachocline has a predominant role. In the latter the cycles are\nbelieved to result from the periodic energy exchange between the dynamo and the\nmagneto-shear instabilities developing in the tachocline and the radiative\ninterior. \n\n"}

A BdHN II originates in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen core\n(CO$_{\\rm core}$) undergoing SN, and the SN ejecta hypercritically accrete onto\na companion neutron star (NS). From the time of the SN shock breakout to the\ntime when the hypercritical accretion starts, we infer the binary separation\n$\\simeq 3 \\times 10^{10}$ cm.

It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the\nstellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. We aim to\ncharacterize the presence of physical companions in orbit around nearby stars.\nOrbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion (PM) of their parent star\nthrough their gravitational reflex motion. Using the Hipparcos catalog and\nGaia's second data release (GDR2), we determined the long-term PM of the stars\ncommon to these two catalogs. We then searched for a PM anomaly (PMa) between\nthe long-term PM vector and the GDR2 (or Hipparcos) measurements, indicative of\nthe presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the\n6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the\nPMa for >99% of the Hipparcos catalog (>117000 stars). 30% of the stars studied\npresent a PMa greater than 3 sigmas.

This is likely valid\nfor the quiescent Sun, but this assumption has also been applied to the more\nextreme flaring scenario. We used 36 electron beam driven radiation\nhydrodynamic solar flare simulations, computed using the RADYN code, to probe\nthe validity of this assumption. Using these simulated atmospheres we solved\nthe radiation transfer equations to obtain the non-LTE, non-equilibrium\npopulations, line profiles, and opacities for a model Silicon atom, including\ncharge exchange processes. This was achieved using the `minority species'\nversion of RADYN. The inclusion of charge exchange resulted in a substantial\nfraction of Si IV at cooler temperatures than those predicted by ionisation\nequilibrium. All simulations with an injected energy flux $F>5\\times10^{10}$\nerg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ resulted in optical depth effects on the Si IV emission,\nwith differences in both intensity and line shape compared to the optically\nthin calculation.

Changes in\nspectral line profiles are inverted to a stellar surface temperature map using\nour $i$Map code.

The temperature difference to the photosphere of the spots\nis between 990 and 280K. Two spots are reconstructed with a typical solar\nmorphology with an umbra and a penumbra. For the one isolated and relatively\nround spot (A), we determine an umbral temperature of 990K and a penumbral\ntemperature of 180K below photospheric temperature. The umbra to photosphere\nintensity ratio of EK Dra is approximately only half of that of a comparison\nsunspot. A test inversion from degraded line profiles showed that the higher\nspectral resolution of PEPSI reconstructs the surface with a temperature\ndifference that is on average 10% higher than before and with smaller surface\nareas by 10-20%. PEPSI is therefore better suited to detecting and\ncharacterising temperature inhomogeneities.

Time resolved\n(10-20 s) photometry with the SAAO 1.9-m, and 1.0-m telescopes, utilizing the\nSHOC EM-CCD cameras, revealed that the source eclipses, with a period of 2.08\nhours (7482.9$\\pm$3.5$\\,$s). The eclipse light curve has a peculiar morphology,\ncomprising an initial dip, where the source brightness drops to ${\\sim}$50% of\nthe pre-eclipse level before gradually increasing again in brightness. A second\nrapid ingress follows, where the brightness drops by ${\\sim}$60-80%, followed\nby a more gradual decrease to zero flux. We interpret the eclipse profile as\nthe result of an initial obscuration of the accretion hot-spot on the magnetic\nwhite dwarf by the accretion stream, followed by an eclipse of both the\nhot-spot and the partially illuminated stream by the red dwarf donor star. This\nis similar to what has been observed in other eclipsing polars such as HU Aqr,\nbut here the stream absorption is more pronounced. The object was subsequently\nobserved with South African Large Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie\nSpectrograph (RSS). This revealed a spectrum with all of the Balmer lines in\nemission, a strong HeII 4686\\AA{} line with a peak flux greater than that of\nH$\\beta$, as well as weaker HeI lines. The spectral features, along with the\nstructure of the light curve, suggest that MASTER OT J061451.70-272535.5 is a\nnew magnetic cataclysmic variable, most likely of the synchronised Polar\nsubclass. \n\n"}

In this paper, we introduce another channel to detect faint\nclose-in binary companions by using microlensing. This method utilizes a\ncaustic-crossing binary lens event with a source also composed of binary stars,\nwhere the companion is a faint star. Detection of the companion is possible\nbecause the flux of the companion can be highly amplified when it crosses the\nlens caustic. The detection is facilitated since the companion is more\namplified than the primary because it, in general, has a smaller size than the\nprimary, and thus experiences less finite source effect.

Abstract: We report a detection of galaxy-QSO cross-correlation w_GQ in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) Early Data Release (EDR) over 0.2-30 arc-minute\nscales. We cross-correlate galaxy samples of different mean depths r'=19-22\n(z_G =0.15-0.35) with the main QSO population (i'<19.1) at mean z_Q=1.6. We\nfind significant positive correlation in all cases except for the faintest\nQSOs, as expected if the signal were due to weak lensing magnification. The\namplitude of the signal on arc-minute scales is about 20%. This is a few times\nlarger than currently expected from weak lensing in LCDM but confirms, at a\nhigher significance, previous measurements by several groups. When compared to\nthe galaxy-galaxy correlation w_GG, a weak lensing interpretation indicates a\nstrong and steep non-linear amplitude for the underlaying matter fluctuations:\nsigma=400 on scales of 0.2 Mpc/h, in contradiction with non-linear modeling of\nLCDM fluctuations.

Indeed this model\ndoes fit an impressive set of independent data: CMB $C_l$ curve, most current\nmatter density estimations, Hubble constant estimation from HST, apparent\nacceleration of the Universe, good matching of the power spectrum of matter\nfluctuations. However, the necessary introduction of a non zero cosmological\nconstant is an extraordinary new mystery for physics, or more exactly the come\nback of one of the ghost of modern physics since its introduction by Einstein.\nHere, I would like to emphasize that some results are established beyond\nreasonable doubt, like the (nearly) flatness of the universe and the existence\nof a dark non-baryonic component of the Universe. But also that the evidence\nfor a cosmological constant may not be as strong as needed to be considered as\nestablished beyond doubt. In this respect, I will argue that an Einstein-De\nSitter universe might still be a viable option. Three global tests: 1) the\nevolution of the abundance of clusters with redshift 2) the baryon fraction\nmeasured in local clusters 3) apparent evolution of the baryon fraction with\nredshift might be consistent with a high matter density for the Universe in the\nrange $0.6-1.$.

Moreover, it is shown by fully\ncosmological, hydro/gravity simulations that the formation of galactic discs is\nonly weakly affected by going from smooth to highly non-homogenous, initial\nbaryon distributions. In particular, the final disc angular momenta at z=0 are\nas large as for the standard case and the ``disc angular momentum problem'' is\nsolved to within a factor of two or better without invoking (hypothetical)\nenergetic feedback events. A very desirable difference relative to the the\nstandard WDM model, however, is that the on-set of star (and AGN) formation\nhappens earlier.

We consider such Cold+Hot\nDark Matter (CHDM) models with one, two or three massive neutrinos, with total\nmass ~4.6eV. Neutrinos of such low mass cannot constitute halos of galaxies and\ngroups, but only of clusters of galaxies. The limit on the density of neutrinos\nin the central parts of galaxy clusters is estimated from the phase space den-\nsity constraints. The ratio of the neutrino density to that of CDM through the\ncluster is found analytically. It appears that the density of neutrinos is\nsuppressed within the Abell radius. However, neutrinos contribute ~20% of the\nmass density to the cluster halo.\n  Our numerical simulations match analytical results. The simulations indicate\nthat the cluster halo dark matter density profile has the power-law slope ~-2.5\nwhich is close to that in the model with cosmological constant.

Our two-fluid model for superfluid neutron star matter\nallows for dissipation via mutual friction and also ``transfusion'' via\nbeta-reactions between the neutron fluid and the proton-electron fluid. \n\n"}
