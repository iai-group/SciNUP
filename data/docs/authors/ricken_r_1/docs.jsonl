Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature.

The algebraic approach thus shifts\nthe paradigm of \"quantization\" of a classical theory to \"classicization\" of a\nquantum theory.

Repulsion is possible if the medium\nbetween the bodies has a permittivity in value intermediate to those of the two\nbodies, but this may not be a useful configuration. Here, inspired by recent\nnumerical work, we initiate analytic calculations of the Casimir-Polder\ninteraction between an atom with anisotropic polarizability and a plate with an\naperture. In particular, for a semi-infinite plate, and, more generally, for a\nwedge, the problem is exactly solvable, and for sufficiently large anisotropy,\nCasimir-Polder repulsion is indeed possible, in agreement with the previous\nnumerical studies. In order to achieve repulsion, what is needed is a\nsufficiently sharp edge (not so very sharp, in fact) so that the directions of\npolarizability of the conductor and the atom are roughly normal to each other.\nThe machinery for carrying out the calculation with a finite aperture is\npresented.

The review discusses similar physics that emerges in\nopen and marginally stable quantum many-body systems. In the presence of open\ndecay channels, the intrinsic states are coupled through the continuum.

Our approach applies\nto an arbitrary number of atoms N and includes the spatial variation of the\nfield throughout the ensemble. We report several new interesting aspects of\ncoherence and entangled behavior that emerge when the size of the atomic\nensemble is not taken to the thermodynamic limit of N>>1. Under such\nconditions, it is found that the counter-propagating cavity modes, although in\nthe thermodynamic limit are mutually incoherent and exhibit no one-photon\ninterference, the modes can, however, be made mutually coherent and exhibit\ninterference after interacting with a finite-size atomic ensemble. It is also\nfound that the spatial redistribution of the atoms over a finite size results\nin nonorthogonality of the collective bosonic modes. This nonorthogonality\nleads to the super-bunching effect that the correlations of photons of the\nindividual cavity modes and of different modes are stronger than those of a\nthermal field.

There has been a resurgence of interest in using this method\nwith 163-Ho. Recent theoretical analyses offer reassurance that there are no\nsignificant theoretical uncertainties. We show that the situation is, however,\nmore complicated, and that the spectrum shape is presently not well enough\nunderstood to permit a sensitive determination of the neutrino mass in this\nway. The theoretical analyses consider only single vacancy states in the\ndaughter 163-Dy atom. It is necessary to consider configurations with more than\none vacancy that can be populated owing to the change in nuclear charge. The\nshakeup and shakeoff theory of Carlson and Nestor is used as a basis for\nestimating the population of double-vacancy states. A spectrum of satellites\nassociated with each primary vacancy created by electron capture is presented.\nThe theory of the calorimetric spectrum is more complicated than has been\ndescribed heretofore. There are numerous shakeup and shakeoff satellites\npresent across the spectrum, and some may be very near the endpoint. \n\n"}

Since it is\nimpossible to prove if an existing random bit string is truly random, it is\nrelevant that they be generated in a trust worthy process. This requires\nspecialized hardware for random numbers, for example a die or a tossed coin.\nBut when all input parameters are known, their outcome might still be\npredicted. A quantum mechanical superposition allows for provably true random\nbit generation. In the past decade many quantum random number generators\n(QRNGs) were realized. A photonic implementation is described as a photon which\nimpinges on a beam splitter, but such a protocol is rarely realized with\nnon-classical light or anti-bunched single photons. Instead, laser sources or\nlight emitting diodes are used. Here we analyze the difference in generating a\ntrue random bit string with a laser and with anti-bunched light.

In events with high multiplicity, however, the\nstandard approach to tag boosted resonances by a large-radius fat jet becomes\ndifficult because the resonances are not well-separated from other hard\nradiation. In this paper, we propose a different approach to tag and\nreconstruct boosted resonances by using the recently proposed mass-jump jet\nalgorithm. A key feature of the algorithm is the flexible radius of the jets,\nwhich results from a terminating veto that prevents the recombination of two\nhard prongs if their combined jet mass is substantially larger than the masses\nof the separate prongs. The idea of collecting jets in \"buckets\" is also used.\nAs an example, we consider the fully hadronic final state of pair-produced\nvectorlike top partners at the LHC, $pp\\to T\\bar{T}\\to t\\bar{t}HH$, and show\nthat the new approach works better than the corresponding generalized $k_T$ jet\nclustering algorithm.

The swiveled Renyi entropies are however generally discontinuous\nat $\\alpha=1$ and do not converge to the von Neumann entropy-based measures in\nthe limit as $\\alpha\\rightarrow1$, instead bounding them from above and below.\nParticular variants reduce to known Renyi entropies, such as the Renyi relative\nentropy or the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, but also lead to ordered\nRenyi conditional mutual informations and ordered Renyi generalizations of a\nrelative entropy difference.

The transition is accompanied by the onset of short-range correlations,\nsuppression of the superfluid response, and rotonization of the excitation\nspectrum. A dispersion law and a dynamic structure factor for the {\\em\nin-phase} (symmetric) and {\\em out-of-phase} (antisymmetric) collective modes,\nduring the dimerization, is studied in detail with the stochastic\nreconstruction method and the method of moments.

Decades later, it became possible to do experiments with\nindividual quantum particles and quantum systems.

Hitherto,\nnearly all experiments and also nearly all realizations in the fields have been\nperformed with qubits, which are two-level quantum systems.

Comparisons of calculated vibrational frequencies to\nexact quantum ones for a set of molecules including benzene show that the new\nimplementation performs better than the original one and that, on average, the\nloss in accuracy with respect to full-dimensional semiclassical calculations is\nreduced to only 10 wavenumbers.

As a consequence,\nmultiple proton-proton collisions occur whenever two bunches cross. Interesting\nhigh-energy (hard) collisions are therefore contaminated by several soft,\nzero-bias, ones. This effect known as pileup pollutes the final state of the\ncollision. It complicates the reconstruction of the objects in this final\nstate, resulting in increased experimental uncertainties. To reduce these\nuncertainties, and improve the quality and precision of LHC measurements,\ntechniques are devised to correct for the effects of pileup. This document\nprovides a theoretical review of the main methods used during Run I and II of\nthe LHC to mitigate pileup effects. I start with an in-depth presentation of\nthe area--median used for the majority of applications, including several\nrefinements of the original idea, their practical implementation and an\nassessment of their efficiency and robustness. I then focus on several\ntheoretical calculations that can provide both quantitative and qualitative\ninformation on the area--median approach.

We investigate and detail the\nstructure of the CWI's, their non-perturbative solutions and the transition to\nmomentum space, comparing them to perturbation theory by taking QED as an\nexample.

A careful comparison with a second\nbasis introduced in previous studies shows that this correlator is affected by\none anomaly pole in the graviton (T) line, induced by renormalization. The\nresult shows that the origin of the anomaly, in this correlator, should be\nnecessarily attributed to the exchange of a massless effective degree of\nfreedom.

Alongside with two baryon-rich fluids, the new model considers\ntime-delayed evolution of a third, baryon-free (i.e. with zero net baryonic\ncharge) fluid of newly produced particles. Its evolution is delayed due to a\nformation time, during which the baryon-free fluid neither thermalizes nor\ninteracts with the baryon-rich fluids. After the formation it starts to\ninteract with the baryon-rich fluids and quickly gets thermalized. Within this\nmodel with pure hadronic equation of state, a systematic analysis of various\nobservables at incident energies between few and about 160A GeV has been done\nas well as comparison with results of transport models. We have succeeded to\nreasonably reproduce a great body of experimental data in the incident energy\nrange of E_{lab} = (1-160)A GeV.

In\nboth cases the correspondence for observable quantities is shown to break down\non a time-scale that increases very slowly (logarithmically) with increasing\nsystem size. In the case of quantum-Liouville correspondence such a short\ntime-scale does not imply a breakdown of correspondence since the largest\nquantum-Liouville differences reached on this time-scale decrease rapidly (as\nan inverse power) with increasing system size.

It is clear that not only the assumption of distinguishability, but\nalso the few-subsystem scenario, are too narrow to embrace all possible\nphysical settings. In particular, the need to go beyond the traditional\nsubsystem-based framework becomes manifest when one tries to apply the\nconventional concept of entanglement to the physics of matter, since the\nconstituents of a quantum many-body system are indistinguishable particles. We\nshall discuss here a notion of generalized entanglement, which can be applied\nto any operator language (fermions, bosons, spins, etc.) used to describe a\nphysical system and which includes the conventional entanglement settings\nintroduced to date in a unified fashion.

Universality of the cloning procedure is achieved by choosing systems\nthat have appropriate symmetries. We first discuss a scheme based on stimulated\nemission in certain three-level-systems, e.g. atoms in a cavity. Then we\npresent a way of realizing optimal universal cloning based on stimulated\nparametric down-conversion. This scheme also implements the optimal universal\nNOT operation. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/9911057", "contents": "Title: Bell Inequalities and the Separability Criterion Abstract: We analyze and compare the mathematical formulations of the criterion for\nseparability for bipartite density matrices and the Bell inequalities. We show\nthat a violation of a Bell inequality can formally be expressed as a witness\nfor entanglement. We also show how the criterion for separability and a\ndescription of the state by a local hidden variable theory, become equivalent\nwhen we restrict the set of local hidden variable theories to the domain of\nquantum mechanics. This analysis sheds light on the essential difference\nbetween the two criteria and may help us in understanding whether there exist\nentangled states for which the statistics of the outcomes of all possible local\nmeasurements can be described by a local hidden variable theory. \n\n"}
