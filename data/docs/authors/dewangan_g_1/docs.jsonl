Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail.

From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)\nand a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS\nstage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion\nas well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally\nextends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and\nirregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS\ncan spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow. The magnetar-like magnetic\nfield strengths resulting from the NS to QS transition provide enough spin-down\nenergy, for the correct amount of time, to account for the plateau in the X-ray\nafterglow.

We derive this response function from\nfull-sky radio surveys at 408 MHz, 1.42 GHz and 23 GHz, as well as from the\npositron flux recently reported by PAMELA. We discuss the influence of\nastrophysical uncertainties on the response function, such as from propagation\nand from the profiles of the dark matter and the Galactic magnetic field.

With the assumption that radio and X-ray\nluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,\nrespectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet\nproduction is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their\npower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with\ndirect, dynamical mass-measurements.

The only free parameter in our model is then the\nstar-formation efficiency (SFE). An efficiency of 2.5% provides the best-fit to\nthe Ly-alpha luminosity function (LF) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this SFE to\nconstruct Ly-alpha LFs at other redshifts.

Remarkably, its numerical value mu_{0 D} = 140\nM_{sun}/pc^2 = (18.6 Mev)^3 is approximately the same (up to a factor of two)\nin all these systems. First, we present the physical consequences of the\nindependence of mu_{0 D} on r_0: the energy scales as the volume sim r_0^3\nwhile the mass and the entropy scale as the surface ~ r_0^2 and the surface\ntimes log r_0, respectively. Namely, the entropy scales similarly to the\nblack-hole entropy but with a much smaller coefficient. Second, we compute the\nsurface gravity and the density profile for small scales from first principles\nand the evolution of primordial density fluctuations since the end of inflation\ntill today using the linearized Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. The density profile\nrho_{lin}(r) obtained in this way decreases as r^{-1-n_s/2} for intermediate\nscales where n_s = 0.964 is the primordial spectral index. This scaling is in\nremarkable agreement with the empirical behaviour found observationally and in\nN-body simulations: r^{-1.6\\pm 0.4}.

We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

These magnetic fields can weaken the positive correlation between\nthe arrival directions of HECRs and the positions of their sources. In order to\nexplore the effect of GMF on the expected correlation, we simulate the arrival\ndistribution of protons with the energy above $6 \\times 10^{19}$ eV taking\nseveral GMF models into account, and then test the correlation between the\nprotons and their sources assumed in the simulation. The dependence of the\ncorrelation signals on GMF models are also investigated. The correlation can be\nobserved by accumulating $\\sim 200$ protons in a half hemisphere. Typical\nangular scale at which the positive signal of the correlation is maximized\ndepends on the spiral component of GMF models. That angular scale is $\\sim 5^o$\nfor bisymmetric spiral (BS) GMF models and $\\sim 7^o$ for axisymmetric spiral\n(AS) GMF models if the number density of HECR sources, $n_s$, is $\\sim 10^{-4}$\nMpc$^{-3}$. An additional vertical (dipole) component of GMF affects these\nangular scale by $0.5^o$ - $1^o$. The difference between the correlation signal\nfor the BS models and that for the AS models is prominent in the northern sky.\nSignificance of the positive correlation depends on source distribution. The\nprobability that the number of simulated HECR events correlating with sources\nis smaller than the number of random events correlating with the same sources\nby chance is much less than $10^{-3}$ ($\\sim 3\\sigma$) in almost all the source\ndistributions with $n_s = 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ under 200 protons detection, but\n$\\sim 10\\%$ of source distributions predicts the chance probability more than\n$10^{-3}$ in the AS GMF model. In addition, we also briefly discuss the effect\nof GMF for heavy-nuclei dominated composition. \n\n"}

This paper looks at the\neffect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e>>0.3) on their collisional\nlifetime and the amount of mass that can remain at late times M_{late}. For an\naxisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we\nfind that M_{late} \\propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. For a scattered\ndisk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamical\nevolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals\nwith the largest eccentricity were present. Despite the increased remaining\nmass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the\ncollisional cascade until e>0.99, partly because most collisions occur near\npericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high\neccentricities (e>0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre\nmay be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also\nincrease the probability of witnessing a recent collision. All of the imaging\nand spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single\nplanetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75AU, apocentre at 150AU, and mass\n5M_\\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains\nchallenging. The mid-IR excess to HD69830 can be explained by the ongoing\ndestruction of a debris belt produced in a recent collision in an eccentric\nplanetesimal belt, but the lack of far-IR emission requires small bound grains\nto be absent from the parent planetesimal belt, possibly due to sublimation. \n\n"}

Recent Spitzer\nobservations revealed an infrared (IR) shell containing a dozen point sources\narranged in a ring-like structure, previously proposed to be young stellar\nobjects. An extended knot of emission located in the NW part of the shell\nappears to be aligned with the pulsar's X-ray jet, suggesting a possible\ninteraction with the shell material.

For both galaxies the star\nformation rate determined from the best-fit FIR SEDs (SFR(L_{IR})) agrees with\nthe SFR determined from the dust corrected H-alpha luminosity (SFR(H-alpha)) to\nwithin a factor of ~ 2; however, when the SFR of these galaxies is estimated\nusing only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependent\ntemplate method (SFR(24um)), it systematically overestimates the SFR by as much\nas a factor of 6.

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc. At larger radii there is no statistically significant\nseparation between populations; the upper limit to the cumulative scoured mass\nat ~kpc is ~2-4 M_BH. This does not depend strongly on stellar mass. The\ndispersion in M(<R) appears larger in the core population, possibly reflecting\nthe fact that scouring increases the scatter in profile shapes.

In tandem with these geometrical constraints, redshift-space\ndistortions (RSD) depend on the build up of large-scale structure.

Moreover, observations show that the UV luminosities and\nstellar masses grow from z=8 to 3, implying that the SFRs increase with time.\nWe compare the cosmologically averaged evolution in galaxies at 3 < z < 8 at\nconstant comoving number density, n = 2 x 10^-4 Mpc^-3. This allows us to study\nthe evolution of stellar mass and star formation in the galaxy predecessors and\ndescendants in ways not possible using galaxies selected at constant stellar\nmass or SFR, quantities that evolve strongly in time. We show that the average\nSFH of these galaxies increase smoothly from z=8 to 3 as SFR ~ t^alpha with\nalpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2. This conflicts with assumptions that the SFR is either\nconstant or declines exponentially in time. We show that the stellar mass\ngrowth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived SFH. This provides\nevidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the IMF is approximately\nSalpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We\nargue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion\nor delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disk growth under the assumption\nthat the SFR depends on the local gas surface density. This predicts that gas\nfractions decrease from z=8 to 3 on average as f_gas ~ (1+z)^0.9 for galaxies\nwith this number density. The implied galaxy gas accretion rates at z > 4 are\nas fast and may even exceed the SFR: this is the \"gas accretion epoch\".

In\nextreme cases, rapid variability of the emission suggests that structures of\nlength-scale smaller than the gravitational radius of the central black hole\nare imprinted on the jet as it is launched, and modulate the radiation released\nafter it has been accelerated to high Lorentz factor.

As for galaxy clusters, Virgo represents\nthe one with the highest flux. However, its large spatial extension can be a\nserious handicap for IACT observations and posterior data analysis. Yet, other\nlocal galaxy cluster candidates with more moderate emission regions, such as\nPerseus, may represent good alternatives. After comparing dwarfs and clusters,\nwe found that the former exhibit annihilation flux profiles that, at the\ncenter, are roughly one order of magnitude higher than those of clusters,\nalthough galaxy clusters can yield similar, or even higher, integrated fluxes\nfor the whole object once substructure is taken into account.

Using\nour new dynamical approach, we find an upturn in the mass-loss vs. Gamma\ndependence, at the point where the winds become optically thick. This coincides\nwith the location where wind efficiency numbers surpass the single-scattering\nlimit of Eta = 1, reaching values up to Eta = 2.5. Our modelling suggests a\ntransition from common O-type winds to Wolf-Rayet characteristics at the point\nwhere the winds become optically thick. This transitional behaviour is also\nrevealed with respect to the wind acceleration parameter beta, which starts at\nvalues below 1 for the optically thin O-stars, and naturally reaches values as\nhigh as 1.5-2 for the optically thick Wolf-Rayet models. An additional finding\nconcerns the transition in spectral morphology of the Of and WN characteristic\nHe II line at 4686 Angstrom.

Our new observations extend the wavelength\ncoverage to include the [OII] 3726,3729 doublet, which adds leverage in oxygen\nabundance estimates and allows measurements of N/O ratios. All four spectra are\nlow excitation, with relatively high N/O ratios (N/O >~ 0.10), each of which\ntend to bias estimates based on strong emission lines toward high oxygen\nabundances. These spectra all fall in a regime where the \"standard\" strong line\nmethods for metallicity determinations are not well calibrated either\nempirically or by photoionization modeling. By comparing our spectra directly\nto photoionization models, we estimate oxygen abundances in the range of 7.9 =<\n12 + log(O/H) =< 8.4, consistent with the scatter of the mass-metallicity\nrelation.

To address the\nproblems of particle propagation and acceleration one needs to infer as much\ninformation as possible on this electron distribution function, through a\ndeconvolution of this fundamental relationship. This review presents recent\nprogress toward this goal using spectroscopic, imaging and polarization\nmeasurements, primarily from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI). Previous conclusions regarding the energy, angular (pitch\nangle) and spatial distributions of energetic electrons in solar flares are\ncritically reviewed.

Optical emission-line and continuum\nproperties are subjected to correlation analyses, in order to identify the main\ndrivers of active galactic nuclei (AGN) correlation space, and of NLS1 galaxies\nin particular. For the first time, we have established the density of the\nnarrow-line region as a key parameter in Eigenvector 1 space, as important as\nthe Eddington ratio L/Ledd.

However,\ncosmologically distant low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) have remained a challenge to\nidentify due to significant contribution from the host galaxy. We identify\nlong-term X-ray variability (~month-years, observed frame) in 20 of 92 CDF-S\ngalaxies spanning redshifts z~0.08-1.02 that do not meet other AGN selection\ncriteria. We show that the observed variability cannot be explained by X-ray\nbinary populations or ultraluminous X-ray sources, so the variability is most\nlikely caused by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. The variable\ngalaxies are not heavily obscured in general, with a stacked effective\npower-law photon index of Gamma_stack~1.93+/-0.13, and are therefore likely\nLLAGN. The LLAGN tend to lie a factor of ~6-80 below the extrapolated linear\nvariability-luminosity relation measured for luminous AGN. This may be\nexplained by their lower accretion rates. Variability-independent black-hole\nmass and accretion-rate estimates for variable galaxies show that they sample a\nsignificantly different black-hole mass-accretion rate space, with masses a\nfactor of 2.4 lower and accretion rates a factor of 22.5 lower than variable\nluminous AGN at the same redshift.

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

Multiple driving processes of such winds\nhave been proposed, including thermal pressure due to supernova-heating, UV\nradiation pressure on dust grains, or cosmic ray (CR) pressure. We here study\nwind formation due to CR physics using a numerical model that accounts for CR\nacceleration by supernovae, CR thermalization, and advective CR transport. In\naddition, we introduce a novel implementation of CR streaming relative to the\nrest frame of the gas. We find that CR streaming drives powerful and sustained\nwinds in galaxies with virial masses M_200 < 10^{11} Msun. In dwarf galaxies\n(M_200 ~ 10^9 Msun) the winds reach a mass loading factor of ~5, expel ~60 per\ncent of the initial baryonic mass contained inside the halo's virial radius and\nsuppress the star formation rate by a factor of ~5. In dwarfs, the winds are\nspherically symmetric while in larger galaxies the outflows transition to\nbi-conical morphologies that are aligned with the disc's angular momentum axis.\nWe show that damping of Alfven waves excited by streaming CRs provides a means\nof heating the outflows to temperatures that scale with the square of the\nescape speed. In larger haloes (M_200 > 10^{11} Msun), CR streaming is able to\ndrive fountain flows that excite turbulence. For halo masses M_200 > 10^{10}\nMsun, we predict an observable level of H-alpha and X-ray emission from the\nheated halo gas. We conclude that CR-driven winds should be crucial in\nsuppressing and regulating the first epoch of galaxy formation, expelling a\nlarge fraction of baryons, and - by extension - aid in shaping the faint end of\nthe galaxy luminosity function. They should then also be responsible for much\nof the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. \n\n"}

Observations have revealed that half of their progenitors, six\nbillion years ago, had peculiar morphologies and/or kinematics, which exclude\nthem from the Hubble sequence. Major mergers, i.e., fusions between galaxies of\nsimilar mass, are found to be the likeliest driver for such strong\npeculiarities. However, thin disks are fragile and easily destroyed by such\nviolent collisions, which creates a critical tension between the observed\nfraction of thin disks and their survival within the L-CDM paradigm. Here we\nshow that the observed high occurrence of mergers amongst their progenitors is\nonly apparent and is resolved when using morpho-kinematic observations which\nare sensitive to all the phases of the merging process. This provides an\noriginal way of narrowing down observational estimates of the galaxy merger\nrate and leads to a perfect match with predictions by state-of-the-art L-CDM\nsemi-empirical models with no particular fine-tuning needed. These results\nimply that half of local thin disks do not survive but are actually rebuilt\nafter a gas-rich major merger occurring in the past nine billion years, i.e.,\ntwo-thirds of the lifetime of the Universe. This emphasizes the need to study\nhow thin disks can form in halos with a more active merger history than\npreviously considered, and to investigate what is the origin of the gas\nreservoir from which local disks would reform. \n\n"}

I: Baryon loading in\n  GRB jets Abstract: A hyper-accreting stellar-mass black hole has been long speculated as the\nbest candidate of central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent rich\nobservations of GRBs by space missions such as Swift and Fermi pose new\nconstraints on GRB central engine models. In this paper, we study the baryon\nloading processes of a GRB jet launched from a black hole central engine. We\nconsider a relativistic jet powered by $\\nu \\bar\\nu$-annihilation or by the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We consider baryon loading from a\nneutrino-driven wind from a neutrino-cooling-dominated accretion flow. For a\nmagnetically dominated BZ jet, we consider neutron-drifting from the magnetic\nwall surrounding the jet and subsequent positron capture and proton-neutron\ninelastic collisions. The minumim baryon loads in both types of jet are\ncalculated. We find that in both cases, a more luminous jet tends to be more\nbaryon poor. A neutrino-driven \"fireball\" is typically \"dirtier\" than a\nmagnetically dominated jet, while a magnetically dominated jet can be much\ncleaner. Both models have the right scaling to interpret the empirical\n$\\Gamma-L_{\\rm iso}$ relation discovered recently. Since some neutrino-driven\njets have too much baryon loading as compared with the data, we suggest that at\nleast a good fraction of GRBs should have a magnetically dominated central\nengine. \n\n"}

The method uses the\nmedian of gas properties, such as density and pressure, which we show to be\nvery robust to the presence of gas inhomogeneities. In particular, we show that\nthe radial profiles of median gas properties are smooth and do not exhibit\nfluctuations at locations of massive clumps in contrast to mean and mode\nproperties. It is shown that distribution of gas properties in a given radial\nshell can be well described by a log-normal PDF and a tail. The former\ncorresponds to a nearly hydrostatic bulk component, accounting for ~99% of the\nvolume, while the tail corresponds to high density inhomogeneities. We show\nthat this results in a simple and robust separation of the diffuse and clumpy\ncomponents of the ICM. The FWHM of the density distribution grows with radius\nand varies from ~0.15 dex in cluster centre to ~0.5 dex at 2r_500 in relaxed\nclusters. The small scatter in the width between relaxed clusters suggests that\nthe degree of inhomogeneity is a robust characteristic of the ICM. It broadly\nagrees with the amplitude of density perturbations in the Coma cluster. We\ndiscuss the origin of ICM density variations in spherical shells and show that\nless than 20% of the width can be attributed to the triaxiality of the cluster\ngravitational potential. As a link to X-ray observations of real clusters we\nevaluated the ICM clumping factor with and without high density\ninhomogeneities.

We compute the star formation rate and\nclumping factor during reionisation in a cosmological volume using a\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamical simulation. We post-process the output with\ndetailed radiative transfer simulations to compute the escape fraction of\nionising photons. Together, this gives us the opportunity to assess the\ncontribution of galaxies to reionisation self-consistently. The strong mass and\nredshift dependence of the escape fraction indicates that reionisation occurred\nbetween z=15 and z=10 and was mainly driven by proto-galaxies forming in\ndark-matter haloes with masses between 1e7 and 1e8 solar mass. More massive\ngalaxies that are rare at these redshifts and have significantly lower escape\nfractions contribute less photons to the reionisation process than the\nmore-abundant low-mass galaxies. Star formation in the low-mass haloes is\nsuppressed by radiative feedback from reionisation, therefore these\nproto-galaxies only contribute when the part of the Universe they live in is\nstill neutral.

The results of the first analysis confirm the correlation\nbetween black hole and total stellar mass for 8 galaxies and includes one\ngalaxy classified as bulgeless. The results of our second analysis, consisting\nof 15,991 galaxies, show that galaxies hosting a supermassive black hole follow\nthe same morphological distribution as the general population of galaxies in\nthe same redshift range. In particular, the fraction of bulgeless galaxies,\n1,450 galaxies or 9 percent, is found to be the same as in the general\npopulation.

In this size range,\nmoons orbiting in an empty gap or in a full ring eventually migrate at the same\nrate. Smaller moons or moonlets -- such as the propellers (e.g., Tiscareno et\nal. 2006) -- are trapped by diffusion of disk material into corotating orbits,\ncreating inertial drag. Larger moons -- such as Pan or Atlas -- do not migrate\nbecause of their own inertia. Fast migration of 2-24 km moons should eliminate\nintermediate-size bodies from the A ring and may be responsible for the\nobserved large-radius cutoff of r_H ~ 1-2 km in the size distribution of the A\nring's propeller moonlets. Although the presence of Daphnis (r_H ~ 5 km) inside\nthe Keeler gap challenges this scenario, numerical simulations demonstrate that\norbital resonances and stirring by distant, larger moons (e.g., Mimas) may be\nimportant factors.

Most\nAGN are radio quiet because the thin accretion disks that feed them are\ninefficient in depositing magnetic flux close to the black hole. Flux\naccumulation is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick disk)\nphase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and strong emission-line radio\ngalaxies occur only when a massive, cold accretion event follows an episode of\nhot accretion. Such an event might be triggered by the merger of a giant\nelliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy.\n  This picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead to the\nformation of a so-called magnetically choked accretion flow (MCAF). The large\nobserved range in radio loudness reflects not only the magnitude of the flux\npressed against the black hole, but also the decrease in UV flux from the disk,\ndue to its disruption by the \"magnetosphere\" associated with the accumulated\nflux. While the strongest jets result from the secular accumulation of flux,\nmoderate jet activity can also be triggered by fluctuations in the magnetic\nflux deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin accretion\ndisks, or by the dissipation of turbulent fields in accretion disk coronae.\nThese processes could be responsible for jet production in Seyferts and\nlow-luminosity AGN, as well as jets associated with X-ray binaries. \n\n"}

However, the ability to carry out effective\nmatched-filter based searches for these systems is limited by the lack of\nreliable waveforms.

One possible acceleration mechanism is the\nfirst-order Fermi process in mildly relativistic shocks: in the Bohm limit, the\nindex of the electron energy spectrum, p, is slightly larger than 2 and\ndecreases with velocity upstream of the shock. This possibility is consistent\nwith our measurements, but requires shocks throughout the jet volume rather\nthan at a few discrete locations. A second possibility is that two acceleration\nmechanisms operate in these jets: one (with p = 2.32) dominant close to the\ngalactic nucleus and associated with high flow speeds, another (with p = 2.18)\ntaking over at larger distances and slower flow speeds. \n\n"}

We propose a\nnovel scenario in which known extragalactic positron sources such as radio jets\nof active galactic nuclei (AGN) fill the intergalactic medium with MeV e+e-\npairs, which are then accreted into the Milky Way. We show that interpreting\nthe diffuse cosmic radio background (CRB) as arising from radio sources with\ncharacteristics similar to the observed cores and radio lobes in powerful AGN\njets suggests that the intergalactic positron-to-electron ratio could be as\nhigh as 10^{-5}, although this can be decreased if the CRB is not all produced\nby pairs and if not all positrons escape to the intergalactic medium.

Based on similarities between the full\nSED shapes (0.3-8 micron), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral\nclasses and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a\nrange in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well-sampled in wavelength\nand show various spectral features including Halpha and the UV dust bump at\n2175 Angstrom. We fit all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population\nsynthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV\nbump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV\nwavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that\nthe best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong\ncorrelation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump strength, with steeper\nlaws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with\nspecific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower\ndust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with\ninclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the\ndust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of\nboth. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies.\nFirst, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived\ngalaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in\nunderestimated values for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

Companion masses are found mostly in 0.1-1 Msun mass range with peak\nat 0.6 Msun. The formation of these systems is believed to involve a common\nenvelope phase, initiated by a BH progenitor, expected to be a massive star >20\nMsun. It was realized that it may be very problematic for a low-mass companion\nto eject a massive envelope of the black hole progenitor. It invoked\nsuggestions that an intermediate-mass companion ejects the envelope, and then\nis shredded by the Roche-lobe overflow to its current low-mass. But this\ncreates another issue; a temperature mismatch between hot models and the\nobserved cool low-mass donors. Finally, the main driver of Roche-lobe overflow\nthat is believed to be magnetic braking does not seem to follow any\ntheoretically calculated models.

Background\nand contamination uncertainties present in the data of non-focusing\nobservatories result in lower sensitivity to IC emission and a greater chance\nof false detection.

The result is\nalso in tension with Planck limits on standard inflationary models. It is\ntherefore important to investigate whether this signal can arise from\nalternative sources. If so, this could lessen the pressure on inflationary\nmodels and the tension with Planck data. We investigate whether vector and\ntensor modes from primordial magnetic fields can explain the signal. We find\nthat in principle, magnetic fields generated during inflation can indeed\nproduce the required B-mode, for a suitable range of energy scales of\ninflation. In this case, the primordial gravitational wave amplitude is\nnegligible, so that there is no tension with Planck and no problems posed for\ncurrent inflationary models.

Abstract: If the specific angular momentum of accretion gas at large radius is small\ncompared to the local Keplerian value, one usually believes that there exists a\n\"circularization radius\" beyond which the angular momentum of accretion flow is\nalmost a constant while within which a disk is formed and the angular momentum\nroughly follows the Keplerian distribution.

We find that for a steady accretion flow, the \"circularization\nradius\" does not exist and the angular momentum profile will be smooth\nthroughout the flow. However, for transient accretion systems, such as the\ntidal disruption of a star by a black hole, a \"turning point\" should exist in\nthe radial profile of the angular momentum, which is conceptually similar to\nthe \"circularization radius\". At this radius, the viscous timescale equals the\nlife time of the accretion event.

To investigate this\ncorrelation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes star\nformation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,\napplying it to GRB production. We predict luminosities, stellar masses, and\nmetallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. Our\nbest-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistent\nwith the large majority of long-duration GRBs in metal-poor environments\noriginating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondary\ncontribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binary\nevolution. Because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximum\nlikelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominant\nat z<2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.\nThis possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-bias\nbased on low-z samples.

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

Such a disk\nis subject to both the tidal torques due to a time-dependent binary potential\nand the radiative torques due to radiation emitted from each star. The tilt\nangle between the circumbinary disk plane and the binary orbital plane is\nassumed to be very small. We find that there is a radius within/beyond which\nthe circumbinary disk is unstable to radiation-driven warping, depending on the\ndisk density and temperature gradient indices. This marginally stable warping\nradius is very sensitive to viscosity parameters, a fiducial disk radius and\nthe temperature measured there, the stellar luminosity, and the disk surface\ndensity at a radius where the disk changes from the optically thick to thin for\nthe irradiation from the central stars. On the other hand, it is insensitive to\nthe orbital eccentricity and binary irradiation parameter, which is a function\nof the binary mass ratio and luminosity of each star. Since the tidal torques\ncan suppress the warping in the inner part of the circumbinary disk, the disk\nstarts to be warped in the outer part. While the circumbinary disks are most\nlikely to be subject to the radiation-driven warping on a AU to kilo-AU scale\nfor binaries with young massive stars more luminous than 10^4Lsun, the\nradiation driven warping does not work for those around young binaries with the\nluminosity comparable to the solar luminosity. \n\n"}

Stellar\nand gas masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and metallicities are obtained\nfrom the analysis of a set of ancillary data. Dust is detected in 49 out of 140\noptically identified dwarfs covered by the HeViCS field; considering only\ndwarfs brighter than $m_B$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. After\nevaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the FIR-submm SEDs are\nbest-fit by $\\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $T_d$ = 22.4 K.\nAssuming $\\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five Herschel\nbands show emission at 500 $\\mu$m in excess of the MBB model.

In\nthis formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a\nnonconservative action $\\mathcal{S}$, which is a functional of a doubled set of\ndegrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative Lagrangian contains a\npotential $K$ which generates nonconservative forces and interactions. Such a\nnonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open\nsystem interacting with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out\nor coarse-graining a subset of variables in closed systems. We generalize\nNoether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and no longer\nconserved when $K$ is non-vanishing.

These TDEs release a huge amount of radiation energy ~ 10^51-52 erg\ninto the circum-nuclear medium. If the medium is dusty, most of the radiation\nenergy will be absorbed by dust grains within ~ 1 pc from the BH and\nre-radiated in the infrared.

We show that the dust emission peaks at\n3-10 microns and has typical luminosities ~ 10^42-43 erg/s (with sky covering\nfactor of dusty clouds ranging from 0.1-1).

First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A*\nwith current and new instruments is expected to resolve their orbital\nprecessions.

Previously, these models have utilized\nthe simplicity of the Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the\nmagnetic flux is magnetic \"hair\" that must be shed before final collapse.

Recent efforts\nhave been made to reconstruct maps of the ISW signal using information from\nsurveys of galaxies and other LSS tracers, but investigation into how survey\nsystematics affect their reliability has so far been limited.

Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to\natomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the\nscale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it\nradiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft\nX-ray excess. The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonised disc region emits FUV\nflux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc but while this gives\nreprocessed variable emission which is much closer to the observed UV and\noptical lightcurves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the\ndata.

We develop an analytical model for the\nsize-dependent secular dynamics of retrograde Phoebe ring grains, and compare\nthis model to the observations. This analysis implies that 1) the \"Phoebe\" ring\nis partially sourced by debris from irregular satellites beyond Phoebe's orbit\nand 2) the scattered light signal is dominated by small grains ($\\lesssim\n20\\mu$m in size). If we assume that the Phoebe ring is generated through\nsteady-state micrometeoroid bombardment, this implies a power-law size\ndistribution with index $> 4$, which is unusually steep among solar system\nrings.

A wide class\nof these theories, albeit indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime,\npredicts a radically different phenomenology for neutron stars, due to a\nnonperturbative, strong-field effect referred to as spontaneous scalarization.\nThis effect is known to occur in theories where the effective linear coupling\n$\\beta_0$ between the scalar and matter fields is sufficiently negative, i.e.\n$\\beta_0 \\lesssim -4.35$, and has been strongly constrained by pulsar timing\nobservations.\n  In the test-field approximation, spontaneous scalarization manifests itself\nas a tachyonic-like instability. Recently, it was argued that, in theories\nwhere $\\beta_0>0$, a similar instability would be triggered by sufficiently\ncompact neutron stars obeying realistic equations of state. In this work we\ninvestigate the endstate of this instability for some representative coupling\nfunctions with $\\beta_0>0$.

Most galaxies more massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$ follow the red-sequence while less massive central\ngalaxies lie on the blue sequence. We show that these sequences are created by\na competition between star formation-driven outflows and gas accretion on to\nthe supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. We develop a simple\nanalytic model for this interaction. In galaxies less massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$, young stars and supernovae drive a high entropy\noutflow that is more buoyant that any diffuse corona. The outflow balances the\nrate of gas inflow, preventing high gas densities building up in the central\nregions. More massive galaxies, however, are surrounded by a hot corona. We\nargue that above a halo mass of $\\sim 10^{12} M_\\odot$, the supernova-driven\noutflow is no longer buoyant and star formation is unable to prevent the build\nup of gas in the central regions. This triggers a strongly non-linear response\nfrom the black hole. Its accretion rate rises rapidly, heating the galaxy's\ncorona, disrupting the incoming supply of cool gas and starving the galaxy of\nthe fuel for star formation. The host galaxy makes a transition to the red\nsequence, and further growth predominantly occurs through galaxy mergers. We\nshow that the analytic model provides a good description of galaxy evolution in\nthe EAGLE hydrodynamic simulations, and demonstrate that, so long as star\nformation-driven outflows are present, the transition mass scale is almost\nindependent of subgrid parameter choice. The transition mass disappears\nentirely, however, if star formation driven outflows are absent. \n\n"}

The mock observations are modeled with isotropic Jeans models to\nassess the success rate in identifying the IMBH presence, which we find to be\nprimarily dependent on IMBH mass. However, even for a IMBH of considerable mass\n(3% of the total GC mass), the analysis does not yield conclusive results in 1\nout of 5 cases, because of shot noise due to bright stars close to the IMBH\nline-of-sight. This stochastic variability in the modeling outcome grows with\ndecreasing BH mass, with approximately 3 failures out of 4 for IMBHs with 0.1%\nof total GC mass.

Taken at face value these constraints exclude multi-Solar mass PBHs\nmaking up all of the DM for both delta-function and extended mass functions.\nHowever the stellar microlensing event rate depends on the density and velocity\ndistribution of the compact objects along the line of sight to the Magellanic\nClouds.

In the canonical\ntruncated disk model of moderately low accretion rate systems, gas in the inner\nregion of the accretion disk occupies a hot, radiatively inefficient phase,\nwhich leads to a geometrically thick disk, while the gas in the outer region\noccupies a cooler, radiatively efficient phase that resides in the standard\ngeometrically thin disk. Observationally, there is strong empirical evidence to\nsupport this phenomenological model, but a detailed understanding of the\ndynamics of truncated disks is lacking. We present a well-resolved viscous,\nhydrodynamic simulation that uses an ad hoc cooling prescription to drive a\nthermal instability and, hence, produce the first sustained truncated accretion\ndisk.

So far\nneither observational systematics nor new physics has been successfully\nimplemented to explain this tension away. This paper present a new solution to\nthe Hubble constant problem. The solution is based on the Simsilun simulation\n(relativistic simulation of the large scale structure of the Universe) with the\nray-tracing algorithm implemented.

However,\nunlike in the Standard Cosmological Model (i.e. $\\Lambda$CDM model +\nperturbations), within the Simsilun simulation relativistic and nonlinear\nevolution of cosmic structures leads to the phenomenon of emerging spatial\ncurvature, where the mean spatial curvature evolves from spatial flatness of\nthe early universe towards slightly curved present-day universe. Consqeuently,\nthe present-day expansion rate is slightly faster compared to the spatially\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM model. The results of the ray-tracing analysis show that the\nuniverse which starts with initial conditions consistent with the Planck\nconstraints should have the Hubble constant $H_0 = 72.5 \\pm 2.1$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$.

After outlining the\nframework and the model, we compile a set of variability measurements in terms\nof structure function (SF) and magnitude difference. We then combine the\nvariability measurements on a SF plot ranging from days to Gyr. The proposed\nframework enables constraints on the underlying PSD and the ability to link AGN\nvariability on different timescales, therefore providing new insights into AGN\nvariability and black hole growth phenomena. \n\n"}

Orbital\n  Alignment or Anti-alignment and Planet Growth Boost in Intermediate\n  Separation Binaries Abstract: Stars are commonly formed in binary systems, which provide a natural\nlaboratory for studying planet formation in extreme conditions. In our first\npaper (Paper I) of a series Xie et al. (2011), we have shown that the\nintermediate stage - from planetesimals to planetary embryos/cores - of planet\nformation can proceed even in highly inclined binaries. Following Paper I, here\nwe numerically study the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, i.e., from\nembryos to full planets, in binary systems of various orbital configurations.\nWe identify an orbital alignment or anti-alignment effect; namely, although an\ninclined binary generally misaligns the planetary orbits with respect to the\nspin axis of the primary host star (i.e., causing large obliquity), it could\nalign or anti-align the planetary orbits with respect to the binary orbit. Such\nan orbital (anti-)alignment effect is caused by the combination of orbital\ndifferential precession and self-damping, and it is mostly significant in cases\nof intermediate binary separations, i.e., a_B~40-200 AU for terrestrial planet\nformation around 1 AU from the primary stars. In such intermediate separation\nbinaries, somewhat contrary to intuition, the binary companion can aid planet\ngrowth by having increased the rate of collisions, forming significantly more\nmassive but fewer planets. In the other two ends, the companion is ether too\nclose thus plays a violently disruptive role or too wide to have significant\neffect on planet formation.

The non-minimal coupling, which typically depends on\na scalar field that possibly drives the homogeneous background, leads to a\ncross-correlation at the level of the three-point function between the\nperturbation in the scalar field and the magnetic fields.

The morphology of these \"TeV halos\" requires\ncosmic-ray diffusion to be locally suppressed by a factor of ~100-1000 compared\nto the typical interstellar medium. No model currently explains this\nsuppression. We show that cosmic-ray self-confinement can significantly inhibit\ndiffusion near pulsars. The steep cosmic-ray gradient generates Alfven waves\nthat resonantly scatter the same cosmic-ray population, suppressing diffusion\nwithin ~20 pc of pulsars younger than ~100 kyr. In this model, TeV halos evolve\nthrough two phases, a growth phase where Alfven waves are resonantly generated\nand cosmic-ray diffusion becomes increasingly suppressed, and a subsequent\nrelaxation phase where the diffusion coefficient returns to the standard\ninterstellar value. Intriguingly, cosmic-rays are not strongly confined early\nin the TeV halo evolution, allowing a significant fraction of injected e+e- to\nescape. If these e+e- also escape from the surrounding supernova remnant, they\nwould provide a natural explanation for the positron excess observed by PAMELA\nand AMS-02. Recently created TeV cosmic-rays are confined in the TeV halo,\nmatching observations by HAWC and H.E.S.S. While our default model relaxes too\nrapidly to explain the confinement of TeV cosmic rays around mature pulsars,\nsuch as Geminga, models utilizing a Kraichnan turbulence spectrum experience\nmuch slower relaxation.

To\nverify these claims, we conducted a multi-object spectrographic campaign on the\nBaade 6.5m telescope around Abell 133; this resulted in a catalog of\n${\\sim}3000$ new redshift measurements, of which 254 are of galaxies near the\ncluster. We investigate the kinematic state of Abell 133 and identify the\nphysical locations of filamentary structure in the galaxy distribution.\nContrary to previous studies, we see no evidence that Abell 133 is dynamically\ndisturbed; we reject the hypothesis that there is a kinematically distinct\nsubgroup (p=0.28) and find no velocity offset between the central galaxy and\nthe cluster ($\\textrm{Z}_\\textrm{score}=0.041^{+0.111}_{-0.106}$). The spatial\ndistribution of galaxies traces the X-ray filaments, as confirmed by angular\ncross correlation with a significance of ${\\sim}5\\sigma$. A similar agreement\nis found in the angular density distribution, where two X-ray structures have\ncorresponding galaxy enhancements. We also identify filaments in the\nlarge-scale structure of galaxies; these filaments approach the cluster from\nthe direction the X-ray structures are seen. While more members between\n$\\textrm{R}_{200}$ and $2\\times\\textrm{R}_{200}$ are required to clarify which\nlarge scale filaments connect to the X-ray gas, we argue that this is\ncompelling evidence that the X-ray emission is indeed associated with cosmic\nfilaments. \n\n"}

This correlation is equivalent to an integral of\nthe bispectrum in the squeezed limit, but is much simpler to implement than the\nusual bispectrum estimators.

Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh\nrefinement, we investigate how photons propagate and escape from turbulent\nclouds with different masses, star formation efficiencies (SFEs), and\nmetallicities, as well as with different models of stellar spectra and\nsupernova feedback. We find that the escape fractions in both LyC and Lya are\ngenerally increasing with time if the cloud is efficiently dispersed by\nradiation and supernova feedback. When the total SFE is low (1% of the cloud\nmass), 0.1-5% of LyC photons leave the metal-poor cloud, whereas the fractions\nincrease to 20-70% in clouds with a 10% SFE. LyC photons escape more\nefficiently if gas metallicity is lower, if the upper mass limit in the stellar\ninitial mass function is higher, if binary interactions are allowed in the\nevolution of stars, or if additional strong radiation pressure, such as Lya\npressure, is present.

It is crucial to distinguish between these two populations\nbecause they have very different consequences on the models of galaxy\nformation. Here we show that old ellipticals and dusty starburst are expected\nto show different colours in the (I-K) vs. (J-K) diagram for redshift range\n1<z<2, providing thus a useful tool to classify ERGs in large samples up to\nK<20.

However, we have\nalso considered non-zero progenitor's metallicity values up to Z=Zsun. The\ncalculations are based on standard nucleation theory and the scheme has been\nfirst tested on the well studied case of SN1987A, yielding results that are in\nagreement with the available data. We find that: i) the first dust grains are\npredominantly made of silicates, amorphous carbon (AC), magnetite, and\ncorundum; ii) the largest grains are the AC ones, with sizes around 300 A,\nwhereas other grain types have smaller radii, around 10-20 A. The grain size\ndistribution depends somewhat on the thermodynamics of the ejecta expansion and\nvariations in the results by a factor ~ 2 might occur within reasonable\nestimates of the relevant parameters. Also, and for the same reason, the grain\nsize distribution, is essentially unaffected by metallicity changes. The\npredictions on the amount of dust formed are very robust: for Z=0, we find that\nSNe with masses in the range (12-35) Msun produce about 0.08 Msun < M_dust <\n0.3 Msun of dust/SN. The above range increases by roughly 3 times as the\nmetallicity is increased to solar values. We discuss the implications and the\ncosmological consequences of the results. \n\n"}

In particular, key\nelectron-capture rates, such as that for Co60 are much smaller.

About half of this change is a consequence of\nincluding beta-decay; the other half, result of the smaller rates for electron\ncapture. Unlike what might be expected solely on basis of the larger Y_e's, the\nnew iron core masses are systematically smaller owing to a decrease in the\nentropy in the outer iron core. The changes in iron core mass range from zero\nto 0.1 M_sun. We also observe, as predicted by Aufderheide et al.

An alternative\nmodel, in which the periods are related to the spin of a magnetic white dwarf\nin an intermediate polar system, has been rejected by other authors. We show\nthat a face-on, stream-fed intermediate polar model for the two systems is\nviable and preferable to the other models. In each case, the X-ray modulation\nperiods then represent the rotation of the white dwarf in the binary reference\nframe. The model explains the fully modulated X-ray pulse profiles, the X-ray\nspectra, the antiphase between X-ray and optical/infrared modulation, the lack\nof longer period modulation, and the low level of polarization. The optical\nspectrum of RX J0806.3+1527 suggests that Balmer series lines are present,\nblended with HeII lines. This is unlike the spectra of any of the known AM CVn\nstars and suggests that the system is not a double degenerate binary. The\noptical spectrum of RX J1914.4+2456 has spectral features that are consistent\nwith those of a K star, ruling out the double degenerate models in this case.\nThe lack of optical/infrared emission lines in RX J1914.4+2456 may be\nattributed to a high mass accretion rate and its face-on orientation. Its\nreported period decrease may be a short term spin-up episode driven by the\ncurrent high M-dot. Finally we suggest that there is an observational selection\neffect such that the face-on intermediate polars that are detected will all\nhave a stream-fed component, and the purely stream-fed intermediate polars that\nare detected will all be face-on systems. \n\n"}

In this non-linear regime, the\nrms_tot decreases with N significantly more slowly than expected from the rms ~\n1/sqrt(N) averaging law. For example, for a power law luminosity function with\na slope of a=3/2, in the non-linear regime, L_tot ~ N^2 and the rms_tot does\nnot depend at all on the number of sources N. Only in the limit of N>>1 do\nthese quantities behave as intuitively expected, L_tot ~ N and rms_tot ~\n1/sqrt(N). We give exact solutions and derive convenient analytical\napproximations for L_tot and rms_tot.\n  Using the total X-ray luminosity of a galaxy due to its X-ray binary\npopulation as an example, we show that the Lx-SFR and Lx-M* relations predicted\nfrom the respective ``universal'' luminosity functions of high and low mass\nX-ray binaries are in a good agreement with observations. Although caused by\nsmall number statistics the non-linear regime in these examples extends as far\nas SFR<4-5 Msun/yr and log(M*/Msun)<10.0-10.5, respectively. \n\n"}

In order to identify the most\nimportant correlations, we perform a principal component analysis with a sample\nof 30 BAL QSOs and eight quantities (including p_0). Most of the variance in\nthe data is contained in two principal components (PC): PC1 is mainly dominated\nby the correlation between the balnicity index BI and the strength of the feii\nemission, and may be driven by the accretion rate of matter onto the central\ncompact object. The variance in PC2 is essentially due to the anti-correlation\nbetween p_0 and the detachment index DI. PC2 may be related to the orientation\nof the BAL QSOs with respect to the line of sight. We also consider a\nspectropolarimetric sample of 21 BAL QSOs for which we define four indices\ndescribing the polarization properties of the absorption and emission lines. We\nfind a possible anti-correlation between the detachment index and a quantity SI\nwhich measures the ratio of the depths of the civ absorption in the polarized\nflux and in the total flux.

In this paper we examine a (200 pc)^3 periodic domain\nthreaded by magnetic fields. Individual parcels of gas at different pressures\nreach widely varying points on the thermal equilibrium curve: no unique set of\nphases is found, but rather a dynamically-determined continuum of densities and\ntemperatures. A substantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal\nequilibrium. Our results appear consistent with observations of interstellar\npressures.

The ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity is at least four\norders of magnitude in excess of that observed in a wide range of active stars\n(including M dwarfs) providing the first direct confirmation that late-M and L\ndwarfs violate the radio/X-ray correlation. The radio emission is due to\ngyrosynchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field of about 175 G, which\nis maintained on timescales longer than three years.

We demonstrate that the case\nof \"bipolar\" oscillations, where a dense gas of neutrinos and antineutrinos in\nequal numbers completely converts from one flavour to another even if the\nmixing angle is small, is equivalent to a pendulum in flavour space. Bipolar\nflavour conversion corresponds to the swinging of the pendulum, which begins in\nan unstable upright position (the initial flavour), and passes through\nmomentarily the vertically downward position (the other flavour) in the course\nof its motion. The time scale to complete one cycle of oscillation depends\nlogarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle.

We further find that a more complex\n(and realistic) system of unequal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos is\nanalogous to a spinning top subject to a torque.

As a strong lens, a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way can give\nrise to four different imaging geometries. They are (i) three images on one\nside of the galaxy centre (`disc triplets'), (ii) three images with one close\nto the centre (`core triplets'), (iii) five images and (iv) seven images.\nNeglecting magnification bias, we show that the core triplets, disc triplets\nand fivefold imaging are roughly equally likely. Even though our models contain\nedge-on discs, their image multiplicities are not dominated by disc triplets.\nThe halo has a small effect on the caustic structure, the time delays and\nbrightnesses of the images. The Milky Way model has a maximum disc (i.e., the\nhalo is not dynamically important in the inner parts). Strong lensing by nearly\nedge-on disc galaxies breaks the degeneracy between the relative contribution\nof the disc and halo to the overall rotation curve.

We confirm the ~60-day cyclic variation\nof the X-ray flux in the long-term monitoring data from the RXTE and CGRO\nobservatories. X-ray light curves and spectra from the ROSAT, Ginga, and ASCA\nobservatories show that the uneclipsed flux varies by as much as a factor of\ntwenty between a high-flux state when 0.71 second pulses are present and a\nlow-flux state when pulses are absent. In contrast, during eclipses when the\nX-rays consist of radiation scattered from circumsource matter, the fluxes and\nspectra in the high and low states are approximately the same. These\nobservations prove that the low state of SMC X-1 is not caused by a reduction\nin the intrinsic luminosity of the source, or a spectral redistribution\nthereof, but rather by a quasi-periodic blockage of the line of sight, most\nlikely by a precessing tilted accretion disk. In each of two observations in\nthe midst of low states a brief increase in the X-ray flux and reappearance of\n0.71 second pulses occurred near orbital phase 0.2. These brief increases\nresult from an opening of the line of sight to the pulsar that may be caused by\nwobble in the precessing accretion disk. The records of spin up of the neutron\nstar and decay of the binary orbit are extended during 1991-1996 by\npulse-timing analysis of ROSAT, ASCA, and RXTE PCA data. The pulse profiles in\nvarious energy ranges from 0.1 to >21 keV are well represented as a combination\nof a pencil beam and a fan beam. Finally, there is a marked difference between\nthe power spectra of random fluctuations in the high-state data from the RXTE\nPCA below and above 3.4 keV.

Then we review the prospects for extremely\nlong-baseline analyses and discuss the sensitivity to measure tiny deviations\nof the flavor mixing angle, expected to be induced by quantum gravity effects.\nFinally we discuss the potential to uncover annihilation of dark matter\nparticles gravitationally trapped at the center of the Sun, as well as\nprocesses occurring in the early Universe at energies close to the Grand\nUnification scale. \n\n"}

We reanalyze this observation and point\nout that such patterns of superpartner masses at the weak scale are {\\it not}\nruled out when taking into account the probability of decay for the metastable\ncolor conserving minimum along these color breaking unbounded directions. It\nturns out that the color conserving minimum, although metastable, has a\nlifetime longer than the present age of the Universe and can survive both\nquantum tunneling and the effects of high temperatures in the early Universe,\ncausing the color/charge breaking effects to be in practice not dangerous. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/9802443", "contents": "Title: A Signature of Inflation from Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking Abstract: In models of cosmological inflation motivated by dynamical supersymmetry\nbreaking, the potential driving inflation may be characterized by inverse\npowers of a scalar field. These models produce observables similar to those\ntypical of the hybrid inflation scenario: negligible production of tensor\n(gravitational wave) modes, and a blue scalar spectral index. In this short\nnote, we show that, unlike standard hybrid inflation models, dynamical\nsupersymmetric inflation (DSI) predicts a measurable deviation from a power-law\nspectrum of fluctuations, with a variation in the scalar spectral index $|dn /\nd(\\ln k)|$ may be as large as 0.05.

{"id": "hep-ph/9904315", "contents": "Title: Preheating in Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation Abstract: We study preheating in a general class of supersymmetric hybrid inflation\nmodel. Supersymmetry leads to only one coupling constant in the potential and\nthus only one natural frequency of oscillation for the homogeneous fields,\nwhose classical evolution consequently differs from that of a general\n(non-supersymmetric) hybrid model. We emphasise the importance of mixing\neffects in these models which can significantly change the rate of production\nof particles. We perform a general study of the rate of production of the\nparticles associated with the homogeneous fields, and show how preheating is\nefficient in producing these quanta. Preheating of other particle species will\nbe model dependent, and in order to investigate this we consider a realistic\nworking model of supersymmetric hybrid inflation which solves the strong-CP\nproblem via an approximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which was proposed by us\npreviously. We study axion production in this model and show that properly\ntaking into account the mixing between the fields suppresses the axion\nproduction, yet enhances the production of other particles. Finally we\ndemonstrate the importance of backreaction effects in this model which have the\neffect of shutting off axion production, leaving the axion safely within\nexperimental bounds. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-ph/9911447", "contents": "Title: Features in the primordial power spectrum of double D-term inflation Abstract: Recently, there has been some interest for building supersymmetric models of\ndouble inflation. These models, realistic from a particle physics point of\nview, predict a broken-scale-invariant power spectrum of primordial\ncosmological perturbations, that may explain eventual non-trivial features in\nthe present matter power spectrum. In previous works, the primordial spectrum\nwas calculated using analytic slow-roll approximations. However, these models\ninvolve a fast second-order phase transition during inflation, with a stage of\nspinodal instability, and an interruption of slow-roll. For our previous model\nof double D-term inflation, we simulate numerically the evolution of quantum\nfluctuations, taking into account the spinodal modes, and we show that the\nsemi-classical approximation can be employed even during the transition, due to\nthe presence of a second inflaton field. The primordial power spectrum\npossesses a rich structure, and possibly, a non-Gaussian spike on observable\nscales. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0010232", "contents": "Title: Trace anomaly driven inflation Abstract: This paper investigates Starobinsky's model of inflation driven by the trace\nanomaly of conformally coupled matter fields. This model does not suffer from\nthe problem of contrived initial conditions that occurs in most models of\ninflation driven by a scalar field. The universe can be nucleated\nsemi-classically by a cosmological instanton that is much larger than the\nPlanck scale provided there are sufficiently many matter fields. There are two\ncosmological instantons: the four sphere and a new ``double bubble'' solution.\nThis paper considers a universe nucleated by the four sphere. The AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence is used to calculate the correlation function for scalar and\ntensor metric perturbations during the ensuing de Sitter phase. The analytic\nstructure of the scalar and tensor propagators is discussed in detail.\nObservational constraints on the model are discussed. Quantum loops of matter\nfields are shown to strongly suppress short scale metric perturbations, which\nimplies that short distance modifications of gravity would probably not be\nobservable in the cosmic microwave background. This is probably true for any\nmodel of inflation provided there are sufficiently many matter fields. This\npoint is illustrated by a comparison of anomaly driven inflation in four\ndimensions and in a Randall-Sundrum brane-world model. \n\n"}
