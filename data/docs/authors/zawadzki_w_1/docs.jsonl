Our starting\npoint is the observation that the notion of classical time is external to\nquantum mechanics. Hence there must exist an equivalent reformulation of\nquantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical time. Such a\nreformulation is a limiting case of a more general quantum theory which becomes\nnonlinear on the Planck mass/energy scale. The nonlinearity gives rise to a\nquantum-classical duality which maps a `strongly quantum, weakly gravitational'\ndynamics to a `weakly quantum, strongly gravitational' dynamics. This duality\npredicts the existence of a tiny nonzero cosmological constant of the order of\nthe square of the Hubble constant, which could be a possible source for the\nobserved cosmic acceleration. Such a nonlinearity could also be responsible for\nthe collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement. We conclude by\nsuggesting that the idea for the origin of dark energy proposed in this paper\ncan be tested indirectly in the laboratory by a detailed examination of the\nprocess of quantum measurement. \n\n"}

We compute the low-temperature linear and nonlinear conductance,\nshot noise, and thermopower, by perturbation theory and a self-consistent\nnonperturbative method. On the conductance plateau, the low-temperature\ncorrections are solely due to momentum-nonconserving processes that change the\nrelative number of left- and right-moving electrons. This leads to a\nsuppression of the conductance for increasing temperature or voltage. The size\nof the suppression is estimated for a realistic saddle-point potential, and is\nlargest in the beginning of the conductance plateau. For large magnetic field,\ninteraction effects are strongly suppressed by the Pauli principle, and hence\nthe first spin-split conductance plateau has a much weaker interaction\ncorrection.

Our main finding is that Coulomb interactions among\nthe electrons dominate the interference, even in a relatively large area FPI,\nleading to a strong dependence of the area enclosed by the interference loop on\nthe magnetic field. In particular, for a composite edge structure, with a few\nindependent edge channels propagating along the edge, interference of the\noutmost edge channel (belonging to the lowest Landau level) was insensitive to\nmagnetic field; suggesting a constant enclosed flux.

We investigate three quantum\ngates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an AC gate based on logical\nqubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known as stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by an exchange\ninteraction that is controlled experimentally using the interdot tunnel\ncoupling $g$ and the detuning $\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference\nbetween the dots.

Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields.

Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range.

An important hallmark of topological superconductors is the\nexistence of protected zero-energy states at surfaces or in vortex cores.

We find that using an accurate model for the\npolarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct\nnumerical results. The interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon\nmodes, the gauge field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT\nlevel in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic\nphonons is interpreted as a strain pattern, allowing the calculation of the\nacoustic gauge field parameter in the GW approximation. The role of electronic\nscreening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is investigated. We then solve\nthe Boltzmann equation semi-analytically in graphene, including both acoustic\nand optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen and\nequipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the\nunscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation\npotential is negligible and strongly screened. By comparing with experimental\ndata, we show that the contribution of acoustic phonons to resistivity is\ndoping- and substrate-independent. The DFT+GW approach underestimates this\ncontribution to resistivity by about 30 %. Above 270K, the calculated\nresistivity underestimates the experimental one more severely, the\nunderestimation being larger at lower doping.

This conclusion follows by proving a\nquantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a\nconstant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to\nzero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy\nregistered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states\nthat any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than\nthe channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily\nconverges to one.

When the field and the spin-torque concur to favor the P to\nAP transition, the reversal yields monotonic resistance ramps that can be\ninterpreted as a domain wall propagation through the device at velocities of 17\nto 30 nm/ns; smaller cells switch hence faster. When the field hinders the P to\nAP transition, the switching is preceded by repetitive switching attempts,\nduring which the resistance transiently increases until successful reversal\noccurs. At 50 nm, the P to AP switching proceeds reproducibly in 3 ns, with a\nmonotonic increase of the device resistance. In the reverse transition (AP to\nP), several reversal paths are possible even in the smallest junctions.\nBesides, the non uniform nature of the response seems still present at\nnanoscale, with sometimes electrical signatures of strong disorder during the\nreversal. The AP to P transition is preceded by a strong instability of the AP\nstate in devices above 100 nm. The resistance becomes extremely agitated before\nswitching to P in a path yielding a slow (20-50 ns) irregular increase of the\nconductance with variability.

Without\nexternal magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling leads to a simple renormalization\nof the hopping amplitude. However, when the degeneracy of the on-site energies\nis lifted by an external magnetic field, the interplay of Zeeman splitting and\nspin-orbit coupling has a strong effect on the localization length.

The gap narrowing largely results from fluctuations of\nlong-wavelength optical phonons---when the latter are present---or their\ndisordered analogs, if the material is amorphous. We elaborate on this notion\nto show that possibly with the exception of weakly bound solids made of\nclosed-shell atoms, the existence of an insulating gap or pseudo-gap in a\nperiodic solid implies that optical phonons must be present, too. This means\nthat in an insulating solid, the primitive cell must have at least two atoms\nand/or that a charge density wave is present.

A naturally\narising question is how to describe time evolution relative to quantum clocks\nand, specifically, how the dynamics relative to different quantum clocks are\nrelated. This is a pressing issue in view of the multiple choice problem of\ntime in quantum gravity, which posits that there is no distinguished choice of\ninternal clock in generic general relativistic systems and that different\nchoices lead to inequivalent quantum theories. Exploiting a recent approach to\nswitching quantum reference systems (arXiv:1809.00556, arXiv:1809:05093), we\nexhibit a systematic method for switching between different clock choices in\nthe quantum theory. We illustrate it by means of the parametrized particle,\nwhich, like gravity, features a Hamiltonian constraint. We explicitly switch\nbetween the quantum evolution relative to the non-relativistic time variable\nand that relative to the particle's position, which requires carefully\nregularizing the zero-modes in the so-called time-of-arrival observable. While\nthis toy model is simple, our approach is general and directly amenable to\nquantum cosmology. It proceeds by systematically linking the reduced quantum\ntheories relative to different clock choices via the clock-choice-neutral Dirac\nquantized theory, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold. This method\nsuggests a new perspective on the multiple choice problem, indicating that it\nis rather a multiple choice feature of a complete relational quantum theory,\ntaken as the conjunction of Dirac quantized and quantum deparametrized\ntheories. Precisely this conjunction permits one to consistently switch between\ndifferent temporal reference systems which is a prerequisite for a quantum\nnotion of general covariance. Finally, we show that quantum uncertainties lead\nto discontinuity in the relational dynamics when switching clocks. \n\n"}

The lattice\nconsists of a one-dimensional array of spinners with nearest neighbor coupling\nresulting from magnetic interactions. The distance between the spinners is\nspatially modulated to obtain a diatomic configuration, and to produce a\nnon-trivial interface by breaking spatial inversion symmetry. For small\namplitudes of motion, the interactions are approximately linear, and the system\nsupports topologically protected interface modes at frequencies inside the bulk\nbandgaps of the lattice.

We show that various qualitative\nproperties of these systems can be easily deduced from the transfer matrix. For\ninstance, the connection between the breakdown of the conventional\nbulk-boundary correspondence and the existence of a non-Hermitian skin effect,\npreviously observed numerically, is traced back to the transfer matrix having a\ndeterminant not equal to unity. The vanishing of this determinant signals\nreal-space exceptional points, whose order scales with the system size. We also\nderive previously proposed topological invariants such as the biorthogonal\npolarization and the Chern number computed on a complexified Brillouin zone.\nFinally, we define an invariant for and thereby clarify the meaning of\ntopologically protected boundary modes for non-Hermitian systems. \n\n"}

For both of these, it was already known\nthat the one-round classical and one-round quantum complexities are\ncharacterized by the chromatic number and orthogonal rank of a certain graph,\nrespectively.\n  In a promise equality problem, Alice and Bob must decide if their inputs are\nequal or not. We prove that classical protocols for such problems can always be\nreduced to one-round protocols with no extra communication. In contrast, we\ngive an explicit instance of a promise equality problem that exhibits an\nexponential gap between the one- and two-round exact quantum communication\ncomplexities. Whereas the chromatic number thus fully captures the complexity\nof promise equality problems, the hierarchy of \"quantum chromatic numbers\"\n(starting with the orthogonal rank) giving the quantum communication complexity\nfor every fixed number of communication rounds turns out to enjoy a much richer\nstructure.\n  In a list problem, Bob gets a subset of some finite universe, Alice gets an\nelement from Bob's subset, and their goal is for Bob to learn which element\nAlice was given.

Integrable cavities are not\ngoverned by single scales, but their non-generic behavior can also be obtained\nfrom semiclassical expansions (over isolated trajectories or families of\ntrajectories, depending on the system). The magnetic response of a\nmicrostructure is enhanced with respect to the bulk (Landau) susceptibility,\nand the semiclassical approach shows that this enhancement is the largest for\nintegrable geometries, due to the existence of families of periodic orbits. We\nshow how the semiclassical tool can be adapted to describe weak residual\ndisorder, as well as the effects of electron-electron interactions. The\ninteraction contribution to the magnetic susceptibility also depends on the\nnature of the classical dynamics of non-interacting electrons, and is\nparametrically larger in the case of integrable systems. \n\n"}

According to this geometrical view,\nthe metric in the particle world is ``contracted'' or ``stretched'' in an\ninverse proportion to the probability distribution. \n\n"}

A common pattern underpinning quantum algorithms can be\nidentified when quantum computation is viewed as multi-particle interference.\nWe use this approach to review (and improve) some of the existing quantum\nalgorithms and to show how they are related to different instances of quantum\nphase estimation. We provide an explicit algorithm for generating any\nprescribed interference pattern with an arbitrary precision. \n\n"}

With either of two distinct\napproaches, one obtains an exponential speed increase in comparison to the\nfastest known classical deterministic algorithms and a quadratic speed increase\nin comparison to classical Monte Carlo (probabilistic) methods. We derive a\nsimpler and slightly faster version of Grover's mean algorithm, demonstrate how\nto apply quantum counting to the problem, develop some variations of these\nalgorithms, and show how both (apparently quite different) approaches can be\nunderstood from the same unified framework. Finally, we discuss how the\nexponential speed increase appears to (but does not) violate results obtained\nvia the method of polynomials, from which it is known that a bounded-error\nquantum algorithm for computing a total function can be only polynomially more\nefficient than the fastest deterministic classical algorithm. \n\n"}
