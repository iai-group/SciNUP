Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star\nformation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and\nintracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses.

In the light of this we have\nre-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps,\nwhich have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the\nsignal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar\nproperties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of\nthe CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian\ntail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal.

We first suggest the independence\nof the two relations although they have been considered similar and dependent.\n  From this viewpoint, we compare constraints on cosmological parameters,\n$\\Omega_m$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$, from the Yonetoku and Amati relations\ncalibrated by low-redshift GRBs with $z < 1.8$. We found that they are\ndifferent in 1-$\\sigma$ level, although they are still consistent in 2-$\\sigma$\nlevel. This and the fact that both Amati and Yonetoku relations have systematic\nerrors larger than statistical errors suggest the existence of a hidden\nparameter of GRBs. We introduce the luminosity time $T_L$ defined by $T_L\\equiv\nE_{\\rm iso}/L_p$ as a hidden parameter to obtain a generalized Yonetoku\nrelation as $(L_p/{10^{52} \\rm{erg s^{-1}}}) =\n  10^{-3.88\\pm0.09}(E_p/{\\rm{keV}})^{1.84\\pm0.04}\n  (T_L/{\\rm{s}})^{-0.34\\pm0.04}$.

Abstract: We address the question of whether numerical particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations and laboratory laser-plasma experiments can (or will be able to, in\nthe near future) model realistic gamma-ray burst (GRB) shocks. For this, we\ncompare the radiative cooling time, t_cool, of relativistic electrons in the\nshock magnetic fields to the microscopic dynamical time of collisionless\nrelativistic shocks -- the inverse plasma frequency of protons, omega_pp^{-1}.\nWe obtain that for t_cool*omega_pp^{-1}\\lesssim ~few hundred, the electrons\ncool efficiently at or near the shock jump and are capable of emitiing away a\nlarge fraction of the shock energy. Such shocks are well-resolved in existing\nPIC simulations; therefore, the microscopic structure can be studied in detail.\nSince most of the emission in such shocks would be coming from the vicinity of\nthe shock, the spectral power of the emitted radiation can be directly obtained\nfrom finite-length simulations and compared with observational data. Such\nradiative shocks correspond to the internal baryon-dominated GRB shocks for the\nconventional range of ejecta parameters. Fermi acceleration of electrons in\nsuch shocks is limited by electron cooling, hence the emitted spectrum should\nbe lacking a non-thermal tail, whereas its peak likely falls in the multi-MeV\nrange. Incidentally, the conditions in internal shocks are almost identical to\nthose in laser-produced plasmas; thus, such GRB-like plasmas can be created and\nstudied in laboratory experiments using the presently available Petawatt-scale\nlaser facilities. An analysis of the external shocks shows that only the highly\nrelativistic shocks, corresponding to the extremely early afterglow phase, can\nhave efficient electron cooling in the shock transition.

We use AO assisted observations obtained at\nthe ESO VLT in the NIR H-band and 7 intermediate bands covering the NIR K-band.\nA comparison of the resulting SEDs with a blackbody of variable extinction then\nallows us to determine the presence and strength of a CO absorption feature to\ndistinguish between early and late type stars. The new method is suitable to\nclassify K giants (and later) as well as B2 main sequence (and earlier) stars\nwhich are brighter than 15.5 mag in the K band in the central parsec. Compared\nto previous spectroscopic investigations that are limited to 13-14 mag, this\nrepresents a major improvement in the depth of the observations as well as\nreducing the needed observation time. We classify 312 stars as early type\ncandidates out of a sample of 5914 sources. The distribution of the early type\nstars can be fitted with a steep power law (beta(R>1'') = -1.49 +/- 0.12,\nalternatively with a broken power law, beta(R=1-10'') = -1.08 +/- 0.12,\nbeta(R=10-20'') = -3.46 +/- 0.58, since we find a drop of the early type\ndensity at ~10'').

Such predictions are\nfrequently compared to the spectral energy distributions of observed galaxies\nvia the stellar population synthesis (SPS) technique. Substantial uncertainties\nin SPS exist, and yet their relevance to the task of comparing galaxy evolution\nmodels to observations has received little attention. In the present work we\nbegin to address this issue by investigating the importance of uncertainties in\nstellar evolution, the initial stellar mass function (IMF), and dust and\ninterstellar medium (ISM) properties on the translation from models to\nobservations. We demonstrate that these uncertainties translate into\nsubstantial uncertainties in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared colors\nof synthetic galaxies.

We detect\nseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [NII]/Halpha,\n[SII]/Halpha and [OII]/[OIII] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line\nregions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies\nactive star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR.

Abstract: Double-peaked [O III]5007, profiles in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may\nprovide evidence for the existence of dual AGNs, but a good diagnostic for\nselecting them is currently lacking. Starting from $\\sim$ 7000 active galaxies\nin SDSS DR7, we assemble a sample of 87 type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [O\nIII]5007, profiles. The nuclear obscuration in the type 2 AGNs allows us to\ndetermine redshifts of host galaxies through stellar absorption lines. We\ntypically find that one peak is redshifted and another is blueshifted relative\nto the host galaxy. We find a strong correlation between the ratios of the\nshifts and the double peak fluxes. The correlation can be naturally explained\nby the Keplerian relation predicted by models of co-rotating dual AGNs. The\ncurrent sample statistically favors that most of the [O III] double-peaked\nsources are dual AGNs and disfavors other explanations, such as rotating disk\nand outflows.

The\nsimulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly\nconsistent with observations until z $\\sim$ 0.5, and a steady evolution of the\nuniversal neutral hydrogen fraction ($\\Omega_{\\rm H I}$). At z=0, about 40% of\nthe baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals\n(80%-90%) are locked in stars.

The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5.

However, a number of recent studies have emphasized\ninaccuracies of SPH in the treatment of fluid instabilities. The origin of\nthese numerical problems can be traced back to spurious surface effects across\ncontact discontinuities, and to SPH's inherent prevention of mixing at the\nparticle level.

After the decoupling the Jeans mechanism fragments all matter in\nclumps of ca 40,000 solar masses. Each of them fragments due to viscosity in\nmillibrown dwarfs of earth weight, so each Jeans cluster contains billions of\nthem. The Jeans clusters act as ideal gas particles in the isothermal model,\nexplaining the flattening of rotation curves. The first stars in old globular\nclusters are formed by aggregation of milli brown dwarfs, without dark period.\nStar formation also happens when Jean clusters come close to each other and\nagitate and heat up the cooled milli brown dwarfs, which then expand and\ncoalesce to form new stars. This explains the Tully-Fischer and Jackson-Faber\nrelations, and the formation of young globular clusters in galaxy mergers.\nThousand of milli brown dwarfs have been observed in quasar microlensing and\nsome 40,000 in the Helix planetary nebula.\n  While the milli brown dwarfs, i.e., dark baryons, constitute the galactic\ndark matter, cluster dark matter consists probably of 1.5 eV neutrinos, free\nstreaming at the decoupling. These two types of dark matter explain a wealth of\nobservations. \n\n"}

The bulk of the dust in our\nsimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 K, similar to that of\nnearby molecular clouds.

Abstract: We compare accretion and black hole spin as potential energy sources for\noutbursts from AGN in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Based on our adopted\nspin model, we find that the distribution of AGN power estimated from X-ray\ncavities is consistent with a broad range of both spin parameter and accretion\nrate. Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to\npower their AGN by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN\npower and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a\ngiven AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the\nfraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN,\nboth vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in\nBCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus\nby the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot\natmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGN, unless their black holes\nare more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. We identify several\npowerful AGN that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating an\nunusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their AGN are powered by another\nmechanism. If these systems are powered primarily by black hole spin, rather\nthan by accretion, spin must also be tapped efficiently in some systems, i.e.,\n$P_{\\rm jet} > \\dot Mc^2$, or their black hole masses must be substantially\nlarger than the values implied by their bulge luminosities. We constrain the\n(model dependent) accretion rate at the transition from radiatively inefficient\nto radiatively efficient accretion flows to be a few percent of the Eddington\nrate, a value that is consistent with other estimates. \n\n"}

The geometrical structure of the\nmodel consists of two wedge-like regions of relativistically flowing gas,\nseparated by a stationary shock. The dynamics is based on solutions of\nrelativistic magnetic reconnection with a guide field from Lyubarsky (2005).\nElectron distributions in each region are chosen to the match the pressure and\ndensity of the local plasma.

Radiative\neffects on plasma are taken into account, including the dependence of pressure\non electron radiative losses and adiabatic heating of the flow decelerating\nunder Compton drag.

With a detection limit\nof L_X = 1E37 erg/s and a field of view covering a galactocentric radius of ~30\nkpc (11.5 arcminute), 383 sources are detected. Cross-correlation with Spitler\net al.'s catalogue of Sombrero globular clusters (GCs) identified from HST/ACS\nobservations reveals 41 X-rays sources in GCs, presumably low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). We quantify the differential luminosity functions (LFs) for\nboth the detected GC and field LMXBs, whose power-low indices (~1.1 for the\nGC-LF and ~1.6 for field-LF) are consistent with previous studies for\nelliptical galaxies. With precise sky positions of the GCs without a detected\nX-ray source, we further quantify, through a fluctuation analysis, the GC LF at\nfainter luminosities down to 1E35 erg/s. The derived index rules out a\nfaint-end slope flatter than 1.1 at a 2 sigma significance, contrary to recent\nfindings in several elliptical galaxies and the bulge of M31.

X-ray\nobservations indicate the presence of either high temperature gas or\nnon-thermal emission in the region of the relic. We find evidence for a weak\nelliptical X-ray surface brightness edge surrounding the core, consistent with\na sloshing cold front. The plume is consistent with having formed due to uplift\nby a buoyantly rising radio bubble, now seen as the radio relic. Our results\nare inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the X-ray wings formed due\nto the passage of a weak shock through the cool core. We instead conclude that\nthe wings are due to X-ray cavities formed by gas displacement by the radio\nrelic. The central cD galaxy contains two small-scale cold gas clumps that are\nslightly offset from their optical and UV counterparts, suggestive of a\ngalaxy-galaxy merger event.

An abundance matching technique is used\nto link galaxy luminosity to the host halo mass. The shape of the mass - light\nrelation at 60 micron is different from those derived at r-, K- and B-band.\nThis is because the 60 micron LF can not be fitted by a Schechter function with\na sharp exponential cutoff.

We demonstrate that if weak, Solar-like winds\nare launched from low-mass Pop III stars formed in the progenitors of the dark\nmatter halo of the Galaxy, then such stars are likely to avoid significant\nenrichment via accretion of material from the interstellar medium. We find that\nat early times accretion is easily prevented if the stars are ejected from the\ncentral regions of the haloes in which they form, either by dynamical\ninteractions with more massive Pop III stars, or by violent relaxation during\nhalo mergers. While accretion may still take place during passage through\nsufficiently dense molecular clouds at later times, we find that the\nprobability of such a passage is generally low (< 0.1), assuming that stars\nhave velocities of order the maximum circular velocity of their host haloes and\naccounting for the orbital decay of merging haloes.

I begin with a brief overview of the\n\"standard model\" of CV evolution and explain why the key observables this model\nis designed to explain - the period gap and the period minimum -- are\nintimately connected to the properties of the secondary stars in these systems.\nCV donors are expected to be slightly inflated relative to isolated, equal-mass\nmain-sequence (MS) stars, and this \"donor bloating\" has now been confirmed\nobservationally. The empirical donor mass-radius relationship also shows a\ndiscontinuity at M_2 = 0.2 M_sun which neatly separates long- and short-period\nCVs. This is strong confirmation of the basic disrupted magnetic braking\nscenario for CV evolution. The empirical M_2-R_2 relation can be combined with\nstellar models to construct a complete, semi-empirical donor sequence for CVs.\nThis sequence provides all physical and photometric properties of \"normal\" CV\nsecondaries along the standard CV evolution track. The observed donor\nproperties can also be used to reconstruct the complete evolution track\nfollowed by CVs, i.e. the mass-transfer rate and angular-momentum-loss rate as\na function of orbital period.

As the gas streams into minihalos with bulk\nvelocities around 1 km / s at z ~ 20, the additional momentum and energy input\nreduces the gas fractions and central densities of the halos, increasing the\ntypical virial mass required for efficient cooling by a factor of three, and\ndelaying Population III star formation by dz ~ 4. Since the distribution of the\nmagnitude of the streaming velocities is narrowly peaked around a\nnon-negligible value, this effect is important in most regions of the universe.\nAs a consequence, the increased minimum halo mass implies a reduction of the\nabsolute number of minihalos that can be expected to cool and form Population\nIII stars by up to an order of magnitude.

Most analytic\nexpressions for these distributions ignore the fact that, although different\nk-modes in the initial Gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is not true in\nreal space: the values of the density field at a given spatial position, when\nsmoothed on different real-space scales, are correlated in a nontrivial way. As\na result, the problem is to estimate first crossing distribution by random\nwalks having correlated rather than uncorrelated steps. In 1990, Peacock &\nHeavens presented a simple approximation for the first crossing distribution of\na single barrier of constant height by walks with correlated steps.

The lognormal behavior of the Npdf has been interpreted in terms of\nturbulent motions dominating the dynamics of the clouds, while the power-law\nbehavior occurs when the cloud is dominated by gravity.

There is tentative evidence that downsizing also\nmanifests itself in the active BHMF, and the BH mass density in broad-line\nquasars contributes an insignificant amount to the total BH mass density at all\ntimes. Within our model uncertainties, we do not find a strong BH mass\ndependence of the mean Eddington ratio; but there is evidence that the mean\nEddington ratio (at fixed BH mass) increases with redshift. \n\n"}

The cool-core\nclusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some\ncooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is\nlocally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using\nhigh-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of\nmultiphase gas in cluster cores heated by highly-collimated bipolar AGN jets.\nOur key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only\nwhen the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall\ntimescales (t_TI/t_ff) falls below a critical threshold of \\approx 10. When\nthis happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot ICM phase and generates\ninhomogeneous and spatially extended Halpha filaments. These cold gas clumps\nand filaments `rain' down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold\nrotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently,\nthe self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a\nhigher entropy level with t_TI/t_ff > 10. Eventually the core reaches\nquasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the\nhot ICM whenever t_TI/t_ff \\lesssim 10. This occurs despite the fact that the\nenergy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion.\nThe effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the\nturbulent motions in the wake of freely-falling cold filaments. Increased AGN\nactivity can locally reverse the cold gas flow, launching cold filamentary gas\naway from the cluster center. Our criterion for the condensation of spatially\nextended cold gas is in agreement with observations and previous idealized\nsimulations. \n\n"}

With its ~100km size, Lutetia is one\nof the largest asteroids ever imaged by a spacecraft. During the flyby, the\non-board OSIRIS imaging system acquired spectacular images of Lutetia's\nnorthern hemisphere revealing a complex surface scarred by numerous impact\ncraters, reaching the maximum dimension of about 55km. In this paper, we assess\nthe cratering history of the asteroid. For this purpose, we apply current\nmodels describing the formation and evolution of main belt asteroids, that\nprovide the rate and velocity distributions of impactors. These models, coupled\nwith appropriate crater scaling laws, allow us to interpret the observed crater\nsize-frequency distribution (SFD) and constrain the cratering history. Thanks\nto this approach, we derive the crater retention age of several regions on\nLutetia, namely the time lapsed since their formation or global surface reset.\nWe also investigate the influence of various factors -like Lutetia's bulk\nstructure and crater obliteration- on the observed crater SFDs and the\nestimated surface ages. From our analysis, it emerges that Lutetia underwent a\ncomplex collisional evolution, involving major local resurfacing events till\nrecent times. The difference in crater density between the youngest and oldest\nrecognized units implies a difference in age of more than a factor of 10.

We\ncombine the population synthesis code Starburst99 with a semi-analytical model\nof galactic outflows and a model for the distribution and abundances of\nchemical elements inside the outflows. Starting with a galaxy mass, formation\nredshift, and adopting a particular form for the star formation rate, we\ndescribe the evolution of the stellar populations in the galaxy, the evolution\nof the metallicity and chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nthe propagation of the galactic wind, and the metal-enrichment of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind. We conclude that the history\nof the ISM enrichment plays a determinant role in the chemical composition and\nextent of the galactic wind, and therefore its ability to enrich the IGM. \n\n"}

To\naddress this, we propose a definition of galaxy independent of the cold dark\nmatter model of the universe: A galaxy is a gravitationally bound set of stars\nwhose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and Newton's\nlaws of gravity. After exploring observational diagnostics of this definition,\nwe examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters,\nultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. While kinematic studies provide an\neffective galaxy diagnostic in many regimes, they can be less useful for\ncompact or faint systems. To explore the use of [Fe/H] spread as a\ncomplementary diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of\n16 Milky Way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to calculate their [Fe/H] spreads\nand uncertainties. Our principal results are: (i) no old star cluster less\nluminous then M_V = -10 has a significant (> 0.1 dex) spread in iron; (ii)\nknown ultra-faint dwarfs can be classified with a combination of kinematics and\n[Fe/H]; (iii) the observed [Fe/H] spreads in massive (> 10^6 M_Sun) globular\nclusters do not necessarily imply they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor a\nneed for dark matter; and (iv) if ultra-compact dwarfs reside in dark matter\nhalos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, then\nthey will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter.

Abstract: The fraction of compact active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that exhibit\ninterstellar scintillation (ISS) at radio wavelengths, as well as their\nscintillation amplitudes, have been found to decrease significantly for sources\nat redshifts z > 2. This can be attributed to an increase in the angular sizes\nof the \\muas-scale cores or a decrease in the flux densities of the compact\n\\muas cores relative to that of the mas-scale components with increasing\nredshift, possibly arising from (1) the space-time curvature of an expanding\nUniverse, (2) AGN evolution, (3) source selection biases, (4) scatter\nbroadening in the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening galaxies,\nor (5) gravitational lensing. We examine the frequency scaling of this redshift\ndependence of ISS to determine its origin, using data from a dual-frequency\nsurvey of ISS of 128 sources at 0 < z < 4. We present a novel method of\nanalysis which accounts for selection effects in the source sample. We\ndetermine that the redshift dependence of ISS is partially linked to the\nsteepening of source spectral indices ({\\alpha}^8.4_4.9) with redshift, caused\neither by selection biases or AGN evolution, coupled with weaker ISS in the\n{\\alpha}^8.4_4.9 < -0.4 sources.

In this paper we incorporate a semi-analytical model of galaxy\nformation based on the Millennium II N-body simulation into the semi-numerical\nmodeling of reionization. The semi-analytical model is used to predict the\nproduction of ionizing photons, then we use the semi-numerical method to model\nthe reionization process. Such an approach allows more detailed modeling of the\nreionization, and also connects observations of galaxies at low and high\nredshifts to the reionization history. The galaxy formation model we use was\ndesigned to match the low-$z$ observations, and it also fits the high redshift\nluminosity function reasonably well, but its prediction on the star formation\nfalls below the observed value, and we find that it also underpredicts the\nstellar ionizing photon production rate, hence the reionization can not be\ncompleted at $z \\sim 6$ without taking into account some other potential\nsources of ionization photons.

We argue that a reasonable analogue\nto early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes\nthat experienced strong mass loss, or alternatively those that have spent a\nlong time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed\nmorphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters,\nand thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day\nlate types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to\nwhat the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts\nabove two.

Firstly we find that the luminosity of\nthe [O III] wing component (Lwing) correlates more tightly with the continuum\nluminosity (L5100) than the luminosity of the line core component (Lcore) does,\nwhich is in line with our previous conclusion that the wing component,\ngenerally blueshifted, originates from the polar outflows in the inner\nnarrow-line region (NLR).

This ripple effect could be unambiguously\ndetectable and allow an electromagnetic monitoring of massive black hole\nmergers as they occur. As the mass ratio of the secondary to primary black hole\nincreases to q>0.01, we expect the gap to widen, possibly clearing a central\ncavity in the inner disk, which shows up in the broad FeKa line component. If\nthe secondary stalls at >100r_{g} in its in-migration, due to low co-rotating\ngas mass, a detectable ripple effect occurs in the broad line component on the\ndisk viscous timescale as the inner disk drains and the outer disk is dammed.\nIf the secondary maintains an accretion disk within a central cavity, due to\ndam bursting or leakage, a periodic 'see-saw' oscillation effect is exhibited\nin the observed line profile. Here we demonstrate the range of ripple effect\nsignatures potentially detectable with Astro-H and IXO/Athena, and oscillation\neffects potentially detectable with XMM or LOFT for a wide variety of merger\nand disk conditions.

We compare\nour view of gas flows in M51 -- which arise due to departures from axi-symmetry\nin the gravitational potential (i.e. the nuclear bar and spiral arms) -- with\nthe global pattern of star formation as traced by Halpha and 24\\mu m emission.\nWe find that the dynamical environment of GMCs strongly affects their ability\nto form stars, in the sense that GMCs situated in regions with large streaming\nmotions can be stabilized, while similarly massive GMCs in regions without\nstreaming go on to efficiently form stars. We argue that this is the result of\nreduced surface pressure felt by clouds embedded in an ambient medium\nundergoing large streaming motions, which prevents collapse.

The example of M51 shows that streaming\nmotions, triggered by gravitational instabilities in the form of bars and\nspiral arms, can alter the star formation law; this can explain the variation\nin gas depletion time among galaxies with different masses and morphologies. In\nparticular, we can explain the long gas depletion times in spiral galaxies\ncompared to dwarf galaxies and starbursts.

However, this assumption seems invalid in BLR models that\nconsists of an accretion disk and its wind. The disk is likely Keplerian and\ntherefore virialized. However, the wind material must, beyond a certain point,\nbe dominated by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. Here, we\nanalyze hydrodynamic simulations of four different disk winds: an isothermal\nwind, a thermal wind from an X-ray heated disk, and two line-driven winds, one\nwith and the other without X-ray heating and cooling. For each model, we check\nwhether gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing the\nvolume-integrated quantities that appear in the virial theorem: internal,\nkinetic, and gravitational energies, We find that in the first two models, the\nwinds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are virialized\nup to a relatively large distance. The line-driven winds are virialized because\nthey accelerate slowly so that the rotational velocity is dominant and the wind\nbase is very dense.

Improved\n  power spectrum determination and map-making Abstract: The existence of galaxy intrinsic clustering severely hampers the weak\nlensing reconstruction from cosmic magnification.

By utilizing\nthe different dependences of cosmic magnification and galaxy intrinsic\nclustering on galaxy flux, we demonstrated that the otherwise overwhelming\ngalaxy intrinsic clustering can be significantly suppressed such that lensing\nmaps can be reconstructed with promising accuracy. This procedure relies\nheavily on the accuracy of determining the galaxy bias from the same data.\nPaper I adopts an iterative approach, which degrades toward high redshift. The\ncurrent paper presents an alternative method, improving over paper I. We prove\nthat the measured galaxy clustering between flux bins allows for simultaneous\ndetermination of the lensing power spectrum and the flux dependence of galaxy\nbias, at this redshift bin. Comparing to paper I, the new approach is not only\nmore straightforward, but also more robust. It identifies an ambiguity in\ndetermining the galaxy bias and further discovers a mathematically robust way\nto suppress this ambiguity to non-negligible level ($\\sim 0.1%$). The\naccurately determined galaxy bias can then be applied to the minimal variance\nestimator proposed in paper I to improve the lensing map-making. The gain at\nhigh redshift is significant. These maps can be used to measure other\nstatistics, such as cluster finding and peak statistics. Furthermore, by\nincluding galaxy clustering measurement between different redshift bins, we can\nalso determine the lensing cross power spectrum between these bins, up to a\nsmall and correctable multiplicative factor. \n\n"}

We focus on Union2 and\nSNLS3 SNIa datasets and use the hemispherical comparison method to detect\npossible anisotropic features. Unlike some previous works where non-diagonal\nelements of the covariance matrix were neglected, we use the full covariance\nmatrix of the SNIa data, thus obtaining more realistic and not underestimated\nerrors. As a matter of fact, the significance of previously claimed detections\nof a preferred direction in the Union2 dataset completely disappears once we\ninclude the effects of using the full covariance matrix. Moreover, we also find\nthat such a a preferred direction is aligned with the orthogonal direction of\nthe SDSS observational plane and this suggests a clear indication that the SDSS\nsubsample of the Union2 dataset introduces a significant biased, making the\ndetected preferred direction unphysical. We thus find that current SNIa surveys\nare inappropriate to test anisotropic features due to their highly\nnon-homogeneous angular distribution in the sky.

Abstract: Using idealized 1-D Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations, we contrast the\nbehavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple,\ncollocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc. We show that isolated\nsupernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by a Myr, but\nsuperbubbles can retain up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of the input energy in form of\nmechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster (few 10s of Myr).

While radial\nvelocity structures are commonly assumed to be associated with non-axisymmetric\ncomponents of the potential such as spiral arms or bars, non-zero vertical\nvelocity structures are usually attributed to excitations by external sources\nsuch as a passing satellite galaxy or a small dark matter substructure crossing\nthe Galactic disc.

Those with a more massive\ncomponent filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the\nRoche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes\nthat, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor),\nmass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of\nmass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show\nthat the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive\ncomponent (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the\nvalue determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge\nsticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical)\nmass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting\nfrom the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why\nwe observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to\npredictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the\nThermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass\nequalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with\nthis phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are\ncomparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27\nSD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both\ntypes of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer.

We give independent\nestimates of the dust polarization signal in the BICEP2 region using four\ndifferent approaches. While these approaches are consistent with each other,\nthe expected amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum remains\nuncertain by about a factor of three. The lower end of the prediction leaves\nroom for a primordial contribution, but at the higher end the dust in\ncombination with the standard CMB lensing signal could account for the BICEP2\nobservations, without requiring the existence of primordial gravitational\nwaves.

The SFR in turn can be used to make a host of predictions\nconcerning the ionization history of the Universe, the chemical abundances, and\nsupernova rates. We compare the predictions made using a hierarchical model of\ncosmic chemical evolution based on three recently proposed SFRs: two based on\nextracting the SFR from the observed gamma-ray burst rate at high redshift, and\none based on the observed galaxy luminosity function at high redshift. Using\nthe WMAP/Planck data on the optical depth and epoch of reionization, we find\nthat only the SFR inferred from gamma-ray burst data at high redshift suffices\nto allow a single mode (in the initial mass function) of star formation which\nextends from z = 0 to redshifts > 10. For the case of the more conservative SFR\nbased on the observed galaxy luminosity function, the reionization history of\nthe Universe requires a bimodal IMF which includes at least a coeval high (or\nintermediate) mass mode of star formation at high redshift (z> 10).

The early brightening can be observed when the observer is in the\ndirection of the hole created by the collision.

We find that 0.19% of\ncore-collapse supernova light curves can be observed with the collisional\nbrightening. Type Ibc supernova light curves are more likely to be brightened\nby the collision (0.53%) because of the high fraction of the progenitors being\nin binary systems and their proximity to the companion stars.

We apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellar\nmass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, and\nmass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our target\ngalaxies. To study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individual\nradial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. We confirm that\nmore massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and less\nreddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved\nspatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these\nrelations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact,\nolder, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching is\nrelated to morphology, but not driven by mass. Negative gradients of ages are\nconsistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest ages\ngradients in Sb-Sbc galaxies. Further, the mean stellar ages of disks and\nbulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late type\nspirals hosting younger disks. The gradients in stellar mass surface density\ndepend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are more\ncentrally concentrated.

In practice, to infer the reduced shear, weak\nlensing measures galaxy shapes, which are the consequence of both the intrinsic\nellipticity of the sources and of the integrated gravitational lensing effect\nalong the line of sight. Hence, a very large number of galaxies is required in\norder to average over their individual properties and to isolate the weak\nlensing cosmic shear signal. If this `shape noise' can be reduced, significant\nadvances in the power of a weak lensing surveys can be expected. This paper\ndescribes a general method for extracting the probability distributions of\nparameters from catalogues of data using Voronoi cells, which has several\napplications, and has synergies with Bayesian hierarchical modelling\napproaches. This allows us to construct a probability distribution for the\nvariance of the intrinsic ellipticity as a function of galaxy property using\nonly photometric data, allowing a reduction of shape noise. As a proof of\nconcept the method is applied to the CFHTLenS survey data.

Motivated by these\nobservations, people begun considering new inflationary models which may lead\nto statistical anisotropy. The simplest possible way to construct anisotropic\ninflation is to introduce vector fields. During the course of this thesis, we\nstudy models of anisotropic inflation and their observational implications such\nas power spectrum, bispectrum etc. Firstly we build a new model, which contains\nthe gauge field which breaks the conformal invariance while preserving the\ngauge invariance. We show that in these kind of models, there can be an\nattractor phase in the evolution of the system when the back-reaction of the\ngauge field becomes important in the evolution of the inflaton field. We then\nstudy the cosmological perturbation theory in these kind of models. More\nspecifically, we calculate the anisotropic corrections due to the presence of\nthe vector field. We then generalize the separate universe formalism to our\nanisotropic set up and use it in some specific examples of anisotropic\ninflation.

We place the galaxy on four different orbits in a\nVirgo-like cluster and evolve it for 10 Gyr. As a reference case we also evolve\nthe same model in isolation. Tidally induced bars form on all orbits soon after\nthe first pericenter passage and survive until the end of the evolution. They\nappear earlier, are stronger, longer and have lower pattern speeds for tighter\norbits. Only for the tightest orbit the properties of the bar are controlled by\nthe orientation of the tidal torque from the cluster at pericenters. The\nmechanism behind the formation of the bars is the angular momentum transfer\nfrom the galaxy stellar component to its halo.

The\nprimary focus is on the accretion rate of stars by the black hole (equivalent\nto their tidal disruption rate for black holes in the small to medium mass\nrange) and the eccentricity distribution of these stars. Our simulations vary\nnot only the particle number, but disc model (two models examined), spatial\nresolution at the centre (characterised by the numerical accretion radius) and\nsoftening length. The large parameter range and physically realistic modelling\nallow us for the first time to confidently extrapolate these results to real\ngalactic centres. While in a real galactic centre both particle number and\naccretion radius differ by a few orders of magnitude from our models, which are\nconstrained by numerical capability, we find that the stellar accretion rate\nconverges for models with N > 32k. The eccentricity distribution of accreted\nstars, however, does not converge. We find that there are two competing effects\nat work when improving the resolution: larger particle number leads to a\nsmaller fraction of stars accreted on nearly-circular orbits, while higher\nspatial resolution increases this fraction. We scale our simulations to some\nnearby galaxies and find that the expected boost in stellar accretion (or tidal\ndisruption, which could be observed as X-ray flares) in the presence of a gas\ndisc is about a factor of 10. Even with this boost, the accretion of mass from\nstars is still a factor of ~ 100 slower than the accretion of gas from the\ndisc. Thus, it seems accretion of stars is not a major contributor to black\nhole mass growth. \n\n"}

Here we show how the E- and B-mode powers depend on the\ndetailed properties of the fluctuations in the magnetized interstellar medium.\nThese fluctuations are classified into the slow, fast, and Alfv\\'en\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which are determined once the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic-field pressures is specified.

The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization\nfluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30\npc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not\ndescribed by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that\ndrives ISM turbulence.

Both sources\nhave also previously been observed within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV\n(SDSS) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey.\nWhile the MaNGA IFU maps probe the gas fields on galaxy-wide scales and show\nthat some regions are dominated by AGN ionization, the new Gemini IFU data zoom\ninto the centre with four times better spatial resolution. In the object with\nthe lower L_bol we find evidence of a young or stalled biconical AGN-driven\noutflow where none was obvious at the MaNGA resolution. In the object with the\nhigher L_bol we trace the large-scale biconical outflow into the nuclear region\nand connect the outflow from small to large scales. These observations suggest\nthat AGN luminosity and galaxy potential are crucial in shaping wind launching\nand propagation in low-luminosity AGN. The transition from small and young\noutflows to galaxy-wide feedback can only be understood by combining\nlarge-scale IFU data that trace the galaxy velocity field with higher\nresolution, small scale IFU maps. \n\n"}

A key question that will help to differentiate\nbetween models is whether UDGs have counterparts in lower-mass host haloes, and\nwhat their abundance as a function of halo mass is. In this study we extend our\nprevious study of UDGs in galaxy clusters to galaxy groups. We measure the\nabundance of UDGs in 325 spectroscopically-selected groups from the Galaxy And\nMass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We make use of the overlapping imaging from the\nESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), from which we can identify galaxies with mean\nsurface brightnesses within their effective radii down to ~25.5 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$ in the r-band. We are able to measure a significant overdensity\nof UDGs (with sizes r_eff > 1.5 kpc) in galaxy groups down to M200=10^12 Msun,\na regime where approximately only 1 in 10 groups contains a UDG that we can\ndetect.

We consider two cases. Our first is based on\nmeasurements of the volumetric SNe Ia rate and assumes we can obtain\nspectroscopic redshifts and light curves for varying fractions of objects that\nare detected pre-peak luminosity by LSST (some of which may be obtained by LSST\nitself and others which would require additional follow-up).

Using numerical simulations, we here demonstrate that star formation\ncan be severely suppressed in disk galaxies with their gas disks\ncounter-rotating with respect to their stellar disks. This new mechanism of\nstar formation suppression (or quenching) does not depend so strongly on model\nparameters of disk galaxies, such as bulge-to-disk- ratios and gas mass\nfractions. Such severe suppression of star formation is due largely to the\nsuppression of the gas density enhancing mechanism i.e spiral arm formation in\ndisk galaxies with counter-rotating gas. Our simulations also show that\nmolecular hydrogen and dust can be rather slowly consumed by star formation in\ndisk galaxies with counter-rotating gas disks (i.e., long gas depletion\ntimescale). Based on these results, we suggest that spiral and S0 galaxies with\ncounter-rotation can have rather low star formation rate for their gas\ndensities.

Abstract: The mass, accretion rate and formation time of dark matter haloes near\nproto-filaments (identified as saddle points of the potential) are analytically\npredicted using a conditional version of the excursion set approach in its\nso-called \"upcrossing\" approximation. The model predicts that at fixed mass,\nmass accretion rate and formation time vary with orientation and distance from\nthe saddle, demonstrating that assembly bias is indeed influenced by the tides\nimposed by the cosmic web. Starved, early forming haloes of smaller mass lie\npreferentially along the main axis of filaments, while more massive and younger\nhaloes are found closer to the nodes. Distinct gradients for distinct tracers\nsuch as typical mass and accretion rate occur because the saddle condition is\nanisotropic, and because the statistics of these observables depend on both the\nconditional means and their covariances. The theory is extended to other\ncritical points of the potential field. The response of the mass function to\nvariations of the matter density field (the so-called large scale bias) is\ncomputed, and its trend with accretion rate is shown to invert along the\nfilament.

Secular\nprocesses play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks strong spiral\nor bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual\nenrichment of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into\nstars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by\nthe feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment, and\nequilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous\ndisc and its descendent stars. The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little\nafter birth and provide a faithful snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at\nthe time of their formation. In this interpretation, the age-velocity\ndispersion relation would reflect the gradual thinning of the disc rather than\nthe importance of secular orbit scattering; the outward flaring of stars would\nresult from the gas disc flare rather than from radial migration; and vertical\ngradients would arise because the gas disc gradually thinned as it enriched.\nSuch radial and vertical trends might just reflect the evolving properties of\nthe parent gaseous disc, and are not necessarily the result of secular\nevolutionary processes. \n\n"}

The instantaneous\nmomentum boost initially increases as the outflow decelerates. However, it\nreaches a maximum of $\\approx$20, due to work done against the gravitational\npotential. The predicted time-averaged observational estimate of the molecular\noutflow momentum boost reaches a maximum of $\\approx1-2$, partly due to our\nassumed molecular fraction, 0.2, but also because the instantaneous and\nobservational, time-averaged definitions are not equivalent.

We\nshow that the bias is a multivariate function of halo properties that falls\ninto three regimes. For massive haloes, halo mass explains the majority of bias\nvariation. For early-forming haloes, bias depends sensitively on the recent\nmass accretion history. For low-mass and late-forming haloes, bias depends more\non the structure of a halo such as its shape and spin.

In which frequency bands and in which\nsky regions can it be identified?\n  Methods: Based on a well known result about the magnetic field alignment in\nsupernova explosions, a theoretical expectation is established that the loop\npolarizations should be predominantly E-mode. In particular, the expected\npolarization angles of Loop I are compared with those from the real microwave\nband data of WMAP and Planck.\n  Results and conclusions: The comparison between model and data shows\nremarkable consistency between data and expectation at all bands and for a\nlarge area of the sky. This result suggests that the polarized emission of\nGalactic Loop I is a major polarized component in all microwave bands from 23\nto 353 GHz, and a considerable part of the polarized foreground is likely\noriginated from a local bubble associated with Loop I, instead of the far more\ndistant Galactic emission. The result also provides a possible way to explain\nthe reported E-to-B excess~\\citep{2016A&A...586A.133P} by contribution of the\nloops.

In this work, we highlight a more severe, previously\nunrecognized shortcoming of ES models: the large-scale 21 cm power spectrum\n(equivalently, HI bias b_HI) is a relatively strong function of the spatial\nresolution used to generate ES ionization maps. We trace this problem to the\nfact that photon non-conservation in these models arises from a\nresolution-dependent mixture of spatially resolved, photon non-conserving\nbubbles, and partially ionized grid cells which are perfectly photon-conserving\nby construction. We argue that this inevitably leads to a resolution-dependence\nof b_HI, with the correct, converged value only emerging at very coarse\nresolution. Quantitatively, we find that b_HI can be non-converged by as much\nas ~20-25% in conservative ES implementations with grid sizes Delta x=5-10\ncMpc/h, even when photon non-conservation is as small as ~3-4%. Thus, although\nnumerically efficient, ES ionization maps coarse enough to produce a converged\nHI bias would wash out all topological features of the ionization field at\nscales k>~0.05 h/cMpc. We therefore present a new, explicitly photon conserving\n(PC) semi-numerical algorithm which distributes photons isotropically around\nsources while also accounting for anisotropic overlaps between nearby bubbles.\nOur PC algorithm predicts a resolution-independent value of b_HI consistent\nwith the result of low-resolution ES maps, thus serving as a useful compromise\nbetween standard ES implementations and more expensive radiative transfer\nsimulations. \n\n"}

We combine these approaches by\nconstructing a likelihood function conditioned on simulated and theoretical\ncovariances, consistently propagating noise from the finite number of\nsimulations and uncertainty in the theoretical model itself using an\ninformative Inverse-Wishart prior. Unlike standard methods, our approach allows\nthe required number of simulations to be less than the number of summary\nstatistics.

In this paper, we provide a minimal example for such a mechanism\nand show how the Planck mass can be dynamically generated in a strongly coupled\ngauge sector. We consider the case of hidden SU(N_c) gauge interactions that\nlink the Planck mass to the condensation of a scalar bilinear operator that is\nnonminimally coupled to curvature.

Under the assumption of an\ninitial Fe ([Fe/H] = -3) and O inventory due to the prompt production by the\nfirst very massive stars, the data at -3 < [Fe/H] < -1 are interpreted to\nresult from the addition of O and Fe only from type II supernovae (SNII) to the\nprompt inventory.

The new observations show\nthe bimodal color distribution of globular clusters more clearly, with peaks at\n(V-I)o = 0.95 and 1.17. The luminosity function (LF) of the blue, metal-poor\npopulation of clusters in NGC 3610 turns over, consistent with a Gaussian\ndistribution with a peak Mv ~= -7.0, similar to old globular-cluster\npopulations in ellipticals. The red, metal-rich population of clusters has a LF\nthat is more extended toward both the bright and faint ends, as expected for a\ncluster population of inter-mediate age. It is well fit by a power law with an\nexponent of alpha = -1.78 +-0.05, or -1.90+-0.07 when corrected for\nobservational scatter. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms the significant\ndifference between the LFs of the red and blue clusters, with a probability of\nless than 0.1% that they come from the same population. A comparison with the\nFall & Zhang cluster disruption models shows marginal agreement with the\nobserved LF, although there are differences in detail.

A by-product of\nthe analysis is the demonstration that, at any given metallicity, the peak of\nthe LF should remain nearly constant from 1.5 Gyr to 12 Gyr, since the effect\nof the disruption of faint clusters is almost perfectly balanced by the fading\nof the clusters.

Such a rapid increase with redshift in biasing\nimplies that quasars at z~2 cannot be the progenitors of modern L* objects,\nrather they must now reside in dense environments, such as clusters.

This approach complements the use of the early- to late-type host\ngalaxy ratio, with the added benefit that the star formation histories of\nearly-type galaxies are simpler than those of late-type galaxies, and any\nsystematic differences between progenitors in early- and late-type galaxies are\nremoved.

This means that\nspatially variable softening lengths can be used in N-body calculations without\nsecular increases in energy. The formalism requires the calculation of a small\nadditional term to the gravitational force related to the gradient of the\nsoftening length. The extra term is similar in form to the usual SPH pressure\nforce (although opposite in direction) and is therefore straightforward to\nimplement in any SPH code at almost no extra cost. For N-body codes some\nadditional cost is involved as the formalism requires the computation of the\ndensity via a summation over neighbouring particles using the smoothing kernel.\n  The results of numerical tests demonstrate that, for homogeneous mass\ndistributions, the use of adaptive softening lengths gives a softening which is\nalways close to the `optimal' choice of fixed softening parameter, removing the\nneed for fine-tuning.

We found that for most quasars a simple\nextrapolation of the far-UV powerlaw into the X-ray domain generally lies below\nthe X-ray data and that the big blue bump and the soft X-ray excess do not\nshare a common physical origin. We explore the issue of whether the observed\nSED might be dust absorbed in the far and near-UV. We fit the UV break,\nassuming a powerlaw that is absorbed by cubic nanodiamond dust grains. We then\nexplore the possibility of a universal SED (with a unique spectral index) by\nincluding further absorption from SMC-like extinction.

The hydrogen column densities\nrequired by either nanodiamonds or amorphous dust models are all consistent,\nexcept for one object, with the columns deduced by our X-ray analysis, provided\nthat the C depletion is ~0.6. Because dust absorption implies a flux recovery\nin the extreme UV (<700A), our modeling opens the possibility that the\nintrinsic quasar SED is much harder and more luminous in the extreme UV than\ninferred from the near-UV data, as required by photoionization models of the\nbroad emission line region.

Thermonuclear ignition of the accreted material in the\natmosphere of the neutron star leads to a thermonuclear explosion which is\nobserved as an X-ray burst occurring periodically between hours and days\ndepending on the accretion rate. The ignition conditions are characterized by a\nsensitive interplay between the accretion rate of the fuel supply and its\ndepletion rate by nuclear burning in the hot CNO cycle and the rp-process. For\naccretion rates close to stable burning the burst ignition therefore depends\ncritically on the hot CNO breakout reaction, O15(alpha,gamma)Ne19, that\nregulates the flow between the hot CNO cycle and the rapid proton capture\nprocess.

Emission from an accretion disk can reproduce the\ndouble-peaked line profile of broad H$\\alpha$, but not the radio structure.\nUnder the accretion disk model, the period of the inner emission line region is\nabout 230 years.

We show that if the inflaton is coupled to a massive particle,\nresonant production of the particle during inflation modifies the evolution of\nthe inflaton, and may leave an imprint in the form of sharp features in the\nprimordial power spectrum. Precision measurements of microwave background\nanisotropies and large-scale structure surveys could be sensitive to the\nfeatures, and probe the spectrum of particles as massive as the Planck scale. \n\n"}

I here develop further an algebraic approach to black hole\nquantization which starts from very elementary assumptions, and proceeds by\nexploiting symmetry. It predicts a uniformly spaced area spectrum for all\ncharges and angular momenta. Area eigenvalues are degenerate; correspondence\nwith black hole entropy then dictates a precise value for the interval between\neigenvalues. \n\n"}

The noncommutative scaling limit is explored to\ninvestigate a possible tunneling of an AdS vacuum in string theory to dS vacuum\nin its low energy gravity theory. The Hagedorn transition is invoked into its\nself-dual gauge theory to decouple the gauge nonlinearity from the dS geometry,\nwhich in turn is shown to describe a pure dS vacuum. \n\n"}

Thus, for the chargeless\ncases, they predict M=0. We show that General Theory of Relativity, too,\ndemands a unique BH mass M=0. And we do this by considering the problem from\nvarious angles, both mathematically and physically. Our analysis may be\nunderstandable even to the readers not having sufficient background in GTR.\nPhysically, this M=0 result means that, continued gravitational collapse indeed\ncontinues for infinite proper time as the system hopelessly tries to radiate\nits entire original mass energy to attain the lowest energy state M=0. Since no\nevent horizon is formed, the problem of loss of information associated with\ncreation of finite mass BHs or their evaporation ceases to exist. \n\n"}
