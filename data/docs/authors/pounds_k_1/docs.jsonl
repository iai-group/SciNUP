Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

No absorption features at\nnegative velocities strongly argue against the widely-used large distance of 19\nto 21 kpc for Kes 75, and show that Kes 75 is within the Solar circle, i.e. a\ndistance $d<$13.2 kpc.

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU. Therefore, a\nphysically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 K),\nlocated at 300 AU from the star and about 60 AU wide.

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs.

We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

In fact, the addition of a new contribution accounting for the\ngas can increase the statistical significance of the lensing model. We propose\na parametric method for strong lensing analyses which exploits multi-wavelength\nobservations.

First, giant stars\nwith planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich\nobjects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not\nvalid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant\nplanets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.\n  None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of\ngiant planet formation. We contend that they are galactic in nature, and\nprobably not linked to the formation process of giant planets. It is suggested\nthat the same dynamical effect, namely the migration of stars in the galactic\ndisk, is at the origin of both features, with the important consequence that\nmost metal-rich stars hosting giant planets originate from the inner disk, a\nproperty that has been largely neglected until now.

First, a\nkinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the\nmain features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)\nlate-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain\nthe observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively\nhigh density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a\nrelatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically\ndistributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the\ndirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the\nemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For\nthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the\nimplications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the\ncentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some\nlines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at\n4700A) will not show this effect.

The local skeleton is traced on the 2D\nsphere by cubic spline interpolation which leads to more accurate estimation of\nthe intersection positions between the skeleton and the secondary pixels than\nconventional linear interpolation. We demonstrate that the skeleton-based\nestimator of non-Gaussianity of the local type (f_NL) - the departure of the\nlength distribution from the corresponding Gaussian expectation - yields an\nunbiased and sufficiently converged f_NL-likelihood.\n  We analyse the skeleton statistics in the WMAP5 combined V- and W-band data\noutside the Galactic base-mask determined from the KQ75 sky-coverage.

We show that it is unlikely that the improved skeleton tracing\nmethod, the omission of Q-band data, the modification of the\nforeground-template fitting method or the absence of 6 extended regions in the\nnew mask contribute to such a deviation. However, the application of the Kp0\nbase-mask in data processing does improve the consistency with the WMAP1\nresults.\n  The f_NL-likelihoods of the data are estimated at 9 different smoothing\nlevels.

We combine cosmological\nsimulations of large scale structure formation with a detailed model of metal\nenrichment, in which outflows expand anisotropically along the direction of\nleast resistance, distributing metals into the IGM. The metals carried by the\noutflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near\nthe central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,\nwe performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven\noutflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM. We found that\nthe metallicity induced in the IGM is greatly dominated by AGNs having\nbolometric luminosity L > 10^9 L_sun, sources with 10^8 < L / L_sun < 10^9\nhaving a negligible contribution. Our simulations produced an average IGM\nmetallicity of [O/H] = -5 at z = 5.5, which then rises gradually, and remains\nrelatively flat at a value [O/H] = -2.8 between z = 2 and z = 0.

We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of\nMrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon\nindex of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with\nthe Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral\nvariability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy\nrange is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20. These unexpected\nspectral changes do not correlate with the measured flux variations above\n0.3GeV.

This is equivalent to\nprobing frequencies >1 kHz in a stellar mass (M_BH ~ 10 Msun) black hole binary\nsystem. The power spectrum is a featureless power law over the region of the\nexpected ISCO frequency, suggesting no strong enhancement or change in the\nvariability at the fastest orbital period in the system. Despite the huge\namplitude of the flux variations between the observations (peak-to-peak factor\nof >50) the power spectrum appears to be stationary in shape, and varies in\namplitude at all observed frequencies following the previously established\nlinear rms-flux relation. The rms-flux relation is offset in flux by a small\nand energy-dependent amount. The simplest interpretation of the offset is in\nterms of a very soft spectral component that is practically constant (compared\nto the primary source of variability).

Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs.

Apparent\n  Radii Abstract: The masses and radii of low-magnetic field neutron stars can be measured by\ncombining different observable quantities obtained from their X-ray spectra\nduring thermonuclear X-ray bursts. One of these quantities is the apparent\nradius of each neutron star as inferred from the X-ray flux and spectral\ntemperature measured during the cooling tails of bursts, when the thermonuclear\nflash is believed to have engulfed the entire star. In this paper, we analyze\n13,095 X-ray spectra of 446 X-ray bursts observed from 12 sources in order to\nassess possible systematic effects in the measurements of the apparent radii of\nneutron stars. We first show that the vast majority of the observed X-ray\nspectra are consistent with blackbody functions to within a few percent. We\nfind that most X-ray bursts follow a very well determined correlation between\nX-ray flux and temperature, which is consistent with the whole neutron-star\nsurface emitting uniformly during the cooling tails. We develop a Bayesian\nGaussian mixture algorithm to measure the apparent radii of the neutron stars\nin these sources, while detecting and excluding a small number of X-ray bursts\nthat show irregular cooling behavior. This algorithm also provides us with a\nquantitative measure of the systematic uncertainties in the measurements. We\nfind that those errors in the spectroscopic determination of neutron-star radii\nthat are introduced by systematic effects in the cooling tails of X-ray bursts\nare in the range $\\simeq 3-8$%. Such small errors are adequate to distinguish\nbetween different equations of state provided that uncertainties in the\ndistance to each source and the absolute calibration of X-ray detectors do not\ndominate the error budget. \n\n"}

The data are from our proper-motion (PM) survey of Kapteyn's\nSelected Areas, in which we have measured accurate PMs to faint magnitudes in\n40x40 arcmin fields evenly spaced across the sky. The radial velocity (RV)\nsignature of Sgr has been identified among our follow-up spectroscopic data in\nfour of the six fields and combined with mean PMs of\nspectroscopically-confirmed members to derive space motions of Sgr debris based\non 15-64 confirmed stream members per field. These kinematics are compared to\npredictions of the Law & Majewski (2010) model of Sgr disruption; we find\nreasonable agreement with model predictions in RVs and PMs along Galactic\nlatitude. However, an upward adjustment of the Local Standard of Rest velocity\nTheta_LSR from its standard 220 km/s to at least $232\\pm14$ km/s (and possibly\nas high as $264\\pm23$ km/s) is necessary to bring 3-D model debris kinematics\nand our measurements into agreement. Satisfactory model fits that\nsimultaneously reproduce known position, distance, and radial velocity trends\nof the Sgr tidal streams, while significantly increasing Theta_LSR}, could only\nbe achieved by increasing the Galactic bulge and disk mass while leaving the\ndark matter halo fixed to the best-fit values from Law & Majewski (2010).

The optimization is performed by\nminimizing several volume integrals which would vanish for an exact\nRobertson-Walker metric. Covariance is automatic. Foliation of space-time is\npart of the optimization procedure. Only the metric is involved in the\nprocedure, no assumptions about the origin of the energy-momentum tensor are\nneeded. A scale factor does not show up during the optimization process, the\noptimal scale factor is determined at the end. The general formulation is non\nperturbative. An explicit perturbative treatment is possible. The shifts which\nlead to the optimal coordinates obey Euler-Lagrange equations which are\nformulated and solved in first order of the perturbation. The extension to\nsecond order is sketched, but turns out to be unnecessary. The only freedom in\nthe choice of coordinates which finally remains are the rigid transformations\nwhich keep the form of the Robertson-Walker metric intact, i.e. translations in\nspace and time, spatial rotations, and spatial scaling.

Physical and kinematical\ndifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. At the R4 position, two\nvelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with the\ncomponent at higher velocity (R4-HV) being less extended and less dense than\nthe low velocity component (R4-LV).

The\nhydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,\nfocusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,\nusing the code \\textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a\nclumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual\nclumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter\ninto the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their\nsize divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump.

One of the key questions is how\nthese disks form so close to their host black holes and under what condition\nthey form stars in a tidally stressed environment.

This suggests that the majority of them either are not blazars\nor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. A\nsignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forming\ngalaxies.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$.

Assuming that the observed MIR\nemission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dusty\ntorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (as\ninferred from the declining fraction of obscured AGNs), the intrinsic disk\nluminosity, L_D, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the corona\nin the 2-300 keV energy band, L_C, with the L_D/L_C ratio varying by a factor\nof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6.

Four models are\nproposed, all based on the standard assumption that cores are randomly\norientated ellipsoids, and on the further assumption that a core's shape is not\ncorrelated with its absolute size. The first and simplest model, M1, has a\nsingle free parameter, and assumes that the relative axes of a core are drawn\nrandomly from a log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation\n\\sigma o. The second model, M2a, has two free parameters, and assumes that the\nlog-normal distribution (with standard deviation \\sigma o) has a finite mean,\n\\mu o, defined so that \\mu o<0 means elongated (prolate) cores are favoured,\nwhereas \\mu o>0 means flattened (oblate) cores are favoured.

Only\nthree confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters\n(GCs) of any galaxy so far, of which one nova and two SSSs (including the nova)\nwere found in M 31 GCs. To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a\nhigh-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and\nChandra. We analysed X-ray and optical data of a new transient X-ray source in\nthe M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations. Our\noptical data set was based on regular M 31 monitoring programmes from five\ndifferent small telescopes. Additionally, we made use of Pan-STARRS 1 data\nobtained during the PAndromeda survey. Our observations reveal that the X-ray\nsource in Bol 126 is the third SSS in an M 31 GC and can be confirmed as the\nsecond CN in the M 31 GC system. This nova is named M31N 2010-10f. Its\nproperties in the X-ray and optical regimes agree with a massive white dwarf\n(M_WD >~ 1.3 M_sun) in the binary system. Incorporating the data on previously\nfound (suspected) novae in M 31 GCs we used our high-cadence X-ray monitoring\nobservations to estimate a tentative nova rate in the M 31 GC system of 0.05\n/yr/GC. An optical estimate, based on the recent 10.5-year WeCAPP survey, gives\na lower nova rate, which is compatible with the X-ray rate on the 95%\nconfidence level. There is growing evidence that the nova rate in GCs is higher\nthan expected from primordial binary formation and under conditions as in the\nfield. Dynamical binary formation and/or additional accretion from the\nintracluster medium are possible scenarios for an increased nova rate, but\nobservational confirmation for this enhancement has been absent, so far.\nRegular X-ray monitoring observations of M 31 provide a promising strategy to\nfind these novae. \n\n"}

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio.

The challenge is to\nquantitatively determine the range of temperatures and species abundances\nallowed by the data.

A variety of temperature and abundance\nretrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous\ninvestigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation\nwe compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential\nEvolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo. We call our\nsuite of retrieval algorithms the Caltech Inverse Modeling and Retrieval\nAlgorithms (CHIMERA).

It has\nbeen found that most O-stars are multiples. HD 150 136 is the nearest system to\nEarth with >100 M_sol, and provides a unique opportunity to study an extremely\nmassive system. Recently, evidence for the existence of a third component in HD\n150 136, in addition to the tight spectroscopic binary that forms the main\ncomponent, was found in spectroscopic observations. Our aim was to image and\nobtain astrometric and photometric measurements of this component using long\nbaseline optical interferometry to further constrain the nature of this\ncomponent. We observed HD150136 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER\nattached to the ESO VLT Interferometer. The recovered closure phases are robust\nto systematic errors and provide unique information on the source asymmetry.\nTherefore, they are of crucial relevance for both image reconstruction and\nmodel fitting of the source structure. The third component in HD 150 136 is\nclearly detected in the high-quality data from AMBER. It is located at a\nprojected angular distance of 7.3 mas, or about 13 AU at the line-of-sight\ndistance of HD 150 136, at a position angle of 209 degrees East of North, and\nhas a flux ratio of 0.25 with respect to the inner binary. We resolved the\nthird component of HD 150 136 in J, H and K filters. The luminosity and color\nof the tertiary agrees with the predictions and shows that it is also an O\nmain-sequence star. The small measured angular separation indicates that the\ntertiary may be approaching the periastron of its orbit.

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This\nvariability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that\nreasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak\ncorrelations between SFR and L_AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the\ngeneral trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and\nmeasurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR.

Our statistical sample of 100\nFirst Stars show that the first generation of stars have a wide mass\ndistribution M_popIII = 10 ~ 1000 M_sun. We first run cosmological simulations\nto generate a set of primordial star-forming gas clouds. We then follow\nprotostar formation in each gas cloud and the subsequent protostellar evolution\nuntil the gas mass accretion onto the protostar is halted by stellar radiative\nfeedback. The accretion rates differ significantly among the primordial gas\nclouds which largely determine the final stellar masses. For low accretion\nrates the growth of a protostar is self-regulated by radiative feedback effects\nand the final mass is limited to several tens of solar masses. At high\naccretion rates the protostar's outer envelope continues to expand and the\neffective surface temperature remains low; such protostars do not exert strong\nradiative feedback and can grow in excess to one hundred solar masses. The\nobtained wide mass range suggests that the first stars play a variety of roles\nin the early universe, by triggering both core-collapse supernovae and\npair-instability supernovae as well as by leaving stellar mass black holes. We\nfind certain correlations between the final stellar mass and the physical\nproperties of the star-forming cloud.

This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational\nconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc)\nwhere the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are\nshaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess\nobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII\nregions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several\nstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared,\nradio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from\nthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized\ngas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas\ndominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have\ncomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The\nhot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures\nare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications\nof these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from\nthe HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed\nradiation to the warm gas.

The predicted SFR\ndensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellar\nmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. The model\npredicts a modest evolution of the HI density at z<3, which is also in\nagreement with the observations. The HI density is predicted to be always\ndominated by galaxies with SFR<1Msun/yr. This contrasts with the H2 density,\nwhich is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with SFR>10Msun/yr. Current\nhigh-redshift galaxy surveys are limited to detect carbon monoxide in galaxies\nwith SFR>30Msun/yr, which in our model make up, at most, 20% of the H2 in the\nuniverse.

One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the\nhybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a\npower series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the\nhybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable.

Abstract: Using idealized 1-D Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations, we contrast the\nbehavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple,\ncollocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc.

Results\n  from scaling the ISM opacity Abstract: The opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates the\naccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of\nplanets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3.

We demonstrate here that the\nunderlying hosts of BCDs are distinct from the broad continuum of typical dwarf\nirregular galaxies, and that it is unlikely that most dwarf irregular galaxies\ncan transform into a BCD or vice versa. Furthermore, we find that the starburst\nin a BCD only brightens it on average by ~0.8 mag (factor of two), in agreement\nwith other studies. It appears that a BCD is a long-lived and distinct type of\ndwarf galaxy that exhibits an exceptionally concentrated matter distribution.\nWe suggest that it is this compact mass distribution that enables the strong\nstar formation events that characterize this class of dwarf galaxy, that the\ncompactness of the underlying host can be used as a distinguishing parameter\nbetween BCDs and other dwarf galaxies, and that it can also be used to identify\nBCDs which are not currently experiencing an intense starburst event. \n\n"}

Focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmental\ncalibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to medium\nresolution spectroscopic surveys. Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures\non different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for\nsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is\nfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case\nthe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the\naperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an\nobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure\nand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is\nmost meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of\nenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on\nstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. With careful calibration,\nobservationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends in\nthe model. This result stands even with reduced redshift accuracy, provided the\nsample is deep enough to preserve a wide dynamic range of density. \n\n"}

We are able to fit all feedback models investigated at the\n5 per cent level using only two free parameters, and we place limits on the\nrange of these halo parameters for feedback models investigated by the OWLS\nsimulations. Accurate predictions to high-$k$ are vital for weak lensing\nsurveys, and these halo parameters could be considered nuisance parameters to\nmarginalize over in future analyses to mitigate uncertainty regarding the\ndetails of feedback. Finally, we investigate how lensing observables predicted\nby our model compare to those from simulations and from HALOFIT for a range of\n$k$-cuts and feedback models and quantify the angular scales at which these\neffects become important.

CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally\nclassified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to\nincrease the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering\nnew ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of\nAp, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and\nrelated stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and\ndata points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a\nlarger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude\nrange were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In\ntotal, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first\ntime, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability\npattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'. The new tools are demonstrated here with application to five\ngalaxies, chosen to be representative case-studies for several areas where this\ntechnique makes it possible to gain new scientific insight.

A\nwell-characterized stellar sample suggests at least two different relationships\nbetween rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long and\nshort cycles simultaneously.

A coaddition image that is optimal for any\n  purpose in the background dominated noise limit Abstract: Image coaddition is one of the most basic operations that astronomers\nperform. In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF. This\ncoaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a the\nmaximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the Fourier transform of the\nimage, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire Fourier domain is of\nequal variance. This method has important implications for multi-epoch\nseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and\ndiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations.

The search\nfor the signature of magnetic activity variability in solar-like pulsations\nstill remained unfruitful more than 2 years after the end of the nominal\nmission. Here, however, we report the discovery of temporal variability in the\nlow-degree acoustic frequencies of the young (1 Gyr-old) solar analog KIC\n10644253 with a modulation of about 1.5 years with significant temporal\nvariations along the duration of the Kepler observations. The variations are in\nagreement with the derived photometric activity. The frequency shifts extracted\nfor KIC 10644253 are shown to result from the same physical mechanisms involved\nin the inner sub-surface layers as in the Sun. In parallel, a detailed\nspectroscopic analysis of KIC 10644253 is performed based on complementary\nground-based, high-resolution observations collected by the HERMES instrument\nmounted on the MERCATOR telescope.

We suggest that advanced civilizations could cloak their\npresence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such\nemission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with\nrelatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent\nnature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from\nKepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array\nemitting a peak power of about 30 MW for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic\ncloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large\narray of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 MW.\nAlternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures\nassociated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is\nachievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 kW per transit. Finally,\nwe suggest that the time of transit for optical SETI is analogous to the\nwater-hole in radio SETI, providing a clear window in which observers may\nexpect to communicate.

The origin of the bars has\nremained as a long-standing problem -- what made bar formation possible in\ncertain S0s?\n  By analysing a large sample of S0s with classical bulges observed by the\nSpitzer space telescope, we find that most of our barred S0s host comparatively\nlow-mass classical bulges, typically with bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$) less\nthan $0.5$; whereas S0s with more massive classical bulges than these do not\nhost any bar. Furthermore, we find that amongst the barred S0s, there is a\ntrend for the longer and massive bars to be associated with comparatively\nbigger and massive classical bulges -- possibly suggesting bar growth being\nfacilitated by these classical bulges. In addition, we find that the bulge\neffective radius is always less than the bar effective radius --indicating an\ninteresting synergy between the host classical bulge and bars being maintained\nwhile bar growth occurred in these S0s. \n\n"}

Physical properties derived from spectral energy\n  distributions Abstract: We characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm-selected, flux-limited, and\ninterferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in COSMOS. We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support\nthe scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals. \n\n"}

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We\ndemonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy\ndepositions during the cosmic \"dark ages\".

In this paper, we focus on the subset of WIMP models in which the\ndark matter annihilates in the early universe through couplings to either the\nStandard Model $Z$ or the Standard Model Higgs boson.

Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects.

In total, this survey has resulted in the discovery of\n17 new gamma-ray pulsars, of which 13 are newly reported in this work, and an\naccompanying paper. These pulsars are all young, isolated pulsars with\ncharacteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between\n$10^{34}$ and $4\\times10^{36}$ erg/s.

We focus\non large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales,\nthe clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion,\nand the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of\ncoefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set\nformalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias\nparameters.

In fact, the detection of such a\nrelic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nperiod, an epoch from which we have no data, and could even hint at\ninflationary physics.

The density structure within\nthe Bondi radius is therefore consistent with steady inflows perpendicular to\nthe jet axis and an outflow directed E along the jet axis. By putting limits on\nthe radial flow speed, we rule out Bondi accretion on the scale resolved at the\nBondi radius. We show that deprojected spectra extracted within the Bondi\nradius can be equivalently fit with only a single cooling flow model, where gas\ncools from 1.5 keV down below 0.1 keV at a rate of 0.03 M$_{\\odot}$/yr. For the\nalternative multi-temperature spectral fits, the emission measures for each\ntemperature component are also consistent with a cooling flow model. The lowest\ntemperature and most rapidly cooling gas in M87 is therefore located at the\nsmallest radii at ~100 pc and may form a mini cooling flow. If this cooling gas\nhas some angular momentum, it will feed into the cold gas disk around the\nnucleus, which has a radius of ~80 pc and therefore lies just inside the\nobserved transition in the hot gas structure. \n\n"}

Here, we present the chemical\nmodeling of glycine in hot cores using the state-of-the-art three-phase\nchemical model NAUTILUS, which is focused on the latest glycine chemistry. For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

Machine learning is a promising solution, allowing the development\nof algorithms tailored to specific telescope arrays and science cases. We\npresent DeepSource - a deep learning solution - that uses convolutional neural\nnetworks to achieve these goals. DeepSource enhances the Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n(SNR) of the original map and then uses dynamic blob detection to detect\nsources. Trained and tested on two sets of 500 simulated 1 deg x 1 deg MeerKAT\nimages with a total of 300,000 sources, DeepSource is essentially perfect in\nboth purity and completeness down to SNR = 4 and outperforms PyBDSF in all\nmetrics. For uniformly-weighted images it achieves a Purity x Completeness (PC)\nscore at SNR = 3 of 0.73, compared to 0.31 for the best PyBDSF model. For\nnatural-weighting we find a smaller improvement of ~40% in the PC score at SNR\n= 3. If instead we ask where either of the purity or completeness first drop to\n90%, we find that DeepSource reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the\n4.3 of PyBDSF (natural-weighting). A key advantage of DeepSource is that it can\nlearn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under\nconsideration.

For a reasonable choice of parameters, thermal inflation\nmodels naturally predict a suppression of the matter power spectrum on galactic\nand sub-galactic scales, mimicking the effect of warm or interacting dark\nmatter. Matter power spectra in these models are also characterised by an\nexcess of power (w.r.t. the standard $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum) just below\nthe suppression scale. By running a suite of N-body simulations we investigate\nthe non-linear growth of structure in models of thermal inflation. We measure\nthe non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the\nhalo mass function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and in other models with damped matter\nfluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered here produce\nmeasurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\\Lambda$CDM at\nredshifts $z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all\nredshifts. The halo mass function at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an\nenhancement of around $\\sim 20\\%$ w.r.t. $\\Lambda$CDM and a damping at lower\nhalo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of the\nfree parameter in the model.

Furthermore, these\ntransits will also probe the distribution of stellar activity across a star's\nsurface, and will help scrub out contamination from stellar activity on\nexoplanet transmission spectra and radial velocity spectra. This radio window\non exoplanets and their host stars is therefore a valuable complement to\nexisting optical tools. \n\n"}

They are, however, promising candidates for\nthe progenitors of the heaviest binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected. If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution. For this, we have\ncomputed a set of models of metal-poor ($Z_\\odot/10$) single helium stars using\nthe \\texttt{MESA} software instrument. For PPISN progenitors with pre-pulse\nmasses $>50M_\\odot$ we find that, after a pulse, heat deposited throughout the\nlayers of the star that remain bound cause it to expand to more than\n$100R_\\odot$ for periods of $10^2-10^4\\;$~yrs depending on the mass of the\nprogenitor. This results in long-lived phases of Roche-lobe overflow or even\ncommon-envelope events if there is a close binary companion, leading to\nadditional electromagnetic transients associated to PPISN eruptions.

Wavelet-based analyses have been\nable to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation\nrate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical\ntools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave\nactually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at\n1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.\nFurthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave\npatterns with 6, 7, 8 and 9 spiral arms rotating around the planet at 1538.2\ndegrees/day, 1492.5 degrees/day, 1454.2 degrees/day and 1421.8 degrees/day,\nrespectively.

Drag forces and accretion rates dictate how these systems are\ntransformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term\nevolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing\nof the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes.

We explore a variety of approaches for modelling the\nradial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in our\nmodels, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. If we\nuse an approach based on Fall & Efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of the\ndiscs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that the\nmajority of the DLAS correspond to a single galactic disc.

We\nfind that the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum, j, in\na halo of mass Mv is well fit by a universal function, M(<j) = Mv \\mu\nj/(j_0+j). This profile is defined by one shape parameter (\\mu or j_0) in\naddition to the global spin parameter \\lambda. It follows a power-law over most\nof the mass, and flattens at large j, with the flattening more pronounced for\nsmall values of \\mu. Compared to a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, most\nhalos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of the\ndistribution. The spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to be\ncylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for ~80% of the halos. We\ninvestigate two ideas for the origin of this profile. The first is based on a\nrevised version of linear tidal-torque theory combined with extended\nPress-Schechter mass accretion, and the second focuses on j transport in minor\nmergers. Finally, we briefly explore implications of the M(<j) profile on the\nformation of galactic disks assuming that j is conserved during an adiabatic\nbaryonic infall. The implied gas density profile deviates from an exponential\ndisk, with a higher density at small radii and a tail extending to large radii.\nThe steep central density profiles may imply disk scale lengths that are\nsmaller than observed. This is reminiscent of the \"angular-momentum problem\"\nseen in hydrodynamic simulations, even though we have assumed perfect j\nconservation. A possible solution is to associate the central excesses with\nbulge components and the outer regions with extended gaseous disks. \n\n"}

By using power ratios to relate gravitational\npotential fluctuations to substructure in X-ray images, we provide the first\nquantitative comparison of the dynamical states of clusters possessing radio\nhalos. A correlation between the 1.4 GHz power (P_{1.4}) of the radio halo (or\nrelic) and the magnitude of the dipole power ratio (P_1/P_0) is discovered such\nthat approximately P_{1.4} ~ P_1/P_0; i.e., the strongest radio halos appear\nonly in those clusters currently experiencing the largest departures from a\nvirialized state.

Time-resolved\nspectroscopy with ~daily sampling reveals a distinction in the variability of\nthe soft hump and power-law components over a timescale of weeks, with the hump\nvarying by a factor of 6 across the 35-day observation compared to a factor 4\nin the power-law. Flux variations in the power-law component are measured down\nto a timescale of ~1000s and accompanying spectral variability suggests the\nsoft hump is not well-correlated with the power-law on such short timescales.\nWe detect Fe Ka and a blend of Fe Kb plus Ni Ka, indicating an origin in highly\nionized gas. Variability measurements constrain the bulk of the Fe Ka to\noriginate within a light week of the nucleus. The large EW of the emission\nlines may be due to high metallicity in NLS1s, supporting some evolutionary\nmodels for AGN. \n\n"}

This model predicts that sub-mm luminosity peaks\nafter only ~ 0.2 Gyr. However, without a very massive seed black hole,\nEddington-limited growth means that a black hole mass of 10^9 solar masses, and\nhence very luminous AGN activity, cannot be produced until > 0.5 Gyr after the\nformation of the first massive stars in the halo. The model thus predicts a\ntime-lag between the peak of sub-mm luminosity and AGN luminosity in a massive\nproto-elliptical of a few times 10^8 years. For a formation redshift z = 5,\nthis means that powerful AGN activity is delayed until z = 3.5, by which time\nstar formation in the host is 90% complete, and sub-mm luminosity has declined\nto ~ 25% of its peak value. This provides a natural explanation for why\nsuccessful sub-mm detections of luminous radio galaxies are largely confined to\nz > 2.5. Conversely the model also predicts that while all high-redshift\nluminous sub-mm-selected sources should contain an active (and growing) black\nhole, the typical luminosity of the AGN in such objects is ~1000 times smaller\nthan that of the most powerful AGN. This is consistent with the almost complete\nfailure to detect sub-mm selected galaxies with existing X-ray surveys. Finally\nthe model yields a black-hole:spheroid mass ratio which evolves rapidly in the\nfirst Gyr, but asymptotes to ~ 0.001-0.003 in agreement with results at low\nredshift. This ratio arises not because the AGN terminates star formation, but\nbecause fueling of the massive black hole is linked to the total mass of gas\navailable for star formation in the host. \n\n"}

Observed clusters and groups, however, show strong\ndeviations from these predicted relations. We argue that these deviations are\nunlikely to be entirely due to observational biasses; we assume they are\nphysically based, due to the presence of excess entropy in the intracluster\nmedium in addition to that generated by accretion shocks during the formation\nof the cluster. Several mechanisms have been suggested as a means of generating\nthis entropy.

If the\nthermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical solutions\ncan be obtained for this problem. We also examine the radiative cooling of gas\nspheres that collapse and virialize in isolation and of halos that form in\ncosmological simulations of structure formation. When applied to these\nproblems, the thermal energy version of SPH leads to substantial overcooling in\nhalos that are resolved with up to a few thousand particles, while the entropy\nformulation is biased only moderately low for these halos.

Novel ways to improve line-of-sight opacity estimates\nare presented, resulting in tight relations between opacities at different\nwavelengths. The submillimetre camera SCUBA, mounted on the JCMT, is the first\nlarge-scale submillimetre array, and as such is ideal for combatting the\neffects of the atmosphere. For example, we find that the off-source pixels are\ncrucial for removing sky-noise. Benefitting from several years of SCUBA\noperation, a database of deep SCUBA observations has been constructed to better\nunderstand the nature of sky-noise and the effects of the atmosphere on\ninstrument sensitivity. This has revealed several results. Firstly, there is\nevidence for positive correlations between sky-noise and seeing and sky-noise\nand sky opacity. Furthermore, 850-micron and 450-micron sky-noise are clearly\ncorrelated, suggesting that 450-micron data may be used to correct 850-micron\nobservations for sky-noise. Perhaps most important of all: if off-source\nbolometers are used for sky-noise removal, there is no correlation between\ninstrument sensitivity and chop throw, for chop throws out to 180 arcsec.\nUnderstanding the effects of submillimetre seeing is also important, and we\nfind that the JCMT beam is not significantly broadened by seeing, nor is there\nan obvious correlation between seeing and pointing excursions. \n\n"}

This is demonstrated by the large number of narrow\nabsorption lines in the RGS spectrum from iron, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, neon,\nargon, magnesium, silicon and sulphur. The wide range of iron states present in\nthe spectrum enables us to deduce the ionisation structure of the absorbing\nmedium.

In this paper, we evaluate the contribution to the background from\nboth sources. The active galaxy contribution arises from unresolved blazars. We\ncompute this contribution using the Stecker-Salamon model. For normal galaxies,\nthe emission is due to cosmic-ray interactions with diffuse gas. Our key\nassumption here is that the cosmic-ray flux in a galaxy is proportional to the\nsupernova rate and thus the massive star formation rate, quantified\nobservationally by the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR). In addition, the\nexistence of stars today requires a considerably higher ISM mass in the past.\nUsing the CSFR to compute both these effects, we find that normal galaxies are\nresponsible for a significant portion (\\sim 1/3) of the EGRB near 1 GeV, but\nmake a smaller contribution at other energies.

Within this multiverse ensemble, it is assumed that the standard\nmodel parameters are strongly correlated with size, i.e. with the value of the\ninverse Hubble parameter at the final time, in a manner as previously\nsuggested.

We find that standard models of double lenses, which\nneglect environment, grossly overestimate the ellipticity of the lens galaxy\n(de/e~0.5) and the Hubble constant (dh/h~0.22). Standard models of quad lenses,\nwhich approximate the environment as a tidal shear, recover the ellipticity\nreasonably well (|de/e|<~0.24) but overestimate the Hubble constant\n(dh/h~0.15), and have significant (~30%) errors in the millilensing analyses\nused to constrain the amount of substructure in dark matter halos. For both\ndoubles and quads, standard models slightly overestimate the velocity\ndispersion of the lens galaxy (d(sigma)/sigma~0.06), and underestimate the\nmagnifications of the images (d(mu)/mu ~ -0.25). Standard analyses of lens\nstatistics overestimate Omega_Lambda (by 0.05-0.14), and underestimate the\nratio of quads to doubles (by a factor of 2). These biases help explain some\nlong-standing puzzles (such as the high observed quad/double ratio), but\naggravate others (such as the low value of H_0 inferred from lensing).

The\nsimulations were performed on a grid with an area of 1 kpc$^{2}$, centered on\nthe solar circle, extending $\\pm 10$ kpc perpendicular to the galactic disk\nwith a resolution as high as 1.25 pc. The simulations were run for a time scale\nof 400 Myr, sufficiently long to avoid memory effects of the initial setup, and\nto allow for a global dynamical equilibrium to be reached in case of a constant\nenergy input rate. (...) We find that in general gas transport into the halo in\n3D is not prevented by an initial disk parallel magnetic field, but only\ndelayed initially, for as long as it is needed to punch holes into the thick\nmagnetized gas disk. The mean volume filling factor of the hot phase in the\ndisk is similar in HD and MHD (the latter with a total field strength of 4.4\n$\\mu$G) runs, amounting to $\\sim 17-21%$ for the Galactic supernova rate. \n\n"}

The discovery of afterglow emission from long GRBs was a\nwatershed event, pinpointing their origin to star forming galaxies, and hence\nthe death of massive stars, and indicating an energy release of about 10^51\nerg.

These two objects are\noriginally selected as i'-dropouts (i'-z' > 1.5) showing an interesting\nphotometric property, the ``NB921 depression''. The NB921-band (centered at\n9196A) magnitude is significantly depressed with respect to the z'-band\nmagnitude. The optical spectra of these two objects exhibit asymmetric\nemission-lines at lambda_obs ~ 8540A and ~ 8560A, suggesting that these objects\nare Ly_alpha emitters at z~6. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the Ly_alpha\nemission of the two objects are 94A and 236A; the latter one is the Ly_alpha\nemitter with the largest Ly_alpha equivalent width at z > 6 ever\nspectroscopically confirmed. The spectroscopically measured Ly_alpha fluxes of\nthese two objects are consistent with the interpretation that the NB921\ndepression is caused by the contribution of the strong Ly_alpha emission to the\nz'-band flux. Most of the NB921-depressed i'-dropout objects are thought to be\nstrong Ly_alpha emitters at 6.0 < z < 6.5; Galactic L and T dwarfs and\nNB921-dropout galaxies at z > 6.6 do not dominate the NB921-depressed\ni'-dropout sample.

Indications that SHB progenitors belong to old stellar\npopulations, in contrast to those of the long-soft GRBs, provide a strong clue\nabout their physical nature.

We here discuss a novel numerical treatment of the\nphysics of CRs and its implementation in the parallel smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics code GADGET-2. In our methodology, the non-thermal CR population\nof each gaseous fluid element is approximated by a simple power law spectrum in\nparticle momentum, characterized by an amplitude, a cut-off, and a fixed slope.\nAdiabatic compression, and a number of physical source and sink terms are\nmodelled which modify the CR pressure of each particle. The most important\nsources considered are injection by supernovae and diffusive shock\nacceleration, while the primary sinks are thermalization by Coulomb\ninteractions, and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. We also include\ndiffusion of CRs.

We find no evidence\nfor a transition from slow to rapid star formation in structures covering three\norders of magnitude in density. This has important implications for models of\nstar formation, since competing models make differing predictions for the\ncharacteristic density at which star formation should transition from slow to\nrapid. The data are inconsistent with models that predict that star clusters\nform rapidly and in free-fall collapse. Magnetic- and turbulence-regulated star\nformation models can reproduce the observations qualitatively, and the\nturbulence-regulated star formation model of Krumholz & McKee quantitatively\nreproduces the infrared-HCN luminosity correlation recently reported by Gao &\nSolomon.

Based on these accurate photometric data, we\nredetermine the structural parameters of G1 by fitting a single-mass isotropic\nKing model. We derive a core radius, $r_c=0.21\\pm0.01\\arcsec (=0.78\\pm0.04\n\\rm{pc})$, a tidal radius, $r_t=21.8\\pm1.1\\arcsec (=80.7\\pm3.9 \\rm{pc})$, and a\nconcentration index $c=\\log (r_t/r_c)=2.01\\pm0.02$.

However, the physics\nof the explosion are debated. Here we report a systematic spectral analysis of\na large sample of well observed type Ia supernovae. Mapping the velocity\ndistribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical\nscenarios. We find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stable\niron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova\nejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of\nnickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product\nof incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in\nall SNe, having an expansion velocity of ~11000 km/s and corresponding to a\nmass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae\nconsidered here burned similar masses, and suggests that their progenitors had\nthe same mass.

A single explosion scenario, possibly\na delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae. \n\n"}

These are\nstrong non-axisymmetric features which significantly affect orbits of stars and\ndark matter particles. One of the main effects is the dynamical resonances\nbetween galactic material and the bar. We detect and characterize these\nresonances in N-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radial\nfrequencies of individual orbits. We found narrow peaks in the distribution of\norbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. We\nfound five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.\nThe corotation resonance and the inner and outer Lindblad resonances are the\nmost populated. The spatial distributions of particles near resonances are\nwide. For example, the inner Lindblad resonance is not localized at a given\nradius. Particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar and\nspan a wide range of radii. On the other hand, particles near the corotation\nresonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable Lagrange\npoints. The distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.\nResonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. Our analysis\nof orbits in both N-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicates\nthat resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trapped\nmaterial. Only if the bar evolves as a whole, resonances drift through the\nphase space. In this case particles anchored near resonant orbits track the\nresonance shift and evolve. The criteria to ensure a correct resonant behavior\ndiscussed in Weinberg & Katz (2007a) can be achieved with few millions\nparticles because the regions of trapped orbits near resonances are large and\nevolving. \n\n"}

These effects naturally depend on the precise shape of the extinction\nlaw and on the redshift of the lens. By means of numerical Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, using a least-squares fitting method and assuming an extinction\nlaw similar to that observed in the Galaxy, we show how accurate photometric\nobservations of multiply imaged quasars obtained in several spectral bands\ncould lead to the estimate of the lens redshift, irrespective of the visibility\nof the deflector.

This correlation is stronger than\nexpected based on the analysis of the Hipparcos catalog. We predict the\nparallaxes of individual cluster members, pi_pm, from their Hipparcos proper\nmotions, assuming that all cluster members have the same space velocity.

Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV.

We argue in this\narticle that this model is compatible with the current observations. A crucial\nr\\^ole for the correct ``phenomenology'' of the model is played by the relative\nmagnitude of the flux of the five form of the type 0 string to the size of five\nof the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field. We do\nnot claim, at this stage at least, that this model is a realistic physical\nmodel for the Universe, but we find it interesting that the model cannot be\nruled out immediately, at least on phenomenological grounds. \n\n"}

Such\nfrequencies are rather difficult to compute, even for Schwarzschild black\nholes. However, it is now quite likely that they may provide a fundamental link\nbetween classical general relativity and quantum theories of gravity. Here we\ncarry out the first numerical computation of very highly damped quasinormal\nmodes (QNM's) for charged and rotating black holes. In the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\ncase QNM frequencies and damping times show an oscillatory behaviour as a\nfunction of charge. The oscillations become faster as the mode order increases.\nAt fixed mode order, QNM's describe spirals in the complex plane as the charge\nis increased, tending towards a well defined limit as the hole becomes\nextremal. Kerr QNM's have a similar oscillatory behaviour when the angular\nindex $m=0$. For $l=m=2$ the real part of Kerr QNM frequencies tends to\n$2\\Omega$, $\\Omega$ being the angular velocity of the black hole horizon, while\nthe asymptotic spacing of the imaginary parts is given by $2\\pi T_H$. \n\n"}

We first elaborate\non a kind of correspondence existing between tachyons and minimally coupled\nscalar fields; corresponding theories give rise to the same cosmological\nevolution for a particular choice of the initial conditions but not for any\nother. This leads us to study a specific one-parameter family of tachyonic\nmodels based on a perfect fluid mixed with a positive cosmological constant.\nFor positive values of the parameter one needs to modify Sen's action and use\nthe sigma process of resolution of singularities. The physics described by this\nmodel is dramatically different and much richer than that of the corresponding\nscalar field. For particular choices of the initial conditions the universe,\nthat does mimick for a long time a de Sitter-like expansion, ends up in a\nfinite time in a special type of singularity that we call a \"big brake\". This\nsingularity is characterized by an infinite deceleration. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0403223", "contents": "Title: Creating the Universe from Brane-Antibrane Annihilation Abstract: When p-dimensional branes annihilate with antibranes in the early universe,\nas in brane-antibrane inflation, stable (p-2)-dimensional branes can appear in\nthe final state. We reexamine the possibility that one of these (p-2)-branes\ncould be our universe. In the low energy effective theory, the final state\nbranes are cosmic string defects of the complex tachyon field which describes\nthe instability of the initial state. We quantify the dynamics of formation of\nthese vortices. This information is then used to estimate the production of\nmassless gauge bosons on the final branes, due to their coupling to the\ntime-dependent tachyon background, which would provide a mechanism for\nreheating after inflation. We improve upon previous estimates indicating that\nthis can be an efficient reheating mechanism for observers on the brane. \n\n"}
