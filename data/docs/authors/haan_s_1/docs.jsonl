Abstract: Most multi-planetary systems are characterized by hot-Jupiters close to their\ncentral star, moving on eccentric orbits. From a dynamical point of view,\ncompact multi-planetary systems form a specific class of the general N-body\nproblem (where N>=3). Moreover, extrasolar planets are found in prograde orbits\nabout their host star, and often in mean motion resonances (MMR). In a first\nstep, we study theoretically a new stabilizing mechanism suitable for compact\ntwo-planet systems. This mechanism involves counter-revolving orbits forming a\nretrograde MMR. In a second step, we investigate the feasibility of planetary\nsystems hosting counter-revolving planets. Dynamical stability, observations,\nand formation processes of these systems are analyzed and discussed. To\ncharacterize the dynamical behavior of multi-dimensional planetary systems, we\napply our technique of global dynamics analysis based on the MEGNO indicator\n(Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) that provides the fine\nstructure of the phase space. In a few cases of possible counter-revolving\nconfigurations, we carry out new fits to the observations using the Pikaia\ngenetic algorithm.

We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from\nthe planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this corresponds\nto minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-\n48 K and 1220 +/- 47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an\norbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30\ndegrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would\nhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the\nsmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's\natmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night\nside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature\ndifferences.

We assume a spherically symmetric density\ndistribution at the outer boundary, but brake the flow symmetry by introducing\na small, latitude-dependent angular momentum. We also consider cases where\nangular momentum at large radii is latitude- and azimuth-dependent. For the\nlatitude-dependent angular momentum, 3-D simulations confirm axisymmetric\nresults: the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted forms a\nthick torus near the equator. Consequently, accretion proceeds only through the\npolar funnel, and the mass accretion rate through the funnel is constrained by\nthe size and shape of the torus, not by the outer conditions. In 3-D\nsimulations, we found that the torus precesses, even for axisymmetric\nconditions at large radii.

We investigate the evolution of linear metric\nfluctuations around this background, and calculate the amplification of the\nlong-wavelength GW of a certain polarization during the anisotropic expansion\n(this effect is absent for another GW polarization, and for scalar\nfluctuations). These GW are superimposed to the usual tensor modes of quantum\norigin from inflation, and are potentially observable if the total number of\ninflationary e-folds exceeds the minimum required to homogenize the observable\nuniverse only by a small margin. Their contribution to the temperature\nanisotropy angular power spectrum decreases with the multipole l as l^(-p),\nwhere p depends on the slope of the initial GW power-spectrum.

The most\nimportant finding is that X-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating diskfree stars\ncan significantly exceed the Keplerian corotation radius, whereas X-ray loop\nsizes in disky and accreting systems do not exceed the corotation radius. This\nis consistent with models of star-disk magnetic interaction where the inner\ndisk truncates and confines the PMS stellar magnetosphere.

Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative.

Using our Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, which\nincludes accurate treatments of all relevant physical processes operating in\nglobular clusters, we study the effects of the kicks on their host cluster and\non the WD population itself. We find that in clusters whose velocity dispersion\nis comparable to the kick speed, WD kicks are a significant energy source for\nthe cluster, prolonging the initial cluster core contraction phase\nsignificantly so that at late times the cluster core to half-mass radius ratio\nis a factor of up to ~ 10 larger than in the no-kick case.

Abstract: By using high-resolution 1D hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the\neffects of purely mechanical feedback from super massive black holes (SMBHs) in\nthe evolution of elliptical galaxies for a broad range of feedback efficiencies\nand compare the results to four major observational constraints. In particular,\nwe focus on 1) the central black hole to stellar mass ratio of the host galaxy,\n2) the lifetime of the luminous quasar phase, 3) the mass of stars formed in\nthe host galaxy within the last Gyr, and 4) the X-ray luminosity of the hot\ndiffuse gas. As a result, we try to pin down the most successful range of\nmechanical feedback efficiencies. We find that while low feedback efficiencies\nresult in too much growth of the SMBH, high efficiencies totally blow out the\nhot interstellar gas, and the models are characterized by very low thermal\nX-ray luminosity well below the observed range. The net lifetime of the quasar\nphase is strongly coupled to the mass ratio between SMBH and its host galaxy,\nwhile the X-ray luminosity is generally correlated to the recent star formation\nwithin the last Gyr. When considering the popularly adopted model of the\nconstant feedback efficiency, the feedback energy deposited into the ambient\nmedium should be more than 0.01% of the SMBH accretion energy to be consistent\nwith the SMBH mass to stellar mass ratio in the local universe. Yet, the X-ray\nluminosity of the hot gas favors about 0.005% of the accretion energy as the\nmechanical AGN feedback energy.

We find that the uncertainty in Galactic parallax is dependent upon the\nspecific geometry of the problem in question. In the case of the tidal stream\nGD-1, the problem geometry indicates that available proper motion data, with\nindividual accuracy ~4 mas/yr, should allow estimation of its distance with\nabout 50 percent uncertainty. Proper motions accurate to ~1 mas/yr, which are\nexpected from the forthcoming Pan-STARRS PS-1 survey, will allow estimation of\nits distance to about 10 percent uncertainty. Proper motions from the future\nLSST and Gaia projects will be more accurate still, and will allow the parallax\nfor a stream 30 kpc distant to be measured with ~14 percent uncertainty.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of the method and show that our uncertainty\nestimates are accurate by computing Galactic parallax using simulated data for\nthe GD-1 stream. We also apply the method to actual data for the GD-1 stream,\npublished by Koposov et al. (2009). With the exception of one datum, the\ndistances estimated using Galactic parallax match photometric estimates with\nless than 1 kpc discrepancy. The scatter in the distances recovered using\nGalactic parallax is very low, suggesting that the proper motion uncertainty\nreported by Koposov et al.

The growing thin disks are\nmodeled as static gravitational potentials and we explore a variety of\ngrowing-disk parameters that are likely to influence the response of thick\ndisks.

Overall, the growth of an embedded thin\ndisk can cause a substantial contraction in both the radial and vertical\ndirection, resulting in a significant decrease in the scale-lengths and\nscale-heights of thick disks. Kinematically, a growing thin disk can induce a\nnotable increase in the mean rotation and velocity dispersions of thick-disk\nstars.

The true PDF from subhalos has been\nshown recently (by Lee et al.) to deviate from Poisson; we extend this analysis\nand derive the signal PDF from a detailed Lambda-CDM-based model for the\nproperties of subhalos. We combine our PDF with a model for Galactic and\nextra-Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission to obtain an estimator and projected\nerror on dark matter particle properties (mass and annihilation cross section)\nusing the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.

We find\nthat, although both estimators are unbaised in the presence of backgrounds, the\nerror on dark matter properties derived from the true PDF is ~50% smaller than\nwhen utilizing the Poisson-based analysis. \n\n"}

The\nevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of the\nvirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated model\nfor disk evolution inside growing NFW dark matter haloes. In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations. We emphasize, though, that this weak evolution\ndoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. On the contrary,\nindividual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a way\nthat they move largely along the scaling relations. Finally, recent\nobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-forming\ndisk galaxies at z \\sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that high\nredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. However, we argue\nthat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimated\nby a factor \\sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \\sim 1.4 between\nH\\alpha sizes and optical sizes. Taking these effects into account, there is no\nindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\\sim 2) have\nabnormally high spin parameters. \n\n"}

Such detections are\nconsidered to be the next observational grand challenge that will enable\ntesting general relativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and improve our\nunderstanding of evolution and growth of these massive compact objects.

The spectra are well fitted by a\ncombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,\nand electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. The spinning\ndust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the high\nfrequency side clearly for the first time. The spectra have a peak in the range\n20-40 GHz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for Perseus and\n8.4 sigma for Rho Ophiuchi.

It is\nimportant in magnetic fusion and in space and solar physics --- areas that have\nso far provided the context for most of reconnection research. Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs. Here, magnetic\nenergy density is so high that its dissipation heats the plasma to MeV\ntemperatures. Electron-positron pairs are then copiously produced, making the\nreconnection layer highly collisional and dressing it in a thick pair coat that\ntraps radiation. The pressure is dominated by radiation and pairs. Yet,\nradiation diffusion across the layer may be faster than the global Alfv\\'en\ntransit time; then, radiative cooling governs the thermodynamics and\nreconnection becomes a radiative transfer problem, greatly affected by the\nultra-strong magnetic field.

Abstract: To gain new insights into the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy reported for\nactive galactic nuclei, we examine radio loudness as a function of Eddington\nratio for a previously published sample of 199 AGN from five different\npopulations. After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries. We conclude that if the\nmass-corrected core radio luminosity is a good measure of jet power, then black\nhole spin may have considerably less impact on jet power than previously\nreported, or that our sample does not include the extremes of spin. If the\nspread in jet power is small then we suggest that characteristics of the\nambient environment and/or the radio source age could be equally as important\nin producing a radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy seen in total radio luminosity. \n\n"}

The\nvelocity distribution is mostly sensitive to the relative spiral arm phase and\npattern speed. In all cases the arms induce strong kinematic imprints for\npattern speeds around 17 km/s/kpc (close to the 4:1 inner resonance) but no\nsubstructure is induced close to corotation.

With the assumption of Saha equilibrium, the variation in\ntemperature is the main driver of the variations in the electrical\nconductivity, induced current and Ohmic power dissipated. Atmospheres\npossessing temperature inversions tend to dissipate most of the Ohmic power\nsuperficially, at high altitudes, whereas those without temperature inversions\nare capable of greater dissipation deeper down. Scattering in the optical range\nof wavelengths tends to cool the lower atmosphere, thus reducing the degree of\ndissipation at depth. Purely absorbing cloud decks (in the infrared), of a\nfinite extent in height, allow for localized reductions in dissipation and may\nreverse a temperature inversion if they are dense and thick enough, thus\ngreatly enhancing the dissipation at depth. If Ohmic dissipation is the\nmechanism for inflating hot Jupiters, then variations in the atmospheric\nopacity (which may be interpreted as arising from variations in metallicity and\ncloud/haze properties) and magnetic field strength naturally produce a scatter\nin the measured radii at a given strength of irradiation.

Because too much mass is heated, the\ntemperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic\narguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical\nresolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected\nthermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose\nand test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum\ntemperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both\nparticle- and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nsimulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark\nmatter haloes with total mass 10^10 and 10^12 h^-1 solar masses.

For example, imagine a researcher looking at a 3D volume visualization\nof simulated or observed data, and simultaneously viewing statistical displays\nof the data set's properties (such as an x-y plot of temperature vs. velocity,\nor a histogram of vorticities).

Our\nmodels are directly applicable to semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy\nformation. We have previously argued that filaments of cold (~10^4 K) gas\ncondense out of the intracluster medium (ICM) in hydrostatic and thermal\nequilibrium when the ratio of the thermal instability timescale to the\nfree-fall time $t_{TI}/t_{ff}$ falls below 5-10. This criterion corresponds to\nan upper limit on the density of the ICM and motivates a model in which a\ndensity core forms wherever $t_{TI}/t_{ff} \\lesssim 10$. Consistent with\nobservations and numerical simulations, this model predicts larger and more\ntenuous cores for lower-mass halos---while the core density in a cluster may be\nas large as ~ 0.1 cm^{-3}, the core density in the Galactic halo should not\nexceed ~ 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. We can also explain the large densities in smaller\nmass halos (galactic `coronae') if we include the contribution of the central\ngalaxy to the gravitational potential. Our models produce a favorable match to\nthe observational X-ray luminosity-temperature (Lx-Tx) relation. For halo\nmasses $\\lesssim 10^{13}$ Msun the core size approaches the virial radius.\nThus, most of the baryons in such halos cannot be in the hot ICM, but either in\nthe form of stars or in the form of hot gas beyond the virial radius. Because\nof the smaller mass in the ICM and much larger mass available for star\nformation, the majority of the baryons in low mass halos ($\\lesssim 10^{13}$\nMsun) can be expelled beyond the virial radius due to supernova feedback. This\ncan account for the baryons `missing' from low mass halos, such as the Galactic\nhalo. \n\n"}

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation.

One important question is\nwhether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition\nof the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely\naffected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or\nprovide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which\ncan help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE\n1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to\nobserve the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the\nS I line.

The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the\nmetals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive \"fall-back\" are not mutually\nexclusive.

Abstract: We show that the position of the central dark matter density peak may be\nexpected to differ from the dynamical center of the Galaxy by several hundred\nparsec. In Eris, a high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulation of a\nrealistic Milky-Way-analog disk galaxy, this offset is 300 - 400 pc (~3\ngravitational softening lengths) after z=1. In its dissipationless\ndark-matter-only twin simulation ErisDark, as well as in the Via Lactea II and\nGHalo simulations, the offset remains below one softening length for most of\nits evolution. The growth of the DM offset coincides with a flattening of the\ncentral DM density profile in Eris inwards of ~1 kpc, and the direction from\nthe dynamical center to the point of maximum DM density is correlated with the\norientation of the stellar bar, suggesting a bar-halo interaction as a possible\nexplanation.

We analyze the rest-frame U-B color\ncorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in\nthe redshift range 0.5< z<0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. We find that Sersic\nindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and\nresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. There exists,\nhowever, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n\nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. We hypothesize that their Sersic\nvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits,\nleading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternative\nto Sersic index. Not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tight\nrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is\nmost physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority of\nthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their\nGIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of\nsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must\nabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench.

We used a set of\nthree-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface convection\ncomputed with CO5BOLD to calculate spectra of late-type stars in the Gaia RVS\nrange and to infer the net velocity offset that convective motions will induce\nin radial velocities derived by cross-correlation. The net velocity shifts\nderived by cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectral\nresolution of the observations.

We demonstrate how the model parameters such as\nmass of the halo, initial conditions in the disc and the halo axes ratio affect\nmorphology and kinematics of the stellar discs.

The growth of the spiral arms\nis not accompanied by significant dynamical heating of the disc, irrelevant to\nits initial parameters. We also investigate transformation of the dark halo's\nshape driven by the long-lived spiral pattern in the disc .

The measurements are based on the combined analysis of time-series\nspectroscopy obtained during two complete transits and two complete secondary\neclipses of the planet. The observations were performed with the MMIRS\ninstrument on the Magellan II telescope using the technique of multi-object\nspectroscopy with wide slits. We compare the transmission and emission data to\ntheoretical models to constrain the composition and thermal structure of the\nplanet's atmosphere. Our measured transmission spectrum exhibits a scatter that\ncorresponds to 1.3 scale heights of the planet's atmosphere, which is\nconsistent with the size of spectral features predicted by theoretical models\nfor a clear atmosphere. We detected the secondary eclipses of the planet at\nsignificances ranging from 2.2 to 14.4 sigma. The secondary eclipse depths, and\nthe significances of the detections increase towards longer wavelengths. Our\nmeasured emission spectrum is consistent with a 2250 K effectively isothermal\n1-D model for the planet's dayside atmosphere.

No evidence is found for a very cold (6-10 K) dust component. The\ntemp of the cold dust component is strongly influenced by the ratio of the star\nformation rate to the total dust mass.

In this paper, we make substantial steps towards\ncomparing simulations and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in a\nmore sensible way. We present a pipeline that generates and fits synthetic QSO\nabsorption spectra using sight lines cast through a cosmological simulation,\nand simultaneously identifies structure by directly analyzing the variations in\nHI and OVI number density. We compare synthetic absorption spectra with a less\nobservationally motivated, but more straightforward density threshold-based\nmethod for finding absorbers. Our efforts focus on HI and OVI to better\ncharacterize the warm/hot intergalactic medium, a subset of the IGM that is\nchallenging to conclusively identify observationally. We find that the two\nmethods trace roughly the same quantities of HI and OVI above observable column\ndensity limits, but the synthetic spectra typically identify more substructure\nin absorbers. We use both methods to characterize HI and OVI absorber\nproperties. We find that both integrated and differential column density\ndistributions from both methods generally agree with observations. The\ndistribution of Doppler parameters between the two methods are similar for Lya\nand compare reasonably with observational results, but while the two methods\nagree with each other with OVI systems, they both are systematically different\nfrom observations.

Several\nworks have studied the question whether a softening scale fixed in space and\ntime provides a good enough modelling of an astrophysical system.

The spiral galaxies studied so far show a similar\nmagnetic field pattern which is of spiral shape along the disk plane and\nX-shaped in the halo, sometimes accompanied by strong vertical fields above and\nbelow the central region of the disk. The strength of the halo field is\ncomparable to that of the disk. The total and turbulent magnetic field strength\nis (weakly) increasing with the star formation. There are, however, indications\nthat stronger star formation reduces the magnetic field regularity globally.\nThe magnetic field in spiral galaxies is generally thought to be amplified and\nmaintained by dynamo action. During the galaxy's formation and evolution the\nturbulent dynamo amplifies the field strength to energy equipartition with the\nturbulent gas, while the large-scale (mean-field) dynamo mainly orders the\nmagnetic field. Hence, the large-scale magnetic field pattern evolves with\ntime. Supernova explosions causes a further continuous injection of turbulent\nmagnetic fields. Assuming that this small-scale field injection is situated\nonly within the spiral arm region where star formation mostly occurs lead to a\nlarge-scale field structure in which the magnetic field regularity is stronger\nin the interarm region as observed in several nearby spiral galaxies. The\ndetection of similar scale heights in several spiral galaxies of different\nHubble type star formation implies a relation between the galactic wind, the\ntotal magnetic field strength and the star formation in the galaxy. A galactic\nwind may be essential for an effective dynamo action. Strong tidal interaction,\nhowever, seems to disturb the balance leading to deviating and locally\ndifferent scale heights as observed in M82 and NGC~4631. \n\n"}

ETGs brighter than $M_r=-21$\nmag are older than 13 Gyr and spend up to 10 Gyr of their overall evolutionary\ntime in the BC before they reach the RS migrating through the GV.

For heavy ($\\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs\nin large (galaxy-sized or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy\npositrons. For lighter dark matter, this is kinematically impossible, and the\nunique observable signature becomes an X-ray line, arising from $\\chi \\chi\n\\rightarrow \\chi^* \\chi^*$, followed by $\\chi^* \\rightarrow \\chi \\gamma$. This\nvariant of XDM is distinctive from other DM X-ray scenarios in that it tends to\nbe most present in more massive, hotter environments, such as clusters, rather\nthan nearby dwarfs, and has different dependencies from decaying models.

Using a novel technique to construct\ndrizzled PSF libraries for HST/ACS data, we accurately determine the fidelity\nof GC structural parameter measurements from detailed artificial star cluster\nexperiments. The measurement of rh for the major fraction of the NGC1399 GC\nsystem reveals a trend of increasing rh versus galactocentric distance, Rgal,\nout to about 10 kpc and a flat relation beyond. This trend is very similar for\nblue and red GCs which are found to have a mean size ratio of\nrh(red)/rh(blue)=0.82+/-0.11 at all galactocentric radii from the core regions\nof the galaxy out to ~40 kpc. This suggests that the size difference between\nblue and red GCs is due to internal mechanisms related to the evolution of\ntheir constituent stellar populations. Modeling the mass density profile of\nNGC1399 shows that additional external dynamical mechanisms are required to\nlimit the GC size in the galaxy halo regions to rh~2 pc.

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMSs; >10^5 Msun) formed in the first protogalaxies with\nvirial temperature T_vir>10^4 K are expected to collapse into seeds of\nsupermassive black hole (SMBHs) in the high-redshift universe (z>7).\nFragmentation of the primordial gas is, however, a possible obstacle to SMS\nformation. We discuss the expected properties of a compact, metal-free,\nmarginally unstable nuclear protogalactic disk, and the fate of the clumps\nformed in the disk by gravitational instability. Interior to a characteristic\nradius R_f=few*10^{-2} pc, the disk fragments into massive clumps with M_c~30\nMsun. The clumps grow via accretion and migrate inward rapidly on a timescale\nof ~10^4 yr, which is comparable or shorter than the Kelvin-Helmholz time >10^4\nyr. Some clumps may evolve to zero-age main sequence stars and halt gas\naccretion by radiative feedback, but most of the clumps can migrate inward and\nmerge with the central protostar before forming massive stars. Moreover, we\nfound that dust-induced-fragmentation in metal-enriched gas does not modify\nthese conclusions unless Z> 3*10^{-4} Zsun, because clump migration below this\nmetallicity remains as rapid as in the primordial case.

Methods: The properties of the dust are derived from the\nwavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddened\nType Ia SN: 1986G, 2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J. [...] Results: All four objects\nare characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios\n(R_V) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized by\nvery blue polarization peaks. In all cases the polarization position angle is\nwell aligned with the local spiral structure. While SN~1986G is compatible with\nthe most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the Galaxy,\nSN2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J show unprecedented behaviours. The observed\ndeviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to the\nrelatively large amounts of reddening characterizing the objects in the sample.\nConclusions: The dust responsible for the polarization of these four SN is most\nlikely of interstellar nature. The polarization properties can be interpreted\nin terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. The anomalous\nbehaviour is apparently associated with the properties of the galactic\nenvironment in which the SN explode, rather than with the progenitor system\nfrom which they originate.

The scaling symmetry of the SP equation and\nthe uncertainty principle tightly relate the core mass to the halo specific\nenergy, which, in the context of cosmological structure formation, leads to a\nsimple scaling between core mass ($M_c$) and halo mass ($M_h$), $M_c \\propto\na^{-1/2} M_h^{1/3}$, where $a$ is the cosmic scale factor.

Since low mass galaxies have smaller baryon fractions\ninteractions with these satellites may leave particularly dramatic imprints. We\nuncover the influence of the most massive of these dark satellites on disky\ndwarf galaxies and the possible dynamical and morphological transformations\nthat result from these interactions. We use a suite of carefully set-up,\ncontrolled simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. The primary dwarf galaxies\nhave solely a stellar disk in the dark matter halo and the secundaries are\ncompletely devoid of baryons. We vary the disk mass, halo concentration,\ninitial disk thickness and inclination of the satellite orbit. The disky dwarf\ngalaxies are heated and disrupted due to the minor merger event, more extremely\nfor higher satellite over disk mass ratios, and the morphology and kinematics\nare significantly altered. Moreover, for less concentrated haloes the minor\nmerger can completely destroy the disk leaving a low-luminosity spheroidal-like\ngalaxy instead. We conclude that dwarf galaxies are very much susceptible to\nbeing disturbed by dark galaxies and that even a minor merger event can\nsignificantly disrupt and alter the structure and kinematics of a dwarf galaxy.\nThis process may be seen as a new channel for the formation of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

We test this claim by performing a\ncounts-in-cells analysis of mock SMG catalogues derived from the Bolshoi\ncosmological simulation to investigate how well SMG associations trace the\nunderlying dark matter structure. We find that SMGs exhibit a relatively\ncomplex bias: some regions of high SMG overdensity are underdense in terms of\ndark matter mass, and some regions of high dark matter overdensity contain no\nSMGs. Because of their rarity, Poisson noise causes scatter in the SMG\noverdensity at fixed dark matter overdensity. Consequently, rich associations\nof less-luminous, more-abundant galaxies (i.e. Lyman-break galaxy analogues)\ntrace the highest dark matter overdensities much better than SMGs.

To better understand the impact of SN explosions on the\nevolution of galaxies, we perform a suite of high-resolution (12 pc), zoom-in\ncosmological simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy at z=3 with adaptive mesh\nrefinement. We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation,\nleading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed\nmass-metallicity relation and stellar mass-halo mass relation at z~3. This is\nachieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: i)\nthe different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting\nradial momentum expected at each stage, ii) the realistic time delay of SNe,\ncommencing at as early as 3 Myr, is required to disperse very dense gas before\na runaway collapse sets in at the galaxy centre via mergers of gas clumps, and\niii) a non-uniform density distribution of the ISM is taken into account below\nthe computational grid scale for the cell in which SN explodes. The last\ncondition is motivated by the fact that our simulations still do not resolve\nthe detailed structure of a turbulent ISM in which the fast outflows can\npropagate along low-density channels. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback\nmodel shows strong outflows, which carry approximately ten times larger mass\nthan star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity.

Absorption from the excited fine-structure levels of OI, CI\nand SiII are detected in the system towards J2140-0321, that has the largest HI\ncolumn density detected so far in an intervening DLA. This is the first\ndetection of OI fine-structure lines in a QSO-DLA, that also provides us a rare\npossibility to study the chemical abundances of less abundant atoms like Co and\nGe. Simple single phase photo-ionisation models fail to reproduce all the\nobserved quantities. Instead, we suggest that the cloud has a stratified\nstructure: H2 and CI likely originate from both a dense (log nH~2.5-3) cold\n(80K) and warm (250K) phase containing a fraction of the total HI while a\nwarmer (T>1000 K) phase probably contributes significantly to the high\nexcitation of OI fine-structure levels. The observed CI/H2 column density ratio\nis surprisingly low compared to model predictions and we do not detect CO\nmolecules: this suggests a possible underabundance of C by 0.7 dex compared to\nother alpha elements.

Young tidal dwarf\ngalaxies (TDGs), born in the tidal tails produced by interacting gas-rich\ngalaxies, have been thought to not follow the MZ relation, because they inherit\nthe metallicity of the more massive parent galaxies. We present chemical\nevolution models to investigate if TDGs that formed at very high redshifts,\nwhere the metallicity of their parent galaxy was very low, can produce the\nobserved MZ relation. Assuming that galaxy interactions were more frequent in\nthe denser high-redshift universe, TDGs could constitute an important\ncontribution to the dwarf galaxy population. The survey of chemical evolution\nmodels of TDGs presented here captures for the first time an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) of stars that is dependent on both the star formation rate and\nthe gas metallicity via the integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory. As TDGs\nform in the tidal debris of interacting galaxies, the pre-enrichment of the\ngas, an underlying pre-existing stellar population, infall, and mass dependent\noutflows are considered. The models of young TDGs that are created in strongly\npre-enriched tidal arms with a pre-existing stellar population can explain the\nmeasured abundance ratios of observed TDGs. The same chemical evolution models\nfor TDGs, that form out of gas with initially very low metallicity, naturally\nbuild up the observed MZ relation. The modelled chemical composition of ancient\nTDGs is therefore consistent with the observed MZ relation of satellite\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

Theys are products of the slow\n(\"secular\") evolution of galaxy disks: bars and other nonaxisymmetries move\ndisk gas toward the center, where it starbursts and builds relatively flat,\nrapidly rotating components. This secular evolution is a new area of galaxy\nevolution work that complements hierarchical clustering. 2 - Disks of\nhigh-redshift galaxies are unstable to the formation of mass clumps that sink\nto the center and merge - an alternative channel for the formation of classical\nbulges.

We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently\nreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120\ndegrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc\ndecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component\nin about 6 dynamical times.

We\nobtained a statistical sample of 59 BCGs, which was divided into two classes,\ndepending on the dynamical state of the host cluster, i.e. merging (M) and\nrelaxed (R). Among the 59 BCGs, 28 are radio-loud, and 31 are radio--quiet. The\nradio-loud sources are located favourably located in relaxed clusters (71\\%),\nwhile the reverse is true for the radio-quiet BCGs, mostly located in merging\nsystems (81\\%). The fractional radio luminosity function (RLF) for the BCGs is\nconsiderably higher for BCGs in relaxed clusters, where the total fraction of\nradio loudness reaches almost 90\\%, to be compared to the $\\sim$30\\% in merging\nclusters. For relaxed clusters, we found a positive correlation between the\nradio power of the BCGs and the strength of the cool core, consistent with\nprevious studies on local samples. Our study suggests that the radio loudness\nof the BCGs strongly depends on the cluster dynamics, their fraction being\nconsiderably higher in relaxed clusters. We compared our results with similar\ninvestigations, and briefly discussed them in the framework of AGN feedback. \n\n"}

We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers\nwith dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may\nthus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population. \n\n"}

The four components of the DDRG B1834+620 have been\nresolved for the first time at 144 MHz. Inner lobes were found to point towards\nthe direction of the outer lobes, unlike standard FR~II sources. Polarized\nemission was detected in the northern outer lobe.

Abstract: If ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are powered by accretion onto stellar\nremnant black holes, then many must be accreting at super-Eddington rates. It\nis predicted that such high accretion rates should give rise to massive,\nradiatively-driven winds. However, observational evidence of a wind, in the\nform of absorption or emission features, has remained elusive. As such, the\nreported detection of X-ray spectral residuals in XMM-Newton spectra of NGC\n5408 X-1, which could be related to absorption in a wind is potentially very\nexciting. However, it has previously been assumed by several authors that these\nfeatures simply originate from background diffuse plasma emission related to\nstar-formation in the ULX's host galaxy. In this work we utilise the spatial\nresolving power of Chandra to test whether we can rule out this latter\ninterpretation. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity in these\nspectral features is emitted from a highly localised region close to the ULX,\nand appears point-like even with Chandra. It is therefore highly likely that\nthe spectral features are associated with the ULX itself, and little of the\nflux in this spectral component originates from spatially extended emission in\nthe host galaxy. This may be consistent with the suggestion of absorption in an\noptically thin phase of a super-Eddington wind.

Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared SEDs of\ngalaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad\nrange of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.\nWe find that the SFR-M* relation is not consistent with a single power-law of\nthe form SFR ~ M*^a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a~1 at low\nmasses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (M_0) that ranges from\n10^9.5 - 10^10.8 Msol, with evidence that M_0 increases with redshift. We\ncompare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological\nsimulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR-M* relation\nalbeit with systematic offsets.

In our analysis we consider several theoretical models,\ncorresponding to isothermal hot gas and zero temperature BEC dark matter,\nnon-isothermal gas and zero temperature dark matter, and isothermal gas and\nfinite temperature BEC, respectively. The properties of the finite temperature\nBEC dark matter cluster are investigated in detail numerically. We compare our\ntheoretical results with the observational data of 106 galactic clusters. Using\na least-squares fitting, as well as the observational results for the dark\nmatter self-interaction cross section, we obtain some upper bounds for the mass\nand scattering length of the dark matter particle. Our results suggest that the\nmass of the dark matter particle is of the order of $\\mu $eV, while the\nscattering length has values in the range of $10^{-7}$ fm. \n\n"}

We present an\nindirect method to detect the presence of a hot bubble using hydrostatic\nphotoionization calculations of the cold (~10^4 K) line-emitting gas. We\ncompare our calculations with observations of the broad line region, the inner\nface of the torus, the narrow line region (NLR), and the extended NLR, and thus\nconstrain the hot gas pressure at distances 0.1 pc -- 10 kpc from the center.\nWe find that emission line ratios observed in the average quasar spectrum are\nconsistent with radiation-pressure-dominated models on all scales.

We\nfind that the strength of the L_[CII] and 158 micron continuum emission in z>~6\nquasar hosts correlate with the quasar's bolometric luminosity. In one quasar,\nthe [CII] line is significantly redshifted by ~1700 km/s with respect to the\nMgII broad emission line. Comparing to values in the literature, we find that,\non average, the MgII is blueshifted by 480 km/s (with a standard deviation of\n630 km/s) with respect to the host galaxy redshift, i.e. one of our quasars is\nan extreme outlier.

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability.

The well\nknown prograde x1 orbit family originates from the same parent orbit as the box\norbits in stationary and rotating triaxial ellipsoids. However only a small\nfraction of bar orbits ~4% have predominately prograde motion like their\nperiodic parent orbit. Most bar orbits arising from the x1 orbit have little\nnet angular momentum in the bar frame making them equivalent to box orbits in\nrotating triaxial potentials. A small fraction of bar orbits (~7%) are long\naxis tubes that behave exactly like those in triaxial ellipsoids:they are\ntipped about the intermediate-axis due to the Coriolis force, with the sense of\ntipping determined by the sign of their angular momentum about the long axis.\nNo orbits parented by prograde periodic x2 orbits are found in the pure bar\nmodel, but a tiny population (~2%) of short axis tube orbits parented by\nretrograde x4 orbits are found.

In this paper, we use the\nEAGLE simulation to study the dependence of the BTFR on the size of the\nsimulated galaxy sample. The huge number of datapoint available in the\nsimulation is indeed not available with current observations. Observational\nstudies that computed the BTFR used various (small) size samples with the only\nobligation to have galaxies spanning over a large range of masses and rotation\nrates. Accordingly, to compare observational and theoretical results, we build\na large number of various size datasets using the same criterion and derive the\nBTFR for all of them.

The relation can be described as gamma_tot = A f_DM + B\nfor all systems at all redshifts. The trend is set by the decreasing importance\nof gas dissipation towards lower redshifts and for more massive systems.\nEarly-type galaxies are smaller, more concentrated, have lower f_DM and steeper\ngamma_tot at high redshifts and at lower masses for a given redshift; f_DM and\ngamma_tot are good indicators for growth by \"dry\" merging.

However, as star\nformation in low-mass halos can be easily depressed or even quenched by\nionizing radiation, a turnover is expected at some faint UV magnitudes. Using a\nphysically-motivated analytical model, we quantify reionization feedback\neffects on the LF faint-end shape. We find that if reionization feedback is\nneglected, the power-law Schechter parameterization characterizing the LF\nfaint-end remains valid up to absolute UV magnitude $\\sim -9$. If instead\nradiative feedback is strong enough that quenches star formation in halos with\ncircular velocity smaller than 50 km s$^{-1}$, the LF starts to drop at\nabsolute UV magnitude $\\sim -15$, i.e. slightly below the detection limits of\ncurrent (unlensed) surveys at $z\\sim5$. The LFs may rise again at higher\nabsolute UV magnitude, where, as a result of interplay between reionization\nprocess and galaxy formation, most of the galaxy light is from relic stars\nformed before the EoR. We suggest that the galaxy number counts data,\nparticularly in lensed fields, can put strong constraints on reionization\nfeedback. In models with stronger reionization feedback, stars in galaxies with\nabsolute UV magnitude higher than $\\sim -13$ and smaller than $\\sim - 8$ are\ntypically older.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum.

For ekpyrotic models, this mechanism loosens the constraints on\nthe amplitude of the ekpyrotic potential while naturally suppressing the\nintrinsic amount of non-Gaussianity.

For this, we use the model of Del\nPopolo (2009) in combination with observed data from the Romanowsky \\& Fall\n(2012) sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies, the Local Group sample\ncompiled by McConnachie (2012), and the simulation results by Cloet-Osselaer et\nal.

We find that the slope $\\alpha$ flattens monotonically, from\n$\\alpha \\simeq -1 $ at $V_{\\rm rot} \\simeq 250$ km/s, to $\\alpha \\simeq 0 $.\nAfter $V_{\\rm rot}\\simeq 25$ km/s the slope starts to steepen. The steepening\nhappens in the mass range dominated by non-rotationally supported galaxies\n(e.g., dSphs) and depends on the level of offset in the angular momentum of\nrotationally and non-rotationally dominated galaxies. The steepening is a\nconsequence of the decrease in baryons content, and angular momentum in\nspheroidal dwarf galaxies. We finally compare our result to the SPH simulations\nof Di Cintio.

We find that among massive galaxies\n($M_{star}/M_{sun}> 10^{10}$), longer bars tend to reside in inner discs having\na flatter radial profile. Such galaxies show a light deficit in the disc\nsurrounding the bar, within the bar radius and often show a $\\Theta$-shaped\nmorphology. We quantify this deficit and find that among all galaxies explored\nin this study (with $10^{9}<M_{star}/M_{sun}< 10^{11}$), galaxies with a\nstronger bar (i.e. longer and/or with a higher Bar/T) show a more pronounced\ndeficit. We also examine simulation snapshots to confirm and extend results by\nAthanassoula and Misiriotis, showing that as bars evolve they become longer,\nwhile the light deficit in the disc becomes more pronounced. Theoretical\nstudies have predicted that, as a barred galaxy evolves, the bar captures disc\nstars in its immediate neighbourhood so as to make the bar longer, stronger and\nthinner.

GCs formed in a host dwarf galaxy\nwith a total mass of ~ 10^10 M_sun can merge to form a single nuclear GC before\nthe host is completely destroyed by the Galaxy, if they are massive (> 3*10^5\nM_sun) and if they are formed in the inner region (R<400 pc).

This is a tight empirical correlation between the disk\ncentripetal acceleration and that expected from the baryonic component. The\nMDAR holds for most radii probed by disk kinematic tracers, regardless of\ngalaxy mass or surface brightness. The relation has two characteristic\naccelerations; $a_0$, above which all galaxies are baryon-dominated; and\n$a_{\\rm min}$, an effective minimum aceleration probed by kinematic tracers in\nisolated galaxies. We use a simple model to show that these trends arise\nnaturally in $\\Lambda$CDM.

In particular, 85% of the cumulative SFHs are\nfitted to within a maximum error of 5% of the total stellar mass formed, and\n99% to within 10%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the\ncommonly used delayed-tau model, and is superseded only by functions with more\nthan three free parameters.

We further analysed archival data taken in 2000 and 2012.\nResults: We detect the source at 5 GHz and on short baselines at 8 GHz. At 15\nand 24 GHz, the source is below our baseline sensitivity for fringe fitting,\nindicating the lack of prominent compact features. The morphology is that of an\nasymmetric double, with significant diffuse emission. The spectrum between 5\nand 8 GHz is rather steep ($S(\\nu)\\sim\\nu^{-(1.0\\pm0.2)}$).

We find these galaxies to reside in a diverse range of\nenvironments measured by four methods: group membership (whether a galaxy is a\nbrightest group/cluster galaxy, satellite, or isolated), halo mass, large-scale\nmass density (measured over a few Mpc), and local mass density (measured within\nthe $N$th neighbour). The spatially resolved IFS stellar kinematics provide\nrobust measurements of the spin parameter $\\lambda_e$ and enable us to examine\nthe relationship among $\\lambda_e$, $M_*$, and galaxy environment. We find a\nstrong correlation between $\\lambda_e$ and $M_*$, where the average $\\lambda_e$\ndecreases from $\\sim 0.4$ to below 0.1 with increasing mass, and the fraction\nof slow rotators $f_{\\rm slow}$ increases from $\\sim 10$% to 90%. We show for\nthe first time that at fixed $M_*$, there are almost no trends between galaxy\nspin and environment; the apparent kinematic morphology-density relation for\nETGs is therefore primarily driven by $M_*$ and is accounted for by the joint\ncorrelations between $M_*$ and spin, and between $M_*$ and environment.

Our fiducial iHOD halo quenching mock\nalso correctly predicts the differences in the spatial clustering and\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing signals between the more vs. less red galaxy subsamples,\nsplit by the red-sequence ridge-line at fixed stellar mass. Meanwhile, models\nthat tie galaxy colours fully or partially to halo assembly bias have\ndifficulties in matching all these observables simultaneously. Therefore, we\ndemonstrate that the observed environmental dependence of galaxy colours can be\nnaturally explained by the combination of 1) halo quenching and 2) the\nvariation of halo mass function with environment --- an indirect environmental\neffect mediated by two separate physical processes. \n\n"}

Nine of these candidates lie nearby to near-infrared sources,\nboosting their reliability; in six cases the observed line frequency and\nstrength are consistent with expectations given the photometric redshift and\nproperties of the galaxy counterparts.

We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a\nstar-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this\nevolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations. In\nparticular, the model explains how feedback self-regulates the star formation\nrate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star formation\nefficiency.

To explain the\namplitude and the spatial range of galactic conformity two--halo terms or\nassembly bias become important. With the scale dependent correlation\ncoefficients the amplitude and the spatial range of conformity are determined\nfrom galaxy and halo samples. The scale dependent correlation coefficients are\nintroduced as a new descriptive statistic to quantify the correlations between\nproperties of galaxies or halos, depending on the distances to other galaxies\nor halos.

However, many astrophysical systems are contracting\nunder the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between\ndriving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that\nresembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some\ncircumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a\nrate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized\ngas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,\nmagnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than\nwould be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case.

Such maps could be used as\ndynamical diagnostics in the emerging field of \"Galactoseismology\", which\npromises to model the history of interactions between the Milky Way and its\nentourage of satellites, as well examine the density of our dark matter halo.\nAs sensitivity to very low surface brightness features around external galaxies\nincreases, many more examples of such disk oscillations will likely be\nidentified. Statistical samples of such features not only encode detailed\ninformation about interaction rates and mergers, but also about long\nsought-after dark matter halo densities and shapes.

In the plane of halo mass and one assembly variable, the\njoint dependence can be largely described as halo bias increasing outward from\na global minimum. We find it unlikely to have a combination of halo variables\nto absorb all assembly bias effects. We then present the joint dependence of\nhalo bias on two assembly variables at fixed halo mass. The gradient of halo\nbias does not necessarily follow the correlation direction of the two assembly\nvariables and it varies with halo mass. Therefore in general for two correlated\nassembly variables one cannot be used as a proxy for the other in predicting\nhalo assembly bias trend. Finally, halo assembly is found to affect the\nkinematics of haloes. Low-mass haloes formed earlier can have much higher\npairwise velocity dispersion than those of massive haloes. In general, halo\nassembly leads to a correlation between halo bias and halo pairwise velocity\ndistribution, with more strongly clustered haloes having higher pairwise\nvelocity and velocity dispersion.

The dust continuum emission is characterized by a main central core and\ntwo prominent rings at $r = 75\\,$au and $r = 130\\,$au intervaled by two gaps at\nat $r = 62\\,$au and $r = 103\\,$au. The two gaps have different widths and\ndepths, with the inner one being narrower and shallower. We determined the\nsurface density of the millimeter dust grains using the 3D radiative transfer\ndisk code \\textsc{dali}. According to our fiducial model the inner gap is\npartially filled with millimeter grains while the outer gap is largely devoid\nof dust. The inferred surface density is compared to 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations (FARGO-3D) of planet-disk interaction. The outer dust gap is\nconsistent with the presence of a giant planet ($M_{\\rm planet} \\sim\n0.8\\,M_{\\rm Staturn}$); the planet is responsible for the gap opening and for\nthe pile-up of dust at the outer edge of the planet orbit. The simulations also\nshow that the same planet can give origin to the inner gap at $r = 62\\,$au. The\nrelative position of the two dust gaps is close to the 2:1 resonance and we\nhave investigated the possibility of a second planet inside the inner gap. The\nresulting surface density (including location, width and depth of the two dust\ngaps) are in agreement with the observations. The properties of the inner gap\npose a strong constraint to the mass of the inner planet ($M_{\\rm planet} <\n0.1\\,M_{\\rm J}$). In both scenarios (single or pair of planets), the\nhydrodynamical simulations suggest a very low disk viscosity ($\\alpha <\n10^{-4}$). Given the young age of the system (0.5 - 1 Myr), this result implies\nthat the formation of giant planets occurs on a timescale of $\\lesssim$ 1\\,Myr. \n\n"}

The identification of the pre-existing flux rope, and the\nrelationship between the twist contained in the rope and the number of turns\nthe jet experiences, are then vital in understanding the jet-triggering\nmechanism. In this paper, we will perform a detailed analysis of imaging,\nspectral and magnetic field observations of four homologous jets, among which\nthe fourth one releases a twist angle of 2.6$\\pi$. Non-linear force free field\nextrapolation of the photospheric vector magnetic field before the jet eruption\npresents a magnetic configuration with a null point between twisted and open\nfields - a configuration highly in favor of the eruption of solar jets. The\nfact that the jet rotates in the opposite sense of handness to the twist\ncontained in the pre-eruption photospheric magnetic field, confirms the\nunwinding of the twist by the jet's rotational motion.

In our\nsimulation we model the formation of Pop III and Pop II stars along with their\nchemical, mechanical and radiative feedback. We consider both UV and X-ray\nemission from an accreting BH to simulate its radiative feedback. The selected\nhalo has a mass of $\\rm 3 \\times 10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$ at $z=7.5$ and we turn on\nradiative feedback from a MBH seed of $\\rm 10^5~M_{\\odot}$ along with in-situ\nstar formation at $z=12$ when the halo mass reaches well above the atomic\ncooling limit. We find that the MBH accretes only about 2200 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$\nduring 320 Myr and the average mass accretion onto the MBH is a few times $\\rm\n10^{-6}~M_{\\odot}/yr$.

While there can be other signatures of cosmological\nmagnetic fields, a signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) would\nprove their primordial origin. The B-mode polarization of CMB is particularly\npromising in this regard because there are relatively few other sources of\nB-modes, and because the vortical modes sourced by the primordial magnetic\nfield (PMF) survive diffusion damping up to a small fraction of the Silk\nlength. At present, the Planck temperature and polarization spectra combined\nwith the B-mode spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) constrain\nthe PMF strength to be no more than $\\sim 1$ nano-Gauss (nG). Because of the\nquartic scaling of the CMB anisotropy spectra with the PMF strength, this bound\nwill not change by much even with the significantly better measurements of the\nB-mode spectrum by the Stage III and Stage IV CMB experiments.

Unlike for simple spherical accretion, in the case of disk\naccretion feedback processes do not set upper limits on stellar masses.

Though\nthey both have residual flux as luminous as $10^{43}erg/s$, their PDLAs are\nquite different in, e.g., HI column density, metal line absorption strength,\nhigh-ionization absorption lines as well as residual flux strength. For J1456,\nthe HI column density is $20.6\\pm0.2$, with za=2.3138, nearly identical to the\nquasar redshift (z=2.3142) determined from the [OIII] emission line. The\nmetallicity of this system is typical of DLAs and there is high ionization\ntherein, suggesting that the PDLA system is multiphase, putting it in the\nquasar environment. For J2153, we measure the HI column density to be\n$21.5\\pm0.1$ at za=3.511, slightly redshifted with respect to the quasar\n(z=3.490) measured from CIII]. The metallicity of this system is quite low and\nthere is a lack of significant high-ionization absorption lines therein,\nsuggesting that the system is beyond the quasar host galaxy. The residual flux\nis wide (1000 km/s) in J1456, with a significance of $8\\sigma$, while also wide\n(1500 km/s) but with a smaller significance of $3\\sigma$ in J2153. Among many\nexplanations, we find that Lya fuzz or resonant scattering can be used to\nexplain the residual flux in the two sources while partial coverage cannot be\nexcluded for J1456. By comparing these two cases, together with similar cases\nreported previously, we suggest that the strength of the residual flux is\nrelated to properties such as metallicity and high-ionization absorption lines\nof PDLAs. The residual flux recorded upon the PDLA absorption trough opens a\nwindow for us to see the physical conditions and processes of the quasar\nenvironment, and their profile and strength further remind us of their spatial\nscales. \n\n"}

In this study, we investigate the shape alignment of\nsatellite galaxies in galaxy pairs similar to the Local Group identified in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 13 (SDSS DR13).

A significant reduction of the cooling rate and cooling\nflow within 20 kpc from the centre can be achieved with kinetic jets.

A key issue is the proportion of the stellar ionizing\nradiation that escapes the galaxies in which it is produced. Spectroscopy of\ngamma-ray burst afterglows can be used to determine the neutral hydrogen\ncolumn-density in their host galaxies and hence the opacity to extreme\nultra-violet radiation along the lines-of-sight to the bursts. Thus, making the\nreasonable assumption that long-duration GRB locations are representative of\nthe sites of massive stars that dominate EUV production, one can calculate an\naverage escape fraction of ionizing radiation in a way that is independent of\ngalaxy size, luminosity or underlying spectrum. Here we present a sample of NH\nmeasures for 138 GRBs in the range 1.6<z<6.7 and use it to establish an average\nescape fraction at the Lyman limit of <fesc>~0.005, with a 98% confidence upper\nlimit of ~0.015. This analysis suggests that stars provide a small contribution\nto the ionizing radiation budget of the IGM at z<5, where the bulk of the\nbursts lie. At higher redshifts, z>5, firm conclusions are limited by the small\nsize of the GRB sample, but any decline in average HI column-density seems to\nbe modest. We also find no indication of a significant correlation of NH with\ngalaxy UV luminosity or host stellar mass, for the subset of events for which\nthese are available.

In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation\nof relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray\nemission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late\nafterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission\nalone can explain late afterglows. We find that collision between a mildly\nrelativistic outflow from the merger with a Lorentz factor of $\\sim 1.2-3$ and\nthe ISM/circumburst material can explain observations, if the synchrotron\nself-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are\ntaken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary\nto explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here\nand can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its\nencounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly\nmagnetized. The origin for optical extinction could be a dust rich old faint\nstar cluster surrounding the BNS, which had also helped its formation and\nmerger. Such environment evades present observational constraints and is\nconsistent with our conclusions about properties and evolution of the\nprogenitor neutron stars obtained from the prompt gamma-ray. If the synchrotron\nemission was produced by collision between density shells, the extinction might\nhave occurred inside the outflow itself rather than externally. A plausible\nsource of additional X-ray is decay of medium and heavy isotopes produced by\nthe kilonova, including r-processes, and recombination of cooled electrons.\nContribution of these processes should be quantified in future works. \n\n"}

At the time of their formation, the PBHs get attached\nto the strings and influence their evolution, leading to the formation of\nblack-hole-string networks and commonly to the suppression of loop production\nin a range of redshifts. Subsequently, reconnections within the network give\nrise to small nets made of several black holes and connecting strings.

The stacks at $z<0.9$ have luminosity limits as low as\n$10^{40}-10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, a regime in which X-ray binaries (XRBs) can\ndominate the X-ray emission. Comparing the measured luminosities to established\nXRB scaling relations, we find that the redshift evolution of the luminosity\nper star formation rate (SFR) of XRBs depends sensitively on the assumed\nobscuration and may be weaker than previously found. The XRB scaling relation\nbased on stacks from the Chandra Deep Field South overestimates the XRB\ncontribution to the COSMOS high specific SFR (sSFR) stacks, possibly due to a\nbias affecting the CDF-S stacks because of their small galaxy samples. After\nsubtracting the estimated XRB contribution from the stacks, we find that most\nstacks at $z>1.3$ exhibit a significant X-ray excess indicating nuclear\nemission.

Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and\ncentrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a\nprolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation. Ram pressure\nremoves the gas from the group UDGs when they are at pericentre, quenching star\nformation in them and making them redder. This generates a\ncolour/star-formation-rate gradient with distance from the centre, as observed\nin clusters.

A second order effect in the fluid\nequations was recently found to make a significant contribution: an offset\nvelocity between gas and dark matter, the so-called streaming velocity.\nPrevious simulations of a limited number of low-mass dark matter haloes suggest\nthat this streaming velocity can delay the formation of the first stars and\ndecrease halo gas fractions and the halo mass function in the low mass regime.\nHowever, a systematic exploration of its effects in a large sample of haloes\nhas been lacking until now.

First, we\nsearch for signatures of the bias in the determination of $\\alpha$ due to the\nlimited spectral coverage (window effect) expected in the synchrotron case. The\nabsence of such a characteristic signature argues against the simplest\nsynchrotron models. We instead find that the observed correlation between $F$\nand $\\alpha$ can, in general, be described by the relation $F(t) \\propto {\\rm\ne}^{k\\,\\alpha(t)}$, for which the median $k = 3$. We suggest that this\ncorrelation is a manifestation of subphotospheric heating in a flow with a\nvarying entropy. Around the peak of the light curve, a large entropy causes the\nphotosphere to approach the saturation radius, leading to an intense emission\nwith a narrow spectrum. As the entropy decreases the photosphere secedes from\nthe saturation radius, and weaker emission with a broader spectrum is expected.\nThis simple scenario naturally leads to a correlated variation of the intensity\nand spectral shape, covering the observed range. \n\n"}

It is unclear how the properties of the external perturbation and\nthe initial current sheet affect the reconnection region properties, and\nthereby the reconnection dynamics and energy release profile.

In particular, previous work has\nshown that the observed Mbh-Mstar (stellar mass) relation is more strongly\nbiased than the Mbh-sigma (velocity dispersion) relation.

Firstly, we confirm that the\nstar-formation efficiency (SFE) increases close to nuclear coalescence. At\npost-merger stages there is evidence that the SFE declines to values typical of\nellipticals. This trend can be attributed to M(H_2) depletion due to\ninteraction induced star-formation. However, there is significant scatter,\nlikely to arise from differences in the interaction details of individual\nsystems. Secondly, we find that the central molecular hydrogen surface density,\nincreases close to the final stages of the merging of the two nuclei. Such a\ntrend is also predicted by numerical simulations.

We evaluate the rms magnitude of these\neffects for a COBE normalized, scale-invariant spectrum, which is an upper\nlimit on spectra produced by inflation. Previous work has shown that\nlarge-scale structure may cause a relative deflection large enough to affect\nobservations, but we find that the corresponding effect of gravity waves is\nsmaller by $\\sim 10^4$ and so cannot be observed. This results from the\noscillation in time as well as the redshifting of the amplitude of gravity\nwaves.

The blast\nwave generated by a GRB explosion would be washed out by interstellar\nturbulence only after tens of millions of years when it finally slows down to a\nvelocity of 10 km/s. This rather long lifetime implies that there could be up\nto several tens of active GRB remnants in each galaxy at any given time.

Due to the\nrelative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the\nplanetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic precessions, which affect the\nnodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^3, are of the\norder of 10^-3 arcseconds per century only for, e.g., Mercury. This value lies\njust at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing\nthe planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and\nBepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main\nsources of systematic errors. They are the aliasing classical precessions\ninduced by the multipolar expansion of the Sun's gravitational potential and\nthe classical secular N-body precessions which are of the same order of\nmagnitude or much larger than the Lense-Thirring precessions of interest.

I very briefly mention a number of particle physics mechanisms\nfor generating magnetic fields in the early universe, but the emphasis is on a\nreview of the field theoretic aspects of the developments of these fields,\nmainly on the occurence of inverse cascades, i.e. generation of order from\ndisorder in the sense of transfer of energy from smaller to larger scales.

A unified\ndescription of gravitational and matter fluctuations is crucial in order to\ndetermine the strength of the instability. To extract specific signatures of\nthe oscillating inflaton field during reheating, it is essential to focus on a\nvariable describing metric fluctuations which is constant in the standard\nanalyses of inflation. When doing this in the case of a massive inflaton\nwithout self coupling, we find no additional growth of super-horizon modes\nduring reheating beyond what the usual analyses of the growth of fluctuations\npredict. However, for a massless self coupled inflaton, there is an initial\nincrease in the value of the gravitational potential, which may lead to\ndifferent predictions for observations. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0305237", "contents": "Title: Anisotropic Inflation and the Origin of Four Large Dimensions Abstract: In the context of (4+d)-dimensional general relativity, we propose an\ninflationary scenario wherein 3 spatial dimensions grow large, while d extra\ndimensions remain small. Our model requires that a self-interacting d-form\nacquire a vacuum expectation value along the extra dimensions. This causes 3\nspatial dimensions to inflate, whilst keeping the size of the extra dimensions\nnearly constant. We do not require an additional stabilization mechanism for\nthe radion, as stable solutions exist for flat, and for negatively curved\ncompact extra dimensions. From a four-dimensional perspective, the radion does\nnot couple to the inflaton; and, the small amplitude of the CMB temperature\nanisotropies arises from an exponential suppression of fluctuations, due to the\nhigher-dimensional origin of the inflaton. The mechanism triggering the end of\ninflation is responsible, both, for heating the universe, and for avoiding\nviolations of the equivalence principle due to coupling between the radion and\nmatter. \n\n"}

The local point of view is preferred by holography and\nnaturally picks out a simple probability measure. It is insensitive to large\nexpansion factors or lifetimes, and so resolves a recently noted paradox. Any\ncosmological measure must be complemented with the probability for observers to\nemerge in a given vacuum. In lieu of anthropic criteria, I propose to estimate\nthis by the entropy that can be produced in a local patch. This allows for\nprior-free predictions. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0703190", "contents": "Title: Charting the Landscape of Modified Gravity Abstract: We explore brane induced gravity on a 3-brane in six locally flat dimensions.\nTo regulate the short distance singularities in the brane core, we resolve the\nthin brane by a cylindrical 4-brane, with the geometry of 4D Minkowski $\\times$\na circle, which has an axion flux to cancel the vacuum pressure in the compact\ndirection. We discover a large diversity of possible solutions controlled by\nthe axion flux, as governed by its boundary conditions. Hence brane induced\ngravity models really give rise to a {\\it landscape} of vacua, at least\nsemiclassically. For sub-critical tensions, the crossover scale, below which\ngravity may look 4D, and the effective 4D gravitational coupling are sensitive\nto vacuum energy. This shows how the vacuum energy problem manifests in brane\ninduced gravity: instead of tuning the 4D curvature, generically one must tune\nthe crossover scale. On the other hand, in the near-critical limit, branes live\ninside very deep throats which efficiently compactify the angular dimension. In\nthere, 4D gravity first changes to $5D$, and only later to $6D$. The crossover\nscale saturates at the gravitational see-saw scale, independent of the tension.\nUsing the fields of static loops on a wrapped brane, we check the perturbative\ndescription of long range gravity below the crossover scale. In sub-critical\ncases the scalars are strongly coupled already at the crossover scale even in\nthe vacuum, because the brane bending is turned on by the axion flux. Near the\ncritical limit, linearized perturbation theory remains under control below the\ncrossover scale, and we find that linearized gravity around the vacuum looks\nlike a scalar-tensor theory. \n\n"}

We find that energy transport from high pt jets\nof gluons to the medium leads to a transient, exponential inflation of the\nfireballs created in high energy heavy ion collisions. In this transient,\ninflatory period, the slopes of the single particle spectra increase, while the\nHBT radius parameters decrease exponentially with time. This effect is shown to\nbe similar to the development of the homogeneity of our Universe due to an\ninflatory period. Independently of the initial conditions, and the exact value\nof the freeze-out time and temperature, the meausurables (single particle\nspectra, the correlation functions, the slope parameters, elliptic flow, HBT\nradii and cross terms) become time independent during the late, non-inflatory\nstages of the expansion, and they satisfy new kind of scaling laws.
