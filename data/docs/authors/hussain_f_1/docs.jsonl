The fast roll stage leads to a purely\nattractive potential for the curvature and tensor perturbations (this potential\nis purely repulsive in slowroll). This attractive potential depresses the CMB\nquadrupole moment for the curvature and B-mode spectra. A single new\ncosmological parameter emerges: the comoving wavenumber k_1 characteristic\nscale of this attractive potential.k_1 happens to exit the horizon precisely at\nthe transition from fast to slowroll.The fastroll stage dynamically modifies\nthe initial power spectrum by a transfer function D(k). We compute D(k) by\nsolving the inflaton evolution equations. D(k) suppresses the primordial power\nfor k < k_1 and enjoys the scaling property D(k) = Psi(k/k_1) where Psi(x) is\nan universal function. We perform a MCMC analysis of the WMAP/SDSS data\nincluding the fast-roll stage and find k_1 = 0.266/Gpc. The quadrupole mode k_Q\n= 0.242/Gpc exits the horizon 1/10 of an efold before k_1.

We fix a regularized measure and\nshow that every trajectory of effective average actions, depending on an IR\ncutoff only, induces an associated trajectory of bare actions which depend on a\nUV cutoff. Together with the regularized measure these bare actions give rise\nto a functional integral which reproduces the prescribed effective action when\nthe UV cutoff is removed. In this way we are able to reconstruct the underlying\nmicroscopic (\"classical\") system and identify its fundamental degrees of\nfreedom and interactions. The bare action of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation is\ncomputed and its flow is analyzed as an example. Various conceptual issues\nrelated to the completion of the asymptotic safety program are discussed. \n\n"}

By adopting suitable representations of\nthe Dirac matrices in higher dimensions, we pursue the investigation of which\nhigher dimensional space-times and which mass-shell relation concerning\nmassless Dirac equations in higher dimensions may induce massive spinors in\nD=1+3. The mixing of the chiral fermions in higher dimensions may induce a\nmechanism such that four massive Majorana fermions may show up and, at an\nappropriate limit an almost zero and a huge mass show up with corresponding\nleft-handed and right-handed eigenstates. This mechanism, in a peculiar way,\ncould reassess the See-Saw scheme associated to neutrino with Majorana-type\nmasses. Remarkably the masses of the particles are fixed by the dimension\ndecoupling/reduction scheme based on the mass Lorentz invariant term, where one\nset of the decoupled dimensions are the \"target\" coordinates frame and the\nother set of coordinates is the composing block of the mass term in lower\ndimensions.

The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the\nscale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the\ncosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the\nsize of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the\norder (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.\nThe mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is\nprotected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to\nordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the\nquintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very\nsmall, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which\navoids stringent fifth-force constraints.

Abstract: Much of the discussion regarding future measurements of the Higgs boson mass\nand self-coupling is focussed on how well various collider options can do. In\nthis article we ask a physics-based question of how well do we need colliders\nto measure these quantities to have an impact on discovery of new physics or an\nimpact in how we understand the role of the Higgs boson in nature. We address\nthe question within the framework of the Standard Model and various beyond the\nStandard Model scenarios, including supersymmetry and theories of composite\nHiggs bosons. We conclude that the LHC's stated ability to measure the Higgs\nboson to better than 150 MeV will be as good as we will ever need to know the\nHiggs boson mass in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, we estimate that\nthe self-coupling will likely need to be measured to better than 20 percent to\nsee a deviation from the Standard Model expectation.

Although\nthis matter is initially far from equilibrium, we find that the equilibrium\nexpression for heavy quark energy loss in a homogeneous strongly coupled plasma\nwith the same instantaneous energy density or pressure as that at the location\nof the quark describes many qualitative features of our results. One\ninteresting exception is that there is a time delay after the initial collision\nbefore the heavy quark energy loss becomes significant. At later times, once a\nliquid plasma described by viscous hydrodynamics has formed, expressions based\nupon assuming instantaneous homogeneity and equilibrium provide a\nsemi-quantitative description of our results - as long as the rapidity of the\nheavy quark is not too large. For a heavy quark with large rapidity, the\ngradients in the velocity of the hydrodynamic fluid result in qualitative\nconsequences for the 'drag' force acting on the quark. In certain\ncircumstances, the force required to drag the quark through the plasma can\npoint opposite to the velocity of the quark, meaning that the force that the\nplasma exerts on a quark moving through it acts in the same direction as its\nvelocity.

These two symmetries are connected by fermionic\nsupercharges. The system includes an internal gauge connection 1-form $A$, a\nspin-1/2 Dirac spinor $\\psi$, the Lorentz connection $\\omega$, and the vielbein\n$e$. The connection one-form is in the adjoint representation of G, while\n$\\psi$ is in the fundamental. In contrast to standard supergravity, the metric\nis not a fundamental field and is in the center of the superalgebra: it is not\nonly invariant under the internal gauge group and under Lorentz\ntransformations, but is also invariant under supersymmetry. The features of\nthis theory that mark the difference with standard supersymmetry are: A) The\nnumber of fermionic and bosonic states is not necessarily the same; B) There\nare no superpartners with equal mass, \"bosoninos\", sleptons and squarks are\nabsent; C) Although this supersymmetry originates in a local gauge theory and\ngravity is included, there is no gravitino; D) Fermions acquire mass from their\ncoupling to the background or from self-couplings, while bosons remain\nmassless.

The Renyi entropies S_n are evaluated for a single interval using\nthe two point function of bosonic twist fields on a torus. For the case of the\ncompact boson, the sum over the classical saddle points results in the\nRiemann-Siegel theta function associated with the A_{n-1} lattice. We then\nstudy the Renyi entropies in the decompactification regime. We show that in the\nlimit when the size of the interval becomes the size of the spatial circle, the\nentanglement entropy reduces to the thermal entropy of free bosons on a circle.\nWe then set up a systematic high temperature expansion of the Renyi entropies\nand evaluate the finite size corrections for free bosons. Finally we compare\nthese finite size corrections both for the free boson CFT and the free fermion\nCFT with the one-loop corrections obtained from bulk three dimensional\nhandlebody spacetimes which have higher genus Riemann surfaces as its boundary.\nOne-loop corrections in these geometries are entirely determined by quantum\nnumbers of the excitations present in the bulk.

Since the scalaron\noscillates excessively many times in its potential, which has a quadratic\nminimum and is a little shallower than quadratic on the positive side, it may\nfragment into long-living localized objects, called oscillons or I-balls, due\nto nonlinear growth of fluctuations before reheating of the universe.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity. \n\n"}

An\nappropriately chosen unitary operator in the boundary theory can create a\nlocally strong excitation near the black hole horizon, whose global energy is\nsmall as a result of the gravitational redshift. The paradox is that this seems\nto violate a general rule of statistical mechanics, which states that an\noperator with energy parametrically smaller than $k T$ cannot create a\nsignificant excitation in a thermal system. When we carefully examine the\nposition dependence of the boundary unitary operator that produces the\nexcitation and the bulk observable necessary to detect the anomalously large\neffect, we find that they do not both fit in a single causal patch. This\nfollows from a remarkable property of position space AdS correlators that we\nestablish explicitly, and resolves the paradox in a generic state of the\nsystem, since no combination of observers can both create the excitation and\nobserve its effect. As a special case of our analysis, we show how this\nresolves the \"Born rule\" paradox of arXiv:1506.01337 and we verify our solution\nusing an independent calculation. We then consider boundary states that are\nfinely tuned to display a spontaneous excitation outside the causal patch of\nthe infalling observer, and we propose a version of causal patch\ncomplementarity in AdS/CFT that resolves the paradox for such states as well. \n\n"}

It was previously shown by one of us that such gedanken experiments\ncannot succeed for test particle matter entering an extremal Kerr-Newman black\nhole.

An\nextensively studied example is that of massive neutrinos, which are known to\nproduce a suppression in the matter power spectrum due to their free streaming.\nGalaxies, as biased traces of matter fluctuations, can therefore provide us\nwith a wealth of information about both known and unknown degrees of freedom in\nthe standard model. To harness this information, however, the galaxy bias has\nto be determined in the presence of massive relics, which is expected to vary\nwith scale. Here we present the code RelicFast, which efficiently computes the\nscale-dependent bias induced by relics of different masses, spins, and\ntemperatures, through spherical collapse and the peak-background split.

One example is known in five\nspacetime dimensions, within the toroidal compactification of type IIB string\ntheory. Such special solution is allowed by the existence of a Chern-Simons\ncoupling in the Supergravity theory and by the possibility of imposing a self\nduality condition on the `rotation 2-form'. We explore three peculiar features\nof such black holes: 1) Oxidising to D=10 the five dimensional configuration\nmay be interpreted as a system of $D1-D5$ branes with a Brinkmann wave\npropagating along their worldvolume. Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Klein\ncompactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has no\ncausality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higher\ndimensions. From the dual SCFT viewpoint, the causality bound for the\ncompactified spacetime arises as the unitarity bound; 2) The vanishing of the\nscattering cross section for uncharged scalars and sufficiently high angular\nmomentum of the background is shown still to hold at the level of charged\ninteractions.

This may\nplay a role in displaying the symmetries and constructing the dynamics of\nlittle understood systems, such as M-theory. 2T physics describes various 1T\ndynamical systems as different d-dimensional ``holographic'' views of the same\n2T system in $d+2$ dimensions. The ``holography'' is due to gauge symmetries\nthat tend to reduce the number of effective dimensions. Different 1T evolutions\n(i.e. different Hamiltonians) emerge from the same 2T theory when gauge fixing\nis done with different embeddings of d dimensions inside d+2 dimensions. Thus,\nin the 2T setting, the distinguished 1T which we call ``time'' is a gauge\ndependent concept. The 2T action has also a global SO(d,2) symmetry in flat\nspacetime, or a more general d+2 symmetry in curved spacetime, under which all\ndimensions are on an equal footing. This symmetry is observable in many 1T\nsystems, but it remained unknown until discovered in the 2T formalism. 2T\nphysics has mainly been developed in the context of particles, including spin\nand supersymmetry, but some advances have also been made with strings and\np-branes, and insights for M-theory have already emerged.

{"id": "hep-th/0312117", "contents": "Title: Massive Gravity on a Brane Abstract: At present no theory of a massive graviton is known that is consistent with\nexperiments at both long and short distances. The problem is that consistency\nwith long distance experiments requires the graviton mass to be very small.\nSuch a small graviton mass however implies an ultraviolet cutoff for the theory\nat length scales far larger than the millimeter scale at which gravity has\nalready been measured. In this paper we attempt to construct a model which\navoids this problem. We consider a brane world setup in warped AdS spacetime\nand we investigate the consequences of writing a mass term for the graviton on\na the infrared brane where the local cutoff is of order a large (galactic)\ndistance scale. The advantage of this setup is that the low cutoff for physics\non the infrared brane does not significantly affect the predictivity of the\ntheory for observers localized on the ultraviolet brane. For such observers the\npredictions of this theory agree with general relativity at distances smaller\nthan the infrared scale but go over to those of a theory of massive gravity at\nlonger distances. A careful analysis of the graviton two-point function,\nhowever, reveals the presence of a ghost in the low energy spectrum. A mode\ndecomposition of the higher dimensional theory reveals that the ghost\ncorresponds to the radion field. We also investigate the theory with a brane\nlocalized mass for the graviton on the ultraviolet brane, and show that the\nphysics of this case is similar to that of a conventional four dimensional\ntheory with a massive graviton, but with one important difference: when the\ninfrared brane decouples and the would-be massive graviton gets heavier than\nthe regular Kaluza--Klein modes, it becomes unstable and it has a finite width\nto decay off the brane into the continuum of Kaluza-Klein states. \n\n"}

This gives rise to a duality principle at the\ndynamical level which emphasizes the significance of the underlying translocal\nstructure for modelling a minimal algebra around a given point.

{"id": "nucl-th/0503030", "contents": "Title: Semileptonic Decays of Heavy Lambda Baryons in a Quark Model Abstract: The semileptonic decays of Lambda_c and Lambda_b are treated in the framework\nof a constituent quark model. Both nonrelativistic and semirelativistic\nHamiltonians are used to obtain the baryon wave functions from a fit to the\nspectra, and the wave functions are expanded in both the harmonic oscillator\nand Sturmian bases. The latter basis leads to form factors in which the\nkinematic dependence on q^2 is in the form of multipoles, and the resulting\nform factors fall faster as a function of q^2 in the available kinematic\nranges. As a result, decay rates obtained in the two models using the Sturmian\nbasis are significantly smaller than those obtained using the harmonic\noscillator basis. In the case of the Lambda_c, decay rates calculated using the\nSturmian basis are closer to the experimentally reported rates. However, we\nfind a semileptonic branching fraction for the Lambda_c to decay to excited\nLambda* states of 11% to 19%, in contradiction with what is assumed in\navailable experimental analyses. Our prediction for the Lambda_b semileptonic\ndecays is that decays to the ground state Lambda_c provide a little less than\n70% of the total semileptonic decay rate. For the decays Lambda_b to Lambda_c,\nthe analytic form factors we obtain satisfy the relations expected from\nheavy-quark effective theory at the non-recoil point, at leading and\nnext-to-leading orders in the heavy-quark expansion. In addition, some features\nof the heavy-quark limit are shown to naturally persist as the mass of the\nheavy quark in the daughter baryon is decreased. \n\n"}

On the dynamical mismatch between de\n  Broglie-Bohm and classical dynamics in semiclassical systems Abstract: The de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics aims to give a\nrealist description of quantum phenomena in terms of the motion of point-like\nparticles following well-defined trajectories. This work is concerned by the de\nBroglie-Bohm account of the properties of semiclassical systems. Semiclassical\nsystems are quantum systems that display the manifestation of classical\ntrajectories: the wavefunction and the observable properties of such systems\ndepend on the trajectories of the classical counterpart of the quantum system.\nFor example the quantum properties have a regular or disordered aspect\ndepending on whether the underlying classical system has regular or chaotic\ndynamics. In contrast, Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems have\nlittle in common with the trajectories of the classical counterpart, creating a\ndynamical mismatch relative to the quantum-classical correspondence visible in\nthese systems. Our aim is to describe this mismatch (explicit illustrations are\ngiven), explain its origin, and examine some of the consequences on the status\nof Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems. We argue in particular that\nsemiclassical systems put stronger constraints on the empirical acceptability\nand plausibility of Bohmian trajectories because the usual arguments given to\ndismiss the mismatch between the classical and the de Broglie-Bohm motions are\nweakened by the occurrence of classical trajectories in the quantum\nwavefunction of such systems. \n\n"}

It is therefore interesting to combine\nsome, if not all, of Feynman's papers into one. The first of his three papers\nis on the ``rest of the universe'' contained in his 1972 book on statistical\nmechanics. The second idea is Feynman's parton picture which he presented in\n1969 at the Stony Brook conference on high-energy physics. The third idea is\ncontained in the 1971 paper he published with his students, where they show\nthat the hadronic spectra on Regge trajectories are manifestations of\nharmonic-oscillator degeneracies. In this report, we formulate these three\nideas using the mathematics of two coupled oscillators. It is shown that the\nidea of entanglement is contained in his rest of the universe, and can be\nextended to a space-time entanglement. It is shown also that his parton model\nand the static quark model can be combined into one Lorentz-covariant entity.\nFurthermore, Einstein's special relativity, based on the Lorentz group, can\nalso be formulated within the mathematical framework of two coupled\noscillators. \n\n"}
