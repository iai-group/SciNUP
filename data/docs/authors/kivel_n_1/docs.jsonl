Two phenomena\ncontribute to the width: the Landau damping phenomenon and the break-up of a\ncolour-singlet bound state into a colour-octet heavy quark-antiquark pair by\nabsorption of a thermal gluon. In the paper, we investigate the relation\nbetween the singlet-to-octet thermal break-up and the so-called\ngluo-dissociation, a mechanism for quarkonium dissociation widely used in\nphenomenological approaches. The gluo-dissociation thermal width is obtained by\nconvoluting the gluon thermal distribution with the cross section of a gluon\nand a 1S quarkonium state to a colour octet quark-antiquark state in vacuum, a\ncross section that at leading order, but neglecting colour-octet effects, was\ncomputed long ago by Bhanot and Peskin. We will, first, show that the effective\nfield theory framework provides a natural derivation of the gluo-dissociation\nfactorization formula at leading order, which is, indeed, the singlet-to-octet\nthermal break-up expression. Second, the singlet-to-octet thermal break-up\nexpression will allow us to improve the Bhanot--Peskin cross section by\nincluding the contribution of the octet potential, which amounts to include\nfinal-state interactions between the heavy quark and antiquark. Finally, we\nwill quantify the effects due to final-state interactions on the\ngluo-dissociation cross section and on the quarkonium thermal width. \n\n"}

Resummation follows after one factorizes the cross\nsection into the rele- vant modes. The class of observables which are sensitive\nto soft recoil effects are particularly challenging to factorize and resum\nsince they involve rapidity logarithms. In this paper we will present a\nformalism which allows one to factorize and resum the perturbative series for\nsuch observables in a systematic fashion through the notion of a \"rapidity\nrenormalization group\". That is, a Collin-Soper like equation is realized as a\nrenormalization group equation, but has a more universal applicability to\nobservables beyond the traditional transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistribution functions (TMDPDFs) and the Sudakov form factor. This formalism\nhas the feature that it allows one to track the (non-standard) scheme\ndependence which is inherent in any scenario where one performs a resummation\nof rapidity divergences.

We compute the\nleading order jet functions and find that the convolution integrals over the\nsoft fractions are logarithmically divergent. This divergency is the\nconsequence of the boost invariance and does not depend on the model of the\nsoft correlation function describing the soft spectator quarks. Using as\nexample a two-loop diagram we demonstrated that such a divergency corresponds\nto the overlap of the soft and collinear regions.

In particular, we study deviations of\nthe Friedmann equation, propagation of gravitational waves, and investigate\nwhether any of the scalar fields in this model could play the role of the\ninflaton. \n\n"}

Then we make predictions that when N_f is within the\nconformal window, the propagator of a meson G(t) behaves at large t, as G(t) =\nc exp(-m_H t)/t^alpha, that is, a modified Yukawa-type decay form, instead of\nthe usual exponential decay form in the small quark mass region. This holds on\nan any lattice for any coupling constant g, as far as g is between 0 and g^*,\nwhere g^* is the IR fixed point. We verify that numerical results really\nsatisfy the predictions for the N_f=7 case and the N_f=16 case.\n  Thirdly, we discuss small number of flavors (N_f=2 sim 6) QCD at finite\ntemperatures. We point out theoretically and verify numerically that the\ncorrelation functions at T/T_c > 1 exhibit the characteristics of the conformal\nfunction with IR cutoff, an exponential decay with power correction.\n  Further, we observe our data are consistent with the picture that the N_f=7\ncase and the N_f=2 at T sim 2 T_c case are close to the meson unparticle model,\nand we estimate gamma^* = 1.2(1). On the other hand, the N_f=16 case and the\nN_f=2 at T= 10^2 sim 10^5 Tc cases are close to a free state in the Z(3)\ntwisted vacuum.

Depending\non the distance of the source, the Universe should be opaque to VHE photons\nabove a certain energy.

An\nexplanation might be the oscillation of VHE photons into hypothetical\naxion-like particles (ALPs) in ambient magnetic fields.

We have also considered the upper bounds on the annihilation\ncross section from Fermi LAT data on dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and extracted\nspecific examples with mass in the range 8-50 GeV that could account for the\napparent low-energy excess in the gamma-ray emission at the Galactic Centre.\nThen, we have computed the theoretical predictions for the elastic scattering\ncross-section of RH sneutrinos.

The high-$Q^2$ processes\nassociated with the QCD evolution of the jet from production as a single hard\nparton through its fragmentation, up to but not including hadronization, are\ntreated perturbatively. The interactions between the partons in the shower and\nthe deconfined matter within which they find themselves lead to energy loss.\nThe momentum scales associated with the medium (of the order of the\ntemperature) and with typical interactions between partons in the shower and\nthe medium are sufficiently soft that strongly coupled physics plays an\nimportant role in energy loss. We model these interactions using qualitative\ninsights from holographic calculations of the energy loss of energetic light\nquarks and gluons in a strongly coupled plasma, obtained via gauge/gravity\nduality. We embed this hybrid model into a hydrodynamic description of the\nspacetime evolution of the hot QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions and\nconfront its predictions with jet data from the LHC. The holographic expression\nfor the energy loss of a light quark or gluon that we incorporate in our hybrid\nmodel is parametrized by a stopping distance.

We focus\non the case of mixed cold dark matter and massive neutrinos, although our\napproach is applicable also to a single warm dark matter species. In order to\ncapture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small\nscales, we account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space\ndistribution using the Vlaslov equation, and derive from it a formal\nclosed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic\nperturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to\nthe neutrino density contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed\nneutrino momentum distribution. We calculate the leading-order total matter\nbispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark, we\ntest the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in\nperturbative and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that\ncombines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid\nequations. Aiming at $\\lesssim1%$ accuracy, we find that the total matter\nbispectrum with a low neutrino mass m=0.046 eV can be reproduced by all but the\nfluid approximation, while for larger neutrino masses m=0.46-0.93 eV only the\nhybrid approach has the desired accuracy on a large range of scales.

All of the approximation schemes fail to reproduce the\nbispectrum of the neutrino density perturbations at better than 20% accuracy\nacross all scales, indicating that an exact treatment of nonlinear neutrino\nperturbations is necessary. \n\n"}

In its simplest incarnation,\nthe relaxion mechanism requires nothing beyond the standard model other than an\naxion (the relaxion field) and an inflaton. In this note, we critically\nre-examine the requirements for successfully realizing the relaxion mechanism\nand point out that parametrically larger field excursions can be obtained for a\ngiven number of e-folds by simply requiring that the background break exact de\nSitter invariance. We discuss several corollaries of this observation,\nincluding the interplay between the upper bound on the scale $M$ and the order\nparameter $\\epsilon$ associated with the breaking of dS symmetry, and entertain\nthe possibility that the relaxion could play the role of a curvaton.

The PCA procedure finds two dominant contributions to the\ntwo-particle correlation function. The leading component is identified with the\nevent plane $v_n(p_T)$, while the subleading component is responsible for\nfactorization breaking in hydrodynamics. For $v_0$, $v_1$, and $v_3$ the\nsubleading flow is a response to the radial excitation of the corresponding\neccentricity. By contrast, for $v_2$ the subleading flow in \\emph{peripheral\ncollisions} is dominated by the nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic\nflow and radial flow fluctuations. In the $v_2$ case, the sub-sub-leading mode\nmore closely reflects the response to the radial excitation of $\\varepsilon_2$.\nA consequence of this picture is that the elliptic flow fluctuations and\nfactorization breaking change rapidly with centrality, and in central\ncollisions (where the leading $v_2$ is small and nonlinear effects can be\nneglected) the subsub-leading mode becomes important. Radial flow fluctuations\nand nonlinear mixing also play a significant role in the factorization breaking\nof $v_4$ and $v_5$.

The BW projector is of the order\n$\\partial ^{2j}$ in the derivatives, and so are the related spin-j wave\nequations and associated Lagrangians. High order differential equations can not\nbe consistently gauged, and allow several unphysical aspects, such as\nnon-locality, acausality, ghosts and etc to enter the theory.

So far, most studies have relied on\na mapping of the quantum dynamics onto a classical-statistical theory that can\nbe simulated on a computer.

Motivated by\nthose observations we consider a model which predicts spontaneous violation of\nCP at high temperature and restoration of CP at present temperature of the\nUniverse. In addition we propose a dark matter (DM) candidate that meets all\nknown properties of DM. Looking for a minimal model that satisfies the above\nconditions leads us to extending the Standard Model (SM) of fundamental\ninteractions by adding a complex singlet scalar $S$. We impose the $CP$ and\n$Z_2$ symmetries on the scalar potential. With the complex vacuum expectation\nvalue of $S$ at the temperature higher than the EW phase transition, the $CP$\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken and a strong first-order electro-weak phase\ntransition is easily realized. Introducing a dimension-6 effective operator\nthat gives new complex contributions to the top quark mass, we show that it is\neasy to yield the observed baryon asymmetry in our Universe. On the other hand,\nthe $CP$ and $Z_2$ symmetries are recovered after the EW phase transition so\nthat the present strong constraints on $CP$ violation can be satisfied and the\nlighter of $\\Re S$ or $\\Im S$ can be the dark matter candidate.

The latter tries to avoid the infrared\ninstabilities of the former by matching the full theory to an effective theory\nthat has been studied on the lattice. We point out a limitation of DR that\ncaused a large apparent disagreement with the effective potential results in\nour previous work.

The low temperature phase\nhas a free energy of order one, and is characterized by a stringy (Hagedorn)\ngrowth in its density of states. The high temperature phase has a free energy\nof order N^2.

In effective field theory, the dominant\nuncertainties in all neutrino-deuteron reactions can be expressed through a\nsingle, common, isovector axial two-body current parameterized by $L_{1,A}$.\nAfter briefly reviewing the status of fixing $L_{1,A}$ experimentally, we\npresent a constraint on $L_{1,A}$ imposed by existing reactor\nantineutrino-deuteron breakup data. This constraint alone leads to an\nuncertainty of 6-7% at 7 MeV neutrino energy in the cross-sections relevant to\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.

We exactly integrate out irrelevant quark modes and hard\ngluon modes in the functional integral representation of the QCD partition\nfunction. Depending on the specific choice for $\\Lambda_q$ and $\\Lambda_g$, the\nresulting effective action contains well-known effective actions for hot and/or\ndense quark matter, for instance the ``Hard Thermal Loop'' or the ``Hard Dense\nLoop'' action, as well as the high-density effective theory proposed by Hong\nand others. We then apply our effective action to review the calculation of the\ncolor-superconducting gap parameter to subleading order in weak coupling, where\nthe strong coupling constant $g \\ll 1$. In this situation, relevant quark modes\nare those within a layer of thickness $2 \\Lambda_q$ around the Fermi surface.\nThe non-perturbative nature of the gap equation invalidates naive attempts to\nestimate the importance of the various contributions via power counting on the\nlevel of the effective action.
