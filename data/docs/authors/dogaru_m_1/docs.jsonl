This allows us to define a dynamical, i.e. s-dependent, vector meson\nmixing scheme.

Stable particles with\ncharge -2, bound with primordial helium in O-helium \"atoms\" (OHe), represent a\nspecific nuclear-interacting form of dark matter. Slowed down in the\nterrestrial matter, OHe is elusive for direct methods of underground Dark\nmatter detection using its nuclear recoil. However, low energy binding of OHe\nwith sodium nuclei can lead to annual variations of energy release from OHe\nradiative capture in the interval of energy 2-4 keV in DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA\nexperiments. At nuclear parameters, reproducing DAMA results, the energy\nrelease predicted for detectors with chemical content other than NaI differ in\nthe most cases from the one in DAMA detector. Moreover there is no bound\nsystems of OHe with light and heavy nuclei, so that there is no radiative\ncapture of OHe in detectors with xenon or helium content. Due to dipole Coulomb\nbarrier, transitions to more energetic levels of Na+OHe system with much higher\nenergy release are suppressed in the correspondence with the results of DAMA\nexperiments.

In that case each individual mass\neigenstate can be either Dirac or Majorana, so that the flavor eigenstates are\n\"large\" admixtures of both. An example of this \"bimodal\" situation is to\nconsider one mass state as a Dirac particle (with a sterile partner), while the\nother two are of Majorana type. Since only Majorana particles contribute to\nneutrinoless double beta decay, the usual dependence of this observable on the\nneutrino mass is modified within this scenario.

{"id": "1106.1937", "contents": "Title: Novel technique for supernova detection with IceCube Abstract: The current supernova detection technique used in IceCube relies on the\nsudden deviation of the summed photomultiplier noise rate from its nominal\nvalue during the neutrino burst, making IceCube a $\\approx 3$ Megaton effective\ndetection volume - class supernova detector. While galactic supernovae can be\nresolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains\nunconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to\nsupernova core collapse models.\n  The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect\nsupernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and\ntime. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented\ndetector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume\nfor such coincidental hits is much smaller ($\\gtrsim 35\\,$kton, about the scale\nof SuperK), a wealth of information is obtained due to the comparatively low\ncoincidental noise rate. We demonstrate that a neutrino flux from a core\ncollapse supernova will produce a signature enabling the resolution of rough\nspectral features and, in the case of a strong signal, providing indication on\nits location.\n  We further discuss the enhanced potential of a rather modest detector\nextension, a denser array in the center of IceCube, within our one dimensional\nanalytic calculation framework. Such an extension would enable the exploration\nof the neutrino sky above a few GeV and the detection of supernovae up to a few\n100's of kilo parsec. However, a $3-4\\,$Mpc detection distance, necessary for\nroutine supernova detection, demands a significant increase of the effective\ndetection volume and can be obtained only with a more ambitious instrument,\nparticularly the boosting of sensor parameters such as the quantum efficiency\nand light collection area. \n\n"}

With the aid of this formalism, we take a fresh look at the\nbehaviours of the charged-pion elastic form factor and of the form factors\nentering in the transitions of the ground-state neutral unflavoured\npseudoscalar mesons pi^0, eta, eta' to one real and one virtual photon within a\nbroad range of momentum transfers Q^2. The uncertainties induced by the\napproximations inherent to this local-duality approach are estimated by\nstudying, in parallel to QCD, quantum-mechanical potential models, where the\nexact form factors, obtained by solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation, may be\ncompared with the corresponding local-duality sum-rule results. For Q^2 larger\nthan 5-6 GeV^2, we judge the predictions of the simplest local-duality model to\nbe reliable and expect their accuracy to improve very fast with increasing Q^2.\nThe large-Q^2 prediction for the pion elastic form factor should be approached\nalready at moderate momentum transfer squared of approximately 4-8 GeV^2; large\ndeviations from its local-duality behaviour for Q^2 = 20-50 GeV^2, predicted by\nsome hadron-structure models, seem rather unlikely.

For low or\nmoderate values of $\\tan\\beta$, the strongest constraints are those imposed by\ndirect searches, and therefore, large areas of the parameter space are still\nallowed. In the large $\\tan \\beta$ limit, however, the $B$-physics constraints\nare more restrictive, effectively forcing the squark and gluino masses to lie\nclose to or above a TeV. A light Higgs boson could dramatically change the\nallowed parameter space, but we need to know its mass precisely for this to be\neffective. We emphasize that it is still too early to write off the cMSSM, even\nin the large $\\tan\\beta$ limit. Finally we explore strategies to extend the LHC\nsearch for cMSSM signals beyond the present reach of the ATLAS and CMS\nCollaborations. \n\n"}

(a) Bounds from\nrates are used to constrain parameters, such as coupling constants and masses.\nThese constraints can be easily updated by simple scalings, if the experimental\nsituations change. (b) The muon g-2 data favors non-chiral interactions. (c) In\n\\mu -> 3 e and \\mu N -> e N processes, Z-penguin diagrams may play some role,\nwhile box diagrams contributions are usually highly constrained. (d) In the\nfirst case (without any built-in cancellation mechanism), using the recent \\mu\n-> e\\gamma bound, we find that \\mu -> 3e and \\mu N -> e N rates are bounded\nbelow the present experimental limits by two to three orders of magnitudes in\ngeneral.

Recently Qian et al. have\nclaimed that this goal may be impeded by the strong dependence of the\ndifference parameter RL+PV on the reactor neutrino flux and on slight\nvariations of Delta M^2_32. We demonstrate that this effect results from a\nspurious dependence of the difference parameter on the very high energy (8+\nMeV) tail of the reactor neutrino spectrum.

A\nprecision detector filling system was developed to simultaneously fill the\nthree liquid zones of the antineutrino detectors and measure the relative\ntarget mass between detectors to <0.02%. This paper describes the design,\noperation, and performance of the system and the resulting precision\nmeasurement of the detectors' target liquid masses. \n\n"}

They are further constrained by the\nHiggs boson mass measurement. The sparticle mass hierarchies can be used to\ngenerate simplified models consistent with the high scale models. In this work\nwe consider supergravity models with universal boundary conditions for soft\nparameters at the unification scale as well as supergravity models with\nnonuniversalities and delineate the list of sparticle mass hierarchies for the\nfive lightest sparticles. Simplified models can be obtained by a truncation of\nthese, retaining a smaller set of lightest particles.

In order to reduce the\nradioactive backgrounds of detectors used in these types of event searches, low\nbackground photosensors are required, as the physical size of these detectors\nbecome increasing larger, and hence the number of such photosensors used also\nincreases rapidly.

Two\nlarge sets of SSMs, each based on a different canonical set of solar abundances\nwith high and low metallicity (Z), are computed to determine model\nuncertainties and correlations among different observables. We present detailed\ncomparisons of high- and low-Z models against different ensembles of solar\nobservables including solar neutrinos, surface helium abundance, depth of\nconvective envelope and sound speed profile. A global comparison, including all\nobservables, yields a p-value of 2.7$\\sigma$ for the high-Z model and\n4.7$\\sigma$ for the low-Z one. When the sound-speed differences in the narrow\nregion of $0.65 < r/R_{sun} < 0.70$ are excluded from the analysis, results are\n0.9$\\sigma$ and 3.0$\\sigma$ for high- and low-Z models respectively.

Many of these models have an additional scalar, which can lead to (and\neven dominate in certain parameter regions) a novel decay channel for the heavy\nvector particles instead - into a SM EW boson and the scalar, which\nsubsequently decays into a SM EW boson pair. In this work, we focus on the\nscalar being relatively heavy, roughly factor of two lighter than the vector\nparticles, rendering its decay products well separated.

Using Monte Carlo\n(MC) based GEANT4 simulation, numerous parameters influencing the light\ncollection and thereby the energy resolution of the antineutrino detector\nmodule are studied: e.g., degrees of scintillator surface roughness, reflector\ntype, and its ap- plying method onto scintillator and light guide surface, the\nreflectivity of the reflector, light guide geometries and diameter of the\nphotocathode.

We consider\nthe possibility that black hole formation happens when the flux of neutrinos is\nstill measurably high. If this occurs, then the neutrino signal from the\nsupernova will be terminated abruptly (the transition takes $\\lesssim 0.5$ ms).\nThe properties and duration of the signal before the cutoff are important\nmeasures of both the physics and astrophysics of the cooling proto-neutron\nstar. For the event rates expected in present and proposed detectors, the\ncutoff will generally appear sharp, thus allowing model-independent\ntime-of-flight mass tests for the neutrinos after the cutoff. If black hole\nformation occurs relatively early, within a few ($\\sim 1$) seconds after core\ncollapse, then the expected luminosities are of order $L_{BH} = 10^{52}$ erg/s\nper flavor. In this case, the neutrino mass sensitivity can be extraordinary.\nFor a supernova at a distance $D = 10$ kpc, SuperKamiokande can detect a\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ mass down to 1.8 eV by comparing the arrival times of the\nhigh-energy and low-energy neutrinos in $\\bar{\\nu}_e + p \\to e^+ + n$.

Due to the Doppler effect of fireballs, there exists a power law\nrelationship between the two quantities within a limited range of frequency.\nThe power law range and the power law index depend strongly on the observed\npeak energy $E_p$ as well as the rest frame radiation form, and the upper and\nlower limits of the power law range can be determined by $E_p$. It is found\nthat, within the same power law range, the ratio of the $FWHM$ of the rising\nportion to that of the decaying phase of the pulses is also related with energy\nin the form of power laws.

In this paper we investigate four aspects related to the application\nof the model to $pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ scattering, from accelerator to cosmic-ray\nenergies: 1) the effect of different estimations for $\\sigma_{tot}$ from\ncosmic-ray experiments; 2) the differences between individual and global\n(simultaneous) fits to $\\sigma_{tot}$ and $\\rho$; 3) the role of the\nsubtraction constant in the dispersion relations; 4) the effect of distinct\nasymptotic inputs from different analytic models.

By introducing a small soft-breaking\nparameter $m_3^2$ of the discrete symmetry, the bottom quark perturbatively\nacquires a nonzero mass. We show a model in which the small $m_3^2 [\\sim\nv^2/(4\\pi)^2]$ is generated by the dynamics above the cutoff scale of the THDM.\nThe ratio $\\tan\\beta$ of the two vacuum expectation values is necessarily very\nlarge; i.e., $\\tan \\beta \\sim m_t/m_b$.
