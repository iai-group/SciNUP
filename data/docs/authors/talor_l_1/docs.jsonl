Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

Although the available\nmass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface\ndensity (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha < 2, the\naccretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances.\nEfficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution,\nwhen the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take\nplace. The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\nM_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can\naccrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.\nOur results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in\nextra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead\nto larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the\ncorrelation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity.

However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed\nin the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)\ncan be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.\nTo reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at\nthe level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent\nWolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass\nmeasurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity\n(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun. This is a rather striking finding as\nthe mass of the most massive known stellar black hole is M_bh = 23-34 Msun and,\nin fact, it is located in a small star forming galaxy with moderate\nmetallicity.

This suggests that an accretion disc must be present during\nthe outburst.

As the overlap with the planetary mass domain increases, the question\nof how these objects form becomes important. The determination of their number\ndensity and whether a mass cut-off limit exists is crucial to understanding\ntheir formation. We propose to search for objects of yet lower masses in the\ncluster and determine the shape of the mass function at low mass. Using new-\nand (re-analysed) published IZJHKs[3.6]-[8.0]-band data of an area of 840\narcmin2, we performed a search for LT-type cluster member candidates in the\nmagnitude range J=19.5-21.5 mag, based on their expected magnitudes and\ncolours. Besides recovering the T type object S Ori 70 and two other known\nobjects, we find three new cluster member candidates, S Ori 72-74, with J=21\nmag and within 12 arcmin of the cluster centre. They have theoretical masses of\n4 (-2,+3) M_Jup and are among the least massive free-floating objects detected\nby direct imaging outside the Solar System. The photometry in archival Spitzer\n[3.6]-[5.8]-band images infers that S Ori 72 is an L/T transition candidate and\nS Ori 73 a T-type candidate, following the expected cluster sequence in the\nmid-infrared. Finally, the L-type candidate S Ori 74 with lower quality\nphotometry is located at 11.8 arcsec (~4250 AU) of a stellar member of sigma\nOrionis and could be a companion. After contaminant correction in the area\ncomplete to J=21.1 mag, we estimate that there remain between zero and two\ncluster members in the mass interval 6-4 M_Jup.

In a model where the\ntotal ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity,\nwe find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4e-8 M_sun/yr, which is two orders of\nmagnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus it is clear\nthat the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This\ncan be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger\ncolumns (~1e22 cm^-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at\nlarger radius than the EUV can. The radial extent of the launching region of\nthe X-ray heated wind is 1-70AU compared with the pure EUV case where the\nlaunch region is concentrated around a few AU. When we couple our wind\nmass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as\nin the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner\nhole develops at ~ 1 AU at the point that the accretion rate in the disc drops\nbelow the wind mass loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is\nquickly removed in the final 15-20% of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent\nwith the 1e5 yr transitional timescale estimated from observations of T-Tauri\nstars. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to\nsome accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large\nX-ray luminosity of 2e30 erg/s; further modeling is required in order to\ninvestigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray\nluminosities in T-Tauri stars. \n\n"}

To do so, we assume that they\nretain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with\na third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is\nthen required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this\nadditional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass\nof a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass\n$M_{\\rm core}$ and the heating $\\dot{E}_{\\rm heating}$. Therefore, in the case\nof tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of the couple $\\{M_{\\rm\ncore},e^2/Q'_p\\}$ that can lead to the same radius, where $Q'_p$ is the tidal\ndissipation factor and $e$ is the eccentricity.

This paper looks at the\neffect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e>>0.3) on their collisional\nlifetime and the amount of mass that can remain at late times M_{late}. For an\naxisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we\nfind that M_{late} \\propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. For a scattered\ndisk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamical\nevolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals\nwith the largest eccentricity were present. Despite the increased remaining\nmass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the\ncollisional cascade until e>0.99, partly because most collisions occur near\npericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high\neccentricities (e>0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre\nmay be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also\nincrease the probability of witnessing a recent collision. All of the imaging\nand spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single\nplanetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75AU, apocentre at 150AU, and mass\n5M_\\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains\nchallenging.

Our hypothesis is\nthat dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by a\ncombination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with an\nexterior disk of small bodies (\"planetesimals\"). Using 5,000 long duration\nN-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50\nEarth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of\nSaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed\neccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller\nradii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking\nstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. For lower mass\nplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, sudden\njumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization of\nscattered low-mass planets in the disk. We present distributions of the final\neccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass and\ninitial system architecture.

The ability to\ndo this relies on the system being in a quasi-equilibrium state in the sense\nthat the eccentricities are constant on the usual secular timescale, and decay\non a timescale which is much longer than the age of the system. Since the\nequilibrium eccentricity is effectively a function only of observable system\nparameters and the unknown Love number of the short-period planet, the latter\ncan be determined with accurate measurements of the planet's eccentricity and\nradius. However, this analysis relies on the unlikely assumption that the\nsystem is coplanar.

This behaviour significantly reduces the ability\nto unambiguously determine the Love number of the short-period planet if the\nmutual inclination is higher than around 10^o. We show that for Q-values less\nthan 10^6, the HAT-P-13 system cannot have a mutual inclination between 54 and\n126^o because Kozai oscillations coupled with tidal dissipation would act to\nquickly move the inclination outside this range, and that the behaviour of\nretrograde systems is the mirror image of that for prograde systems.

According to this\nanalysis, the stable stratification $N^2\\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,\nand the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with\nthe potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.\nGlobally, $Fr_t^2 \\leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than\nthe total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the\nkinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the\nother hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy\n($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to\nthe kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile\n$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must\nbe long-wave scale. Locally, the flow is unstable as the gradient Richardson\nnumber $Ri>1/4$. These results extend the Rayleigh's, Fj{\\o}rtoft's, Sun's and\nArnol'd's criteria for the inviscid homogenous fluid, but they contradict the\nwell-known Miles-Howard theorem.

We\nhave identified three S-complex asteroid clusters with ages in the range\n10^{5-6} years. The average color of the objects in these clusters agree with\nthe prediction of Willman et al., 2008.

The average color of the S-complex pairs is PC_1=0.49+/-0.03, over\n5-sigma redder than predicted by Willman et al., 2008. Therefore, the most\nlikely pair formation mechanism is gentle separation due to YORP spin-up\nleaving much of the aged and reddened surface undisturbed. In this case our\ncolor measurement allows us to set an upper limit of ~64% on the disturbed\nsurface portion. Using pre-existing color data and our new results for the\nyoungest S-complex asteroid clusters we have extended our space weather model\nto explicitly include the effects of regolith gardening and fit separate\nweathering and gardening characteristic timescales of tau_w=960+/-160My and\ntau_g=2000+/-290My respectively.

Although many false positives can\nbe identified by a detailed analysis of the LCs, the detections of others\nrequire additional observations.

A close inspection of the problem indicates that in all\nrelevant cases the binaries are brighter in the infrared than in the optical\nregime.

Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores.

II.\n  Measuring the Size of the \"Frozen\" Zone Abstract: Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the\ninitial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding\nthat tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless\ncollisional fragmentation is effective.

These grains are\nexpected to carry nonzero negative charges in the weakly ionized disks, but its\neffect on their collisional growth has not been fully understood so far. In\nthis paper, we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust\nsize distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a\nweakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions.\nTo clarify the role of the size distribution, we divide our analysis into two\nsteps. First, we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming\na monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We show that the monodisperse\ngrowth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is\nmet, as is already expected in the previous work. Second, we numerically\nsimulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski's method to see how the outcome\nchanges when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve. We find that,\nunder certain conditions, the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a\nlimited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the\ndust mass in the system. This occurs because remaining small aggregates\nefficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being\nstrongly charged.

We performed extensive Monte Carlo simulations and we found that for\nGaussian random noise WASP is sensitive to companions as small as the Moon\norbiting a $V\\sim$12 white dwarf. For fainter stars WASP is sensitive to\nincreasingly larger bodies. Our sensitivity drops in the presence of co-variant\nnoise structure in the data, nevertheless Earth-size bodies remain readily\ndetectable in relatively low S/N data. We searched for eclipses and transit\nsignals in a sample of 194 white dwarfs in the WASP archive however, no\nevidence for companions was found.

Statistical Analysis of the\n  First Four Months Abstract: The architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints\non models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation of\norbital eccentricities and inclinations. NASA's Kepler mission has identified\n1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary\nsystems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit\ntiming analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of\nplanet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive\nof TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span\nof observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet\nmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple\ntransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We\nfind that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does\nnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per\nstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a\nsingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We\nanticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with\nmultiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a\npowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital\ndynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least\nsix years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the\ndynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive\nto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type\nstars. \n\n"}

For a qualitative\nestimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal\nphase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our\nmodel is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The\ndifference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low\nfrequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in\nlarger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and\nrheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the\nsame rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being\nnegligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the\nseismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)\nbecomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what\none might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate\ndeviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,\nand this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in\nmagnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the\nprimary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses\nthe synchronous orbit. We describe the mantle rheology with the Andrade model,\nallowing it to lean towards the Maxwell model at the lowest frequencies. To\nimplement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by\nendowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale\nto the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle. Some uncertainty in this\nparameter's frequency-dependence does not influence our principal conclusions. \n\n"}

Our goal was to detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during\neclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of\nplanet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope. In\nthis paper, we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the\ncritical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of\nthe increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature\ngradient. Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form\nmassive envelopes before disc dissipation.

Following previous\nwork where the dust size distribution has been calculated from a state-of-the\nart collision model for dust aggregates that involves both coagulation and\nfragmentation (Paper I), the corresponding opacities are presented in this\nstudy. The opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theory\nassuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\\mu}m silicate and graphite\ngrains and vacuum. In particular, we explore how the coagulation affects the\nnear-IR opacities and the opacity in the 9.7{\\mu}m silicate feature.

Abstract: The last decade has seen a dramatic confirmation that an in situ star\nformation is possible inside the inner parsec of the Milky Way. Here we suggest\nthat giant planets, solid terrestrial-like planets, comets and asteroids may\nalso form in these environments, and that this may have observational\nimplications for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Like in debris discs around main\nsequence stars, collisions of large solid objects should initiate strong\nfragmentation cascades. The smallest particles in such a cascade - the\nmicroscopic dust - may provide a significant opacity. We put a number of\nobservational and physical constraints on AGN obscuring torii resulting from\nsuch fragmentation cascades. We find that torii fed by fragmenting asteroids\ndisappear at both low and high AGN luminosities. At high luminosities, $L \\sim\nL_{\\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington limit, the AGN radiation\npressure blows out the microscopic dust too rapidly. At low luminosities, on\nthe other hand, the AGN discs may avoid gravitational fragmentation into stars\nand solids. We also note that these fragmentation cascades may be responsible\nfor astrophysically \"large\" dust particles of approximately micrometer sizes\nthat were postulated by some authors to explain unusual absorption properties\nof the AGN torii. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recent studies of solar system formation suggest that the solar system's\ngiant planets formed and migrated in the protoplanetary disk to reach resonant\norbits with all planets inside 15 AU from the Sun. After the gas disk's\ndispersal, Uranus and Neptune were likely scattered by gas giants, and\napproached their current orbits while dispersing the transplanetary disk of\nplanetesimals, whose remains survived to this time in the region known as the\nKuiper belt. Here we performed N-body integrations of the scattering phase\nbetween giant planets in an attempt to determine which initial states are\nplausible. We found that the dynamical simulations starting with a resonant\nsystem of four giant planets have a low success rate in matching the present\norbits of giant planets, and various other constraints (e.g., survival of the\nterrestrial planets). The dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if\nJupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, and leads to final systems with\nfewer than four planets. Several initial states stand out in that they show a\nrelatively large likelihood of success in matching the constraints. Some of the\nstatistically best results were obtained when assuming that the solar system\ninitially had five giant planets and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to\nthat of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected to interstellar space by Jupiter. This\npossibility appears to be conceivable in view of the recent discovery of a\nlarge number free-floating planets in interstellar space, which indicates that\nplanet ejection should be common. \n\n"}

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure.

We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of\nTaurus-Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in\norder to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply\nthat the tidal influence of a close (<40 AU) binary companion significantly\nhastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ~2/3 of all close\nbinaries promptly disperse their disks within <1 Myr after formation. However,\nprompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and\nsingle stars, with ~80%-90% retaining their disks for at least ~2--3 Myr (but\nrarely for more than ~5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing\ntimescale have significant implications for giant planet formation; most single\nstars have 3--5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close\nbinary systems would have to form giant planets within <1 Myr. If core\naccretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in\nclose binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a\nsimilar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity\nin RV surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is\nvery well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the\ndisk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation. \n\n"}

In the case of a\nhydrogen-rich atmosphere, molecular absorption and scattering processes may\nresult in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength. The aim of\nthis paper is to measure these variations. We have obtained observations of the\ntransit of GJ1214b in the r- and I-band with the INT, in the g, r, i and z\nbands with the 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope, in the Ks-band with the NOT, and in\nthe Kc-band with the WHT. By comparing the transit depth between the the\ndifferent bands, which is a measure for the planet-to-star size ratio, the\natmosphere is investigated. We do not detect clearly significant variations in\nthe planet-to-star size ratio as function of wavelength. Although the ratio at\nthe shortest measured wavelength, in g-band, is 2sigma larger than in the other\nbands. The uncertainties in the Ks and Kc bands are large, due to systematic\nfeatures in the light curves. The tentative increase in the planet-to-star size\nratio at the shortest wavelength could be a sign of an increase in the\neffective planet-size due to Rayleigh scattering, which would require GJ1214b\nto have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. If true, then the atmosphere has to have\nboth clouds, to suppress planet-size variations at red optical wavelengths, as\nwell as a sub-solar metallicity, to suppress strong molecular features in the\nnear- and mid-infrared. However, star spots, which are known to be present on\nthe hoststar's surface, can (partly) cancel out the expected variations in\nplanet-to-star size ratio, due to the lower surface temperature of the spots .\nA hypothetical spot-fraction of 10% would be able to raise the infrared points\nsufficiently with respect to the optical measurements to be inconsistent with a\nwater-dominated atmosphere.

Our technique exploits the fact the light curve derived stellar density\nmust be the same for all planets transiting a common star. Assuming a circular\norbit, the derived stellar density departs from the true value by a predictable\nfactor, Psi, which contains information on the eccentricity of the system. By\ncomparing multiple stellar densities, any differences must be due to\neccentricity and thus meaningful constraints can be placed in the absence of\nany other information. The technique, dubbed \"Multibody Asterodensity\nProfiling\" (MAP), is a new observable which can be used alone or in combination\nwith other observables, such as radial velocities and transit timing\nvariations. An eccentricity prior can also be included as desired. MAP is most\nsensitive to the minimum pair-combined eccentricity e.g. (e1 + e2)[min].\nIndividual eccentricity constraints are less stringent but an empirical\neccentricity posterior is always derivable and is freely available from transit\nphotometry alone.

Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in\nexplaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host. \n\n"}

Another method, employed both in planetary science\nand astrophysics, is based on decomposition of each harmonic of the tide into\ntwo bulges oriented orthogonally to one another.\n  We prove that the two methods are equivalent. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat the two-bulge method is not a separate approximation, but ensues directly\nfrom the Fourier expansion of a linear tidal theory equipped with an arbitrary\nrheological model involving a departure from elasticity. To this end, we use\nthe most general mathematical formalism applicable to linear bodily tides. To\nexpress the tidal amendment to the potential of the perturbed primary, we act\non the tide-raising potential of the perturbing secondary with a convolution\noperator. This enables us to interconnect a complex Fourier component of the\ntidally generated potential of the perturbed primary with the appropriate\ncomplex Fourier component of the tide-raising potential of the secondary. Then\nwe demonstrate how this interrelation entails the two-bulge description.\n  While less economical mathematically, the two-bulge approach has a good\nillustrative power, and may be employed on a par with a more concise method of\ncomplex amplitudes. At the same time, there exist situations where the\ntwo-bulge method becomes more practical for technical calculations. \n\n"}

The\nfirst phase of ChanPlaNS targeted 21 mostly high-excitation PNe within ~1.5 kpc\nof Earth, yielding 4 detections of diffuse X-ray emission and 9 detections of\nX-ray-luminous point sources at the central stars (CSPNe) of these objects.\nCombining these results with those obtained from Chandra archival data for all\n(14) other PNe within ~1.5 kpc that have been observed to date, we find an\noverall X-ray detection rate of ~70%. Roughly 50% of the PNe observed by\nChandra harbor X-ray-luminous CSPNe, while soft, diffuse X-ray emission tracing\nshocks formed by energetic wind collisions is detected in ~30%; five objects\ndisplay both diffuse and point-like emission components.

This paper reports on\nhigh spatial-resolution adaptive optics images of 90 Kepler planetary\ncandidates. Companion stars are detected as close as 0.1 arcsec from the target\nstar. Images were taken in the near-infrared (J and Ks bands) with ARIES on the\nMMT and PHARO on the Palomar Hale 200-inch.

After surviving\nperihelion, the comet underwent major changes (permanent loss of nuclear\ncondensation, formation of spine tail). The process of disintegration\nculminated with an outburst on December 17.6 (T+1.6 d) and this delayed\nresponse is inconsistent with the rubble pile model. Probable cause was thermal\nstress from the heat pulse into the nucleus after perihelion, which could also\nproduce fragmentation of sungrazers far from the Sun. The spine tail was a\nsynchronic feature, made up of dust released at <30 m/s. Since the nucleus\nwould have been located on the synchrone, we computed the astrometric positions\nof the missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the\nspine tail's axis with lines of forced orbital-period variation, derived from\norbital solutions based on preperihelion astrometry from the ground. The\nresulting osculating orbital period was 698+/-2 years, which proves that C/2011\nW3 is the first major member of the predicted new, 21st-century cluster of\nbright Kreutz-system sungrazers. The spine tail's tip contained dust 1-2 mm in\ndiameter. The bizarre appearance of the dust tail in images taken hours after\nperihelion with coronagraphs on SOHO and STEREO is readily understood. The\ndisconnection of the comet's head from the preperihelion tail and the apparent\nactivity attenuation near perihelion are both caused by sublimation of all dust\nat heliocentric distances smaller than ~1.8 solar radii.

This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars. While the former are too weak to create $B_s \\gtrsim 5\\times\n10^{13}$G$\\;\\gg B_d$, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than\n$10^6$ years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a\ntoroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where\nthe ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created\nby various processes acting early in a neutron star's life.

These magnetic spots can be\nlong-lived, thereby fulfilling the pre-conditions for the appearance of the\nradio pulsar activity.

We obtain\nimproved estimates for HD 189733b's dayside planet-star flux ratio of 0.1466%\n+/- 0.0040% at 3.6 micron and 0.1787% +/- 0.0038% at 4.5 micron; these are the\nmost accurate secondary eclipse depths obtained to date for an extrasolar\nplanet. We compare our new dayside and nightside spectra for HD 189733b to the\npredictions of models from Burrows et al. (2008) and Showman et al. (2009). We\nfind that HD 189733b's 4.5 micron nightside flux is 3.3 sigma smaller than\npredicted by the Showman et al. models, which assume that the chemistry is in\nlocal thermal equilibrium. We conclude that this discrepancy is best-explained\nby vertical mixing, which should lead to an excess of CO and correspondingly\nenhanced 4.5 micron absorption in this region. [abridged] \n\n"}

We attempt to use as an additional constraint that\nthe B star radius inferred from temperature, flux, and distance, should equate\nthe Roche radius, since the system accretes by Roche lobe overflow. This leads\nto substantially larger masses, but from trying to apply the technique to known\nsystems, we find that the masses are consistently overestimated.

We derive\nanalytical formulae for their TTV signals. We separate planet eccentricity into\nfree and forced parts, where the forced part is purely due to the planets'\nproximity to resonance. This separation yields simple analytical formulae. The\nphase of the TTV depends sensitively on the presence of free eccentricity: if\nthe free eccentricity vanishes, the TTV will be in phase with the longitude of\nconjunctions. This effect is easily detectable in current TTV data. The\namplitude of the TTV depends on planet mass and free eccentricity, and it\ndetermines planet mass uniquely only when the free eccentricity is sufficiently\nsmall. We proceed to analyze the TTV signals of six short period Kepler pairs.\nWe find that three of these pairs (Kepler-18,24,25) have TTV phase consistent\nwith zero. The other three (Kepler-23,28,32) have small TTV phases, but ones\nthat are distinctly non-zero. We deduce that the free eccentricities of the\nplanets are small, < 0.01, but not always vanishing. Furthermore, as a\nconsequence of this, we deduce that the true masses of the planets are fairly\naccurately determined by the TTV amplitudes, within a factor < 2. The smallness\nof the free eccentricities suggests that the planets have experienced\nsubstantial dissipation. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the\nobserved pile-up of Kepler pairs near mean-motion resonances is caused by\nresonant repulsion. But the fact that some of the planets have non-vanishing\nfree eccentricity suggests that after resonant repulsion occurred there was a\nsubsequent phase in the planets' evolution when their eccentricities were\nmodestly excited, perhaps by interplanetary interactions. \n\n"}

The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

We present new precision astrometric\nmeasurements, a re-analysis of HARPS radial velocity measurements, and\nmedium-resolution infrared spectroscopy of GJ 1214. We combine these\nmeasurements with recent transit follow-up observations and new catalog\nphotometry to provide a comprehensive update of the star-planet properties. The\ndistance is obtained with 0.6% relative uncertainty using CAPScam astrometry.\nThe new value increases the nominal distance to the star by ~10% and is\nsignificantly more precise than previous measurements. Updated Doppler\nmeasurements combined with published transit observations significantly refine\nthe constraints on the orbital solution. The analysis of the infrared spectrum\nand photometry confirm that the star is enriched in metals compared to the Sun.\nUsing all this information, combined with empirical mass-luminosity relations\nfor low mass stars, we derive updated values for the bulk properties of the\nstar-planet system. We also use infrared absolute fluxes to estimate the\nstellar radius and to re-derive the star-planet properties. Both approaches\nprovide very consistent values for the system.

We present the wavelength-dependent\nphoto-attenuation rates for different photodissociation processes forming O(1S)\nand O(1D). The calculated radiative efficiency profiles of O(1S) and O(1D)\natoms show that in comet Hale-Bopp the green and red-doublet emissions are\nemitted mostly above radial distances of 10^3 and 10^4 km, respectively.

The recently demonstrated correlation\nbetween timing noise and variation of pulse profile motivates us to further\ninvestigate its origins. We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes. Considering the existence of the ultracompact binary white dwarf of\norbital period of 5.4 minute, HM Cancri, such orbital periods to pulsar\nbinaries are not strange. The change of latitude of the magnetic moment\nexceeding the range of emission beam of a pulsar results in the intermittency,\nwhich explains the behavior of PSR B1931+24. Therefore, it provides not only a\nmechanism of the quasi-periodic feature displayed on some ``singular\" pulsars,\nlike timing noise, variation of pulse profile and intermittency; but also a new\napproach of searching ultra-compact binaries, possibly pulsar-black hole binary\nsystems. \n\n"}

The fragmentation of self-gravitating\nprotostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to\ntens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by\ngrain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central\nstar and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar\ndisc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass,\ngrain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption. While\nthere are key pieces of physics yet to be incorporated, it represents a first\nstep towards a mature statistical model of GI and tidal downsizing as a mode of\nstar and planet formation.\n  We show results from four runs of the population synthesis model, varying the\nopacity law and the strength of migration, as well as investigating the effect\nof disc truncation during the fragmentation process. Our early results suggest\nthat GI plus tidal downsizing is not the principal mode of planet formation,\nbut remains an excellent means of forming gas giant planets, brown dwarfs and\nlow mass stars at large semimajor axes.

The deflection experienced by these particles are inversely\nproportional to the square of their velocities and as a result their focal\nlengths will be shorter. We investigate the velocity dispersion of these\nslow-moving particles, originating from distant point-like sources, for\nimposing upper and lower bounds on the velocities of such particles in order\nfor them to be focused onto Earth. We find that fluxes of such slow-moving and\nnon-interacting particles must have speeds between ~0.01 and ~0.14 times the\nspeed of light, $c$. Particles with speeds less than ~0.01 c will undergo way\ntoo much deflection to be focused, although such individual particles could be\ndetected.

It was shown in our previous work that at 1\nAU, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is completely suppressed when both\nOhmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (AD) are taken into account,\nresulting in a laminar flow with accretion driven by magnetocentrifugal wind.\nIn this work, we study the radial dependence of the laminar wind solution using\nlocal shearing-box simulations. Scaling relation on the angular momentum\ntransport for the laminar wind is obtained, and we find that the wind-driven\naccretion rate can be approximated as\nM_dot~0.91x10^(-8)R_AU^(1.21)(B_z/10mG)^(0.93)M_Sun/yr, where B_z is the\nstrength of the large-scale vertical magnetic field threading the disk.

We found that\nall four types of observed rotational irregularities have evolving nature.\nIrregularities in pulsar rotation rate pass through three evolutional stages\nthat show that a certain type of rotational irregularity can occur only at a\ncertain stage of pulsar rotation evolution. The age boundaries between\ndifferent evolutionary stages are indistinct and diffusive. This fact is\nbecause different pulsars having similar properties evolve along different\npaths.

Mass loss\nat the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many\nsystems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a\nfew 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's\nprevious evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent\nscattering instabilities.

While spatial\ninhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for much\nof the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arise\nfrom atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to,\nclouds. To better understand the role that thermal variability might play we\npresent a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developed\none-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. We focus\non the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem\nthrough omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results\ndemonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at\npressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the\nupper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared\nwater opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal\nperturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations,\nthe emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent\nbehaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at\ndifferent wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in\nthe atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative\nexchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation\nevolves in time. We conclude that thermal--as well as cloud--fluctuations must\nbe considered as possible contributors to the observed brown dwarf variability. \n\n"}

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines. In\nthis regions, C/O is found to approach unity after about 5 Myrs, scaling with\nthe cosmic ray ionisation rate. We then explore how the atmospheric chemistry\nand cloud properties in young gas giants are affected when the non-solar C/O\nratios predicted by the disk models are assumed. The DRIFT cloud formation\nmodel is applied to study the formation of atmospheric clouds under the\ninfluence of varying primordial element abundances and its feedback onto the\nlocal gas. We demonstrate that element depletion by cloud formation plays a\ncrucial role in converting an oxygen-rich atmosphere gas into carbon-rich gas\nwhen non-solar, primordial element abundances are considered as suggested by\ndisk model. \n\n"}

In the jittering-jets model the explosion of CCSNe is powered by\njittering jets launched by an intermittent accretion disk formed by accreted\ngas having a stochastic angular momentum. The first two bipolar jets episodes\neject mass mainly from the plane defined by the two bipolar axes. Accretion\nthen proceeds from the two opposite directions normal to that plane. Such a\nflow has an angular momentum in the direction of the same plane. If the gas\nforms an accretion disk, the jets will be launched in more or less the same\nplane as the one defined by the jets of the first two launching episodes.

Current searches for transiting\ncircumbinary planets concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore\nrestricted to a small fraction of potential hosts. We investigate the concept\nof finding planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries, whose geometry would\nrequire mutually inclined planes. Using an N-body code we explore how the\nnumber and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital\nparameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated\ncircumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar\nneighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a\nrange of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with\nthe Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of\nbinaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic\nsystems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and\nnon-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are\ncompared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting\nnon-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational\nbiases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary\nplanets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the\ndistributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely\ndifferent.

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these\nresults, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state\ntransitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y.

Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD.

We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected.

Second, a drop in\nplanet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a 10 day orbital\nperiod, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median\nstellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is\nstellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of\nstellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping\nand destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the\npre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of\nmigrating planets or planetary building blocks. These results demonstrate the\nstellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence\nrate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the\ninner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration\nof planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters. \n\n"}

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity.

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable.

Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega.

At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent.

A Centrifugal\n  Growth Barrier for 2D Flows Abstract: In the core accretion paradigm of planet formation, gas giants only form a\nmassive atmosphere after their progenitors exceeded a threshold mass: the\ncritical core mass. Most (exo)planets, being smaller and rock/ice-dominated,\nnever crossed this line. Nevertheless, they were massive enough to attract\nsubstantial amounts of gas from the disc, while their atmospheres remained in\npressure-equilibrium with the disc. Our goal is to characterise the\nhydrodynamical properties of the atmospheres of such embedded planets and their\nimplication for their (long-term) evolution. In this paper -- the first in\nseries -- we start to investigate the properties of an isothermal and inviscid\nflow past a small, embedded planet by conducting local, 2D hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Using the PLUTO code we confirm that the flow is steady and bound.\nThis steady outcome is most apparent for the log-polar grid (with the grid\nspacing proportional to the distance from the planet). For low-mass planets,\nCartesian grids are somewhat less efficient as they have difficulty to follow\nthe circular, large speeds in the deep atmosphere. Relating the amount of\nrotation to the gas fraction of the atmosphere, we find that more massive\natmospheres rotate faster -- a finding consistent with Kelvin's circulation\ntheorem. Rotation therefore limits the amount of gas that planets can acquire\nfrom the nebula.

Because\ncooling by neutrinos can be very efficient, NSs have been predicted to\naccumulate significant mass during CE events, perhaps enough to lead them to\ncollapse to black holes. We revisit this conclusion with the additional\nconsideration of CE structure, particularly density gradients across the\nembedded NS's accretion radius. This work is informed by our recent numerical\nsimulations that find that the presence of a density gradient strongly limits\naccretion by imposing a net angular momentum to the flow around the NS. Our\ncalculations suggest that NSs should survive CE encounters. They accrete only\nmodest amounts of envelope material, $\\lesssim 0.1M_\\odot$, which is broadly\nconsistent with mass determinations of double NS binaries.

A possible channel for producing such\nmisaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's\norbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a\nrecent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot\nJupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often\nchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star.

This involves the existence of a\npressure maximum which traps dust either in between two gap-opening planets or\nat the outermost gap edge of a single or multiple planet system, combined with\nthe decoupling of large dust particles from the gas. We perform 2D gas\nhydrodynamical simulations of disks with one and two giant planets which may\nopen deep or partial gaps. A gas ring forms in between two planets such that\nthe surface mass density is higher than on either side of it. This ring is a\nregion of pressure maximum where we expect large grains, which are marginally\ncoupled to the gas and would otherwise be subject to radial drift, to collect.\nSuch a pressure maximum also occurs at the outermost gap edge in a disk with\none or more planets. We infer the dust evolution in these regions as the gas\ndisk evolves, to understand the longer term behavior of the resulting dust\nrings. Over time the gas surface density in the ring(s) decreases, which may\ncause the larger trapped particles to decouple. Consequently, these particles\nare expected to stay in ring structure(s) longer than the gas. For a Minimum\nMass Solar Nebula model, we expect that millimeter and centimeter-sized grains\nin the outer O(10) au would most likely undergo this trapping and decoupling\nprocess. \n\n"}

Tidal downsizing may reduce both the\nobject mass and semimajor axis. However, most studies of tidal downsizing end\nwhen the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its\nparent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet\nand brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be\nexplored.\n  We carry out N-Body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in\nmulti-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters.\nIn both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis\nmodels of tidal downsizing.\n  The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities. The\nejection rate is around 25%. The ejecta mass distribution is similar to that\nfor all objects, with a velocity dispersion consistent with those produced by\nfull hydrodynamic simulations. The semimajor axis distribution after scattering\nextends to parsec scales.\n  In the cluster simulations, 13% of objects are ejected from their planetary\nsystem, and around 10% experience significant orbit modification.

Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational\namplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their\nprojected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational\namplitudes of the Kepler KOIs with those of Kepler single stars can provide a\nmeasure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of\nKepler planets.

While the\nmagnetic field sheltered Earth's atmosphere from erosion at this time, standoff\nof the solar wind was greatly reduced, and similar to that during modern\nextreme solar storms. These conditions suggest that intense radiation from the\nyoung Sun may have modified the atmosphere of the young Earth by promoting loss\nof volatiles, including water.

Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b.

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down.

We compare all\nexisting eclipse data to a blackbody spectrum, to a carbon-rich non-inverted\nmodel and to a solar composition model with an inverted temperature structure.\nWe find that current available data on WASP-33b's atmosphere can be best\nrepresented by a simple blackbody emission, without the need for more\nsophisticated atmospheric models with temperature inversions. Although our data\ncannot rule out models with or without a temperature inversion, they do confirm\na high brightness temperature for the planet at short wavelengths. WASP-33b is\none of the hottest exoplanets known till date, and its equilibrium temperature\nis consistent with rapid reradiation of the absorbed stellar light and a low\nalbedo. \n\n"}

Using both an analytical\nmodel of planetary density and numerical simulations utilizing the Fast\nAccurate Integrand Renormalization (FAIR) algorithm (a fast geodesics\ncalculator described below) with realistic planetary density inputs, dark\nmatter streams moving through a compact body are shown to produce hugely\nmagnified dark matter densities along the stream velocity axis going through\nthe center of the body.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions.

In this manuscript, we take one step closer to\nproving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve\nhave $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to\nexplosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,\n$\\Psi > 0$. $\\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,\nand we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\\tau$ condition used to\ninfer the $L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve.

However,\ncharacterizing the SPFs of these extrasolar debris disks is challenging because\nonly a limited range of scattering angles are visible to Earth-based observers.\nBy contrast, Saturn's tenuous rings can be observed over a much broader range\nof geometries, so their SPFs can be much better constrained. Since these rings\nare composed of small particles released from the surfaces of larger bodies,\nthey are reasonable analogs to debris disks and so their SPFs can provide\ninsights into the plausible scattering properties of debris disks. This work\nexamines two of Saturn's dusty rings: the G ring (at 167,500 km from Saturn's\ncenter) and the D68 ringlet (at 67,600 km). Using data from the cameras onboard\nthe Cassini spacecraft, we are able to estimate the rings' brightnesses at\nscattering angles ranging from 170 to 0.5 degrees. We find that both of the\nrings exhibit extremely strong forward-scattering peaks, but for scattering\nangles above 60 degrees their brightnesses are nearly constant. These SPFs can\nbe well approximated by a linear combination of three Henyey-Greenstein\nfunctions, and are roughly consistent with the SPFs of irregular particles from\nlaboratory measurements. Comparing these data to Fraunhofer and Mie models\nhighlights several challenges involved in extracting information about particle\ncompositions and size distributions from SPFs alone. The SPFs of these rings\nalso indicate that the degree of forward scattering in debris disks may be\ngreatly underestimated. \n\n"}

Since activity is driven by the sublimation of volatiles, this\nis a puzzling result because this area is less exposed to the Sun and is\ntherefore expected to be cooler on average (Sierks et al. 2015).\n  We used a thermophysical model that takes into account thermal inertia,\nglobal self-heating, and shadowing, to compute surface temperatures of the\ncomet. We found that, for every rotation in the August--December 2014 period,\nsome parts of the neck region undergo the fastest temperature variations of the\ncomet's surface precisely because they are shadowed by their surrounding\nterrains. Our work suggests that these fast temperature changes are correlated\nto the early activity of the comet, and we put forward the hypothesis that\nerosion related to thermal cracking is operating at a high rate on the neck\nregion due to these rapid temperature variations. This may explain why the neck\ncontains some ice --as opposed to most other parts of the surface (Capaccioni\net al. 2015)-- and why it is the main source of the comet's early activity\n(Sierks et al. 2015).\n  In a broader context, these results indicate that thermal cracking can\noperate faster on atmosphereless bodies with significant concavities than\nimplied by currently available estimates (Delbo' et al. 2014). \n\n"}

We have studied their\ncombined effect through a suite of 2d simulations of protoplanetary discs\nundergoing X-ray photoevaporation with an embedded giant planet. In a previous\nwork we explored how the formation of a giant planet triggers the dispersal of\nthe inner disc by photo-evaporation at earlier times than what would have\nhappened otherwise. This is particularly relevant for the observed transition\ndiscs with large holes and high mass accretion rates that cannot be explained\nby photo-evaporation alone. In this work we significantly expand the parameter\nspace investigated by previous simulations. In addition, the updated model\nincludes thermal sweeping, needed for studying the complete dispersal of the\ndisc. After the removal of the inner disc the disc is a non accreting\ntransition disc, an object that is rarely seen in observations. We assess the\nrelative length of this phase, to understand if it is long lived enough to be\nfound observationally. Depending on the parameters, especially on the X-ray\nluminosity of the star, we find that the fraction of time spent as a\nnon-accretor greatly varies.

We propose a\nmethod to compare transiting planets for their potential to support life based\non transit data, stellar properties and previously reported limits on planetary\nemitted flux.

As these parameters are often\nunconstrained, there is an \"eccentricity-albedo degeneracy\" for the\nhabitability of transiting exoplanets.

We conduct a\nlarge population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational\npotential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar\nspin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar\nspin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking.

A large fraction of the observational sample contains\nlimited multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity of\nmulti transiting systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutual\ninclinations, allowing them to appear as single-transiting systems in a\ntransit-based survey. This paper begins an exploration of the effectiveness of\ndynamical mechanisms in exciting orbital inclination within exoplanetary\nsystems of this class. For these tightly packed systems, we determine that the\norbital inclination angles are not spread out appreciably through\nself-excitation. In contrast, the two Kepler multi-planet systems with\nadditional non-transiting planets are susceptible to oscillations of their\ninclination angles, which means their currently observed configurations could\nbe due to planet-planet interactions alone. We also provide constraints and\npredictions for the expected transit duration variations (TDVs) for each\nplanet. In these multi-planet compact Kepler systems, oscillations of their\ninclination angles are remarkably hard to excite; as a result, they tend to\nremain continually mutually transiting (CMT-stable). We study this issue\nfurther by augmenting the planet masses and determining the enhancement factor\nrequired for oscillations to move the systems out of transit.

Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we\nthen derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges of\norbital periods. The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 days\nis 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets.

Abstract: The obliquities of planet-hosting stars are clues about the formation of\nplanetary systems. Previous observations led to the hypothesis that for\nclose-in giant planets, spin-orbit alignment is enforced by tidal interactions.\nHere, we examine two problems with this hypothesis. First, Mazeh and coworkers\nrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced\nphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even\nfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were\nresponsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both\nproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has\nserious shortcomings. \n\n"}

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability.

Abstract: Jupiter's core is generally assumed to have formed beyond the snow line. Here\nwe consider an alternative scenario, that Jupiter's core may have accumulated\nin the innermost parts of the protoplanetary disk. A growing body of research\nsuggests that small particles (\"pebbles\") continually drift inward through the\ndisk. If a fraction of drifting pebbles is trapped at the inner edge of the\ndisk a several Earth-mass core can quickly grow. Subsequently, the core may\nmigrate outward beyond the snow line via planet-disk interactions. Of course,\nto reach the outer Solar System Jupiter's core must traverse the terrestrial\nplanet-forming region.\n  We use N-body simulations including synthetic forces from an underlying\ngaseous disk to study how the outward migration of Jupiter's core sculpts the\nterrestrial zone. If the outward migration is fast (Tmig~10^4 years), the core\nsimply migrates past resident planetesimals and planetary embryos. However, if\nits migration is slower (Tmig~10^5 years) the core removes solids from the\ninner disk by shepherding objects in mean motion resonances. In many cases the\ndisk interior to 0.5-1 AU is cleared of embryos and most planetesimals. By\ngenerating a mass deficit close to the Sun, the outward migration of Jupiter's\ncore may thus explain the absence of terrestrial planets closer than Mercury.\nJupiter's migrating core often stimulates the growth of another large\n(~Earth-mass) core -- that may provide a seed for Saturn's core -- trapped in\nexterior resonance. The migrating core also may transport a fraction of\nterrestrial planetesimals, such as the putative parent bodies of iron\nmeteorites, to the asteroid belt. \n\n"}

Angular dependence of\n  scattering Abstract: In protoplanetary disks, micron-sized dust grains coagulate to form highly\nporous dust aggregates. Because the optical properties of these aggregates are\nnot completely understood, it is important to investigate how porous dust\naggregates scatter light. In this study, the light scattering properties of\nporous dust aggregates were calculated using a rigorous method, the T-matrix\nmethod, and the results were then compared with those obtained using the\nRayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) theory and Mie theory with the effective medium\napproximation (EMT). The RGD theory is applicable to moderately large\naggregates made of nearly transparent monomers. This study considered two types\nof porous dust aggregates, ballistic cluster-cluster agglomerates (BCCAs) and\nballistic particle-cluster agglomerates (BPCAs). First, the angular dependence\nof the scattered intensity was shown to reflect the hierarchical structure of\ndust aggregates; the large-scale structure of the aggregates is responsible for\nthe intensity at small scattering angles, and their small-scale structure\ndetermines the intensity at large scattering angles. Second, it was determined\nthat the EMT underestimates the backward scattering intensity by multiple\norders of magnitude, especially in BCCAs, because the EMT averages the\nstructure within the size of the aggregates. It was concluded that the RGD\ntheory is a very useful method for calculating the optical properties of BCCAs. \n\n"}

We confirm the generic result that light\nnuclei are preferentially retained in the liquid and heavy nuclei in the solid.\nThis is in agreement with the previous study of a 17-component mixture of\nrp-process ashes by Horowitz et al.

We also find an alternate phase separation regime\nfor the lightest ash mixtures which does not demonstrate this generic\nbehaviour.

Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified\neither as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity\nfollowed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet\nthat is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a\nhighly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,\ntidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is\ncorrect, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied\nby another giant planet interior to the water-ice line. Using the current\nsample of giant planets discovered with the Doppler technique, we find that hot\nJupiters with P_orb < 10 days are no more or less likely to have exterior\nJupiter-mass companions than longer-period giant planets with P_orb >= 10 days.\nThis result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the\napproximate location of the water-ice line.

This\nfriction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial\nwaves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for\nthis friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent\neddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on\nvelocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into\naccount the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.\nTherefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and\ncharacteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been\nrecently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical\nsimulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal\nwaves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.\nFinally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary\nconvective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The\naction of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied\non tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number\nbelow 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of\nmagnitude. It may lead to a loss of efficiency of the viscous dissipation of\nthe equilibrium tide and to a more efficient complex and resonant dissipation\nof tidal inertial waves in the bulk of convective regions. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to have a completely coupled treatment of the tidal/rotational\nevolution of star-planet systems and multiple stars with a coherent treatment\nof the variations of tidal flows and of their dissipation as a function of\nrotation. \n\n"}

Abstract: Two XMM Newton observations of Nova V4743 Sgr (Nova Sgr 2002) were performed\nshortly after it returned to quiescence, 2 and 3.5 years after the explosion.\nThe X-ray light curves revealed a modulation with a frequency of ~0.75 mHz,\nindicating that V4743 Sgr is most probably an intermediate polar (IP). The\nX-ray spectra have characteristics in common with known IPs, with a hard\nthermal plasma component that can be fitted only assuming a partially covering\nabsorber.

The spacecraft will also come close to a\nnumber of Mercury-crossing asteroids with perihelia less than 0.3 AU. At small\nheliocentric distances, these objects may begin to lose mass, thus becoming\n\"active asteroids\" with comet-like comae or tails. This paper assembles a\ndatabase of 97 known Mercury-crossing asteroids that may be encountered by SPP,\nand it presents estimates of their time-dependent visible-light fluxes and mass\nloss rates. Assuming a similar efficiency of sky background subtraction as was\nachieved by STEREO, we find that approximately 80% of these asteroids are\nbright enough to be observed by the Wide-field Imager for SPP (WISPR). A model\nof gas/dust mass loss from these asteroids is developed and calibrated against\nexisting observations. This model is used to estimate the visible-light fluxes\nand spatial extents of spherical comae. Observable dust clouds occur only when\nthe asteroids approach the Sun closer than 0.2 AU. The model predicts that\nduring the primary SPP mission between 2018 and 2025, there should be 113\ndiscrete events (for 24 unique asteroids) during which the modeled comae have\nangular sizes resolvable by WISPR.

Abstract: Occultation light curves of exomoons may give information on their albedo and\nhence indicate the presence of ice cover on the surface. Icy moons might have\nsubsurface oceans thus these may potentially be habitable. The objective of our\npaper is to determine whether next generation telescopes will be capable of\nalbedo estimations for icy exomoons using their occultation light curves. The\nsuccess of the measurements depends on the depth of the moon's occultation in\nthe light curve and on the sensitivity of the used instruments. We applied\nsimple calculations for different stellar masses in the V and J photometric\nbands, and compared the flux drop caused by the moon's occultation and the\nestimated photon noise of next generation missions with 5 $\\sigma$ confidence.\nWe found that albedo estimation by this method is not feasible for moons of\nsolar-like stars, but small M dwarfs are better candidates for such\nmeasurements. Our calculations in the J photometric band show that E-ELT\nMICADO's photon noise is just about 4 ppm greater than the flux difference\ncaused by a 2 Earth-radii icy satellite in a circular orbit at the snowline of\nan 0.1 stellar mass star. However, considering only photon noise underestimates\nthe real expected noise, because other noise sources, such as CCD read-out and\ndark signal become significant in the near infrared measurements. Hence we\nconclude that occultation measurements with next generation missions are far\ntoo challenging, even in the case of large, icy moons at the snowline of small\nM dwarfs. We also discuss the role of the parameters that were neglected in the\ncalculations, e.g. inclination, eccentricity, orbiting direction of the moon.\nWe predict that the first albedo estimations of exomoons will probably be made\nfor large icy moons around the snowline of M4 -- M9 type main sequence stars. \n\n"}

Quantifying the set of planet masses and orbits that could have been\ndetected will enable more efficient planet discovery and characterization. We\nanalyzed Doppler measurements from Lick and Keck Observatories collected by the\nCalifornia Planet Survey.

The Doppler targets are primarily F8 and later main sequence\nstars, with observations spanning 1987-2014. We identified 76 stars with\nDoppler measurements from the prospective mission target lists. We developed an\nautomated planet search and a methodology to estimate the pipeline completeness\nusing injection and recovery tests.

We precisely\nconstrained stellar and planetary parameters by combining asteroseismology,\nspectroscopy, and granulation noise modeling along with transit and radial\nvelocity measurements. The uncertainty in planet radius is dominated by\nsystematic differences in transit depth, which we measure to be up to 30%\nbetween different lightcurve reduction methods. Our calculations indicate the\nincident flux on this planet was 170$^{+140}_{-60}$ times the incident flux on\nEarth while the star was on the main sequence.

Since the physics and geometry\nbehind the transit light curve and the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect\n(spectroscopic transit) are the same, the Rossiter-McLaughlin observations are\nexpected to be affected by the occultation of stellar active regions in a\nsimilar way. In this paper we perform a fundamental test on the spin-orbit\nangles as derived by Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, and we examine the\nimpact of the occultation of stellar active regions by the transiting planet on\nthe spin-orbit angle estimations. Our results show that the inaccurate\nestimation on the spin-orbit angle due to stellar activity can be quite\nsignificant (up to 30 degrees), particularly for the edge-on, aligned, and\nsmall transiting planets. Therefore, our results suggest that the aligned\ntransiting planets are the ones that can be easily misinterpreted as misaligned\nowing to the stellar activity.

Their abundances\ncan be comparable to that of methanol ice (few % of water ice) at large disc\nradii (R > 30 AU). Current Class II disc models may be underestimating the\ncomplex organic content. Planet population synthesis models may underestimate\nthe amount of CO2 and overestimate CH3OH ices in planetesimals by disregarding\nchemical processing between the cloud and disc phases. The overall C/O and C/N\nratios differ between the gas and solid phases. The two ice ratios show little\nvariation beyond the inner 10 AU and both are nearly solar in the case of pure\ninfall, but both are sub-solar when viscous spreading dominates. Chemistry in\nthe protostellar envelope en route to the protoplanetary disc sets the initial\nvolatile and prebiotically-significant content of icy planetesimals and\ncometary bodies. Comets are thus potentially reflecting the provenances of the\nmidplane ices in the Solar Nebula. \n\n"}

The planet has 20, 100, or 1000~M$_\\oplus$,\nranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a\ndeep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model disk's\nappearance. The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under starlight\nheating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in\nscattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by\nanother more distant planet. The surface brightness contrast between outer wall\nand shadow for the 1000-M$_\\oplus$ planet is an order of magnitude greater than\na model neglecting the temperature disturbances.

In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk.

As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries. \n\n"}

We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low.

This ECS has demonstrated 0.6mK RMS stability over 15 days at both 180K\nand 300K, and maintained high quality vacuum (<$10^{-7}$Torr) over months,\nduring long-term stability tests conducted without a planned passive thermal\nenclosure surrounding the vacuum chamber. This control scheme is versatile and\ncan be applied as a blueprint to stabilize future NIR and optical high\nprecision Doppler instruments over a wide temperature range from ~77K to\nelevated room temperatures. A similar ECS is being implemented to stabilize\nNEID, the NASA/NSF NN-EXPLORE spectrograph for the 3.5m WIYN telescope at Kitt\nPeak, operating at 300K. A full SolidWorks 3D-CAD model and a comprehensive\nparts list of the HPF ECS are included with this manuscript to facilitate the\nadaptation of this versatile environmental control scheme in the broader\nastronomical community. \n\n"}

Disc\n  Structure and Evolution Abstract: We present the results of 2-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nself-gravitating circumbinary discs around binaries whose parameters match\nthose of the circumbinary planet-hosting systems Kepler-16, -34 and -35.\nPrevious work has shown that non-self-gravitating discs in these systems form\nan eccentric precessing inner cavity due to tidal truncation by the binary, and\nplanets which form at large radii migrate until stalling at this cavity. While\nthis scenario appears to provide a natural explanation for the observed orbital\nlocations of the circumbinary planets, previous simulations have failed to\nmatch the observed planet orbital parameters. The aim of this work is to\nexamine the role of self-gravity in modifying circumbinary disc structure as a\nfunction of disc mass, prior to considering the evolution of embedded\ncircumbinary planets. In agreement with previous work, we find that for disc\nmasses between 1--5 times the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), disc\nself-gravity affects modest changes in the structure and evolution of\ncircumbinary discs. Increasing the disc mass to 10 or 20 MMSN leads to two\ndramatic changes in disc structure. First, the scale of the inner cavity\nshrinks substantially, bringing its outer edge closer to the binary. Second, in\naddition to the eccentric inner cavity, additional precessing eccentric\nring-like features develop in the outer regions of the discs. If planet\nformation starts early in the disc lifetime, these changes will have a\nsignificant impact on the formation and evolution of planets and precursor\nmaterial. \n\n"}

We study the effect\nof radiative feedback from such newly-formed secondary objects using radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We compare the results of simulations without any\nradiative feedback from secondary objects with those where two types of\nradiative feedback are considered: (i) continuous, and (ii) episodic. We find\nthat: (i) continuous radiative feedback stabilizes the disc and suppresses\nfurther fragmentation, reducing the number secondary objects formed; (ii)\nepisodic feedback from secondary objects heats and stabilises the disc when the\noutburst occurs, but shortly after the outburst stops, the disc becomes\nunstable and fragments again. However, fewer secondary objects are formed\ncompared to the the case without radiative feedback. We also find that the mass\ngrowth of secondary objects is mildly suppressed due to the effect of their\nradiative feedback. However, their mass growth also depends on where they form\nin the disc and on their subsequent interactions, such that their final masses\nare not drastically different from the case without radiative feedback. We find\nthat the masses of secondary objects formed by disc fragmentation are from a\nfew M$_{\\rm J}$ to a few 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$. Planets formed by fragmentation tend\nto be ejected from the disc. We conclude that planetary-mass objects on wide\norbits (wide-orbit planets) are unlikely to form by disc fragmentation.\nNevertheless, disc fragmentation may be a significant source of free-floating\nplanets and brown dwarfs. \n\n"}

Interestingly,\ndifferent potential recondensation nuclei have very different propensities to\nactually nucleate water ice at the temperatures associated with freeze-out in\nprotoplanetary discs. Therefore, if a region in a disc is warmed and then\nrecooled, water vapor should not be expected to refreeze evenly onto all\navailable grains. Instead it will preferentially recondense onto the most\nfavorable grains. When the recooling is slow enough, only the most favorable\ngrains will nucleate ice, allowing them to recondense thick ice mantles. We\nquantify the conditions for preferential recondensation to rapidly create\npebble-sized grains in protoplanetary discs and show that FU Orionis type\noutbursts have the appropriate cooling rates to drive pebble creation in a band\nabout 5 astronomical units wide outside of the quiescent frost line from\napproximately Jupiter's orbit to Saturn's (about 4 to 10 au).

At maximum light, the estimated photospheric\ntemperature and velocity are 17,000K and 14,000kms^-1 respectively. The\ninferred radiative and kinetic energy are roughly 1x10^{51} and 2x10^{52}erg.\nGaia16apd is extremely UV luminous, emitting 50% of its total luminosity at\n1000 - 2500A.

This excess is interpreted primarily as a\nresult of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of\niron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate\neither from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our\nobservation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized\nmaterial, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor\nmetallicity is likely sub-solar.

Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our\nSpitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted\nplanets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them.

In disks around Herbig Ae stars ($T_{\\mathrm{*}}\\sim$\n10,000K, $M_{\\mathrm{*}}\\gtrsim$ 2.5$M_{\\bigodot}$), the position of the\nH$_{2}$O snowline is further from the central star compared with that around\ncooler, and less massive T Tauri stars. Thus, the H$_{2}$O emission line fluxes\nfrom the region within the H$_{2}$O snowline are expected to be stronger. In\nthis paper, we calculate the chemical composition of a Herbig Ae disk using\nchemical kinetics. Next, we calculate the H$_{2}$O emission line profiles, and\ninvestigate the properties of candidate water lines across a wide range of\nwavelengths (from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter) that can locate the position\nof the H$_{2}$O snowline.

Spectroscopic monitoring of KIC 8197761 revealed sinusoidal radial\nvelocity variations with a semi-amplitude of $19.75 \\pm 0.32$ km/s, while\nindividual spectra present rotational broadening consistent with $v \\sin i =\n9\\pm1$ km/s. This suggests that the stellar surface rotation is synchronized\nwith the orbit, whereas the stellar core rotates $\\sim$30 times slower.\nCombining the observed radial velocity variability with the transit photometry,\nconstrains the companion's mass to be $\\approx 0.28$ M$_{\\odot}$, ruling out an\nexoplanet hypothesis. \n\n"}

Tidal interactions may have played an important role in\nthe evolution of the spin-orbit angle. In this study, we investigate the tidal\ninteractions in spin-orbit misaligned systems. In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and\nin a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited\non top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core. The\ntidal quality factor associated with the obliquity tide $Q'_{210}$ can be\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with other tidal\ncomponents if their frequencies fall outside the frequency range of inertial\nwaves. Therefore, it is possible that the spin-orbit misalignment undergoes\nmuch more rapid decay than the orbital decay in hot Jupiter systems owing to\nthe enhanced dissipation of the obliquity tide. \n\n"}

The\n\\textit{Spitzer} data exhibit finite-source effects due to the passage of the\nlens close to or directly over the surface of the source star as seen from\n\\textit{Spitzer}. Such finite-source effects generally yield measurements of\nthe angular Einstein radius, which when combined with the microlens parallax\nderived from a comparison between the ground-based and the \\textit{Spitzer}\nlight curves, yields the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax. From this\nanalysis, we find that the lens of OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 is a very low-mass star\nwith the mass $0.10 \\pm 0.02 \\ M_\\odot$ or a brown dwarf with the mass $55\\pm 9\n\\ M_{J}$, which are respectively located at $D_{\\rm LS} = 0.80 \\pm 0.19\\\n\\textrm{kpc}$ and $ D_{\\rm LS} = 0.54 \\pm 0.08\\ \\textrm{kpc}$, and thus it is\nthe first isolated low-mass microlens that has been decisively located in the\nGalactic bulge. The fundamental reason for the degeneracy is that the\nfinite-source effect is seen only in a single data point from \\textit{Spitzer}\nand this single data point gives rise to two solutions for $\\rho$. Because the\n$\\rho$ degeneracy can be resolved only by relatively high cadence observations\naround the peak, while the \\textit{Spitzer} cadence is typically $\\sim 1\\,{\\rm\nday}^{-1}$, we expect that events for which the finite-source effect is seen\nonly in the \\textit{Spitzer} data may frequently exhibit this $\\rho$\ndegeneracy.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

Effect of stellar\n  metallicity Abstract: Observations of hot Jupiter type exoplanets suggest that their orbital period\ndistribution depends on the metallicity of their host star. We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region. While on the pre-main sequence the dissipation of a metal\npoor Sun-like star is higher than the dissipation of a metal rich Sun-like\nstar, on the main sequence it is the opposite. However, for the $0.4~M_{\\odot}$\nstar, the dependence of the dissipation with metallicity is much less visible.\n  Using an orbital evolution model, we show that changing the metallicity leads\nto different orbital evolutions (e.g., planets migrate farther out from an\ninitially fast rotating metal rich star). By using this model, we qualitatively\nreproduced the observational trends of the population of hot Jupiters with the\nmetallicity of their host stars. However, more steps are needed to improve our\nmodel to try to quantitatively fit our results to the observations. Namely, we\nneed to improve the treatment of the rotation evolution in the orbital\nevolution model and ultimately we need to consistently couple of the orbital\nmodel to the stellar evolution model. \n\n"}

Observations have shown\nthat free-floating Jupiter-mass objects can exceed the number of stars in our\ngalaxy, implying that capture scenarios may not be so rare. To address this\nissue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering\nbetween a free-floating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound\nplanet. We distinguish between three different possible scattering outcomes,\nwhere the free-floating planet may get captured after the interaction with the\nbinary, remain unbound, or \"kick-out\" the bound planet and replace it. The\nsimulation was performed for different masses of the free-floating planets and\nstars, as well as different impact parameters, inclination angles and approach\nvelocities. The outcome statistics are used to construct an analytical\napproximation of the cross section for capturing a free-floating planet by\nfitting their dependence on the tested variables. The analytically approximated\ncross section is used to predict the capture rate for these kinds of objects,\nand to estimate that about 1\\% of all stars are expected to experience a\ntemporary capture of a free-floating planet during their lifetime.

Those maps could shed light on the possible initial\nnumber of small bodies close to Mimas, and help to better understand the\ndynamical origin of the small satellites.

Dust grains radially\ndrift due to gas--dust friction, and the gas is affected by the feedback from\ndust grains. We investigate the effects of the feedback from dust grains on the\nviscous evolution of the gas, taking into account the vertical dust settling.\nThe feedback from the grains pushes the gas outward. When the grains are small\nand the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much smaller than unity, the radial drift\nvelocity is reduced by the feedback effect but the gas still drifts inward.\nWhen the grains are sufficiently large or piled-up, the feedback is so\neffective that forces the gas flows outward. Although the dust feedback is\naffected by dust settling, we found that the 2D approximation reasonably\nreproduces the vertical averaged flux of gas and dust. We also performed the 2D\ntwo-fluid hydrodynamic simulations to examine the effect of the feedback from\nthe grains on the evolution of the gas disk. We show that when the feedback is\neffective, the gas flows outward and the gas density at the region within $\\sim\n10\\ \\mbox{AU}$ is significantly depleted.

The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and\na He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and\ncover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from\nthis scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities. \n\n"}

The method has its roots in binary star astronomy, and\nexoplanet detection represents the low-companion-mass limit of that\napplication.

Two primary forms of instrumental\ncalibration are the stable spectrograph and absorption cell methods, the former\nbeing the path taken for the next generation of spectrographs.

The clouds are produced by avalanches:\nradial outflows of dust that gain exponentially more mass as they shatter\nbackground disk particles in collisional chain reactions. The avalanches are\ntriggered from a region a few AU across -- the \"avalanche zone\" -- located on\nAU Mic's primary \"birth\" ring, at a true distance of $\\sim$35 AU from the star\nbut at a projected distance more than a factor of 10 smaller: the avalanche\nzone sits directly along the line of sight to the star, on the side of the ring\nnearest Earth, launching clouds that disk rotation sends wholly to the\nsoutheast, as observed. The avalanche zone marks where the primary ring\nintersects a secondary ring of debris left by the catastrophic disruption of a\nprogenitor up to Varuna in size, less than tens of thousands of years ago. Only\nwhere the rings intersect are particle collisions sufficiently violent to spawn\nthe sub-micron dust needed to seed the avalanches.

The Lorentz force exerted by the wind's magnetic\nfield, whose polarity reverses periodically according to the stellar magnetic\ncycle, promises to explain the observed vertical undulations. The timescale\nbetween avalanches, about 10 yr, might be set by time variability of the wind\nmass-loss rate or, more speculatively, by some self-regulating limit cycle. \n\n"}

We predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus\nentropy \"tuning fork\" diagram. We find high nominal post-formation luminosities\nfor hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation histories can still lead\nto a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass.\nHowever, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the\npost-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot states. As a key result\nwe predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep\nincrease towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of\nlow-mass planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an\nestimate of the planet mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the gas\naccretion rate can be estimated. Due to the \"core-mass effect\" planets that\nunderwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies.

The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit\ntheory of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For\nsufficiently large core mass (in the \"Hill regime\"), essentially all particles\nof appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be captured. However, the\nouter regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle\norbits may affect the efficiency of pebble accretion. We conduct shearing-box\nsimulations of pebble accretion with different levels of MRI turbulence\n(strongly turbulent assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics, weakly turbulent in\nthe presence of ambipolar diffusion, and laminar) and different core masses to\ntest the efficiency of pebble accretion at a microphysical level.

These observations\ncan provide complementary information on the mechanism carving the gaps in dust\nand additional constraints on the purported planet mass.

Due to the low dust density in the gaps, the dust and gas\ncomponents can become thermally decoupled, with the gas being colder than the\ndust. The gaps seen in CO are due to a combination of gas temperature dropping\nat the location of the planet, and of the underlying surface density profile.\nIn none of the models is a CO cavity observed, only CO gaps, indicating that\none single massive planet is not able to explain the CO cavities observed in\ntransition disks. \n\n"}

More often than not, evaluation of the true physical model for\nthese nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent on too many\n(unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference. Sometimes,\nhousekeeping data---and often the science data themselves---can be used as\npredictors of the systematic noise.

These models can be used to fit and subtract systematics\nprior to investigation of the signals of interest, or they can be used in a\nsimultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals. In this Note, we show that\nif a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of the linear components, the\nweights can be marginalized out with an operation in pure linear algebra, which\ncan (often) be made fast.

Since observed\nsuper-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas\nefficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to\nbe rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we\npropose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat\ntransport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is\ninvestigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate\npseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the\nradiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling\nluminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for\nthe turbulent diffusivity, $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$. If $\\nu_{\\rm turb}>\\nu_{\\rm\ncritical} $, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet\nwould become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant.

Abstract: Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness\ndistributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition\ndisks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms.

The integrated\nphotometric excess due to an avalanche is limited, less than 10% for these\nreleased dust masses, peaking in the mid-IR and becoming insignificant beyond\n$\\sim$40-50$\\mu$m. Contrary to earlier studies, we do not obtain stronger\navalanches when increasing $\\tau$ to higher values. Likewise, we do not observe\na significant luminosity deficit, as compared to the pre-avalanche level, after\nthe passage of the avalanche. These two results concur to make avalanches an\nunlikely explanation for the sharp luminosity drops observed in some extremely\nbright debris discs. The ideal configuration for observing an avalanche would\nbe a two-belt structure, with an inner belt of fractional luminosity >10$^{-4}$\nwhere breakups of massive planetesimals occur, and a more massive outer belt,\nwith $\\tau$ of a few $10^{-3}$, into which the avalanche chain reaction\ndevelops and propagates. \n\n"}

This state may be subject\nto a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical shear instability' (VSI), whose\nbreakdown into turbulence transports a moderate amount of angular momentum\nwhile also facilitating planet formation, possibly via the production of\nsmall-scale vortices. In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit\narbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the\nincompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are\nthemselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk\nrotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain\nlarge amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed). This `delay' in\nsaturation probably explains the prominence of the VSI linear modes in global\nsimulations. More generally, the parasites may set the amplitude of VSI\nturbulence in strongly irradiated disks. They are also important in breaking\nthe axisymmetry of the flow, via the unavoidable formation of vortices. The\nvortices, however, are not aligned with the orbital plane and thus express a\npronounced $z$-dependence.

The best\nconstrained parameters are the individual layer thicknesses. The maximum radius\nfraction of possible atmospheres are 0.18 and 0.13 $R$ (radius), for planets b\nand c, respectively.

Our aim is to model the gaseous CO$_2$ abundance in the inner disk and\nuse this to probe the efficiency of icy dust transport in a viscous disk.\nFeatures in the simulated CO$_2$ spectra are investigated for their dust flux\ntracing potential. We have developed a 1D viscous disk model that includes gas\nand grain motions as well as dust growth, sublimation and freeze-out and a\nparametrisation of the CO$_2$ chemistry. The thermo-chemical code DALI was used\nto model the mid-infrared spectrum of CO$_2$, as can be observed with\nJWST-MIRI. CO$_2$ ice sublimating at the iceline increases the gaseous CO$_2$\nabundance to levels equal to the CO$_2$ ice abundance of $\\sim 10^{-5}$, which\nis three orders of magnitude more than the gaseous CO$_2$ abundances of $\\sim\n10^{-8}$ observed by Spitzer.

The disk in such systems is twisted/warped due to the gravitational\ntorques from the oblate central star and the external companion. We calculate\nthe disk warp profile, taking into account of bending wave propagation and\nviscosity in the disk. We show that for typical protostellar disk parameters,\nthe disk warp is small, thereby justifying the \"flat-disk\" approximation\nadopted in previous theoretical studies. However, the viscous dissipation\nassociated with the small disk warp/twist tends to drive the disk toward\nalignment with the binary or the central star. We calculate the relevant\ntimescales for the alignment. We find the alignment is effective for\nsufficiently cold disks with strong external torques, especially for systems\nwith rapidly rotating stars, but is ineffective for the majority of\nstar-disk-binary systems. Viscous warp driven alignment may be necessary to\naccount for the observed spin-orbit alignment in multi-planet systems if these\nsystems are accompanied by an inclined binary companion. \n\n"}

Among the\nspiral-triggering mechanisms proposed, only one establishes a causal link\nbetween shadows and spirals so far. In fact, provided the presence of shadows\nin the disc, the combined effect of temperature gradient and differential disc\nrotation, creates strong azimuthal pressure gradients. After several thousand\nyears, grand-design spirals develop in the gas phase. Previous works have only\nconsidered static shadows caused by an inclined inner disc. However, in some\ncases, the inner regions of circumbinary discs can break and precess. Thus, it\nis more realistic to consider moving shadow patterns in the disc. In this\nconfiguration, the intersection between the inner and the outer discs defines\nthe line of nodes at which the shadows are cast. Here, we consider moving\nshadows and study the resulting circumbinary disc structure. We find that only\nstatic and prograde shadows trigger spirals, in contrast to retrograde ones.\nInterestingly, if a region of the disc corotates with the shadow, a planet-like\nsignature develops at the co-rotation position. The resulting spirals resemble\nthose caused by a planet embedded in the disc, with similar pitch angles. \n\n"}

We modeled the intrinsic light curves in six\noptical bands, adopting a theoretical model for the luminosity evolution of\nsupernovae interacting with their circumstellar material. From the difference\nbetween the observed and intrinsic light curves, we calculated extinction\ncurves as a function of time. The total-to-selective extinction ratio, $R_V$,\nwas determined from the extinction in the B and V bands.

Previous studies have\nreported extended wings and asymmetries in the H$\\alpha$ line during flares. We\nused a total of 473 high-resolution spectra of 28 active M dwarfs obtained by\nthe CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exo-earths\nwith Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) spectrograph to study the\noccurrence of broadened and asymmetric H$\\alpha$ line profiles and their\nassociation with flares, and examine possible physical explanations.

The broadened H$\\alpha$ lines display a variety of profiles with\nsymmetric cases and both red and blue asymmetries.

We find the mean grain\nsize of silicate minerals to be a key control on magma ascent. For grain sizes\nlarger than $\\approx$ 1 mm, melt segregation produces distinct radial structure\nand chemical stratification. This stratification is most pronounced for bodies\nformed at around 1 Myr after formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions. These findings\nsuggest a link between the time and orbital location of planetesimal formation\nand their subsequent structural and chemical evolution. According to our\nmodels, the evolution of partially molten planetesimal interiors falls into two\ncategories. In the magma ocean scenario, the whole interior of a planetesimal\nexperiences nearly complete melting, which would result in turbulent convection\nand core-mantle differentiation by the rainfall mechanism. In the magma sill\nscenario, segregating melts gradually deplete the deep interior of the\nradiogenic heat source. In this case, magma may form melt-rich layers beneath a\ncool and stable lid, while core formation would proceed by percolation. Our\nfindings suggest that grain sizes prevalent during the internal heating stage\ngoverned magma ascent in planetesimals. Regardless of whether evolution\nprogresses toward a magma ocean or magma sill structure, our models predict\nthat temperature inversions due to rapid Al-26 redistribution are limited to\nbodies formed earlier than $\\approx$ 1 Myr after CAIs.

Multi-wavelength observations are indispensable in studying disk\ngeometry and dust evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We aimed\nto construct a 3-dimensional model of HD 163296 capable of reproducing\nsimultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the\nSPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk\nmidplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is\nintermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig\nstars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the\nALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used\nto constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and\ngrain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the\ndisk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only\nthe innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a\nlack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two\nmodels capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased\nsettling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the\nsurface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the\nfirst ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the\nouter disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and NIR\nwavelengths. In the region outside the fragmentation-dominated regime, such\ndepletion is expected from state-of-the-art dust evolution models.

Here we analytically\nand numerically investigate vertical tracer transport in a 3D stratified\natmosphere and predict $K_{zz}$ as a function of the large-scale circulation\nstrength, horizontal mixing due to eddies and waves and local tracer sources\nand sinks. We find that $K_{zz}$ increases with tracer chemical lifetime and\ncirculation strength but decreases with horizontal eddy mixing efficiency. We\ndemarcated three $K_{zz}$ regimes in planetary atmospheres. In the first regime\nwhere the tracer lifetime is short compared with the transport timescale and\nhorizontal tracer distribution under chemical equilibrium ($\\chi_0$) is\nuniformly distributed across the globe, global-mean vertical tracer mixing\nbehaves diffusively.

While the\nexistence of a circum-jovian disk is supported by hydrodynamic simulations, no\nconsensus exists regarding the origin and delivery mechanisms of the building\nblocks of the forming satellites. The opening of a gap in the circumsolar disk\nwould have efficiently isolated Jupiter from the main sources of solid\nmaterial. However, a reservoir of planetesimals should have existed at the\nouter edge of Jupiter's gap, where solids were trapped and accumulated over\ntime. Here we show that the formation of Saturn's core within this reservoir,\nor its prompt inward migration, allows planetesimals to be redistributed from\nthis reservoir towards Jupiter and the inner Solar System, thereby providing\nenough material to form the Galilean satellites and to populate the Main Belt\nwith primitive asteroids. We find that the orbit of planetesimals captured\nwithin the circumjovian disk are circularized through friction with gas in a\ncompact system comparable to the current radial extent of the Galilean\nsatellites. The decisive role of Saturn in the delivery mechanism has strong\nimplications for the occurrence of massive moons around extrasolar giant\nplanets as they would preferentially form around planets within multiple planet\nsystems. \n\n"}

While current simulations of terrestrial\naccretion can reproduce many observed qualities of the solar system,\nreplicating the small mass of Mars requires modification to standard planet\nformation models. Here we use 800 dynamical simulations to show that an early\ninstability in the outer solar system strongly influences terrestrial planet\nformation and regularly yields properly sized Mars analogs.

First, we found that the $M_{\\rm{dust}}-M_\\star$ relation is much\nflatter for TDs than the observed trends from samples of class II sources in\ndifferent star forming regions. This relation demonstrates that cavities open\nin high (dust) mass disks, independent of the stellar mass. The flatness of\nthis relation contradicts the idea that TDs are a more evolved set of disks.\nTwo potential reasons (not mutually exclusive) may explain this flat relation:\nthe emission is optically thick or/and millimeter-sized particles are trapped\nin a pressure bump.

Significant difference is expected in case of\natmospheric waves interfering with cloud structures.

Secondly, we extensively study the impact of atmospheric seeing and\nshow that it modifies the apparent location of the planet in the sky whenever\nthe planet is not observed at full phase (opposition).

Here we investigate how the\nprocess of inward scattering of comets originating in an outer belt, is\naffected by the architecture of a planetary system, to determine whether this\ncould lead to observable exozodi levels or deliver volatiles to inner planets.\nUsing N-body simulations, we model systems with different planet mass and\norbital spacing distributions in the 1-50 AU region.

The thermal phase mapping problem has previously been solved\nanalytically, with orthogonal maps---spherical harmonics---yielding orthogonal\nlightcurves---sinusoids. The eclipse mapping problem, let alone combined\nphase+eclipse mapping, does not lend itself to such a neat solution. Previous\nefforts have either adopted spherical harmonics, or various ad hoc map\nparameterizations, none of which produce orthogonal lightcurves.

With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

Although the\naerodynamic drag from the dust on the gas is weaker than in the case where all\ngrains are optimally coupled to the gas, the cumulative \"back-reaction\" of the\ndust particles can still alter the gas dynamics significantly. In typical\nprotoplanetary discs, the net effect of the dust back-reaction decreases the\ngas accretion flow compared to the dust-free (viscous) case, even for\ndust-to-gas ratios of order $1\\%$.

Coupling of better measurements of mass ($M_p$) and radius of\nexoplanets with planet structure models enables estimating the total heavy\nelement mass ($M_Z$) in these planets. The corresponding relation is\ncharacterized by a power-law profile, $M_Z \\propto M_p^{3/5}$. We develop a\nsimplified, but physically motivated analysis to investigate how the power-law\nprofile can be produced under the current picture of planet formation. Making\nuse of the existing semi-analytical formulae of accretion rates of pebbles and\nplanetesimals, our analysis shows that the relation can be reproduced well if\nit traces the final stage of planet formation. In the stage, planets accrete\nsolids from gapped planetesimal disks and gas accretion is limited by disk\nevolution. We also find that dust accretion accompanying with gas accretion\ndoes not contribute to $M_Z$ for planets with $M_p < 10^3 M_{\\oplus}$. Our\nfindings are broadly consistent with that of previous studies, yet we\nexplicitly demonstrate how planetesimal dynamics is crucial for better\nunderstanding the relation.

The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be\noptically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult.\nWe find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc\nsurface is important for the line formation.

Our primary findings\nare that the solid core masses of planets are higher around higher metallicity\nstars and that these more massive cores were able to accrete larger gas\nenvelopes. Furthermore, investigating the recently reported result that planets\nwith radii in the range (2-6Rearth) are more common at short periods around\nhigher metallicity stars in detail, we find that the average host star\nmetallicity of H/He atmosphere-hosting planets increases smoothly inside an\norbital period of ~20 days. We interpret the location of the metallicity\nincrease within the context of atmospheric photoevaporation: higher metallicity\nstars are likely to host planets with higher atmospheric metallicity, which\nincreases the cooling in the photoevaporative outflow, lowering the mass-loss\nrates. Therefore, planets with higher metallicity atmospheres are able to\nresist photoevaporation at shorter orbital periods. Finally, we find evidence\nat 2.8 sigma that planets that do not host H/He atmospheres at long periods are\nmore commonly found around lower metallicity stars.

This discrepancy could be caused by the presence of free-free\nemission close to the star at 7 mm, or by a more compact accumulation of the\nlarge dust grains at the edge of the cavity. \n\n"}

One and only mechanism proposed for prolonging the residence time of\nhot grains in the near-stellar environments is trapping of charged\nnanoparticles by stellar magnetic fields. We revisit the model of magnetic\ngrain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking\ninto account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of\nmagnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the\nvicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate\nmagnetic-field strengths.

Given the observing\nstrategy employed by TESS the probability of detecting single transits in long\nperiod systems is increased. These systems require careful consideration.\n  Aims: To simulate the number of TESS transit detections during its 2 year\nmission with a particular emphasis on single transits. Additionally, to\ndetermine the feasibility of ground-based follow-up observations from a single\nsite.\n  Methods: A distribution of planets is simulated around the $\\sim$ 4 million\nstars in the TESS Candidate Target List. These planets are tested for\ndetectable transits and characterised. Based on simulated parameters the single\ntransit detections are further analysed to determine which are amenable to\nground-based follow-up.\n  Results: TESS will discover an approximate lower bound of 4700 planets with\naround 460 being single transits. A large fraction of these will be observable\nfrom a single ground-based site. This paper finds that, in a single year,\napproximately 1000 transit events of around 320 unique TESS single transit\ndetections are theoretically observable.\n  Conclusions: As we consider longer period exoplanets the need for exploring\nsingle transit detections increases. For periods $\\gtrsim45$ days the number of\nsingle transit detections outnumber multitransits by a factor of 3 (82$\\pm$18\nand 25$\\pm$7 respectively) a factor which only grows as longer period\ndetections are considered. Therefore, it is worth expending the extra effort\nrequired to follow-up these more challenging, but potentially very rewarding,\ndiscoveries.

We have carried out numerical simulations of the resonance\ncrossing using an N-Body code as well as using averaged equations of motion. A\nlarge span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started\non its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can\ntrigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.\nThe outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a\nquality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the\nresonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality\nfactor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with\npost-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations\ncapable of reaching 11 degrees. Usually high inclinations come with high\neccentricities but some simulations show elements compatible with Iapetus'\ncurrent orbit. A quality factor between 100 and 2000 at the frequency of Titan\nwould bring Titan and Iapetus into a 5:1 resonance, which would perturb\nIapetus' eccentricity and inclination to values observed today.

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether\nthese nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how\nto constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we\npresent a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on\ncentrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic\natomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material\n($S_{\\max}$), resulting in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than\n$a\\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\\max}\\sim 10^{9}\\erg\\cm^{-3}$.

The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3\n\\leq m \\lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion\nrelation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days. Here we\nsimulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \\leq m \\leq\n5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of\nthe surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of\nthe solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been\nobserved. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier\nspectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious\nplanetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in\nthe case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV\nplanet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of\nobservational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.10386", "contents": "Title: Clumpy dust rings around non-accreting young stars Abstract: We investigate four young, but non-accreting, very low mass stars in Orion,\nwhich show irregular eclipses by circumstellar dust. The eclipses are not\nrecurring periodically, are variable in depth, lack a flat bottom, and their\nduration is comparable to the typical timescale between eclipses. The dimming\nis associated with reddening consistent with dust extinction. Taken together\nthis implies the presence of rings around these four stars, with radii ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 40 AU, comprised of optically thin dust clouds. The stars also\nshow IR excess indicating the presence of evolved circumstellar disks, with\norders of magnitude more material than needed for the eclipses. However, the\nrings need to cover an opening angle of about 20 degrees to explain how common\nthese variable stars are in the coeval population in the same region, which is\nmore extended than a typical disk. Thus, we propose that the rings may not be\npart of the disks, but instead separate structures with larger scale heights.\nTo be sustained over years, the rings need to be replenished by dust from the\ndisk or gravitationally bound to an object (e.g., planets or planetesimals).\nThese four stars belong to a growing and diverse class of post-T Tauri stars\nwith dips or eclipses in their lightcurves. Dusty rings with scale heights\nexceeding those of disks may be a common phenomenon at stellar ages between 5\nand 10 Myr, in the transition from accretion disks to debris disks. These\nstructures could be caused by migrating planets and may be signposts for the\npresence of young planetary systems. \n\n"}
