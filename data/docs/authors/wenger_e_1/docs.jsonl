After a (3+1)-dimensional\nideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons\nvia the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation\nwithin UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a\nrealistic freeze-out.

Thus, the structure of Lambda(1405) is closely\nrelated to the Kbar N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study\nfew-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic\nproperties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical\ncoupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity\nof the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Lambda(1405)\nresonance is dominated by the meson-baryon molecule component and is described\nas a superposition of two independent states. The meson-baryon nature of\nLambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with\nstrangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic\ninteractions. We summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the\nLambda(1405) structure and future perspective of the physics of the\nLambda(1405) resonance. \n\n"}

With the aid of this formalism, we take a fresh look at the\nbehaviours of the charged-pion elastic form factor and of the form factors\nentering in the transitions of the ground-state neutral unflavoured\npseudoscalar mesons pi^0, eta, eta' to one real and one virtual photon within a\nbroad range of momentum transfers Q^2.

For Q^2 larger\nthan 5-6 GeV^2, we judge the predictions of the simplest local-duality model to\nbe reliable and expect their accuracy to improve very fast with increasing Q^2.\nThe large-Q^2 prediction for the pion elastic form factor should be approached\nalready at moderate momentum transfer squared of approximately 4-8 GeV^2; large\ndeviations from its local-duality behaviour for Q^2 = 20-50 GeV^2, predicted by\nsome hadron-structure models, seem rather unlikely.

It has been suggested that the existence of a\nQCD phase transition would cause an increase and divergence of fluctuations.\nThus the event-by-event particle-ratio fluctuations could be used to study\nstrangeness and baryon number fluctuations near the critical point in the QCD\nphase diagram. On the other hand, the study of the balance function can provide\ninformation about charge creation time as well as the subsequent collective\nbehavior of particles.\n  For fluctuations we present dynamical $K/\\pi$, $p/\\pi$, and $K/p$ ratio\nfluctuations from Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV at\nthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider using the STAR detector. Charge dependent\nresults as well as multiplicity scaling properties of these fluctuation results\nare discussed.

We ascribed this difference to a\nnon-unitary interaction of the produced final state rho_f(S) with a universal\nquantum environment in the Universe. This new kind of interaction must be a\npure dephasing interaction. If the quantum environment is to be an integral\npart of the Nature then its dephasing interactions must be fully consistent\nwith the Standard Model. In this work we impose on the dephasing interaction\nthe requirements of the conservation of the identities and four-momenta of the\nfinal state particles, Lorentz symmetry, P-parity and the conservation of total\nangular momentum and isospin.

ICECUBE claimed that a\ncomponent (10:6+5:0 3:6), a third, of these events must be a trace of expected\ndownward muons and-or atmospheric neutrinos (muon track dominated): The\nprobability that this scenario occurs is very poor, about 0.1- 0.5%. The\nparadox might be mitigate as we suggest if nearly all of the 28 events are\noriginated by extraterrestrial sources arriving to us in de-coherent states. At\nfirst sight also a partial solution may rise if highest energy events at E nu >\n60 TeV ( 17 showering versus 4 muon tracks) are mostly of extraterrestrial\nnature. However this solution leaves problematic the earlier 30 - 60 TeV energy\nregion, whose 8 showers versus 3 tracks is in tension with most nearby\natmospheric neutrino signals, by a sharp difference at TeV energy ruled (as\nshown in Deep Core) by ten over one neutrino (muon) events over showers. This\npuzzling (fast) flavor transition from atmospheric nu muon flux at TeV to tens\nTeV showers and muon neutrino absence has deep consequences.

Standard approaches have relied on\n`shallow' machine learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex\nnon-linear functions of the inputs, and rely on a pain-staking search through\nmanually constructed non-linear features.

These relations\nemerge out of the symmetries of the angular distribution. We discuss the\nimplications of these relations under the (testable) hypotheses of no scalar or\ntensor contributions and no New Physics weak phases in the Wilson coefficients.\nUnder these hypotheses there is a direct relation among the observables\n$P_{1}$,$P_2$ and $P_{4,5}^\\prime$. This can be used as an independent\nconsistency test of the measurements of the angular observables. Alternatively,\nthese relations can be applied directly in the fit to data, reducing the number\nof free parameters in the fit. This opens up the possibility to perform a full\nangular fit of the observables with existing datasets. An important consequence\nof the found relations is that a priori two different measurements, namely the\nmeasured position of the zero ($q_0^2$) of the forward-backward asymmetry\n$A_{FB}$ and the value of $P_5^\\prime$ evaluated at this same point, are\nrelated by $P_4^2(q_0^{2})+P_5^2(q_0^{2})=1$.

We find that photon-tagged b-jets exhibit smaller momentum\nimbalance shift in nuclear matter, and correspondingly smaller energy loss,\nthan photon-tagged light flavor jets.

Heavy quarks are considered\neffective probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a short\ntime scale, with respect to that of the QGP, and subsequently interact with it.\nMoreover, for a proper assessment of the characteristics of the matter produced\nin heavy-ion collisions, it is important to disentangle the final state effects\ndue to the formation of a QGP from the initial state effects due to the fact\nthat nuclei are present in the colliding system. Both initial and final state\neffects may lead to qualitatively similar phenomena in the observables of\ninterest.

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb.

Its extension to the\nmulti-reference level allows for restoring symmetries and, in turn, for\ncalculating transition rates.\n  [Purpose] We propose a new no-core-configuration-interaction (NCCI) model\ntreating properly isospin and rotational symmetries. The model is applicable to\nany nucleus irrespective of its mass and neutron- and proton-number parity. It\nproperly includes polarization effects caused by an interplay between the long-\nand short-range forces acting in the atomic nucleus.\n  [Methods] The method is based on solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation\nwithin a model space built of linearly-dependent states having good angular\nmomentum and properly treated isobaric spin. The states are generated by means\nof the isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying\n(multi)particle-(multi)hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the\nself-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach.\n  [Results] The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N~Z nuclei\nthat are relevant from the point of view of a study of superallowed Fermi\nbeta-decays. In particular, a new set of the isospin-symmetry-breaking\ncorrections to these decays is given.\n  [Conclusions] It is demonstrated that the NCCI model is capable to capture\nmain features of low-lying energy spectra in light and medium-mass nuclei using\nrelatively small model space and without any local readjustment of its\nlow-energy coupling constants. Its flexibility and a range of applicability\nmakes it an interesting alternative to the conventional nuclear shell model. \n\n"}

QCD is characterised by two emergent\nphenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are\nexpressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion\nproperties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a\nNambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in\nNature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to\nrevealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental\nprogress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting\nboth improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved\nin the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.\nBoth challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a\ntheoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB\nworks to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,\nensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all\nthe mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and\nneutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton\ndistribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form\nfactor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions\nfor the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by\nexperiments planned at JLab 12. Those experiments will extend precise\ncharged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in\nvalidating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the\nnonperturbative and perturbative domains, and thereby reaching a goal that has\nlong driven hadro-particle physics. \n\n"}

Therefore, the upper limits of the\ntotal cross sections for the bound state production and decay in\ndd->(4He-eta)_bound->3He n pi0 and dd->(4He-eta)_bound->3He p pi- processes\nwere determined taking into account the isospin relation between both the\nchannels considered. The results of the analysis depend on the assumptions of\nthe N* momentum distribution in the anticipated mesic-4He. Assuming as in the\nprevious works, that this is identical with the distribution of nucleons bound\nwith 20 MeV in 4He, we determined that (for the mesic bound state width in the\nrange from 5 MeV to 50 MeV) the upper limits at 90% confidence level are about\n3 nb and about 6 nb for npi0 and ppi- channels, respectively. However, based on\nthe recent theoretical findings of the N*(1535) momentum distribution in the\nN*-3He nucleus bound by 3.6 MeV, we find that the WASA-at-COSY detector\nacceptance decreases and hence the corresponding upper limits are 5 nb and 10\nnb for npi0 and ppi- channels respectively. \n\n"}

At TeV-scale colliders, this is in contrast to top quark and\nmultijet processes, which, by definition, are hard and central. Consequently,\nvetoing events with jets possessing transverse momenta above $p_T^{\\rm Veto}$\nin searches for new color-singlet states can efficiently reduce non-singlet\nbackgrounds, thereby increasing experimental sensitivity. To quantify this\ngeneric observation, we investigate the production and leptonic decay of a\nSequential Standard Model $W'$ boson at the 13 TeV LHC. We systematically\nconsider signal and background processes at next-to-leading-order (NLO) in QCD\nwith parton shower (PS) matching; for color-singlet channels, we resum Sudakov\nlogarithms of the form $\\alpha_s^j(p_T^{\\rm Veto})\\log^k(Q/p_T^{\\rm Veto})$ up\nto next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL) with NLO matching.

The distribution of isoscalar\nmonopole strength is computed in a relativistic random phase approximation\n(RPA) using three effective interactions that have been calibrated to the\nproperties of finite nuclei and neutron stars.

As this QCD\ninterference does not depend on the strong coupling constant, it is part of the\nno-interaction baseline that needs to be controlled prior to searching for\nother manifestations of collective dynamics. Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence. We further find that the\nnon-abelian features of QCD interference can give rise to odd harmonic\nanisotropies. These findings indicate that the no-interaction baseline\nincluding QCD interference effects can make a sizeable if not dominant\ncontribution to the measured $v_n$ coefficients in pp collisions. Prospects for\nanalyzing QCD interference contributions further and their possible relevance\nfor proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions are discussed shortly. \n\n"}

Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the\ninfluence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities\n$\\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\\epsilon_n)$, $p(\\epsilon_n,\\epsilon_m)$ and\n$p(N,\\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle\ncumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation\nis established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the\nreference subevent.

We then consider how neutral and charged\nhadrons containing a gluino will behave in a detector, demonstrating that there\nis generally substantial apparent missing momentum associated with a produced\ngluino-LSP. We next investigate limits on a (heavy) gluino-LSP deriving from\nLEP, LEP2 and RunI Tevatron experimental searches for excess events in the jets\nplus missing momentum channel and for stable heavily-ionizing charged\nparticles. The range of gluino mass that can be excluded depends upon the path\nlength of the gluino in the detector, the amount of energy it deposits in each\nhadronic collision, and the probability for the gluino to fragment to a\npseudo-stable charged hadron after a given hadronic collision.

The reaction is characterized by a high\ndegree of transparency of the collisions partners leading to the formation of a\nbaryon-poor central region.

In E850 the angular dependence of the\nnuclear transparency near 90 Deg. c.m., and the nuclear transparency for\ndeuterons was studied. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier\nexperiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the\nCarbon data. E834 also determines the nuclear transparencies for Li, Al, Cu,\nand Pb nuclei as well as for C. We find for both E850 and E834 that the A(p,2p)\nnuclear transparency, unlike that for A(e,e'p) nuclear transparency, is\nincompatible with a constant value versus energy as predicted by Glauber\ncalculations. The A(p,2p) nuclear transparency for C and Al increases by a\nfactor of two between 5.9 and 9.5 GeV/c incident proton momentum. At its peak\nthe A(p,2p) nuclear transparency is about 80% of the constant A(e,e'p) nuclear\ntransparency. Then the nuclear transparency falls back to the Glauber level\nagain. This oscillating behavior is generally interpreted as an interplay\nbetween two components of the pN scattering amplitude; one short ranged and\nperturbative, and the other long ranged and strongly absorbed in the nuclear\nmedium. We suggest a number of experiments for further studies of nuclear\ntransparency effects. \n\n"}

It is shown that for low\ncollision energies possible nuclear reactions (including deuterium fusion) are\nstrongly boosted by the environment. The effect originates from a chain of\npreliminary three elastic collisions which transform the projectile-target\nexperiment into one with colliding beams. Firstly, the projectile-target pair\nof nuclei undergo elastic scattering in which the projectile shares its energy\nand momentum with the target nucleus. Then the projectile and target nuclei\ncollide with different heavy nuclei from the environment. These latter\ncollisions change the velocities of the target and projectile nuclei and set\nthem again on the collision course.

The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude.
