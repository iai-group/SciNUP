Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

The\ntemperature map is uniquely able to identify the substructure in an almost\nrelaxed cluster which would be unnoticed in the ICM electron number density and\npressure maps. We describe the radial fluctuations in the 2-D maps by a\ncumulative/differential scatter profile relative to the mean profile within/at\na given radius.

Abstract: We have observed the hard X-ray selected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy SWIFT\nJ2127.4+5654 with Suzaku. We report the detection of a broad relativistic iron\nemission line from the inner accretion disc. By assuming that the inner edge of\nthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of the\nblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spin\na= 0.6\\pm0.2. However, a non-rotating Schwarzschild spacetime is excluded at\njust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning Kerr black hole is\nexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. The intermediate spin we measure may indicate\nthat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds through\nshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the disc\nand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. The measured steep emissivity\nindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating X-ray source to be very centrally\nconcentrated. Light bending may help focus the primary emission towards the\ninnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. On the other\nhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the hole\nrotational energy is at work. If this is the case, the interplay between\naccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction\n(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,\nunder standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.\nRotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account for\nthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral\nanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

Over the three XRT observations, the\nsource flux varied by up to 39% from the average, and the spectrum is generally\nsoft.

Because the time period of star capture by the supermassive black\nhole is expected to be shorter than the lifetime of the ejected fast particles\nagainst Coulomb losses, the gamma-ray emission is predicted to be stationary.\nWe find that the nuclear de-excitation lines should be emitted from a region of\nmaximum 5$^\\circ$ angular radius.

Such SMW\njets are assumed as initial conditions in some numerical simulations that\ndemonstrate that SMW jets can expel the rest of the collapsing star. The\noriginal fast narrow jets must deposit their energy inside the star via shock\nwaves, and form two hot bubbles that accelerate a much larger mass to form SMW\njets. To prevent the jets from penetrating through the still infalling gas and\nescape instead of forming the hot bubbles, the jets should encounter fresh\ninfalling gas.

Between directional sweeps, the\nthree-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always\nperformed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.\nHence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation\nequations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel\nparallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI\nfor cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory. This scheme\nis then combined with an additional OpenMP parallelisation of different sweeps\nthat can take advantage of clusters of shared memory.

Search for very cold clouds Abstract: In the previous papers of this series, we have decomposed into Gaussian\ncomponents all the HI 21-cm line profiles of the Leiden-Argentina-Bonn (LAB)\ndatabase, and studied statistical distributions of the obtained Gaussians. Now\nwe are interested in separation from the general database of the components the\n\"clouds\" of closely spaced similar Gaussians. In this paper we describe the new\ncloud-finding algorithm. To separate the clouds of similar Gaussians, we start\nwith the single-link hierarchical clustering procedure in five-dimensional\n(longitude, latitude, velocity, Gaussian width and height) space, but make some\nmodifications to accommodate it to the large number of components. We also use\nthe requirement that each cloud may be represented at any observed sky position\nby only one Gaussian and take into account the similarity of global properties\nof the merging clouds. As a test, we apply the algorithm for finding the clouds\nof the narrowest HI 21-cm line components.

This has lead to the intriguing suggestion\nthat this high energy emission is generated via synchrotron emission of\nrelativistic electrons accelerated by the external shock. Moreover, the limits\non the MeV afterglow emission lead to the suggestion that, at least in bright\nGeV bursts the field is not amplified beyond compression in the shock. We show\nhere that considerations of confinement (within the decelerating shock),\nefficiency and cooling of the emitting electrons constrain, within this model,\nthe magnetic fields that arise in both the upstream (circum burst) and\ndownstream (ejecta) regions, allowing us to obtain a direct handle on their\nvalues. The well known limit on the maximal synchrotron emission, when combined\nwith the blast wave evolution, implies that late photons (arriving more than\n~100 s after the burst) with energies higher than ~ 10GeV do not arise\nnaturally from external shock synchrotron and almost certainly have a different\norigin. Finally, even a modest seed flux (a few mJy) at IR-optical would\nquench, via Inverse Compton cooling, the GeV emission unless the magnetic field\nis significantly amplified behind the shock. An observation of a burst with\nsimultaneous IR-optical and GeV emission will rule out this model. \n\n"}

The recent Fermi-LAT\nobservations of prompt GeV emission from several bright GRBs have leaded to\nconclusions of unexpectedly large LFs, $\\Gamma>10^3$. Here we revisit this\nproblem with two main concerns. (1) With one-zone assumption where all photons\nare assumed to be generated in the same region (radius) and time, we {\\em\nself-consistently} calculate the $\\gamma\\gamma$ optical depth by adopting a\ntarget photon spectrum with HE cutoff. We find that this might be important\nwhen the GRB LF is below a few hundreds. (2) Recent Fermi-LAT observations\nsuggest that the bulk MeV-range and HE ($\\ga100$ MeV) emission may arise from\ndifferent regions. We then consider a two-zone case where HE emission is\ngenerated in much larger radii than that of the MeV-range emission. We find\nthat the HE emission may be mainly attenuated by MeV-range emission and that\nthe attenuated HE spectrum does not show an exponential spectral cutoff but a\nslight steepening. This suggests that there may be no abrupt cutoff due to\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ attenuation if relaxing the one-zone assumption.

In particular we discuss how studying the energy spectra\nof each neutrino flavour coming from such distant sources and their distortion\nrelative to each other may serve as pointers to exotic physics such as neutrino\ndecay, Lorentz symmetry violation, pseudo-Dirac effects, CP and CPT violation\nand quantum decoherence. This allows us to probe hitherto unexplored ranges of\nparameters for the above cases, for example lifetimes in the range $\n10^{-3}-10^{4} $ s/eV for the case of neutrino decay. We show that standard\nneutrino oscillations ensure that the different flavours arrive at the earth\nwith similar shapes even if their flavour spectra at source may differ strongly\nin both shape and magnitude. As a result, observed differences between the\nspectra of various flavours at the detector would be signatures of non-standard\nphysics altering neutrino fluxes during propagation rather than those arising\nduring their production at source.

In anticipation of the first detections, the\nexpected distribution of GW sources in the local universe is of considerable\ninterest. Here we investigate the full phase space distribution of coalescing\ncompact binaries at $z = 0$ using dark matter simulations of structure\nformation. The fact that these binary systems acquire large barycentric\nvelocities at birth (\"kicks\") results in merger site distributions that are\nmore diffusely distributed with respect to their putative hosts, with mergers\noccurring out to distances of a few Mpc from the host halo. Redshift estimates\nbased solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can, as a result, be\ninaccurate.

The dominant source of the systematics for all ground based telescopes\nis the spatial correlation of the PSF modulated by both atmospheric turbulence\nand optical aberrations. In this paper, we present a full FOV simulation of the\nLSST images by modeling both the atmosphere and the telescope optics with the\nmost current data for the telescope specifications and the environment. To\nsimulate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, we generated six-layer phase\nscreens with the parameters estimated from the on-site measurements. For the\noptics, we combined the ray-tracing tool ZEMAX and our simulated focal plane\ndata to introduce realistic aberrations and focal plane height fluctuations.\nAlthough this expected flatness deviation for LSST is small compared with that\nof other existing cameras, the fast f-ratio of the LSST optics makes this focal\nplane flatness variation and the resulting PSF discontinuities across the CCD\nboundaries significant challenges in our removal of the systematics. We resolve\nthis complication by performing PCA CCD-by-CCD, and interpolating the basis\nfunctions using conventional polynomials. We demonstrate that this PSF\ncorrection scheme reduces the residual PSF ellipticity correlation below 10^-7\nover the cosmologically interesting scale. From a null test using HST/UDF\ngalaxy images without input shear, we verify that the amplitude of the galaxy\nellipticity correlation function, after the PSF correction, is consistent with\nthe shot noise set by the finite number of objects. Therefore, we conclude that\nthe current optical design and specification for the accuracy in the focal\nplane assembly are sufficient to enable the control of the PSF systematics\nrequired for weak-lensing science with the LSST. \n\n"}

For\ngalactic black hole X-ray binaries XMM-Newton spectra during hard state also\nreveal the presence of a relativistic iron emission line and a thermal\ncomponent, interpreted as an indication for a weak inner cool accretion disk\nunderneath a hot corona. These thermal components were found after the\ntransition from soft to hard spectral state and can be understood as sustained\nby re-condensation of gas from an advection-dominated flow (ADAF) onto the\ndisk. In view of the similarity of accretion flows around stellar mass and\nsupermassive black holes we discuss whether the broad iron emission lines in\nSeyfert 1 AGN can be understood as arising from a similar accretion flow\ngeometry. We derive Eddington-scaled accretion rates for Seyfert galaxies with\nstrong lines in samples of Miller (2007) and Nandra et al. (2007). For the\nevaluation we use the observed X-ray luminosity, bolometric corrections and\nblack hole masses from literature, most values taken from Fabian and Vasudevan\n(2009).

For 10^7 to 10^8 solar mass black holes in Seyfert 1 AGN\nthis limit corresponds to 0.01 to 0.2 solar masses per year.

However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric\ngravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In\nthis paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse\nmodels leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of\ncollapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior\nrestrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show\nthat when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the\nenergy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus\noffering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of\nvarious possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy\nparticles from the vicinity of naked singularity. We then construct a model of\ngravitational collapse to a timelike naked singularity to demonstrate the\nworking of these ideas, where the pressure is allowed to be negative but the\nenergy conditions are respected. We show that a finite amount of mass-energy\ndensity has to be necessarily radiated away from the vicinity of the naked\nsingularity as the collapse evolves. Therefore the nature of naked\nsingularities, both at classical and quantum level could play an important role\nin the process of particle acceleration, explaining the occurrence of highly\nenergetic outgoing particles in the vicinity of Cauchy horizon that participate\nin extreme high energy collisions. \n\n"}

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars.

It is based on kinematics of particles moving near the horizon. This\neffect arises when particles of two kinds collide near the horizon. For massive\nparticles, the first kind represents a particle with the generic energy and\nangular momentum (I call them \"usual\"). Near the horizon, such a particle has a\nvelocity almost equal to that of light in the frame that corotates with a black\nhole (the frame is static if a black hole is static). The second kind (called\n\"critical\") consists of particles with the velocity v<c near the horizon due to\nspecial relationship between the energy and angular momentum (or charge). As a\nresult, the relative velocity approaches the speed of light c, the Lorentz\nfactor grows unbound. This explanation applies both to generic rotating black\nholes and charged ones (even for radial motion of particles). If one of\ncolliding particles is massless (photon), the critical particle is\ndistinguished by the fact that its frequency is finite near the horizon. The\nexistence (or absence) of the effect is determined depending on competition of\ntwo factors - gravitational blue shift for a photon propagating towards a black\nhole and the Doppler effect due to transformation from the locally nonrotating\nframe to a comoving one. Classification of all possible types of collisions is\nsuggested depending on whether massive or massless particle is critical or\nusual. \n\n"}

An initial prototype ARA detector system was installed in\nJanuary 2011, and has been operating continuously since then.

The multi-frequency emission is unpulsed\nand nonthermal, and is generally thought to be related to the relativistic\nelectrons accelerated from the interaction between the pulsar wind and the\nstellar wind, where X-ray emission is from the synchrotron process and the VHE\nemission is from the inverse Compton (IC) scattering process.

The main advantage of such approach is to avoid the\nnecessity of assuming an \\textit{ad hoc} parameterization of the SFH.

Subtracting a late-time spectrum\nof the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of SN2009nz and uncover broad\nfeatures typical of nearby GRB-SNe. This establishes unambiguously that\nGRB091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined Type Ic SN, and links a cosmological\nlong burst with a standard energy release (E_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to a\nmassive star progenitor. The spectrum of SN2009nz closely resembles that of\nSN2006aj, with SN2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but has\nsignificantly narrower features than SNe 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of a\nlower expansion velocity. The photospheric velocity inferred from the SiII 6355\nabsorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of SNe 2006aj\nand 2003dh than to the other GRB-SNe. Combining the measured velocity with the\nlight curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosion\nparameters: M_Ni ~ 0.35 M_sun, E_K ~ 2.3e51 erg, and M_ej ~ 1.4 M_sun, similar\nto those of SN2006aj. These properties indicate that SN2009nz follows a trend\nof lower M_Ni for GRB-SNe with lower E_K and M_ej. Equally important, since\nGRB091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of SN2009nz to\nSN2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that XRF060218/SN2006aj was powered by\na neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encoded\nin the SN properties but not in the prompt emission.

We evaluate the consequences of the lossy compression\nalgorithm of Bernstein et al. (2010) for the high-precision measurement of\nweak-lensing galaxy ellipticities. This square-root algorithm compresses each\npixel independently, and the information discarded is by construction less than\nthe Poisson error from photon shot noise. For simulated space-based images\n(without cosmic rays) digitized to the typical 16 bits per pixel, application\nof the lossy compression followed by image-wise lossless compression yields\nimages with only 2.4 bits per pixel, a factor of 6.7 compression.

The ellipticity measurement method is biased by the addition\nof noise, so the additional digitization noise is expected to induce a\nmultiplicative bias on the galaxies' measured ellipticities.

Nonspinning black holes Abstract: The late inspiral, merger, and ringdown of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS)\nsystem can provide information about the neutron-star equation of state (EOS).\nCandidate EOSs can be approximated by a parametrized piecewise-polytropic EOS\nabove nuclear density, matched to a fixed low-density EOS; and we report\nresults from a large set of BHNS inspiral simulations that systematically vary\ntwo parameters. To within the accuracy of the simulations, we find that, apart\nfrom the neutron-star mass, a single physical parameter Lambda, describing its\ndeformability, can be extracted from the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown\nwaveform. This parameter is related to the radius, mass, and l=2 Love number,\nk_2, of the neutron star by Lambda = 2k_2 R^5/3M_{NS}^5, and it is the same\nparameter that determines the departure from point-particle dynamics during the\nearly inspiral. Observations of gravitational waves from BHNS inspiral thus\nrestrict the EOS to a surface of constant Lambda in the parameter space,\nthickened by the measurement error. Using various configurations of a single\nAdvanced LIGO detector, we find that neutron stars are distinguishable from\nblack holes of the same mass and that Lambda^{1/5} or equivalently R can be\nextracted to 10-40% accuracy from single events for mass ratios of Q=2 and 3 at\na distance of 100 Mpc, while with the proposed Einstein Telescope, EOS\nparameters can be extracted to accuracy an order of magnitude better. \n\n"}

The blast wave is driven by\ninjecting high pressure in the simulation domain. The interstellar magnetic\nfield can be amplified by two different processes, occurring in different\nregions. One is facilitated by the fluid vorticity generated by the ``rippled\"\nshock front interacting with the background turbulence. The resulting turbulent\nflow keeps amplifying the magnetic field, consistent with earlier work\n\\citep{Giacalone2007}. The other process is facilitated by the growth of the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability at the contact discontinuity between the ejecta and\nthe shocked medium. This can efficiently amplify the magnetic field and tends\nto produce the highest magnetic field. We investigate the dependence of the\namplification on numerical parameters such as grid-cell size and on various\nphysical parameters.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40.

Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

Standard theories suggest that\ncollisions are rare, occurring only via random encounters between stars in\ndense clusters. We present a different formation pathway, the triple evolution\ndynamical instability (TEDI), in which mass loss in an evolving triple star\nsystem causes orbital instability. The subsequent chaotic orbital evolution of\nthe stars triggers close encounters, collisions, exchanges between the stellar\ncomponents, and the dynamical formation of eccentric compact binaries\n(including Sirius like binaries). We demonstrate that the rate of stellar\ncollisions due to the TEDI is approximately 10^{-4} yr^{-1} per Milky-Way\nGalaxy, which is nearly 30 times higher than the total collision rate due to\nrandom encounters in the Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, we find that the\ndominant type of stellar collisions is qualitatively different; most collisions\ninvolve asymptotic giant branch stars, rather than main sequence, or slightly\nevolved stars, which dominate collisions in globular clusters.

We present a cosmological simulation following the\ntransport of the metals synthesized in a Population III supernova assuming that\nit had an energy of 1e51 ergs, compatible with standard Type II supernovae. A\nyoung supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic HII region in the\nfree expansion phase and is followed for 40 Myr employing adaptive mesh\nrefinement and Lagrangian tracer particle techniques.

According to the standard\ncosmological model, the isotopic composition of the gas in such clouds was\nformed at the epoch of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and is determined only by the\nbaryon density in the Universe. The dispersion in the available cloud\ncomposition observations exceeds the errors of individual measurements. This\nmay indicate that there are mechanisms of the change in the composition of\nmatter in the Universe after the completion of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We\nhave calculated the destruction and production rates of light isotopes (D, 3He,\n4He) under the influence of photonuclear reactions triggered by the gamma-ray\nemission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We investigate the destruction and\nproduction of light elements depending on the spectral characteristics of the\ngamma-ray emission. We show that in comparison with previous works, taking into\naccount the influence of spectral hardness on the photonuclear reaction rates\ncan increase the characteristic radii of influence of the gamma-ray emission\nfrom AGNs by a factor of 2-8. The high gamma-ray luminosities of AGNs observed\nin recent years increase the previous estimates of the characteristic radii by\ntwo orders of magnitude.

The novelty in CLaSPS is the\ncriterion used for the selection of the optimal clusterings, based on a\nquantitative measure of the degree of correlation between the cluster\nmemberships and the distribution of a set of observables, the labels, not\nemployed for the clustering.

The physical\nrelationship between different components of diffuse gas emitting at multiple\nwavelengths is a focus of this work. We first present radio continuum\nobservations using Green Bank Telescope and model the nonthermal spectrum in\nterms of a broken power-law distribution of GeV electrons emitting synchrotron\nradiation.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM.

To detect the B-modes\ngenerated during inflation the Flux response and polarization angle of these\nexperiments must be calibrated to exquisite precision. While suitable flux\ncalibration sources abound, polarization angle calibrators are deficient in\nmany respects. Man-made polarized sources are often not located in the\nantenna's far-field, have spectral properties that are radically different from\nthe CMB's, are cumbersome to implement and may be inherently unstable over the\n(long) duration these searches require to detect the faint signature of the\ninflationary epoch.

On average, the neutron star is found to be radio emitting for 26 +- 6 %\nof the time. No evidence is obtained to suggest that the pulsar undergoes any\nsystematic, intrinsic variations in pulse intensity during the radio-emitting\nphases.

The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic field\nwhere the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in\nthe disc. The viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two \"alpha\"\nparameters, while the coronal region above the disc is treated using ideal MHD.\nThe initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three poloidal field loops\nthreading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the\nadvection of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At\nearly times the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open.\nThe twisting of the opened field lines leads to the formation of both an inner\ncollimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances from the axis a\nmatter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the\nmagnetic field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the\ndisc. For the early times, we have derived from the simulations both the matter\naccretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed of the magnetic field. We\nshow that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with the\npredictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one\ndue to the disc's viscosity (which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum\nin the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc's\nsurface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum).

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter\nassumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in\na manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets. Comparing the predicted\nX-ray fluxes with limits from hard X-ray surveys, we conclude that either the\nBondi-Hoyle efficiency parameter \\lambda, is rather small (< 0.01), the\nvelocities of the IBH are rather high, or some combination of both. The\npredicted radio flux densities correspond to a population of objects which,\nwhile below current survey limits, should be detectable with the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA). Converting the simulated space velocities into proper\nmotions, we further demonstrate that such IBH could be identified as faint high\nproper motion radio sources in SKA surveys. \n\n"}

According to this suggestion the SN progenitor\nsuffered a rapid expansion within months before explosion. The expansion was\ndriven by leakage of energy from the core where vigorous oxygen nuclear burning\ntakes place within a year prior to explosion. This expansion triggered mass\ntransfer onto the secondary star. Most of the extra energy of the outburst\ncomes from the accretion of ~0.1Mo onto the secondary star. As well, the gas\noutflowing at v~2000 km/s was launched from the accreting secondary star, most\nlikely in a bipolar outflow.

The radio emission at high spatial\nresolution appears structured in a precessing jet with a precessional period of\n27-28 d. Aims: How close is the precessional period of the radio jet to the\norbital period? Any periodicity in the radio emission should be revealed by\ntiming analysis.

New observations of\nM87 enable us to put forward a comprehensive model for the physical heating\nmechanism. Low-frequency radio observations by LOFAR revealed the absence of\nfossil cosmic-ray (CR) electrons in the radio halo surrounding M87. This puzzle\ncan be resolved by accounting for the CR release from the radio cocoons and the\nsubsequent mixing of CRs with the dense ambient intracluster gas, which\nthermalizes the electrons on a timescale similar to the radio halo age of 40\nMyr. Hadronic interactions of similarly injected CR protons with the ambient\ngas should produce an observable gamma-ray signal in accordance with the steady\nemission of the low state of M87 detected by Fermi and H.E.S.S. Hence, we\nnormalize the CR population to the gamma-ray emission, which shows the same\nspectral slope as the CR injection spectrum probed by LOFAR, thereby supporting\na common origin. We show that CRs, which stream at the Alfven velocity with\nrespect to the plasma rest frame, heat the surrounding thermal plasma at a rate\nthat balances that of radiative cooling on average at each radius. However, the\nresulting global thermal equilibrium is locally unstable and allows for the\nformation of the observed cooling multi-phase medium through thermal\ninstability.

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey.

We include the nuclear energy input from the freshly synthesized,\nradioactively decaying nuclei in our simulations and study its effects on the\nremnant dynamics. Although the nuclear heating substantially alters the\nlongterm evolution, we find that running nuclear networks over purely\nhydrodynamic simulations (i.e. without heating) yields actually acceptable\nnucleosynthesis results.

This leads to an\nunexpected richness of possible theoretical models able to describe such\nphenomenology. Hints of emission at tens of GeV are indeed known since the\nEGRET observations during the '90s and confirmed in the Fermi-LAT data.\nHowever, our comprehension of these phenomena is still far to be satisfactory.\nIn this respect, the VHE characterization of GRBs may constitute a breakthrough\nfor understanding their physics and, possibly, for providing decisive clues for\nthe discrimination among different proposed emission mechanisms, which are\nbarely distinguishable at lower energies. The current generation of Cherenkov\nobservatories, such as the MAGIC telescopes, have opened the possibility to\nextend the measurement of GRB emission, and in general to any short time-scale\ntransient phenomena, fromfew tens of GeV up to the TeV energy range, with a\nhigher sensitivity with respect to gamma-ray space-based instruments.

Our previous\nsimulations have demonstrated that the primary features of the Fermi bubbles\ncould be successfully reproduced by recent jet activity from the central active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). In this work, we generate gamma-ray and microwave maps\nand spectra based on the simulated properties of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic\nfields in order to examine whether the observed bubble and haze emission could\nbe explained by leptons contained in the AGN jets. We also investigate the\nmodel predictions of the polarization properties of the Fermi bubbles. We find\nthat: (1) The same population of leptons can simultaneously explain the bubble\nand haze emission given that the magnetic fields within the bubbles are very\nclose to the exponentially distributed ambient field, which can be explained by\nmixing in of the ambient field followed by turbulent field amplification; (2)\nThe centrally peaked microwave profile suggests CR replenishment, which is\nconsistent with the presence of a more recent second jet event; (3) The bubble\ninterior exhibits a high degree of polarization because of ordered radial\nmagnetic field lines stretched by elongated vortices behind the shocks;\nhighly-polarized signals could also be observed inside the draping layer; (4)\nEnhancement of rotation measures could exist within the shock-compressed layer\nbecause of increased gas density and more amplified and ordered magnetic\nfields.

The\ncause of this low radio detection rate has previously been attributed to\nlimited observing sensitivity. We use visibility stacking to test this idea,\nand conclude that the low detection rate is instead due to two intrinsically\ndifferent populations of GRBs, radio bright and radio faint.

These radio bright\nGRBs have higher gamma-ray fluence, isotropic energies, X-ray fluxes and\noptical fluxes than the radio faint GRBs, confirming the existence of two\nphysically distinct populations.

The Chandra data reveal\na long (>40 kpc) and narrow tail with a nearly constant width (~3 kpc) to the\nsoutheast of the galaxy, and a leading edge ~1.5 kpc from the galaxy center on\nthe upstream side of the tail. The tail is most likely caused by the nearly\nedge-on stripping of ESO 137-002's ISM by ram pressure, compared to the nearly\nface-on stripping of ESO 137-001 discussed in our previous work. Spectral\nanalysis of individual regions along the tail shows that the gas throughout it\nhas a rather constant temperature, ~1 keV, very close to the temperature of the\ntails of ESO 137-001, if the same atomic database is used. The derived gas\nabundance is low (~0.2 solar with the single-kT model), an indication of the\nmultiphase nature of the gas in the tail. The mass of the X-ray tail is only a\nsmall fraction (<5%) of the initial ISM mass of the galaxy, suggesting that the\nstripping is most likely at an early stage. However, with any of the single-kT,\ndouble-kT and multi-kT models we tried, the tail is always \"over-pressured\"\nrelative to the surrounding ICM, which could be due to the uncertainties in the\nabundance, thermal vs. non-thermal X-ray emission, or magnetic support in the\nICM. The H-alpha data from SOAR show a ~21 kpc tail spatially coincident with\nthe X-ray tail, as well as a secondary tail (~12 kpc long) to the east of the\nmain tail diverging at an angle of ~23 degrees and starting at a distance of\n~7.5 kpc from the nucleus.

The long Suzaku observation shows two types\nof clear absorption dips, both of which recur on a dip interval of 9.74 +- 0.04\nhours, which we identify with the orbital period. There is also partially\nionized absorption in the non-dip (persistent) emission in both the high/soft\nstate and, very unusually, the low/hard state. However, this absorption (in\nboth states) has substantially lower ionization than that seen in other high\ninclination systems, where the material forms a homogeneous disk wind. Here\ninstead the absorption is most probably associated with clumpy, compact\nstructures associated with the dipping material, which we see uniquely in this\nsource likely because we view it at a very large inclination angle. A large\ninclination angle is also favored, together with a low black hole mass, to\nexplain the high disk temperature seen in the fairly low luminosity high/soft\nstate, as Doppler boosting enhances the disk temperature at high inclination.\nThe disk radius inferred from these data is significantly smaller than that of\nthe soft component seen in the low/hard state, supporting models where the disk\nis truncated at low luminosities.

In this work, we report\non a detailed analysis of the XMM- Newton data and focus in particular on the\ntiming and spectral variability of the source. IGR J18245-2452 continuously\nswitches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in\nflux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These\nvariations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic\nspectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source\nchanges from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different\ncount rates and energies show a complex variability.

These foregrounds come from a variety of sources (such as\nGalactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic point sources), but almost all\nshare the property of being spectrally smooth, and when viewed through the\nchromatic response of an interferometer, occupy a signature \"wedge\" region in\ncylindrical $k_\\perp k_\\parallel$ Fourier space. The complement of the\nforeground wedge is termed the \"EoR window\", and is expected to be mostly\nforeground-free, allowing clean measurements of the power spectrum. This paper\nis a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical\nframework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we use\nour framework to explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be\nenlarged, thereby increasing the sensitivity of a power spectrum measurement.\nWe adapt the FKP approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm\ncosmology, and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to simpler\nestimators that ignore covariances between different Fourier modes. The optimal\nquadratic estimator is found to suppress foregrounds by an extra factor of\n$\\sim 10^5$ in power at the peripheries of the EoR window, boosting the\ndetection of the cosmological signal from $12\\sigma$ to $50\\sigma$ at the\nmidpoint of reionization in our fiducial models.

As charged particles in\nextensive air showers are deflected by the magnetic field of the Earth, a\ndeformation of the angular distribution of the Cherenkov light, that would be\napproximately symmetric about the shower axis if no magnetic field were\npresent, is expected. In this work we study the variation of the Cherenkov\nlight distribution as a function of the azimuth angle in the plane\nperpendicular to shower axis. It is found that the asymmetry induced by the\ngeomagnetic field is most significant for early stages of shower evolution and\nfor showers arriving almost perpendicular to the vector of the local\ngeomagnetic field.

The array consists of 5 telescopes in a square layout with one central\ntelescope, known as the Pevatron eXplorer or PeX. PeX is a PeV (10^{15} eV)\ncosmic ray explorer that aims to study and discover gamma-ray sources in the 1\nto 500 TeV range. The initial PeX design has been influenced by the HEGRA\nCT-System and H.E.S.S. configurations. One important feature of multi-TeV air\nshowers is their ability to trigger telescopes at large core distance (>400m).\nPeX will utilise large core distance events to improve the performance and\nillustrate the viability of a sparse array for multi-TeV gamma-ray astronomy.\n  One important aspect of the thesis (Chapter 6) was the investigation of a new\ntime-based image cleaning method. The arrival time between photons in two\nadjacent pixels in the camera is used to apply an extra cut which helps\nmitigate night sky background. To illustrate the robustness of the time\ncleaning cut, various level of night sky background have been considered. These\nlevels include: off-Galactic plane, on-Galactic plane and towards the Galactic\ncentre. The most important result is that PeX performance with a time cleaning\ncut improves results when a high level of night sky background is present. For\na Galactic centre level of night sky background there is a factor of 1.5\nimprovement in angular resolution, effective area and quality factor when a\ntime cleaning cut is applied compared to using no time cleaning cut. \n\n"}

In particular, we develop\nfurther the angular distribution analysis and discuss the perspectives for\ndiagnostics. By performing various statistical tests (maximum likelihood,\nKolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests) we conclude that currently the\ndata show a mild preference (below the two sigma level) for the angular\ndistribution expected from dark matter decay vs. the isotropic distribution\nforeseen for a conventional astrophysical flux of extragalactic origin.

By utilizing the method in Kino et al., we derive the energy\ndensities of magnetic fields ($U_{B}$) and electrons and positrons ($U_{\\pm}$)\nin the compact region detected by EHT (EHT-region) with its\nfull-width-half-maximum size $40~{\\rm \\mu as}$. First, we assume that an\noptically-thick region for synchrotron self absorption (SSA) exists in the\nEHT-region.

However, great progress in this area has been\nmade in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of\nground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.\nIn particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic\nrays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding\nof the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way\ndepends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in\ncomposition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy\nare considered. In this work we develop an analytical method to study these\neffects.

I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a\nthick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a\nsimilar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if\nstar spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be\nregarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary\natmospheres. In this work, including our prior knowledge of H-C-N-O chemistry\nenables me to constrain the C/O ratio without detecting a single carbon-bearing\nmolecule. \n\n"}

From these considerations it follows that one is unable to prove,\nespecially model-independently,a discovery of a DM particle with an\naccelerator, or collider. One can only obtain evidence on existence of a weakly\ninteracting neutral particle, which could be, or could not be the DM candidate.\nThe current LHC DM search program uses only the missing transverse energy\nsignature. Non-observation of any excess above Standard Model expectations\nforces the LHC experiments to enter into the same fighting for the best\nexclusion curve, in which (almost) all direct and indirect DM search\nexperiments permanently take place.

One of the main uncertainties\nconcerns the process that terminates the growth of the instability.

We perform two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional sheering-disc simulations of a differentially rotating\nprotoneutron star layer in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics with unprecedented\nhigh numerical accuracy, finding that Kelvin-Helmholtz parasitic modes dominate\ntearing modes in the regime of large hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers, as encountered close to the surface of protoneutron stars.

They\nrepresent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are\ndetectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on\nthe equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of\nthe postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant\ncan be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be\ndescribed by concepts of asteroseismology.

It is\nthe only IACT system featuring telescopes of different sizes, which provides\nsensitivity for gamma rays across a very wide energy range, from ~30 GeV up to\n~100 TeV. Since the camera electronics of CT1-4 are much older than the one of\nCT5, an upgrade is being carried out; first deployment was in 2015, full\noperation is planned for 2016. The goals of this upgrade are threefold:\nreducing the dead time of the cameras, improving the overall performance of the\narray and reducing the system failure rate related to aging. Upon completion,\nthe upgrade will assure the continuous operation of H.E.S.S. at its full\nsensitivity until and possibly beyond the advent of CTA. In the design of the\nnew components, several CTA concepts and technologies were used and are thus\nbeing evaluated in the field: The upgraded read-out electronics is based on the\nNECTAR readout chips; the new camera front- and back-end control subsystems are\nbased on an FPGA and an embedded ARM computer; the communication between\nsubsystems is based on standard Ethernet technologies. These hardware solutions\noffer good performance, robustness and flexibility. The design of the new\ncameras is reported here. \n\n"}

To better understand this\nphenomenon, we take a first step to building a sample of changing-look quasars\nwith a systematic but simple archival search for these objects in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 12.

The available data consists of the time averaged spin-down rate,\nwhich displays a distinctive double-peaked modulation, and measurements of the\nbeam-width. Two concepts exist in the literature that are capable of explaining\nthese variations; we formulate predictive models from these and quantitatively\ncompare them. The first concept is phenomenological and stipulates that the\nmagnetosphere undergoes periodic switching between two meta-stable states as\nfirst suggested by Lyne et al. The second concept, precession, was first\nconsidered as a candidate for the modulation of B1828-11 by Stairs et al.. We\nquantitatively compare models built from these concepts using a Bayesian\nodds-ratio. Because the phenomenological switching model itself was informed by\nthis data in the first place, it is difficult to specify appropriate\nparameter-space priors that can be trusted for an unbiased model comparison.\nTherefore we first perform a parameter estimation using the spin-down data, and\nthen use the resulting posterior distributions as priors for model comparison\non the beam-width data.

We study the internal dynamics of neutrino-driven convection\nand its role in re-distributing energy and momentum through the gain region. We\nfind that even if buoyant plumes are able to locally transfer heat up to the\nshock, convection is not able to create a net positive energy flux and overcome\nthe downwards transport of energy from the accretion flow. Turbulent convection\ndoes, however, provide a significant effective pressure support to the\naccretion flow as it favors the accumulation of energy, mass and momentum in\nthe gain region.

Importantly, classical mode interference and speckle issues\nassociated with multi-mode fibers, also known as 'modal noise', are mitigated\nwhen using SMFs, which also provide perfect radial and azimuthal image\nscrambling. However, these fibers do support multiple polarization modes, an\nissue that is generally ignored for larger-core fibers given the large number\nof propagation modes. Since diffraction gratings used in most high resolution\nastronomical instruments have dispersive properties that are sensitive to\nincident polarization changes, any birefringence variations in the fiber can\ncause variations in the efficiency profile, degrading illumination stability.\nHere we present a cautionary note outlining how the polarization properties of\nSMFs can affect the radial velocity measurement precision of high resolution\nspectrographs.

The second adds\nconfigurations 2s$^2$ 2p 5l, for l=0-2, which give rise to 590 CI/CC levels in\ntotal. Comparison of oscillator strengths and effective collision strengths\nfrom these two calculations demonstrates the lack of convergence in data for\nn=4 from the smaller one. Comparison of results for the 564 CI/CC level\ncalculation with an earlier ICFT R-matrix calculation which used the exact same\nCI expansion but truncated the CC expansion to only 200 levels demonstrates the\nlack of convergence of the earlier data, particularly for n=3 levels.

Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data\nset on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 AU of their star.\nHowever, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and\ndetection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational\nbiases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By\nassuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability, we infer the\nexpected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a\nmarginalized form.

The precession frequency diverges on the\nergoregion, a behavior intimately related to and governed by the geometry of\nthe ergoregion, analogous to the situation in a Kerr spacetime. Interestingly,\nit turns out that here the LT precession is inversely proportional to the\nangular momentum ($a$) of the wormhole along the pole and around it in the\nstrong gravity regime, a behavior contrasting with its direct variation with\n$a$ in the case of other compact objects. In fact, divergence of LT precession\ninside the ergoregion can also be avoided if the gyro moves with a non-zero\nangular velocity in a certain range. As a result, the spin precession frequency\nof the gyro can be made finite throughout its whole path, even very close to\nthe throat, during its travel to the wormhole.

We analyze the effects of flattening on the\nannihilation (J) and decay (D) factors of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with both\nanalytic and numerical methods. Flattening has two consequences: first, there\nis a geometric effect as the squeezing (or stretching) of the dark matter\ndistribution enhances (or diminishes) the J-factor; second, the line of sight\nvelocity dispersion of stars must hold up the flattened baryonic component in\nthe flattened dark matter halo. We provide analytic formulae and a simple\nnumerical approach to estimate the correction to the J- and D-factors required\nover simple spherical modeling. The formulae are validated with a series of\nequilibrium models of flattened stellar distributions embedded in flattened\ndark-matter distributions. We compute corrections to the J- and D-factors for\nthe Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the assumption that they are all\nprolate or all oblate and find that the hierarchy of J-factors for the dwarf\nspheroidals is slightly altered (typical correction factors for an ellipticity\nof $0.4$ are $0.75$ for the oblate case and $1.6$ for the prolate case). We\ndemonstrate that spherical estimates of the D-factors are very insensitive to\nthe flattening and introduce uncertainties significantly less than the\nuncertainties in the D-factors from the other observables for all the dwarf\nspheroidals (for example, ${}^{+10\\mathrm{\\,percent}}_{-3\\mathrm{\\,percent}}$\nfor a typical ellipticity of $0.4$).

Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including\nthe Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled\nwith the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their\nobservation. Extragalactic systems contain multiple stellar populations with\ncomplex star formation histories. However, their study is mainly based upon the\nprinciples of simple stellar populations (SSP). Hence, it is critical to\nexamine the validity of SSP models. AIMS. This work aims to empirically test\nthe validity of SSP models. This is done by comparing SSP models against\nobservations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the\ndetermination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.\nIntegral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC\n3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and\nunresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed\nusing the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of\nstrong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties\nfrom the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is\nanalysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity\ndetermination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population,\nthe derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those\nderived from resolved stars. RESULTS. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC\n3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range\nof those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including\nother estimates found in the literature.

Assuming that\n$\\gamma$-ray emitting HBL form the bulk of the sources of high-energy neutrinos\nabove 100 TeV, we intend to calculate the number of events expected to be\ndetected for each source by IceCube and KM3NeT.

Rays in the escape window\nhave $\\omega_{0} < \\omega \\leq \\omega_{+}$ and are free to propagate to\ninfinity from the CO surface.

In this\nmodel, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star explodes following detonation of a\nsurface layer of helium. One potential signature of this explosion mechanism is\nthe presence of unburned helium in the outer ejecta, left over from the surface\nhelium layer. In this paper we present simple approximations to estimate the\noptical depths of important He I lines in the ejecta of double-detonation\nmodels. We use these approximations to compute synthetic spectra, including the\nHe I lines, for double-detonation models obtained from hydrodynamical explosion\nsimulations. Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the\nnear-infrared 10830 \\AA~and 2 $\\mu$m lines of He I. We first consider a double\ndetonation model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This\nmodel has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0.03 $M_{\\odot}$ and our\ncalculations suggest that the 2 $\\mu$m feature is expected to be very weak but\nthat the 10830 \\AA~feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta.\nConsequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nexpected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum\nlight. However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model\n($\\sim 19,000$~km~s$^{-1}$) mean that the He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nconfused or blended with the C I 10690~\\AA~line forming at lower velocities.

The high density of hits on a given particle track facilitates the task\nof pattern recognition in a high-occupancy environment and in addition provides\nparticle identification by measuring the specific energy loss for each track.\nFor these reasons, TPCs with Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC)\namplification have been and are widely used in experiments recording heavy-ion\ncollisions. A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the\norder of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is\nmandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting\nback into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of\nsubsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a\nconventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be\napplied without a significant loss of data. A continuous readout of the signals\nis the more appropriate way of operation. This, however, constitutes a change\nof paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification\nregion, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data\nhandling. A mandatory prerequisite for such an operation is a sufficiently good\nsuppression of the ion backflow from the avalanche region, which otherwise\nlimits the tracking and particle identification capabilities of such a\ndetector. Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) are a promising candidate to combine\nexcellent spatial resolution with an intrinsic suppression of ions. In this\npaper we describe the design, construction and the commissioning of a large TPC\nwith GEM amplification and without gating grid (GEM-TPC). \n\n"}

One problem that plagues the use of this tool in the era of\nlarge-scale sky surveys is that the bright galaxies that are selected for\nspectroscopic observation do not have properties that match those of (far more\nnumerous) dimmer galaxies; thus, ill-designed empirical methods that produce\naccurate and precise redshift estimates for the former generally will not\nproduce good estimates for the latter. In this paper, we provide a principled\nframework for generating conditional density estimates (i.e. photometric\nredshift PDFs) that takes into account selection bias and the covariate shift\nthat this bias induces. We base our approach on the assumption that the\nprobability that astronomers label a galaxy (i.e. determine its spectroscopic\nredshift) depends only on its measured (photometric and perhaps other)\nproperties x and not on its true redshift. With this assumption, we can\nexplicitly write down risk functions that allow us to both tune and compare\nmethods for estimating importance weights (i.e. the ratio of densities of\nunlabeled and labeled galaxies for different values of x) and conditional\ndensities.

The resulting radiation could potentially be detected\nby the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European\nExtremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from\nneutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic\ncenter, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark\nmatter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or\nspin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding $2 \\times 10^{-45}$\ncm$^2$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure.

Over millions of years, the binary evolves to a\nperiod minimum before reversing course and migrating outwards. Because the time\ninterval between consecutive EMRIs is comparable to the mass-transfer\ntimescale, the semi-major axes of two consecutive mass-transferring EMRIs will\ncross on a radial scale < few AU. We show that such EMRI crossing events are\ninevitably accompanied by a series of mildly relativistic, grazing physical\ncollisions between the stars. Each collision strips a small quantity of mass,\nprimarily from the more massive star, which generally increases their radial\nseparation to set up the next collision after a delay of decades to centuries\n(or longer) set by further gravitational radiation. Depending on the mass of\nthe SMBH, this interaction can result in N ~ 1-1e4 gas production events of\nmass Msun/N, thus powering a quasi-periodic sequence of SMBH accretion-powered\nflares over a total duration of thousands of years or longer. Although the EMRI\nrate is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of tidal disruption events\n(TDE), the ability of a single interacting EMRI pair to produce a large number\nof luminous flares - and to make more judicious use of the available stellar\nfuel - could make their observed rate competitive with the TDE rate, enabling\nthem to masquerade as \"TDE Imposters.\" We predict flares with luminosities that\ndecay both as power laws shallower than t^(-5/3) or as decaying exponentials.\nViscous spreading of the gas disks produced by the accumulation of previous\nmass-stripping events places substantial mass on radial scales > 10-100 AU,\nproviding a reprocessing source required to explain the unexpectedly high\noptical luminosities of some flares. \n\n"}

The specific\naccretion-rate distribution is defined as the probability of a galaxy with a\ngiven stellar mass and redshift hosting an active nucleus with a certain\nspecific accretion rate. We find that the probability of a galaxy hosting an\nAGN increases with decreasing specific accretion rate. There is evidence that\nthis trend reverses at low specific accretion rates, $\\lambda<10^{-4}-10^{-3}$\n(in Eddington units). There is also a break close to the Eddington limit, above\nwhich the probability of an accretion event decreases steeply. The specific\naccretion-rate distribution evolves such that the fraction of AGN among\ngalaxies drops toward lower redshifts. This decrease in the AGN duty cycle is\nresponsible for the strong evolution of the accretion density of the Universe\nfrom redshift $z\\approx1-1.5$ to the present day. Our analysis also suggests\nthat this evolution is accompanied by a decoupling of accretion events onto\nblack holes from the formation of stars in galaxies.

The challenging requirement is that the resonance has twice the\ndark matter mass to one part in a million. We achieve this by introducing an\n$SU(3)_f$ dark flavor symmetry that is spontaneously broken to $SU(2)_f \\times\nU(1)_f$. The resonance is the heaviest state in the dark matter flavor\nmultiplet and the required mass relation is protected by the vacuum structure\nand supersymmetry from radiative corrections. The pseudo-Nambu Goldstone Bosons\n(PNGB's) from the dark flavor symmetry breaking can be slightly lighter than\none GeV and dominantly decay into two muons just from kinematics, with\nsubsequent decay into positrons.

Abstract: Radio mode feedback, associated with the propagation of powerful outflows in\nactive galaxies, is a crucial ingredient in galaxy evolution. Extragalactic\njets are well collimated and relativistic, both in terms of thermodynamics and\nkinematics. They generate strong shocks in the ambient medium, associated with\nobserved hotspots, and carve cavities that are filled with the shocked jet\nflow. In this Letter, we compare the pressure evolution in the hotspot and the\ncavity generated by relativistic and classical jets. Our results show that the\nclassical approach underestimates the cavity pressure by a factor larger or\nequal to 2 for a given shocked volume during the whole active phase. The\ntension between both approaches can only be alleviated by unrealistic jet flow\ndensities or gigantic jet areas in the classical case. As a consequence, the\nefficiency of a relativistic jet heating the ambient is typically around 20%\nlarger compared with a classical jet, and the heated volume is 2 to 10 times\nlarger during the time evolution. This conflict translates into two\nsubstantially disparate manners, both spatially and temporal, of heating the\nambient medium. These differences are expected to have relevant implications on\nthe star formation rates of the host galaxies and their evolution. \n\n"}

The viscous effect plays key roles for the remnant\nevolution and mass ejection from it in two phases of the evolution. In the\nfirst $t\\lesssim10$ ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to\na rigidly rotating state, and as a result, a sound wave, which subsequently\nbecomes a shock wave, is formed in the vicinity of the MNS due to the variation\nof the quasi-equilibrium state of the MNS.

Here we use our new population-synthesis code MOBSE,\nan upgraded version of BSE (Hurley et al. 2002), to investigate the demography\nof merging BHBs. MOBSE includes metallicity-dependent prescriptions for mass\nloss of massive hot stars. It also accounts for the impact of the\nelectron-scattering Eddington factor on mass loss. We perform >10^8 simulations\nof isolated massive binaries, with 12 different metallicities, to study the\nimpact of mass loss, core-collapse supernovae and common envelope on merging\nBHBs. Accounting for the dependence of stellar winds on the Eddington factor\nleads to the formation of black holes (BHs) with mass up to 65 Msun at\nmetallicity Z~0.0002. However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses <40 Msun.\nWe find merging BHBs with mass ratios in the 0.1 - 1.0 range, even if mass\nratios >0.6 are more likely.

We assess the stability of mass transfer from a carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarf onto compact objects of various masses, and conclude that for mass\ntransfer to proceed stably the accretor must, in fact, be a black hole. Such\nsystems can form dynamically by the collision of a stellar-mass black hole with\na giant star. Tidal dissipation of energy in the giant's envelope leads to a\nbound binary with a pericentre separation less than the radius of the giant. An\nepisode of common-envelope evolution follows, which ejects the giant's\nenvelope. We find that the most likely target is a horizontal-branch star, and\nthat a realistic quantity of subsequent dynamical hardening is required for the\nresulting binary to merge via gravitational wave emission. Observing one binary\nlike 47 Tuc X9 in the Milky Way globular cluster system is consistent with the\nexpected formation rate. The observed 6.8-day periodicity in the X-ray emission\nmay be driven by eccentricity induced in the UCXB's orbit by a perturbing\ncompanion. \n\n"}

Black holes seem like mystical objects, but they are\nan integral part of current astrophysics and are at the center of attempts to\nunify quantum physics and general relativity. Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast\nto earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due\nto a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of\nthe event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is\nattempting to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved\nby adding more telescopes to the array, in particular at high sites in Africa.\nUltimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event Horizon Imager, could\nproduce much more detailed images of black holes. In combination with numerical\nsimulations and precise measurements of the orbits of stars - ideally also of\npulsars - these images will allow us to study black holes with unprecedented\nprecision. \n\n"}

Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of\nproducing simulated images that are comparable to those obtained from local\nsurveys.

Instead of a ~100-day plateau as\nobserved for ordinary type II-P supernovae, the light curve of iPTF14hls has at\nleast five distinct peaks, followed by a steep decline at ~1000 days since\ndiscovery. Until 500 days since discovery, the effective temperature of\niPTF14hls is roughly constant at 5000-6000K . In this paper we propose that\niPTF14hls is likely powered by intermittent fallback accretion. It is found\nthat the light curve of iPTF14hls can be well fit by the usual t^{-5/3}\naccretion law until ~1000 days post discovery when the light curve transitions\nto a steep decline. To account for this steep decline, we suggest a power-law\ndensity profile for the late accreted material, rather than the constant\nprofile as appropriated for the t^{-5/3} accretion law. Detailed modeling\nindicates that the total fallback mass is ~0.2M_{sun}, with an ejecta mass\nM_{ej}~21M_{sun}.

Towards this, we study the hysteresis behavior in\nthe hardness intensity diagram (HID) based on the broadband ($3 - 150$ keV)\nspectral modeling, spectral signature of jet ejection and the evolution of\nQuasi-periodic Oscillation (QPO) frequencies using the two-component advective\nflow model around a black hole.

Abstract: We explore the ability of gravitational-wave detectors to extract the\nredshift distribution of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. The evolution of the\nmerger rate across redshifts $0 < z \\lesssim 1$ is directly tied to the\nformation and evolutionary processes, providing insight regarding the\nprogenitor formation rate together with the distribution of time delays between\nformation and merger. Because the limiting distance to which BBHs are detected\ndepends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected\nbinaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider\nthe mass and redshift distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate\ndensity, ${dN}/{dm_1\\,dm_2\\,dz}$. Our constraints on the mass distribution\nagree with previously published results, including evidence for an upper mass\ncutoff at $\\sim 40 \\ M_\\odot$. Additionally, we show that the current set of\nsix BBH detections are consistent with a merger rate density that is uniform in\ncomoving volume. Although our constraints on the redshift distribution are not\nyet tight enough to distinguish between BBH formation channels, we show that it\nwill be possible to distinguish between different astrophysically motivated\nmodels of the merger rate evolution with $\\sim 100$--$300$ LIGO-Virgo\ndetections (to be expected within 2--5 years). Specifically, we will be able to\ninfer whether the formation rate peaks at higher or lower redshifts than the\nstar formation rate, or the typical time delay between formation and merger.\nMeanwhile, with $\\sim 100$ detections, the inferred redshift distribution will\nplace constraints on more exotic scenarios such as modified gravity. \n\n"}

The pair outflow drives solitary waves in\nthe ambient protons. Their bipolar electric fields attract electrons of the\noutflowing pair cloud and repel positrons. These fields can reflect some of the\nprotons thereby accelerating them to almost an MeV.

K lines and edges from such elements are\nobserved in the X-ray spectra of supernova remnants, galaxy clusters and\naccreting black holes and neutron stars, their diagnostic potential being\nlimited by poor atomic data. We are completing the previously reported\nradiative datasets with new photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections\nfor isoelectronic sequences with electron number $19\\leq N\\leq 26$. We are also\ngiving attention to the access, integrity and usability of the whole resulting\natomic database. Target representations are obtained with the atomic structure\ncode AUTOSTRUCTURE. Where possible, cross sections for ground-configuration\nstates are computed with the Breit--Pauli $R$-matrix method (BPRM) in either\nintermediate or $LS$ coupling including damping (radiative and Auger) effects;\notherwise and more generally, they are generated in the isolated-resonance\napproximation with AUTOSTRUCTURE. Cross sections were computed with BPRM only\nfor the K ($N=19$) and Ca ($N=20$) isoelectronic sequences, the latter in $LS$\ncoupling. For the rest of the sequences ($21\\leq N \\leq 26$), AUTOSTRUCTURE was\nrun in $LS$-coupling mode taking into account damping effects. Comparisons\nbetween these two methods for K-like Zn XII and Ca-like Zn XI show that, to\nensure reasonable accuracy, the $LS$ calculations must be performed taking into\naccount the non-fine-structure relativistic corrections. \n\n"}

We also show that the sole astrometric and photometric informations\ncoming from the Gaia satellite yield sufficient insights for supervised\nlearning methods to automatically identify GL candidates with an efficiency\nthat is comparable to methods based on image processing. Methods: We simulated\n106,623,188 lens systems composed of more than two images, based on a regular\ngrid of parameters characterizing a non-singular isothermal ellipsoid lens\nmodel in the presence of an external shear. These simulations are used as an\ninput for training and testing our supervised learning models consisting of\nExtremely Randomized Trees.

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam\nfrom the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities. The\ncomputational costs for both these beamformation techniques as well as their\nsuitability for studies of pulsars and FRBs are discussed. Techniques discussed\nhere would be of interest for all upcoming surveys with interferometric arrays.\nFinally, we describe a time-domain survey with the GMRT using the\npost-correlation beamformation as a case study.

However, we are now in a regime where the sensitivity to\nsingle pulses in radio surveys is often limited more by the strong background\nof radio frequency interference (RFI, which can greatly increase the\nfalse-positive rate) than by the sensitivity of the telescope itself.

The radio spectral index\nderived from VLA/ATCA observations is broadly consistent with that expected\nfrom a millisecond pulsar, further disfavoring an accretion disk scenario.\nX-ray observations show evidence for a double-peaked orbital light curve,\nsimilar to that observed in some redback millisecond pulsar binaries and likely\ndue to an intrabinary shock.

The soft absorber is less ionized\n($\\log\\xi=3$) compared to the iron K outflow ($\\log\\xi=5$) and is outflowing\nwith a velocity of approximately $-0.2c$. A soft X-ray excess is present below\n1 keV against the highly absorbed continuum and can be attributed to the\nre-emission from a wide angle wind.

However, recent works have suggested the existence of an intermediate\npopulation in the bursts observed by the Swift satellite. Moreover, some\nresearchers have questioned the universality of the 2.0-second dividing line\nbetween short and long bursts: some bursts may be short but actually result\nfrom collapsars, the physical mechanism behind normally long bursts, and some\nlong ones may originate from mergers, the usual progenitors of short GRBs. In\nthis work, we focus on GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite and study the\ndistribution of their durations measured in the observer's reference frame and,\nfor those with known redshifts, in the bursts' reference frames. However, there\nare relatively few bursts with measured redshifts, and this makes an accurate\nstudy difficult. To overcome this problem, we follow [Zhang:2018] and determine\na \"pseudo-redshift\" from the correlation relation between the luminosity $L_p$\nand the energy $E_p$, both of which are calculated at the peak of the flux.\nInterestingly, we find that the uncertainties in the quantities observed and\nused in the determination of pseudo-redshifts, do affect the precision of the\nindividual results significantly, but they keep the distribution of\npseudo-redshifts very similar to that of the actual ones and thus allow us to\nuse pseudo-redshifts for our statistical study. We use the reduced chi-square\nand the maximization of the log-likelihood to statistically analyze the\ndistribution of Fermi GRB durations. Both methods show that the distribution of\nthe observed and the intrinsic bursts durations are better represented by two\ngroups, rather than three. \n\n"}

{"id": "1810.07270", "contents": "Title: Explanation of Detailed Spectral Properties of FRBs by Axion Star Model Abstract: We have proposed a generation mechanism of non repeating ( repeating ) fast\nradio bursts: They arise by axion star collisions with neutron stars (\naccretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion star as coherent state of\naxions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with\nfrequency $m_a/2\\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons\ncoherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The\nradiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb\nthe coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the\ntime scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra\nof the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally\nbroaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\\delta\\nu$ are proportional\nto their center frequencies $\\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies\n( $1.2$GHz$\\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler\nshifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On\nthe other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center\nfrequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift\nalso makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter.\nBecause the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger\nthan those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating\nFRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields\nof the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs,\nwhich are over the extent of the receiver frequency range.

With this knowledge, we\nintroduce a data processing pipeline that is able to isolate and correct these\nsystematic effects. The pipeline will be used to calibrate calibrator\nobservations as the first step of a full data reduction process.\n  Methods: We processed two LOFAR observations of the calibrator 3C196: the\nfirst using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system at 42-66 MHz and the second using\nthe High Band Antenna (HBA) system at 115-189 MHz.\n  Results: We were able to isolate and correct for the effects of clock drift,\npolarisation misalignment, ionospheric delay, Faraday rotation, ionospheric\nscintillation, beam shape, and bandpass.

During the GRB\nprompt phase, some dissipation processes may happen and disturb the magnetic\nfield, making the field become random to some extent. Therefore, a mixed\nmagnetic field consisting of an ordered component and a random component is\nplausible for the early afterglow phase. Here we investigate the polarization\nevolution and light curve of an afterglow under such a 3-dimensional mixed\nmagnetic field. Three kinds of ordered component (i.e., aligned, toroidal and\nradial) are discussed. We find that the three cases are distinguishable through\njet polarization evolution. The polarization angle for a 3D mixed magnetic\nfield with an aligned ordered component can evolve gradually but only changes\nabruptly by $90^\\circ$ in the toroidal and radial cases. Furthermore, during\nthe reverse shock crossing time, the polarization degree (PD) can be non-zero\nfor the toroidal case but roughly zero for the radial case. Since an aligned\ncomponent in a jet corresponds to a magnetar central engine and a toroidal\ncomponent corresponds to a black hole, GRB central engines are distinguishable\nthrough polarization observations even if the magnetic field is mixed in a jet.\nIn addition, our polarization calculation can be applied to GRB 170817A\nassociated with GW170817. Using the recently-observed PD upper limit $12\\%$ of\nGRB 170817A at $t=244$ days, the magnetic field strength ratio of the ordered\nto random components in this afterglow is constrained to be $\\lesssim0.9$. \n\n"}

Cluster radio shocks (relics) are polarized sources mostly\nfound in the cluster's periphery. They trace merger induced shock waves.\nRevived fossil plasma sources are characterized by their radio steep-spectra\nand often irregular morphologies. In this review we give an overview of the\nproperties of diffuse cluster radio sources, with an emphasis on recent\nobservational results. We discuss the resulting implications for the underlying\nphysical acceleration processes that operate in the ICM, the role of\nrelativistic fossil plasma, and the properties of ICM shocks and magnetic\nfields. We also compile an updated list of diffuse cluster radio sources which\nwill be available on-line http://galaxyclusters.com. We end this review with a\ndiscussion on the detection of diffuse radio emission from the cosmic web. \n\n"}
