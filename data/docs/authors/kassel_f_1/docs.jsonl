Given an n-dimensional manifold W, a topological\narbiter associates a value 0 or 1 to codimension zero submanifolds of W,\nsubject to natural topological and duality axioms. For example, there is a\nunique arbiter on $RP^2$, which reports the location of the essential 1-cycle.\nIn contrast, we show that there exists an uncountable collection of topological\narbiters in dimension 4. Families of arbiters, not induced by homology, are\nalso shown to exist in higher dimensions. The technical ingredients underlying\nthe four dimensional results are secondary obstructions to generalized\nlink-slicing problems. For classical links in the 3-sphere the construction\nrelies on the existence of nilpotent embedding obstructions in dimension 4,\nreflected in particular by the Milnor group. In higher dimensions novel\narbiters are produced using nontrivial squares in stable homotopy theory.\n  The concept of \"topological arbiter\" derives from percolation and from\n4-dimensional surgery. It is not the purpose of this paper to advance either of\nthese subjects, but rather to study the concept for its own sake. However in\nappendices we give both an application to percolation, and the current\nunderstanding of the relationship between arbiters and surgery.

As a result, many large classes of 3-manifolds,\nincluding knot complements, are known to have left-orderable fundamental group.\nHowever, though the complement of a knot has left-orderable fundamental group,\nthe result of Dehn surgery is a closed 3-manifold that need not have this\nproperty. We take this as motivation for the study of left-orderability in the\ncontext of Dehn surgery, and establish a condition on peripheral elements that\nmust hold whenever a given Dehn surgery yields a manifold with left-orderable\nfundamental group. This leads to a workable criterion used to determine when\nsufficiently positive Dehn surgery produces manifolds with non-left-orderable\nfundamental group.

We show that the fundamental group\nplays a predominant role in the equivariant classification of such 4-manifolds.\nIn particular, it is shown that for any finitely presented group with infinite\ncenter, there are at most finitely many distinct smooth (resp. topological)\n4-manifolds which support a fixed-point free smooth (resp. locally linear)\n$S^1$-action and realize the given group as the fundamental group. A similar\nstatement holds for the number of equivalence classes of fixed-point free\n$S^1$-actions under some further conditions on the fundamental group. The\nconnection between the classification of the $S^1$-manifolds and the\nfundamental group is given by a certain decomposition, called fiber-sum\ndecomposition, of the $S^1$-manifolds. More concretely, each fiber-sum\ndecomposition naturally gives rise to a Z-splitting of the fundamental group.\nThere are two technical results in this paper which play a central role in our\nconsiderations. One states that the Z-splitting is a canonical JSJ\ndecomposition of the fundamental group in the sense of Rips and Sela.

Our work unifies and\nextends a long list of results by many authors. We make it a point to avoid any\nassumption of properness/compactness, keeping in mind the motivating example of\n$\\mathbb H^\\infty$, the infinite-dimensional rank-one symmetric space of\nnoncompact type over the reals. The monograph provides a number of examples of\ngroups acting on $\\mathbb H^\\infty$ which exhibit a wide range of phenomena not\nto be found in the finite-dimensional theory. Such examples often demonstrate\nthe optimality of our theorems. We introduce a modification of the Poincar\\'e\nexponent, an invariant of a group which gives more information than the usual\nPoincar\\'e exponent, which we then use to vastly generalize the Bishop--Jones\ntheorem relating the Hausdorff dimension of the radial limit set to the\nPoincar\\'e exponent of the underlying semigroup. We give some examples based on\nour results which illustrate the connection between Hausdorff dimension and\nvarious notions of discreteness which show up in non-proper settings. We\nconstruct Patterson--Sullivan measures for groups of divergence type without\nany compactness assumption. This is carried out by first constructing such\nmeasures on the Samuel--Smirnov compactification of the bordification of the\nunderlying hyperbolic space, and then showing that the measures are supported\non the bordification. We study quasiconformal measures of geometrically finite\ngroups in terms of (a) doubling and (b) exact dimensionality. Our analysis\ncharacterizes exact dimensionality in terms of Diophantine approximation on the\nboundary. We demonstrate that some Patterson--Sullivan measures are neither\ndoubling nor exact dimensional, and some are exact dimensional but not\ndoubling, but all doubling measures are exact dimensional. \n\n"}

The game on a graph $G$ can be described as\nfollows: let $f_n$ be a sequence of positive integers; an initial fire starts\nat a finite set of vertices; at each (integer) time $n\\geq 1$, $f_n$ vertices\nwhich are not on fire become protected, and then the fire spreads to all\nunprotected neighbors of vertices on fire; once a vertex is protected or is on\nfire, it remains so for all time intervals. The graph $G$ has the\n\\emph{$f_n$-containment property} if every initial fire admits an strategy that\nprotects $f_n$ vertices at time $n$ so that the set of vertices on fire is\neventually constant. If the graph $G$ has the containment property for a\nsequence of the form $f_n=Cn^d$, then the graph is said to have\n\\emph{polynomial containment}. In [5], it is shown that any locally finite\ngraph with polynomial growth has polynomial containment; and it is remarked\nthat the converse does not hold. That article also raised the question of\nwhether the equivalence of polynomial growth and polynomial containment holds\nfor Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. In this short note, we remark\nhow the equivalence holds for elementary amenable groups and for non-amenable\ngroups from results in the literature. \n\n"}

Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) represents this\nuniversal pairing p onto a finite dimensional quotient pairing q with values in\nC which in physically motivated cases is positive definite. To see if such a\n\"unitary\" TQFT can potentially detect any nontrivial x, we ask if <x,x> is\nnon-zero whenever x is non-zero. If this is the case, we call the pairing p\npositive. The question arises for each dimension d=0,1,2,.... We find p(d)\npositive for d=0,1, and 2 and not positive for d=4. We conjecture that p(3) is\nalso positive.

In\nfact we prove a stronger version that is analogous to Dwyer's extension of\nStallings' theorem. \n\n"}

We apply the general techniques developed in\n[15] and [16] to the L-theory case of the conjecture and prove several results.\n  Here we prove the conjecture, after inverting 2, for poly-free groups. In\nparticular, it follows for braid groups. We also prove the conjecture for some\nclasses of groups without inverting 2. In fact we consider a general class of\ngroups satisfying certain conditions which includes the above groups and some\nother important classes of groups. We check that the properties we defined in\n[15] are satisfied in several instances of the conjecture. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/0703923", "contents": "Title: The Baum-Connes conjecture and proper group actions on affine buildings Abstract: We study the possibility of applying a finite-dimensionality argument in\norder to address parts of the Baum-Connes conjecture for finitely generated\nlinear groups. This gives an alternative approach to the results of Guentner,\nHigson, and Weinberger concerning the Baum-Connes conjecture for linear groups.\n  For any finitely generated linear group over a field of characteristic zero\nwe construct a proper action on a finite-asymptotic-dimensional CAT(0)-space,\nprovided that for such a group its unipotent subgroups have `bounded\ncomposition rank'. The CAT(0)-space in our construction is a finite product of\nsymmetric spaces and affine Bruhat-Tits buildings.\n  For the case of finitely generated subgroup of SL(2,C) the result is\nsharpened to show that the Baum-Connes assembly map is an isomorphism. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/9909063", "contents": "Title: The Links-Gould Invariant Abstract: The ``Links-Gould invariant'' is a two-variable Laurent polynomial invariant\nof oriented (1,1) tangles, which is derived from the representation of the\nbraid generator associated with the one-parameter family of four dimensional\nrepresentations with highest weights (0,0|a) of the quantum superalgebra\nU_q[gl(2|1)]. We use an abstract tensor state model to evaluate the invariant,\nas per the construction of the bracket polynomial state model used by Louis\nKauffman to derive the Jones polynomial. This model facilitates both\ncomputation and theoretical exploration.\n  Our family of representations has a two-variable quantum R matrix (unique up\nto orthogonal transformations). Choosing this R matrix to yield the\nrepresentation of the braid generator ensures that our polynomial invariant\nwill also have two variables. We construct this R matrix from first principles.\nWe have evaluated the invariant for several critical link examples and numerous\nother links of special forms. Throughout, the assistance of Mathematica has\nbeen invoked.\n  We observe that the Links-Gould invariant is distinct from the two-variable\nHOMFLY polynomial in that it detects the chirality of some links where the\nHOMFLY fails. Notably, it does not distinguish inverses, which is not\nsurprising as we are able to demonstrate that no invariant of this type should\nbe able to distinguish between inverses. It also does not distinguish between\nmutants. \n\n"}
