A tagged-photon beam with energies in the 4.8 to 5.4 GeV range,\nproduced through bremsstrahlung from a 5.744 GeV electron beam, was incident on\na liquid-hydrogen target. A Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) was performed on a\nsample of 83,000 events, the highest such statistics to date in this reaction\nat these energies.

In the first work a search for anomalous carbon atoms was done and a\nlimit on the existence of such atoms was determined, $^{12}\\tilde{\\mathrm C}$ /\n$^{12}$C $< 2.5\\times10^{-12}$. In the second work PEP was tested with the\nNEMO-2 detector and the limits on the violation of PEP for p-shell nucleons in\n$^{12}$C were obtained. Specifically, transitions to the fully occupied\n$1s_{1/2}$-shell yielded a limit of $4.2\\times10^{24}$ y for the process with\nthe emission of a $\\gamma$-quantum. Similarly limits of $3.1\\times10^{24}$ y\nfor $\\beta^-$ and $2.6\\times10^{24}$ y for $\\beta^+$ Pauli-forbidded transition\nof $^{12}$C $\\to$ $^{12}\\tilde{\\mathrm N}$($^{12}\\tilde{\\mathrm B}$) are\nreported.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations\non the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead\nto an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \\ge 2$ while only\nthe $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore. In the energy reconstruction 2p-2h interactions lead to a downward\nshift of the reconstructed energy; this effect of 2p-2h excitations disappears\nat higher energies because the 2p-2h influence is spread out over a wider\nenergy range. \n\n"}

For the\nmeasurement of the efficiencies in data collected in 2010 and 2011, the\nbootstrap method is applied. Different sample triggers based on jets and\nmissing transverse energy are compared and their efficiencies are measured.

In this paper we\npropose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of DNA or RNA\ncould provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5\nkeV, and can operate at room temperature. When a WIMP from the Galactic Halo\nelastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector, the recoiling nucleus\nthen traverses hundreds of strings of single stranded nucleic acids (ssNA) with\nknown base sequences and severs ssNA strands along its trajectory. The location\nof the break can be identified by amplifying and identifying the segments of\ncut ssNA using techniques well known to biologists. Thus the path of the\nrecoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy.

However, 4G variations (BSM4) are possible if the new\nparticle is not the SM Higgs boson and/or if other new quanta modify its\nproduction and decay rates. Since LHC searches have pushed 4G quarks to high\nmass and strong coupling where perturbation theory eventually fails, we examine\nthe leading nondecoupling EW (electroweak) corrections at two loop order to\nestimate the domain of validity for perturbation theory. We find that the two\nloop hypercharge correction, which has not been included in previous EW fits of\n4G models, makes the largest quark sector contribution to the rho parameter,\nmuch larger even than the nominally leading one loop term. Because it is large\nand negative, it has a big effect on the EW fits.

First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay.

For a given cosmological model, one can obtain\nindependent information on nuclear processes in the energy range relevant for\nBBN, which determine the eventual ^2H/H yield. In particular, assuming the\nstandard cosmological model, we show that a combined analysis of Planck data\nand of recent deuterium abundance measurements in metal-poor damped Lyman-alpha\nsystems provides independent information on the cross section of the radiative\ncapture reaction d(p,\\gamma)^3He converting deuterium into helium.\nInterestingly, the result is higher than the values suggested by a fit of\npresent experimental data in the BBN energy range (10 - 300 keV), whereas it is\nin better agreement with ab initio theoretical calculations, based on models\nfor the nuclear electromagnetic current derived from realistic interactions.\nDue to the correlation between the rate of the above nuclear process and the\neffective number of neutrinos Neff, the same analysis points out a Neff>3 as\nwell. We show how this observation changes when assuming a non-minimal\ncosmological scenario. We conclude that further data on the d(p,\\gamma)^3He\ncross section in the few hundred keV range, that can be collected by\nexperiments like LUNA, may either confirm the low value of this rate, or rather\ngive some hint in favour of next-to-minimal cosmological scenarios. \n\n"}

We discuss the prospects of probing exotic Higgs decays at the\nLHC using the 4-lepton final state. We study two specific scenarios, with new\nparticles appearing in the intermediate state of the 4-lepton Higgs decay. In\none, Higgs decays to a Z boson and a new massive gauge boson, the so-called\nhidden photon. In the other, Higgs decays to an electron or a muon and a new\nvector-like fermion. We argue that the upcoming LHC run will be able to explore\na new parameter space of these models that is allowed by current precision\nconstraints. Employing matrix element methods, we use the full information\ncontained in the differential distribution of the 4-lepton final state to\nextract the signal of exotic decays.

The studies of\njet shapes in proton-proton collisions have served as precision tests of\nperturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). They have also recently become the\nbaseline for studying the in-medium modification of parton showers in\nultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. The jet shape is a function of\ntwo angular parameters $R$ and $r$, which can be at hierarchical scales. Its\ncalculation suffers from large logarithms of the ratio between the two scales,\nand these phase space logarithms can conveniently be resummed in the framework\nof soft-collinear effective theory (SCET).

Resummation is\nperformed at next-to-leading logarithmic order using renormalization-group\nevolution techniques.

The experiment\nwill therefore have to cope with a much larger machine background than its\npredecessor Belle, in particular from events outside of the interaction region.\nWe present the concept of a track trigger, based on a neural network approach,\nthat is able to suppress a large fraction of this background by reconstructing\nthe $z$ (longitudinal) position of the event vertex within the latency of the\nfirst level trigger. The trigger uses the hit information from the Central\nDrift Chamber (CDC) of Belle II within narrow cones in polar and azimuthal\nangle as well as in transverse momentum (\"sectors\"), and estimates the\n$z$-vertex without explicit track reconstruction. The preprocessing for the\ntrack trigger is based on the track information provided by the standard CDC\ntrigger.

However, because these higgsinos are nearly mass degenerate, they release\nvery little visible energy in their decays, and (even putting aside triggering\nissues) signals from electroweak higgsino pair production typically remain\nburied under Standard Model backgrounds. Prospects for detecting higgsino pair\nproduction via events with monojets or mono-photons from initial state\nradiation are also bleak because of signal-to-background rates typically at the\n1% level. Here, we consider the possibility of reducing backgrounds by\nrequiring the presence of soft daughter leptons from higgsino decays in monojet\nevents. We find that LHC14 experiments with an integrated luminosity of 300\nfb^{-1} should be sensitive to light higgsinos at the 5\\sigma level for \\mu <\n170 GeV with a S/B ~ 8.5%. For an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb^{-1} (which\nshould be possible at a high luminosity LHC) the corresponding sensitivity to\n\\mu extends to over 200 GeV though the systematic uncertainty would have to be\ncontrolled to considerably better than 5%. The corresponding reach from\nmeasurements of the rate asymmetry between monojet events with same flavour vs.\nopposite flavour dileptons is ~10-15 GeV smaller, but does not suffer the\nsystematic uncertainty from the normalization of the background. \n\n"}

The relatively large masses of heavy\nquarks ensure that they are predominantly produced in the early stages of the\ncollision and probe the complete space-time evolution of the expanding medium.\nThe measurements of D-meson production in pp collisions provide an important\ntest of pQCD calculations and serve as an essential baseline for the\ncomprehensive studies in heavy-ion collisions. The study of D-meson production\nin p-Pb collisions is necessary to disentangle the cold nuclear matter effects\nfrom hot nuclear matter effects. The measurement of heavy-flavour production as\na function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions could\nprovide insight into the role of multi-parton interactions at LHC energies.\n  We present ALICE results on D-meson production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}\n=$ 7 TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm {NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV.

They all emerge as a result of its strong\ncoupling. Strong coupling QCD creates complex phenomena, much richer than known\n40 years ago: a richness that ensures colour confinement and accounts for more\nthan 95\\% of the mass of the visible Universe. How strong coupling QCD really\nworks requires a synergy between experiment and theory. A very personal view of\nthese fascinating developments in cold QCD is presented. \n\n"}

However, transferring the\ndetector design from the CAD program to Geant4 can be laborious and\nerror-prone. SW2GDML is a tool that reads a design in the popular SOLIDWORKS\nCAD program and outputs Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML), used by\nGeant4 for importing and exporting detector geometries. Other methods for\noutputting CAD designs are available, such as the STEP format, and tools exist\nto convert these formats into GDML. However, these conversion methods produce\nvery large and unwieldy designs composed of tessellated solids that can reduce\nGeant4 performance.

Flavor-changing neutral\ncurrent $Z'$ couplings, such as $tcZ'$, can be induced by the presence of extra\nvector-like quarks. In this paper we study the LHC signatures of the induced\nright-handed $tcZ'$ coupling that is inspired by, but not directly linked to,\nthe $B \\to K^{(*)}$ anomalies. The specific processes studied are $cg \\to tZ'$\nand its conjugate process each followed by $Z'\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$. By constructing\nan effective theory for the $tcZ'$ coupling, we first explore\nmodel-independently the discovery potential of such a $Z'$ at the 14 TeV LHC\nwith 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosities. We then reinterpret the\nmodel-independent results within the gauged $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ model. In\nconnection with $tcZ'$, the model also implies the existence of a\nflavor-conserving $ccZ'$ coupling, which can drive the $c \\bar c \\to Z' \\to\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ process. Our study shows that existing LHC results for dimuon\nresonance searches already constrain the $ccZ'$ coupling, and that the $Z'$ can\nbe discovered in either or both of the $cg \\to tZ'$ and $c \\bar c \\to Z'$\nprocesses.

Since the DM only interacts by transitioning to a heavier state,\nfreeze-out proceeds via coannihilation and the unstable heavier state is\ndepleted at later times. For sufficiently large mass splittings, direct\ndetection is kinematically forbidden and indirect detection is impossible, so\nthis scenario can only be tested with accelerators. Here we propose new\nsearches at proton and electron beam fixed-target experiments to probe sub-GeV\ncoannihilation, exploiting the distinctive signals of up- and down-scattering\nas well as decay of the excited state inside the detector volume.

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment. A similar coherent enhancement mechanism can work\nfor relativistic particles in the dark sector, but not for the conventionally\nconsidered non-relativistic dark matter. \n\n"}

These\nfinal states rely heavily on phenomenological models and perturbative\ncorrections which are not fully understood, and yet for many physics searches\nat the LHC, multijet processes are an important background to deal with. It is\ntherefore imperative that the modelling of multijet processes is better\nunderstood and improved. For this reason, a study has been done with several\nstate-of-the-art Monte Carlo event generators, and their predictions are tested\nagainst ATLAS data using the Rivet framework. The results display a mix of\nagreement and disagreement between the predictions and data, depending on which\nvariables are studied.

Hypothesising that these symmetries exist implies the\nexistence of a new form of matter, called mirror matter. The mirror matter\ntheory (or exact parity model) makes four main predictions: 1) Dark matter in\nthe form of mirror matter should exist in the Universe (i.e. mirror galaxies,\nstars, planets, meteoroids...), 2) Maximal ordinary neutrino - mirror neutrino\noscillations if neutrinos have mass, 3) Orthopositronium should have a shorter\neffective lifetime than predicted by QED (in \"vacuum\" experiments) because of\nthe effects of photon-mirror photon mixing and 4) Higgs production and decay\nrate should be 50% lower than in the standard model due to Higgs mirror - Higgs\nmixing (assuming that the seperation of the Higgs masses is larger than their\ndecay widths). At the present time there is strong experimental/observational\nevidence supporting the first three of these predictions, while the fourth one\nis not tested yet because the Higgs boson, predicted in the standard model of\nparticle physics, is yet to be found. This experimental/observational evidence\nis rich and varied ranging from the atmospheric and solar neutrino deficits,\nMACHO gravitational microlensing events, strange properties of extra-solar\nplanets, the existence of \"isolated\" planets, orthopositronium lifetime\nanomaly, Tunguska and other strange \"meteor\" events including perhaps, the\norigin of the moon.

A cold flow on\nEarth produces a peak in the spectrum of microwave photons in cavity detectors\nof dark matter axions, and a plateau in the nuclear recoil energy spectrum in\nWIMP detectors.

The\nmodel predicts two states with nucleon quantum numbers which have tentatively\nbeen identified with the N*(1440) and the N*(1710). This paper examines the\nviability of this model by focusing on the decay width of the nucleon members\nof the multiplet. An inequality relating the partial widths of these nucleon\nstates in the N+nucleon channel to the width of the theta+ is derived for this\nmodel under the assuming ideal mixing and that the only significant exact SU(3)\nsymmetry violations are the result of ideal mixing, threshold effects and the\nmasses of pseudo-Goldstone bosons. This inequality is badly violated if the\nstates in the multiplet are the N*(1440) and the N*(1710) and if the recent\nbounds extracted for the theta+ width are reliable.
