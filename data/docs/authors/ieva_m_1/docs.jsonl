The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background.

Since the\nlight-neutrino mass must be less than an eV or so, the mixing would be very\nsmall, even for a heavy-neutrino mass of order a few hundred GeV. This would\nmake it unlikely to test the model directly at the LHC, as the amplitude for\nproducing the heavy neutrino is proportional to the mixing size. However, it\nhas been realized for some time that, with more than one generation of light\nand heavy neutrinos, the mixing can be significantly larger in certain\nsituations.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet. This model matches the overall spectrum shown by the Auger\ndata and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function of\nparticle energy.

We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily\ncovariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad\ndata (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected\nintrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit.

In this framework, extremes are basically identified with the block\nmaxima of the time series of the chosen observable, in the limit of infinitely\nlong blocks. It has been proved that, assuming suitable mixing conditions for\nthe underlying dynamical systems, the extremes of a specific class of\nobservables are distributed according to the so called Generalized Extreme\nValue (GEV) distribution. Direct calculations show that in the case of\nquasi-periodic dynamics the block maxima are not distributed according to the\nGEV distribution. In this paper we show that, in order to obtain a universal\nbehaviour of the extremes, the requirement of a mixing dynamics can be relaxed\nif the Pareto approach is used, based upon considering the exceedances over a\ngiven threshold. Requiring that the invariant measure locally scales with a\nwell defined exponent - the local dimension -, we show that the limiting\ndistribution for the exceedances of the observables previously studied with the\nGnedenko approach is a Generalized Pareto distribution where the parameters\ndepends only on the local dimensions and the value of the threshold.

It is challenging to identify\nchemical components from a wide range of explosives. There are two key steps\ninvolved. One is a nondestructive and informative spectroscopic technique for\ndata acquisition. The other is an associated library of reference features\nalong with a computational method for feature matching and meaningful detection\nwithin or beyond the library.\n  Recently several experimental techniques based on Raman scattering have been\ndeveloped to perform standoff detection and identification of explosives, and\nthey prove to be successful under certain idealized conditions. However data\nanalysis is limited to standard least squares method assuming the complete\nknowledge of the chemical components. In this paper, we develop a new iterative\nmethod to identify unknown substances from mixture samples of Raman\nspectroscopy. In the first step, a constrained least squares method decomposes\nthe data into a sum of linear combination of the known components and a\nnon-negative residual. In the second step, a sparse and convex blind source\nseparation method extracts components geometrically from the residuals.\nVerification based on the library templates or expert knowledge helps to\nconfirm these components. If necessary, the confirmed meaningful components are\nfed back into step one to refine the residual and then step two extracts\npossibly more hidden components.

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the\ndistribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the\ncoefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT). A Fourier analysis of the charged particle\npair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Dphi=phi_a-phi_b) is performed\nto extract the coefficients v_{n,n}=<cos (n Dphi)>.

Consequently, the transient information of\nmolecules in each particular cell contains significant noise. The DSMC method\nuses the transient values of molecular variables to compute the cell's\nvariables (including number density, flow velocity and temperature) and so the\nstochastic noise in its cell's variables is remarkable particularly in the case\nof low velocity.

Indeed, all observed couplings\nare consistent with the predictions from the Higgs mechanism, both to vector\nbosons and fermions implying that masses are indeed consistent of being\ngenerated by the interactions with the Higgs field. However, on a cosmological\nscale the mass of the universe seems not to be related to the Higgs field: the\nbaryonic mass originates from the binding energy of the quarks inside the\nnuclei and dark matter is not even predicted in the SM, so the origin of its\nmass is unknown.

For this purpose we extract the charm\nvacuum polarisation via a standard dispersion relation from BESII-data on\n$e^+e^-\\to hadrons$. In the factorisation approximation (FA) the vacuum\npolarisation describes the interference fully non-perturbatively. The observed\ninterference pattern by the LHCb collaboration is opposite in sign and and\nsignificantly enhanced as compared to the FA. A change of the FA-result by a\nfactor of -2.5, which correspond to a 350%-corrections, results in a reasonable\nagreement with the data. This raises the question on the size of\nnon-factorisable corrections which are colour enhanced but loop-suppressed.

These different\ntypes of interactions are often represented as layers, attributes on the edges\nor as a time-dependence of the network structure. Although they are crucial for\na more comprehensive scientific understanding, these representations offer\nsubstantial challenges. Namely, it is an open problem how to precisely\ncharacterize the large or mesoscale structure of network systems in relation to\nthese additional aspects. Furthermore, the direct incorporation of these\nfeatures invariably increases the effective dimension of the network\ndescription, and hence aggravates the problem of overfitting, i.e. the use of\noverly-complex characterizations that mistake purely random fluctuations for\nactual structure. In this work, we propose a robust and principled method to\ntackle these problems, by constructing generative models of modular network\nstructure, incorporating layered, attributed and time-varying properties, as\nwell as a nonparametric Bayesian methodology to infer the parameters from data\nand select the most appropriate model according to statistical evidence. We\nshow that the method is capable of revealing hidden structure in layered,\nedge-valued and time-varying networks, and that the most appropriate level of\ngranularity with respect to the additional dimensions can be reliably\nidentified.

These are small, but not\nnegligible, and include quark-hadron \"duality violations\" (i.e., resonance\neffects) which are not described by the operator product expansion (OPE). In\none approach, an attempt is made to suppress duality violations enough that\nthey might become negligible.

The corresponding total decay\nwidth behaves as $\\Gamma=\\frac\\pi2 ATL$ where $T$ and $L$ are the tension and\nlength of the string and $A$ is a dimensionless universal constant. We show\nthat this result holds for a bosonic string not only in the critical dimension.\nThe partial width of a given decay mode is given by\n$\\Gamma_i/\\Gamma=\\Phi_i\\exp(-2\\pi Cm_{sep}^2/T)$ where $\\Phi_i$ is a phase\nspace factor, $m_{sep}$ is the mass of the \"quark\" and \"antiquark\" created at\nthe splitting point, and $C$ is a dimensionless coefficient close to unity.\nBased on the spectra of hadrons we observe that their (modified) Regge\ntrajectories are characterized by a negative intercept. This implies a\nrepulsive Casimir force that gives the string a \"zero point length\". We fit the\ntheoretical decay width to experimental data for mesons on the trajectories of\n$\\rho$, $\\omega$, $\\pi$, $\\eta$, $K^*$, $\\phi$, $D$, and $D^*_s$, and of the\nbaryons $N$, $\\Delta$, $\\Lambda$, and $\\Sigma$.

Using random matrix theory and exact solutions in\nlinear models, we derive the generalization error and training error dynamics\nof learning and analyze how they depend on the dimensionality of data and\nsignal to noise ratio of the learning problem. We find that the dynamics of\ngradient descent learning naturally protect against overtraining and\noverfitting in large networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network\nsizes, when the effective number of free parameters equals the number of\nsamples, and thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger.\nAdditionally, in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires\nstarting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural\nnetworks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their\ngeneralization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce\novertraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort.

However as all\nthe approaches are heuristics, while the complete brute-force is not feasible,\nthere is no known way to understand if the obtained partitioning is really the\noptimal one. In this article we address the modularity maximization problem\nfrom the other side --- finding an upper-bound estimate for the possible\nmodularity values within a given network, allowing to better evaluate suggested\ncommunity structures. Moreover, in some cases when then upper bound estimate\nmeets the actually obtained modularity score, it provides a proof that the\nsuggested community structure is indeed the optimal one. We propose an\nefficient algorithm for building such an upper-bound estimate and illustrate\nits usage on the examples of well-known classical and synthetic networks, being\nable to prove the optimality of the existing partitioning for some of the\nnetworks including well-known Zachary's Karate Club. \n\n"}

Two prototype\ndetectors were installed at the T2K muon monitor location, and various EMT\nproperties were studied based on in situ data taken with the T2K muon beam. The\nsignal size is as expected based on calculation, and the EMTs show a\nsufficiently fast time response for bunch-by-bunch beam monitoring. The\nspill-by-spill intensity resolution is 0.4%, better than the required value\n(1%). Signal linearity within $\\pm$1% is achieved at proton beam powers up to\n460 kW (with +250 kA focusing horn operation). A gradual signal decrease was\nobserved during the initial exposure, due to the stabilization of dynode\nmaterials, before the response became stable within $\\pm$1%. This work\ndemonstrates that EMTs are a good candidate for future muon monitoring at T2K,\nand may also have other more general applications. \n\n"}

Here the interevent time is defined as a time interval between\ntwo consecutive events in the event sequence, and the burst size denotes the\nnumber of events in a bursty train detected for a given time window. In order\nto understand such temporal scaling behaviors implying a hierarchical temporal\nstructure, we devise a hierarchical burst model by assuming that each observed\nevent might be a consequence of the multi-level causal or decision-making\nprocess. By studying our model analytically and numerically, we confirm the\nscaling relation $\\alpha+\\gamma=2$, established for the uncorrelated interevent\ntimes, despite of the existence of correlations between interevent times. Such\ncorrelations between interevent times are supported by the stretched\nexponential burst size distributions, for which we provide an analytic\nargument. In addition, by imposing conditions for the ordering of events, we\nobserve an additional feature of log-periodic behavior in the autocorrelation\nfunction.

Here, we\npresent a general framework for calculating these dynamical quantities by\napproximating boundary value problems using dynamical operators with a Galerkin\nexpansion. A specific choice of basis set in the expansion corresponds to\nestimation of dynamical quantities using a Markov state model. More generally,\nthe boundary conditions impose restrictions on the choice of basis sets. We\ndemonstrate how an alternative basis can be constructed using ideas from\ndiffusion maps. In our numerical experiments, this basis gives results of\ncomparable or better accuracy to Markov state models. Additionally, we show\nthat delay embedding can reduce the information lost when projecting the\nsystem's dynamics for model construction; this improves estimates of dynamical\nstatistics considerably over the standard practice of increasing the lag time. \n\n"}

Hypothesising that these symmetries exist implies the\nexistence of a new form of matter, called mirror matter. The mirror matter\ntheory (or exact parity model) makes four main predictions: 1) Dark matter in\nthe form of mirror matter should exist in the Universe (i.e. mirror galaxies,\nstars, planets, meteoroids...), 2) Maximal ordinary neutrino - mirror neutrino\noscillations if neutrinos have mass, 3) Orthopositronium should have a shorter\neffective lifetime than predicted by QED (in \"vacuum\" experiments) because of\nthe effects of photon-mirror photon mixing and 4) Higgs production and decay\nrate should be 50% lower than in the standard model due to Higgs mirror - Higgs\nmixing (assuming that the seperation of the Higgs masses is larger than their\ndecay widths). At the present time there is strong experimental/observational\nevidence supporting the first three of these predictions, while the fourth one\nis not tested yet because the Higgs boson, predicted in the standard model of\nparticle physics, is yet to be found. This experimental/observational evidence\nis rich and varied ranging from the atmospheric and solar neutrino deficits,\nMACHO gravitational microlensing events, strange properties of extra-solar\nplanets, the existence of \"isolated\" planets, orthopositronium lifetime\nanomaly, Tunguska and other strange \"meteor\" events including perhaps, the\norigin of the moon.

We review a few of the properties of radio\nemission from cosmic ray air showers and show how these properties can be\nexplained by coherent ``geosynchrotron'' emission from electron-positron pairs\nin the shower as they move through the geomagnetic field. This should allow one\nto use the radio emission as a useful diagnostic tool for cosmic ray research.\nA new generation of digital telescopes will make it possible to study this\nradio emission in greater detail. For example, the planned Low-Frequency Array\n(LOFAR), operating at 10-200 MHz, will be an instrument uniquely suited to\nstudy extensive air showers and even detect neutrino-induced showers on the\nmoon. We discuss sensitivities, count rates and possible detection algorithms\nfor LOFAR and a currently funded prototype station LOPES.

We find that the uncertainty in the primary flux induced by the\npropagation parameters alone is about two orders of magnitude at low energies,\nand it is mainly determined by the lack of knowledge on the thickness of the\ndiffusive halo. On the contrary, different dark matter density profiles do not\nsignificantly alter the flux: a NFW distribution produces fluxes which are at\nmost 20% higher than an isothermal sphere. The most conservative choice for\npropagation parameters and dark matter distribution normalization, together\nwith current data on cosmic antiprotons, cannot lead to any definitive\nconstraint on the supersymmetric parameter space, neither in a low-energy\neffective MSSM, or in a minimal SUGRA scheme.

The $\\sigma(500)$ resonance, which is then strongly\ncoupled to pion pairs, yields a tiny contribution because, in our approach, its\ncoupling to kaon pairs is proportional to $m^2_\\sigma-m^2_K$ and thus quite\nsmall. \n\n"}

Nevertheless, we show that this\ninformation can be summarized in a set of simple equations, expressing alpha as\na multi-valued function of a single theoretically unknown parameter, which\nconveniently can be chosen as a well-defined ratio of penguin to tree\namplitudes. Using these exact analytic expressions, free of any assumption\nbesides the Standard Model, and some reasonable hypotheses to constrain the\nmodulus of the penguin amplitude, we derive several new upper bounds on the\npenguin-induced shift |2alpha-2alpha_eff|, generalizing the recent result of\nGrossman and Quinn. These bounds depend on the averaged branching ratios of\nsome decays (pi0pi0, K0K0bar, K+-pi-+) particularly sensitive to the penguin.\nOn the other hand, with further and less conservative approximations, we show\nthat the knowledge of the B+- -> Kpi+- branching ratio alone gives sufficient\ninformation to extract the free parameter without the need of other\nmeasurements, and without knowing |V_td| or |V_ub|. More generally, knowing the\nmodulus of the penguin amplitude with an accuracy of ~30% might result in an\nextraction of alpha competitive with the experimentally more difficult isospin\nanalysis.

The method is general and in particular\napplicable to sparsely populated spectra. Monte Carlo techniques to evaluate\nthe sensitivity of an experiment are described. As an example, the method is\nused to calculate the sensitivity of the GERDA experiment to neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay. \n\n"}

While data considered for physics studies are\nsubject to a careful understanding of error sources, such analysis are almost\nabsent in studies of voting process. As a way to test reliability in electoral\nprocesses we choose to investigate the July 2006 presidential election in\nMexico. We use records which appeared in the Programa de Resultados\nPreliminares, PREP, the program which offers electoral results as soon as they\nare captured. In order to contrast the results we used the congressional\nelection data-set and the July 2000 presidential record. We demonstrate the\nexistence of correlations in the percentage of votes and, we offer evidence of\nthe strong influence of the PRI in the curious results in the presidential\ncase. Distributions of errors in the data-sets are analyzed for all the\nelections and no large deviations were found. That is, even when the sum of\nerrors is around 45% in all cases, their global behavior is similar. This\nresult gives support to the thesis of no large fraud for the July 2006\npresidential election. Distribution of votes in all cases is obtained for all\nthe parties. Parties and candidates with few votes, annulled votes and\nnon-registered candidates follow a power law distribution, and the corporate\nparty follows a daisy model distribution. Parties and candidates with many\nvotes show a mixed behavior. \n\n"}

These methods attempt to classify events given a\nnumber of identification variables. The BDT algorithm has been discussed by us\nin previous publications. Testing is done in this paper by smearing and\nshifting the input variables of testing samples. Based on these studies, BDT\nhas better particle identification performance than ANN. The degradation of the\nclassifications obtained by shifting or smearing variables of testing results\nis smaller for BDT than for ANN. \n\n"}

A promising line of research involves the early detection of\nprecursory log-periodic oscillations to help forecast extreme events in\ncollective phenomena where discrete scale invariance plays an important role.\nHere I investigate two distinct approaches towards the general problem of how\nto detect log-periodic oscillations in arbitrary time series without prior\nknowledge of the location of the moveable singularity. I first show that the\nproblem has a definite solution in Fourier space, however the technique\ninvolved requires an unrealistically large signal to noise ratio. I then show\nthat the quadrature signal obtained via analytic continuation onto the\nimaginary axis, using the Hilbert transform, necessarily retains the\nlog-periodicities found in the original signal. This finding allows the\ndevelopment of a new method of detecting log-periodic oscillations that relies\non calculation of the instantaneous phase of the analytic signal. I illustrate\nthe method by applying it to the well documented stock market crash of 1987.\nFinally, I discuss the relevance of these findings for parametric rather than\nnonparametric estimation of critical times. \n\n"}

First, we study\nthe six cases m = 2, N = 2,...,7 by computing the the 3 x 3 Fisher information\nmatrices for the corresponding optimal measurements recently devised by Vidal\net al (quant-ph/9812068) for N = 2,...,7. We obtain simple polynomial\nexpressions for the (\"Gill-Massar\") traces of the products of the inverse of\nthe quantum Helstrom information matrix and these Fisher information matrices.\nThe six traces all have minima of 2 N -1 in the pure state limit, while for\nseparable measurements (quant-ph/9902063), the traces can equal N, but not\nexceed it. Then, the result of an analysis for m = 3, N = 2 leads us to\nconjecture that for optimal measurements for all m and N, the \"Gill-Massar\ntrace\" achieves a minimum of (2N-1)(m-1) in the pure state limit. \n\n"}
