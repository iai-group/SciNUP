This assumption may lead to very different\nobservational consequences compared to the case of a standard cosmology where\nthe energy density of the Universe is dominated by radiation. We show that,\ndepending on the choice of the temperature T_r above which kination dominates\nover radiation, any situation between the strong and the super--weak wash--out\nregime are equally viable for leptogenesis, even with the RHN Yukawa coupling\nfixed to provide the observed atmospheric neutrino mass scale ~ 0.05 eV. For M<\nT_r < M/100, i.e., when kination stops to dominate at a time which is not much\nlater than when leptogenesis takes place, the efficiency of the process,\ndefined as the ratio between the produced lepton asymmetry and the amount of CP\nviolation in the RHN decay, can be larger than in the standard scenario of\nradiation domination.

Most interesting decision problems, however, do not come with\na state space and an outcome space. Indeed, in complex problems it is often far\nfrom clear what the state and outcome spaces would be. We present an\nalternative foundation for decision making, in which the primitive objects of\nchoice are syntactic programs. A representation theorem is proved in the spirit\nof standard representation theorems, showing that if the DM's preference\nrelation on objects of choice satisfies appropriate axioms, then there exist a\nset S of states, a set O of outcomes, a way of interpreting the objects of\nchoice as functions from S to O, a probability on S, and a utility function on\nO, such that the DM prefers choice a to choice b if and only if the expected\nutility of a is higher than that of b. Thus, the state space and outcome space\nare subjective, just like the probability and utility; they are not part of the\ndescription of the problem. In principle, a modeler can test for SEU behavior\nwithout having access to states or outcomes.

The interstellar absorption lines are resolved into two components\nof approximately equal strength and each spanning several hundred km/s in\nvelocity. One component has a net blueshift of -70 km/s relative to the stars\nand H II regions and presumably arises in a galaxy-scale outflow similar to\nthose seen in most star-forming galaxies at z = 2-3.

A major\nlimitation of such models to date in the context of HCNs is the neglect of\nnetwork traffic and load: all base stations (BSs) have typically been assumed\nto always be transmitting. Small cells in particular will have a lighter load\nthan macrocells, and so their contribution to the network interference may be\nsignificantly overstated in a fully loaded model. This paper incorporates a\nflexible notion of BS load by introducing a new idea of conditionally thinning\nthe interference field. For a K-tier HCN where BSs across tiers differ in terms\nof transmit power, supported data rate, deployment density, and now load, we\nderive the coverage probability for a typical mobile, which connects to the\nstrongest BS signal. Conditioned on this connection, the interfering BSs of the\n$i^{th}$ tier are assumed to transmit independently with probability $p_i$,\nwhich models the load.

We find that a pair of modern Europeans living in neighboring\npopulations share around 10-50 genetic common ancestors from the last 1500\nyears, and upwards of 500 genetic ancestors from the previous 1000 years. These\nnumbers drop off exponentially with geographic distance, but since genetic\nancestry is rare, individuals from opposite ends of Europe are still expected\nto share millions of common genealogical ancestors over the last 1000 years.\nThere is substantial regional variation in the number of shared genetic\nancestors: especially high numbers of common ancestors between many eastern\npopulations likely date to the Slavic and/or Hunnic expansions, while much\nlower levels of common ancestry in the Italian and Iberian peninsulas may\nindicate weaker demographic effects of Germanic expansions into these areas\nand/or more stably structured populations. Recent shared ancestry in modern\nEuropeans is ubiquitous, and clearly shows the impact of both small-scale\nmigration and large historical events. Population genomic datasets have\nconsiderable power to uncover recent demographic history, and will allow a much\nfuller picture of the close genealogical kinship of individuals across the\nworld. \n\n"}

Here we develop a visualization technique that is adapted to\ndescribe this modular structure. In complement to the widely employed\nRamachandran plot that is based on toroidal geometry, our approach utilizes the\ngeometry of a two-sphere.

It maps the positions of\neach atom to the surface of the two-sphere exactly how these atoms are seen by\nan observer who is located at the position of the central C-alpha atom. At each\nlevel of side-chain atoms we observe a strong correlation between the\npositioning of the atom and the underlying local secondary structure with very\nlittle if any variation between the different amino acids. As a concrete\nexample we analyze the left-handed helix region of non-glycyl amino acids.

Several commonly employed size\nmeasurement techniques are used, including single Sersic fits, two-component\nSersic models, and a non-parametric method. Through simple simulations, we show\nthat the non-parametric and two-component Sersic methods provide the most\nrobust effective radius measurements, while those based on single Sersic\nprofiles are often overestimates, especially for massive red/early-type\ngalaxies. Using our robust sizes, we show for all sub-samples that the\nmass-size relations are shallow at low stellar masses and steepen above ~ 3-4 x\n10^{10}\\msun. The mass-size relations for galaxies classified as late-type,\nlow-n, and star-forming are consistent with each other, while blue galaxies\nfollow a somewhat steeper relation. The mass-size relations of early-type,\nhigh-n, red, and quiescent galaxies all agree with each other but are somewhat\nsteeper at the high-mass end than previous results.

Although it\nis difficult to investigate such a scenario at collider experiments, the\nmeasurement of the hadronic electric dipole moments is one of promising ways to\ndetect the effects of the SUSY particles.

In fact, we find that not all the\nnon-perturbative completions are consistent with non-perturbative $p-q$\nduality; Non-perturbative duality rather provides a constraint on\nnon-perturbative contour ambiguity (equivalently, of D-instanton fugacity) in\nmatrix models.

Four of\nthe six galaxies in our sample display ordered H2 velocity fields, consistent\nwith gas moving in the plane of the galaxy and rotating in the same direction\nas the stars.

We can classify the observed velocity fields into four different types\nof flows, ordered by increasing complexity: (1) circular motion in a disc\n(NGC3351); (2) oval motion in the galaxy plane (NGC3627 and NGC4536); (3)\nstreaming motion superimposed on circular rotation (NGC4501); and (4)\ndisordered streaming motions (NGC4569 and NGC4579).

Rather, an analysis that takes\nmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue\nearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies\nare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.\nIn contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,\nand they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates\ndecline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these\nconclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a\nstriking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms\nof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that\nlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of\ngas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion\nof the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental\nprocesses. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas\nsupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid\nquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.\nThis gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,\nwhich in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and\nmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN\nfeedback. \n\n"}

The formation of\ndwarf galaxies is considered to depend on a random variable, the tidal index\ntheta, an environmental parameter defined by Karachentsev et al. (2004), such\nthat for theta less than zero, the formation of dwarf irregular galaxy is\nassured whereas for theta greater than zero, the formation of dwarf ellipticals\nis preferred. It is found that for particular ranges of the interactive\nparameters the model predictions are in good agreement with the observed number\ndensity of the different galaxy types as a function of space density in four\nclusters of galaxies. This supports the fact that galaxy interactions do not\nall necessarily give rise to the formation of either dwarf irregulars or dwarf\nellipticals. It is also shown that the formation of dwarf irregulars at high\ndensities is much lower than that of dwarf ellipticals, and that the formation\nof the latter reaches a maximum at a particular space density, unlike the\nformer. This suggests that at high densities many dwarf irregulars are stripped\nof their gaseous envelopes to become dwarf elliptical. \n\n"}

Previous studies\nhave shown that the continuous disk is hard to be resolved with 8 meter class\ntelescopes in Q-band due to the strong emission from the unresolved innermost\nregion of the disk.

Up to now, the AGN luminosity\nfunction has been estimated several times in soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard X-rays\n(2-10 keV). AGN selection in these energy ranges often suffers from\nidentification and redshift incompleteness and, at the same time, photoelectric\nabsorption can obscure a significant amount of the X-ray radiation.

Using a mosaic of 45 pointings, we have obtained a homogeneous\n1.3mm image of the HUDF, achieving an rms sensitivity of 35 microJy, at a\nresolution of 0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of ~50 >3.5sigma peaks, a\nrigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with flux densities S(1.3) > 120 microJy.\nAll of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts (<z> =\n2.15), and 12 are also detected at 6GHz in new deep JVLA imaging. Due to the\nwealth of supporting data in this unique field, the physical properties of the\nALMA sources are well constrained, including their stellar masses (M*) and\nUV+FIR star-formation rates (SFR). Our results show that stellar mass is the\nbest predictor of SFR in the high-z Universe; indeed at z > 2 our ALMA sample\ncontains 7 of the 9 galaxies in the HUDF with M* > 2 x 10^10 Msun and we detect\nonly one galaxy at z > 3.5, reflecting the rapid drop-off of high-mass galaxies\nwith increasing redshift. The detections, coupled with stacking, allow us to\nprobe the redshift/mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to S(1.3) ~\n10 micro-Jy. We find strong evidence for a steep `main sequence' for\nstar-forming galaxies at z ~ 2, with SFR \\propto M* and a mean specific SFR =\n2.2 /Gyr.

Our analysis, based on the real-space\ndynamical mean field theory, elucidates the following results. (i) Even when\nthe reduction occurs, the winding number defined by the Green's function can\ntake a nontrivial value at zero temperature. (ii) The winding number taking the\nnontrivial value becomes consistent with the absence of gapless edge modes due\nto Mott behaviors emerging only at the edges. (iii) Temperature effects can\nrestore the gapless edge modes, provided that the energy scale of interactions\nis smaller than the bulk gap. In addition, we observe the topological edge Mott\nbehavior only in some finite temperature region. \n\n"}

The production of\nan intense muon beam relies on the efficient capture of pions, which\nsubsequently decay to muons, using a novel superconducting solenoid magnet\nsystem.

In order to\ndetect muons, a target of either copper or magnesium was placed to stop muons\nat the end of the muon beamline.

The boundary value\nproblem consists of a second order parabolic equation defined on a time-varying\nLipschitz domain in a Euclidean space and of a mixed boundary condition\ncomposed of a Robin and the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. It is assumed\nthat the time-varying domain is included in a fixed smooth domain and that a\ncertain part of the boundary of the time-varying domain is also included in the\nboundary of the fixed domain, say the fixed boundary. The Robin condition is\nimposed on a part of the boundary included in the fixed one and the Dirichlet\ncondition on the rest of the boundary. Such a parabolic boundary value problem\nalways has a unique weak solution for given data; however it does not possess a\nclassical or strong solution in general, even in the case of equations with\nconstant coefficients.

For example, systematic variation of the exchange\ncoupling strength can be used to create systems that behave as if they are\ncomprised of virtually independent segments that exhibit \"local\" Curie\ntemperatures. Such localization of thermodynamic behavior leads to boundaries\nbetween strongly and weakly magnetized regions that can be controllably moved\nwithin the material with temperature. The utility of this interesting\nfunctionality is largely dependent on the inherent spatial resolution of\nmagnetic properties - specifically the distance over which the exchange\nstrength and corresponding properties behave locally. To test the degree to\nwhich this type of localization can be realized in materials, we have\nfabricated epitaxial films of Co[1-x]Ru[x] alloy featuring a nanometer scale\ntriangular wave-like concentration depth profile. Continuous nanoscale\nmodulation of the local Curie temperature was observed using polarized neutron\nreflectometry. These results are consistent with mean-field simulations of spin\nsystems that encompass the possibility of delocalized exchange coupling, and\nshow that composition grading can be used to localize magnetic properties in\nfilms down to the nanometer level. Since this is demonstrated here for an\nitinerant metal, we assert that for virtually any modulated magnetic material\nsystem, collective effects can be suppressed to length scales smaller than\nabout 3 nm, so that magnetic behavior overall can be well described in terms of\nlocal material properties. \n\n"}

If the isolation mass is very small, then\ngas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a\nmainly solid composition. For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the\nplanet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into\na gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation\nmass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here we expand on previous\nmeasurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all\nrelevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling\nlaw that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$. We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas,\nwith Stokes number $\\tau_{\\rm f}<0.005$ can drift through the partial gap at\npebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must\nbe decreasingly smaller to penetrate through the pressure bump. Turbulent\ndiffusion of particles, however, can lead to an increase of the pebble\nisolation mass by a factor of two, depending on the strength of the background\nviscosity and on the pebble size. We finally explore the implications of the\nnew scaling law of the pebble isolation mass on the formation of planetary\nsystems by numerically integrating the growth and migration pathways of planets\nin evolving protoplanetary discs. Compared to models neglecting the dependence\nof the pebble isolation mass on the $\\alpha$-viscosity, our models including\nthis effect result in larger core masses for giant planets. These larger core\nmasses are more akin to the core masses of the giant planets in the Solar\nSystem. \n\n"}

To measure the influence of high-level bottom-up features, we\nuse a recent DNN-based saliency model. To account for top-down influences, we\nevaluate the models on two large datasets with different tasks: first, a\nmemorisation task and, second, a search task. Our results lend support to a\nseparation of visual scene exploration into three phases: The first saccade, an\ninitial guided exploration characterised by a gradual broadening of the\nfixation density, and an steady state which is reached after roughly 10\nfixations. Saccade target selection during the initial exploration and in the\nsteady state are related to similar areas of interest, which are better\npredicted when including high-level features.

As an effort towards extracting coherent\nsummaries, we propose a neural coherence model to capture the cross-sentence\nsemantic and syntactic coherence patterns. The proposed neural coherence model\nobviates the need for feature engineering and can be trained in an end-to-end\nfashion using unlabeled data. Empirical results show that the proposed neural\ncoherence model can efficiently capture the cross-sentence coherence patterns.\nUsing the combined output of the neural coherence model and ROUGE package as\nthe reward, we design a reinforcement learning method to train a proposed\nneural extractive summarizer which is named Reinforced Neural Extractive\nSummarization (RNES) model. The RNES model learns to optimize coherence and\ninformative importance of the summary simultaneously. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed RNES outperforms existing baselines and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in term of ROUGE on CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The\nqualitative evaluation indicates that summaries produced by RNES are more\ncoherent and readable. \n\n"}

It is a powerful tool for\nstudying the limit behavior of large interacting systems, including mean field\ngames and systemic risk. It also appears naturally in stochastic control\nproblems with partial information and in time inconsistent problems. In this\npaper we propose a novel notion of viscosity solution for parabolic master\nequations, arising mainly from control problems, and establish its\nwellposedness. Our main innovation is to restrict the involved measures to\ncertain set of semimartingale measures which satisfy the desired compactness.\nAs an important example, we study the HJB master equation associated with the\ncontrol problems for McKean-Vlasov SDEs.

During training, no object bounding\nboxes are available, but the set of possible objects to be grounded is known\nbeforehand.

Our framework consists of a mechanism network that\ntakes an input distribution for training and outputs a mechanism, as well as a\nbuyer network that takes a mechanism as input and output an action.

It is known that, in\nsuperconductors with sign reversal gaps, non-magnetic impurities can break\nCooper pairs leading to the quasiparticle density of states in the\nsuperconducting state.

These galaxies vary mainly in mass and\nhence luminosity, spanning a range in luminosities from -16 to -22 magnitudes\nin the B band. We focus on the attenuation in different wavelength bands as a\nfunction of the disk inclination and the luminosity of the models, and compare\nthis to observations.\n  Observations suggest different metallicity gradients for galaxies of\ndifferent luminosities.
