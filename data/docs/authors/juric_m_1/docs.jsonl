The former type of outflow could be ejecta that is\nejected during the prompt phase of a GRB and consists of a series of baryonic\nshells with a distribution of Lorentz factors, and the latter type could be an\nelectron-positron-pair wind that is driven by the post-burst central engine. We\nhere provide a unified description for the dynamics of fireballs based on these\ntwo types of energy injection, and calculate the corresponding high-energy\nphoton emission by considering synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton\nscattering (including synchrotron self-Compton and combined inverse-Compton) of\nelectrons. We find that, in the two energy-injection models, there is a plateau\n(even a hump) in high-energy light curves during the X-ray shallow decay phase.\nIn particular, a considerable fraction of the injecting energy in the\nlepton-dominated model can be shared by the long-lasting reverse shock since it\nis relativistic. Furthermore, almost all of the energy of the reverse shock is\ncarried by leptons, and thus the inverse-Compton emission is enhanced\ndramatically. Therefore, this model predicts more significant high-energy\nafterglow emission than the baryon-dominated model. We argue that these\nobservational signatures would be used to discriminate between different\nenergy-injection models in the upcoming {\\em Gamma-ray Large Area Space\nTelescope} (GLAST) era. \n\n"}

We show how a broad class of gravity\ntheories can be tested by combining these probes. A robust way to interpret\nobservations is by constraining two key functions: the ratio of the two metric\npotentials, and the ratio of the Gravitational ``constant'' in the Poisson\nequation to Newton's constant. We also discuss quasilinear effects that carry\nsignatures of gravity, such as through induced three-point correlations.\n  Clustering of dark energy can mimic features of modified gravity theories and\nthus confuse the search for distinct signatures of such theories. It can\nproduce pressure perturbations and anisotropic stresses, which breaks the\nequality between the two metric potentials even in general relativity.

We use the Dark Energy Task\nForce (DETF) models of future data sets, and compare the discriminative power\nof experiments designated by the DETF as Stages 2, 3, and 4. Our work reveals a\nminimal increase in discriminating power when comparing Stage 3 to Stage 2, but\na very striking increase in discriminating power when going to Stage 4.

Here, we present systematic analysis of the\nlightcurve characteristics from X-ray to gamma-ray energy bands for the two\nprototypical LL-GRBs 980425 and 060218. It is found that both the pulse width\n($w$) and the ratio of the rising width to the decaying width ($r/d$) of theses\ntwo bursts are energy-dependent over a broad energy band. There exists a\nsignificant trend that the pulses tend to be narrower and more symmetry with\nrespect to the higher energy bands for the two events. Both the X-rays and the\ngamma-rays follow the same $w - E$ and $r/d - E$ relations. These facts may\nindicate that the X-ray emission tracks the gamma-ray emission and both are\nlikely to be originated from the same physical mechanism. Their light curves\nshow significant spectral lags. We calculate the three types of lags with the\npulse peaking time ($t_{peak}$), the pulse centroid time ($t_{cen}$), and the\ncross-correlation function (CCF). The derived $t_{peak}$ and $t_{cen}$ are a\npower-law function of energy. The lag calculated by CCF is strongly correlated\nwith that derived from $t_{peak}$. But the lag derived from $t_{cen}$ is less\ncorrelated with that derived from $t_{peak}$ and CCF. The energy dependence of\nthe lags is shallower at higher energy bands.

By\ncalculating the first-order variation of the entropy, subject to the mass- and\nenergy-conservation constraints, we obtain an entropy stationary equation.\nIncorporated with the Jeans equation, and by specifying some functional form\nfor the anisotropy parameter beta, we numerically solve the two equations, and\ndemonstrate that the velocity anisotropy parameter plays an important role to\nattain a density profile that is finite in mass, energy, and spatial extent. If\nincorporated again with some empirical density profile from simulations, our\ntheoretical predictions of the anisotropy parameter, and the radial\npseudo-phase-space density in the outer non-gravitationally degenerate region\nof the dark matter halo, agree rather well with the simulation data, and the\npredictions are also acceptable in the middle weak-degenerate region of the\ndark halo.

Abstract: We have observed the hard X-ray selected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy SWIFT\nJ2127.4+5654 with Suzaku. We report the detection of a broad relativistic iron\nemission line from the inner accretion disc. By assuming that the inner edge of\nthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of the\nblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spin\na= 0.6\\pm0.2. However, a non-rotating Schwarzschild spacetime is excluded at\njust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning Kerr black hole is\nexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. The intermediate spin we measure may indicate\nthat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds through\nshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the disc\nand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. The measured steep emissivity\nindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating X-ray source to be very centrally\nconcentrated. Light bending may help focus the primary emission towards the\ninnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. On the other\nhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the hole\nrotational energy is at work. If this is the case, the interplay between\naccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction\n(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,\nunder standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.\nRotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account for\nthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral\nanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

We show that contrary\nto earlier indications the accumulated data speak against this possibility.\nAnother method would be to use correlation between a distance dependent and a\ndistance independent variable to measure distance and determine cosmological\nparameters as is done using Cepheid variables and to some extent Type Ia\nsupernovae. Many papers have dealt with the use of so called Amati relation,\nfirst predicted by Lloyd, Petrosian and Mallozzi, or the Ghirlanda relation for\nthis purpose.

Here, we draw on a large suite of\nhigh resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, to systematically\ninvestigate this process and its dependence on the baryonic physics associated\nwith galaxy formation. The inclusion of baryons results in significantly more\nconcentrated density profiles if radiative cooling is efficient and feedback is\nweak.

However, astrophysical accretion disks are not razor-thin, it is\nuncertain whether the shear stress necessarily vanishes at the ISCO, and the\nmagnetic field, which is thought to drive turbulence in disks, may contain\nlarge-scale structures that do not behave like a simple local scalar viscosity.\nWe describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of accretion disks around black holes with a range of spin\nparameters, and we use the simulations to assess the validity of the NT model.\nOur fiducial initial magnetic field consists of multiple (alternating polarity)\npoloidal field loops whose shape is roughly isotropic in the disk in order to\nmatch the isotropic turbulence expected in the poloidal plane.

To improve\nthe characterization of planetary systems, we describe how aliases originate\nand present a new approach for distinguishing between orbital frequencies and\ntheir aliases. Our approach harnesses features in the spectral window function\nto compare the amplitude and phase of predicted aliases with peaks present in\nthe data. We apply it to confirm prior alias distinctions for the planets GJ\n876 d and HD 75898 b. We find that the true periods of Gl 581 d and HD 73526\nb/c remain ambiguous.

We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate\ntransformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal\ntime for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the big-bang, the\ncoordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping\nfrom DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We\npresent explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a\nscalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible\nin terms of elliptic integrals. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT\ncoordinates, recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub\nregion, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two\nNUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the\ncomplete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions\ncorrespond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates.

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters.

We\ninvestigate the effects of spatial variations of dust properties and the\ninfluence of embedded heating sources. Wrong assumptions of dust opacity and\nits spectral index beta can cause significant systematic errors in mass\nestimates. These are mainly multiplicative and leave the slope of the mass\nspectrum intact, unless cores with very high optical depth are included.\nTemperature variations bias colour temperature estimates and, in quiescent\ncores with optical depths higher than for normal stable cores, masses can be\nunderestimated by up to one order of magnitude. When heated by internal\nradiation sources the observations recover the true mass spectra. The shape,\nalthough not the position, of the mass spectrum is reliable against\nobservational errors and biases introduced in the analysis. This changes only\nif the cores have optical depths much higher than expected for basic\nhydrostatic equilibrium conditions. Observations underestimate the value of\nbeta whenever there are temperature variations along the line of sight. A bias\ncan also be observed when the true beta varies with wavelength.

(2008) published new Galactic 3D-models of magnetic\nfields in the disk and halo of the Milky Way and the distribution of cosmic-ray\nelectron density by taking into account the thermal electron density model\nNE2001 by Cordes & Lazio (2002, 2003). The models successfully reproduce\nobserved continuum and polarization all-sky maps and the distribution of\nrotation measures of extragalactic sources across the sky. However, the model\nparameters obtained for the Galactic halo, although reproducing the\nobservations, seem physically unreasonable: the magnetic field needs to be\nsignificantly stronger in the Galactic halo than in the plane and the\ncosmic-ray distribution must be truncated at about 1 kpc to avoid excessive\nsynchrotron emission from the halo. The reason for these unrealistic parameters\nwas the low scale-height of the warm thermal gas of about 1 kpc adapted in the\nNE2001 model. However, this scale-height seemed well settled by numerous\ninvestigations. Recently, the scale-height of the warm gas in the Galaxy was\nrevised by Gaensler et al. (2008) to about 1.8 kpc, by showing that the 1 kpc\nscale-height results from a systematic bias in the analysis of pulsar data.\nThis implies a higher thermal electron density in the Galactic halo, which in\nturn reduces the halo magnetic field strength to account for the observed\nrotation measures of extragalactic sources. We slightly modified the NE2001\nmodel for the new scale-height and revised the Sun et al. (2008) model\nparameters accordingly: the strength of the regular halo magnetic field is now\n2 microG or lower, and the physically unrealistic cutoff in z for the\ncosmic-ray electron density is removed.

In the second epoch, one velocity feature peaking at Vlsr=7491.1\nkm/s, redshifted by ~200 km/s relative to the systemic velocity, was detected\nonly toward the southern nucleus. The detection of an H2O maser feature at or\nnear this velocity had never been reported in earlier observations.

The two epochs of VLA observations\nshow that the maser intensity is variable on timescales of at least three\nmonths, while the correlation between the maser intensity and the radio\ncontinuum intensity is not certain from our data.

The partition of gas into different thermal components must itself\ndepend on the star formation rate, since a steady state distribution requires a\nbalance between heating (largely from stellar UV for the atomic component) and\ncooling. In this presentation, I discuss a simple thermal and dynamical\nequilibrium model for the star formation rate in disk galaxies, where the basic\ninputs are the total surface density of gas and the volume density of stars and\ndark matter, averaged over ~kpc scales. Galactic environment is important\nbecause the vertical gravity of the stars and dark matter compress gas toward\nthe midplane, helping to establish the pressure, and hence the cooling rate. In\nequilibrium, the star formation rate must evolve until the gas heating rate is\nhigh enough to balance this cooling rate and maintain the pressure imposed by\nthe local gravitational field.

For this purpose, we\nhave developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study\nthe formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and\nsedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K,\nFreytag et al. 2010).

This rule has been used in the construction of the new\nmodel atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, the\ndiffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of\ndepth.

It allows us to directly estimate the\ncluster's total mass from the integrated comptonization parameter Y, even for\ndistant clusters.

The naive expectation that the anisotropy amplitude scales as D(E) is\nshown to be an oversimplification which does not reflect in the predicted\nanisotropy for any realistic distribution of the sources. The fluctuations in\nthe anisotropy pattern are dominated by nearby sources, so that predicting or\nexplaining the observed anisotropy amplitude and phase becomes close to\nimpossible. We find however that the very weak energy dependence of the\nanisotropy amplitude below $10^{5}$ GeV and the rise at higher energies, can\nbest be explained if the diffusion coefficient is $D(E)\\sim E^{1/3}$. Faster\ndiffusion, for instance with $\\delta=0.6$, leads in general to an exceedingly\nlarge anisotropy amplitude. The spiral structure introduces interesting trends\nin the energy dependence of the anisotropy pattern, which qualitatively reflect\nthe trend seen in the data.

In the\nrapidly growing population of remnants with observationally determined masses,\na striking mass gap has emerged at the boundary between neutron stars and black\nholes. The heaviest neutron stars reach a maximum of two solar masses, while\nthe lightest black holes are at least five solar masses.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a\nconstant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account\nfor the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,\nas they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma. Comparing our model to\nthe observed luminosity-temperature relation, we discriminate between different\nM-c_vir relations: a weak dependence of c_vir on M is currently preferred by\ndata. This simple theoretical model accounts for much of the complexity of\nrecent, improved X-ray scaling relations, provided that we allow for a mild\ndependence of Gamma on M or for T_xi consistent with intercluster values.\n[abridged] \n\n"}

The environmental conditions in the GC - here taken to mean the inner\n200 pc in diameter of the Milky Way - are extreme with respect to those\ntypically encountered in the Galactic disk. The energy densities of the various\nGC ISM components are typically ~two orders of magnitude larger than those\nfound locally and the star-formation rate density ~three orders of magnitude\nlarger. Unusually within the Galaxy, the Galactic centre exhibits\nhard-spectrum, diffuse TeV (=10^12 eV) gamma-ray emission spatially coincident\nwith the region's molecular gas. Recently the nuclei of local star-burst\ngalaxies NGC 253 and M82 have also been detected in gamma-rays of such\nenergies. We have embarked on an extended campaign of modelling the broadband\n(radio continuum to TeV gamma-ray), non- thermal signals received from the\ninner 200 pc of the Galaxy.

In this work, we apply an analytic model that predicts the\nstructural properties of remnants formed in major mergers to progenitor disk\ngalaxies with properties taken from two different semi-analytic models. We\npredict the effective radius, velocity dispersion, luminosity, age, and\nmetallicity of the merger remnants, enabling us to compare directly to\nobservations of early-type galaxies. While we find a tight correlation between\nage and velocity dispersion, we find a stronger dependence of age and\nmetallicity on effective radius than observations report. The correlations\narise as a result of the dependence of gas fraction, age, and metallicity on\nthe stellar mass in the progenitor disk galaxies. These dependences induce a\nrotation in the radius-velocity plane between the correlations with effective\nradius and circular velocity in the disk galaxy progenitors, and the\ncorrelations with effective radius and velocity dispersion in the elliptical\ngalaxy remnants. The differences between our results and those from\nobservations suggest that major mergers alone cannot produce the observed lack\nof correlation between effective radius and stellar population parameters.\nSimulations have suggested that subsequent minor mergers introduce scatter in\nthe effective radius while leaving the velocity dispersion essentially\nunchanged.

Using the\nassociation of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the death of massive stars\nand their ultra-luminous nature, the CSFH can be probed to higher redshifts\nthan current conventional methods. Unfortunately, no consensus has been reached\non the manner in which the LGRB rate (LGRBR) traces the CSFH, leaving many of\nthe questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. Observations by the\nGRB NIR detector (GROND) over the past 4 years have, for the first time,\nacquired highly complete LGRB samples. Driven by these completeness levels and\nnew evidence of LGRBs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxies\nthan previously thought, the possible biases of the LGRBR-CSFH connection are\ninvestigated over a large range of galaxy properties. The CSFH is modelled\nusing empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formation\nrates. Biasing the CSFH by metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and other\nunknown redshift dependencies, a LGRBR is generated and compared to the highly\ncomplete GROND sample. It is found that there is no strong preference for a\nmetallicity cut or fixed galaxy mass boundaries and that there are no unknown\nredshift effects, in contrast to previous work which suggest values of\nZ/Z_sun~0.1-0.3. From the best-fit models, we predict that ~1.2% of the LGRB\nburst sample exists above z=6. The linear relationship between the LGRBR and\nthe CSFH suggested by our results implies that redshift biases present in\nprevious LGRB samples significantly affect the inferred dependencies of LGRBs\non their host galaxy properties. Such biases can lead to, e.g., an\ninterpretation of metallicity limitations and evolving LGRB luminosity\nfunctions. \n\n"}

It has been extensively observed with ground based\ntelescopes and within the WISH Guaranteed Time Herschel Key Program. We present\nnew observations of the C18O 3-2 and the HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} lines towards NGC\n7129 FIRS 2. Combining these observations with Herschel data and modeling their\nemissions, we constrain the C18O and HDO abundance profiles across the\nprotostellar envelope. In particular, we derive the abundance of C18O and HDO\nin the hot core. The intensities of the C18O lines are well reproduced assuming\nthat the C18O abundance decreases through the protostellar envelope from the\nouter edge towards the centre until the point where the gas and dust reach the\nCO evaporation temperature (~20-25 K) where the C18O is released back to the\ngas phase. Once the C18O is released to the gas phase, the modelled C18O\nabundance is found to be ~1.6x10^{-8}, which is a factor of 10 lower than the\nreference abundance. This result is supported by the non-detection of C18O 9-8,\nwhich proves that even in the hot core (T_k>100 K) the CO abundance must be 10\ntimes lower than the reference value. Several scenarios are discussed to\nexplain this C18O deficiency. One possible explanation is that during the\npre-stellar and protostellar phase, the CO is removed from the grain mantles by\nreactions to form more complex molecules. Our HDO modeling shows that the\nemission of HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} line is maser and comes from the hot core\n(T_k>100 K). Assuming the physical structure derived by Crimier et al.

Abstract: The scale-dependent galaxy bias generated by primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG)\ncan be used to detect and constrain deviations from standard single-field\ninflation. The strongest signal is expected in the local model for PNG, where\nthe amplitude of non-Gaussianity can be expressed by a set of parameters (fnl,\ngnl, ...). Current observational constraints from galaxy clustering on fnl and\ngnl assume that the others PNG parameters are vanishing. Using two sets of\ncosmological N-body simulations where both fnl and gnl are non-zero, we show\nthat this strong assumption generally leads to biased estimates and spurious\nredshift dependencies of the parameters. Additionally, if the signs of fnl and\ngnl are opposite, the amplitude of the scale-dependent bias is reduced,\npossibly leading to a false null detection. Finally we show that model\nselection techniques like the Bayesian evidence can (and should) be used to\ndetermine if more than one PNG parameter is required by the data. \n\n"}

We use deep HST images to construct CMDs, from which we\nselect stellar populations that trace different evolutionary phases in order to\nconstrain their range of ages and metallicities, as well as to examine their\nspatial distribution. In addition, we use the resolved stars in the RGB in\norder to derive photometric metallicities. All studied dwarfs contain\nintermediate-age stars with ages of ~1Gyr and older as traced by the luminous\nasymptotic giant branch and red clump stars, while the transition-type dwarfs\ncontain also stars younger than ~1Gyr as traced by a young main sequence and\nvertical red clump stars. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the stars that\ntrace different evolutionary phases shows a population gradient in all\ntransition-type dwarfs. The derived error-weighted mean metallicities, assuming\npurely old stellar populations, range from -1.5dex for ESO294-G010 to -1.9dex\nfor Scl-dE1, and should be considered as lower limits to their true\nmetallicities.

Measurement of these delay variations is not\nonly crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides an\nunparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. In\nthis paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independent\nred-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion can\nattenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. We present a robust\nmethod for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply it\nto observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Correction for dispersion\nvariations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. We discuss\nscheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such as\nscintillation, that can exacerbate the problem. Comparison with scintillation\nmeasurements confirms previous results that the spectral exponent of electron\ndensity variations in the interstellar medium often appears steeper than\nexpected.

I:\n  Hydrodynamics Abstract: We use 3D hydrodynamical models to investigate the effects of massive star\nfeedback from winds and supernovae on inhomogeneous molecular material left\nover from the formation of a massive stellar cluster. We simulate the\ninteraction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with 3 O-stars into a\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 solar masses of molecular\nmaterial within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular\nclump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is\nentrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly\nresistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other\ndense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is\ngradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in\nexcess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per\ncent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the\ndifference being radiated. After 4.4 Myr, the massive stars in our simulation\nbegin to explode as supernovae. The highly structured environment into which\nthe SN energy is released allows even weaker coupling to the remaining dense\nmaterial and practically all of the SN energy reaches the wider environment.\nThe molecular material is almost completely dispersed and destroyed after 6\nMyr. The escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be about 50 per\ncent during the first 4 Myr of the cluster's life.

Here we show that\nType I LGRBs (LGRBs I) exhibit different shapes of light curves from Type II\nLGRBs (LGRBs II). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this classification has\nuncovered a new scaling law in the light curves of LGRBs II spanning 8 orders\nof magnitude from the prompt to late X-ray afterglow emission.

A single set of contemporaneous images is explored in\ndetail, along with prefatory consideration for time evolution using only the\n171 A data.

The AIA data show four stages of oxygen\nionization (O III - O VI) along with C IV, while XRT likely captured emission\nfrom O VII, a line typical of the corona.

The perils of such a\nsearch may have appeared insurmountable when considering the coarse ring-shaped\nGW localizations spanning thousands of deg^2 using time-of-arrival information\nalone.

Such a remnant has been proposed as an\nexplanation for the late X-ray emission observed following some short duration\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as possible electromagnetic counterparts to the\ngravitational wave chirp. A stable NS merger remnant necessarily possesses a\nlarge rotational energy > 1e52 erg, the majority of which is ultimately\ndeposited into the surrounding circumburst medium (CBM) at mildly relativistic\nvelocities. We present Very Large Array radio observations of 7 short GRBs,\nsome of which possessed temporally extended X-ray emission, on timescales of\n~1-3 years following the initial burst.

In each a well-defined measure of complexity fluctuates but grows\nirreversibly between rising bounds from that point.

All-sky model of thermal dust emission Abstract: This paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the Planck 857,\n545 and 353 GHz, and IRAS 100 micron data. Using a modified black-body fit to\nthe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and\nspectral index over the 353-3000 GHz range. This model is a tight\nrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. It shows variations of the order of 30\n% compared with the widely-used model of Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel. The\nPlanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole\nsky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to\nprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. An\nincrease of the dust opacity at 353 GHz, tau_353/N_H, from the diffuse to the\ndenser interstellar medium (ISM) is reported. It is associated with a decrease\nin the observed dust temperature, T_obs, that could be due at least in part to\nthe increased dust opacity. We also report an excess of dust emission at HI\ncolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust in\nthe warm ionized medium. In the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitude, we\nreport an anti-correlation between tau_353/N_H and T_obs while the dust\nspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency\n(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. The implication is that\nin the diffuse high-latitude ISM tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dust\ncolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlation\nof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements on\nstars is strong. To estimate Galactic E(B-V) in extragalactic fields at high\nlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead of\nthe dust optical depth, calibrated to E(B-V) using reddening measurements of\nquasars deduced from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. \n\n"}

These coherent structures are observed at\nthe peak of the energy dissipation rate and are the carriers of long-range\ncorrelations despite all the non-linear interactions during the formation of\nturbulence. Even though the largest scale separation has been achieved at this\npoint, these structures are coherent with a size that spans our computational\ndomain dominating the scaling of the energy spectrum, which follows a $E\n\\propto k^{-2}$ power law. As Reynolds number increases curling of the current\nsheets, due to Kelvin-Helmhotlz type instabilities and reconnection, modifies\nthe scaling of the energy spectrum from $k^{-2}$ towards $k^{-5/3}$.

We use GALEX, XMM\nOptical Monitor, and HST data to explore the UV attenuation in the outer parts\nof spiral disks which are backlit by other UV-bright galaxies, starting with\ncandidates provided by Galaxy Zoo participants. Our analysis incorporates\ngalaxy symmetry, using non-overlapping regions of each galaxy to derive error\nestimates on the attenuation measurements. The entire sample has an attenuation\nlaw close to the Calzetti et al. (1994) form; the UV slope for the overall\nsample is substantially shallower than found by Wild et al.

Using high-resolution 3D plasma simulations, we study the statistics\nof the velocity field and its relation with the thermodynamic perturbations.\nThe normalization of the ICM spectrum (density, entropy, or pressure) is\nlinearly tied to the level of large-scale motions, which excite both gravity\nand sound waves due to stratification. For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity\nwaves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially tangential\nturbulence. For M>0.5, sound waves start to significantly contribute, passing\nthe leading role to compressive pressure fluctuations, associated with\nisotropic (or slightly radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations\nare then characterized by the dominant process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic\n(high M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters reside in the\nintermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence\ndrifting towards isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the regime,\nthe variance of density perturbations is comparable to the 1D Mach number. This\nlinear relation allows to easily convert between gas motions and ICM\nperturbations, which can be exploited by Chandra, XMM data and by the\nforthcoming Astro-H.

Observations were conducted with\nthe Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 16 cm wavelength, with an rms\nsensitivity better than 0.05 mJy/beam in each field.

We then investigate the possibility that point-sources detected in\nthe proximity of the dSph optical center might be due to the emission from a DM\ncuspy profile.

Overall, extant synthetic\nfluxes predict quite realistic broad-band colours and bolometric corrections,\nespecially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the\npredictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of\nhydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free\nparameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)\nchanges for different values of [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]; in particular, how\nsuitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch\nand lower main sequence populations with different [alpha/Fe], due to the\nconcomitant loops and swings in the CMD.

We use a well-defined and homogeneous sample of spiral host galaxies\nof 692 SNe from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in different stages of\ngalaxy-galaxy interaction and activity classes of nucleus. We propose that the\nunderlying mechanisms shaping the number ratios of SNe types can be interpreted\nwithin the framework of interaction-induced star formation, in addition to the\nknown relations between morphologies and stellar populations. We find a strong\ntrend in behaviour of the NIa/NCC ratio depending on host morphology, such that\nearly spirals include more Type Ia SNe. The NIbc/NII ratio is higher in a broad\nbin of early-type hosts. The NIa/NCC ratio is nearly constant when changing\nfrom normal, perturbed to interacting galaxies, then declines in merging\ngalaxies, whereas it jumps to the highest value in post-merging/remnant\ngalaxies. In contrast, the NIbc/NII ratio jumps to the highest value in merging\ngalaxies and slightly declines in post-merging/remnant subsample. The\ninterpretation is that the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies,\nwhich are strongly affected in the final stages of interaction, have an impact\non the number ratios of SNe types.

Stellar masses are obtained by SED fitting\non 5-band photometric data obtained at the Subaru telescope. We identify 1363\ncluster members down to a stellar mass of 10^9.5 Msolar. Results. The whole\ncluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster\nSF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population\nhas a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50\nMpc), highest density cluster region, than in more external, lower density\nregions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant galaxies is maximum in this\ninnermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently increases\nagain toward the cluster outskirts.

Interpretation of the data hinges critically on\ncorrectly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light\ncurves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need\nto explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent\nsystematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse\ndepths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented\nhere exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of\nUCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we\nachieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that\nis inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements.

The HeViCS\ncatalogs contain about 52000, 42200, and 18700 sources selected at 250, 350,\nand 500 micron above 3sigma and are ~ 75%, 62%, and 50% complete at flux\ndensities of 20 mJy at 250, 350, 500 micron, respectively. We then measured\nsource number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron and we also cross-correlated\nthe catalogs with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the redshift\ndistribution of the nearby sources. From this cross-correlation, we select\n~2000 sources with reliable fluxes and a high signal-to-noise ratio, finding an\naverage redshift z~0.3+/-0.22. The number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron\nshow an increase in the slope below 200 mJy, indicating a strong evolution in\nnumber of density for galaxies at these fluxes. In general, models tend to\noverpredict the counts at brighter flux densities, underlying the importance of\nstudying the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution to refine\nthe theoretical recipes of the models. Our iterative method for source\nidentification allowed the detection of a family of 500 micron sources that are\nnot foreground objects belonging to Virgo and not found in other catalogs. \n\n"}

The luminosity\ndistribution of galaxies in populous voids follows the same distribution\nobserved across the SDSS survey in the same redshift range.

As we\ndemonstrate in this paper, all conventional difficulties may, however, be\novercome if the generation of the D-term is based on strong dynamics. To\nillustrate our idea, we focus on a certain class of vector-like SUSY breaking\nmodels that enjoy a minimal particle content and which may be easily embedded\ninto more complete scenarios. We are then able to show that, upon gauging a\nglobal flavor symmetry, an appropriate choice of Yukawa couplings readily\nallows to dynamically generate a D-term at an almost arbitrary energy scale.\nThis includes in particular the natural and consistent realization of D-terms\naround, above and below the scale of grand unification in supergravity, without\nthe need for fine-tuning of any model parameters.

An existing observational bias strongly favours\nthe detection of ETNOs with arguments of perihelion close to 0 degrees and 180\ndegrees yet no objects have been found at 180 degrees. No plausible explanation\nhas been offered so far to account for this unusual pattern. Here, we study the\ndynamical evolution of comet 96P/Machholz 1, a bizarre near-Earth object (NEO)\nthat may provide the key to explain the puzzling clustering of orbits around\nargument of perihelion close to 0 degrees recently found for the population of\nETNOs. Comet 96P/Machholz 1 is currently locked in a Kozai resonance with\nJupiter such that the value of its argument of perihelion is always close to 0\ndegrees at its shortest possible perihelion (highest eccentricity and lowest\ninclination) and about 180 degrees near its shortest aphelion (longest\nperihelion distance, lowest eccentricity and highest inclination). If this\nobject is a dynamical analogue (albeit limited) of the known ETNOs, this\nimplies that massive perturbers must keep them confined in orbital parameter\nspace. Besides, its future dynamical evolution displays orbital flips when its\neccentricity is excited to a high value and its orbit turns over by nearly 180\ndegrees, rolling over its major axis.

Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational\namplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their\nprojected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational\namplitudes of the Kepler KOIs with those of Kepler single stars can provide a\nmeasure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of\nKepler planets. We apply this technique to the large samples of 993 KOIs and\n33,614 single Kepler stars in temperature range of 3500-6500 K. We find with\nhigh significance that the amplitudes of cool KOIs are larger, on the order of\n10%, than those of the single stars. In contrast, the amplitudes of hot KOIs\nare systematically lower. After correcting for an observational bias, we\nestimate that the amplitudes of the hot KOIs are smaller than the single stars\nby about the same factor of 10%. The border line between the relatively larger\nand smaller amplitudes, relative to the amplitudes of the single stars, occurs\nat about 6000K. Our results suggest that the cool stars have their planets\naligned with their stellar rotation, while the planets around hot stars have\nlarge obliquities, consistent with the findings of Winn et al.

Using\nthis sample of clusters we set an empirical limit on the amount of scatter in\nICL surface brightness profiles of such clusters at z=0.5 and constrain the\nprogenitor population and formation mechanism of the ICL by measuring the ICL\nsurface brightness profile, the ICL color and color gradient, and the total ICL\nluminosity within 10<r<110 kpc. The observed scatter is physical, which we\nassociate with differences in ICL assembly process, formation epoch, and/or ICL\ncontent. Using stellar population synthesis models we transform the observed\ncolors to metallicity. For three of the four clusters we find clear negative\ngradients that, on average, decrease from super solar in the central regions of\nthe BCG to sub-solar in the ICL. Such negative color/metallicity gradients can\narise from tidal stripping of L* galaxies and/or the disruption of dwarf\ngalaxies, but not major mergers with the BCG.

The AKARI performed an all sky\nsurvey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160$\\mu$m) with 3-10 times better\nsensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak\nof the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can\nmeasure the total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies much\nmore precisely, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density of the local\nUniverse. In the AKARI NEP deep field, we construct restframe 8$\\mu$m,\n12$\\mu$m, and total infrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2\nusing 4128 infrared sources. A continuous filter coverage in the mid-IR\nwavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 24$\\mu$m) by the AKARI\nsatellite allows us to estimate restframe 8$\\mu$m and 12$\\mu$m luminosities\nwithout using a large extrapolation based on a SED fit, which was the largest\nuncertainty in previous work. By combining these two results, we reveal\ndust-hidden cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution from $z$=0 to\n$z$=2.2, all probed by the AKARI satellite. The next generation space infrared\ntelescope, SPICA, will revolutionize our view of the infrared Universe with\nsuperb sensitivity of the cooled 3m space telescope.

The model includes the mixing of heavy elements (metals)\nejected by the supernova and their contribution to radiative losses. The\ninteraction of the supernova envelope with the cloudy phase of the interstellar\nmedium leads to nonsimultaneous, and on average earlier, onsets of the\nradiative phase in different parts of the supernova envelope. Growth in the\nvolume filling factor $f$ leads to a decrease in the time for the transition of\nthe envelope to the radiative phase and a decrease in the envelope's mean\nradius, due to the increased energy losses by the envelope in the cloudy\nmedium. When the development of hydrodynamical instabilities in the supernova\nenvelope is efficient, the thermal energy falls as $E_t\\sim t^{-2.3}$, for the\npropagation of the supernova remnant through either a homogeneous or a cloudy\nmedium.

Thus, the interaction of the supernova envelope with the\ncloudy interstellar medium appreciably changes the dynamics and structure of\nthe distribution of the gas in the remnant. This affects the observational\ncharacteristics of the remnant, in particularly, leading to substantial\nfluctuations of the emission measure of the gas with $T>10^5$~K and the\nvelocity dispersion of the ionized gas. \n\n"}

The\nfate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation\nstar formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al.

We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]\nemission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted\nsynthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense\nshell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities\nthat are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a\ndense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good\ntracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the\nbrightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial\nvelocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest\nemission at zero radial velocity.

SN 2012ca is a member\nof the set of type of the ambiguous IIn/Ia-CSM SNe, the nature of which have\nbeen debated extensively in the literature. The two leading scenarios are\neither a type Ia SN exploding within a dense CSM from a non-degenerate, evolved\ncompanion, or a core-collapse SN from a massive star. While some members of the\npopulation have been unequivocally associated with type Ia SNe, in other cases\nthe association is less certain. While it is possible that SN 2012ca does arise\nfrom a thermonuclear SN, this would require a relatively high (between 20 and\n70 per cent) efficiency in converting kinetic energy to optical luminosity, and\na massive (~2.3-2.6 Msun) circumstellar medium. On the basis of energetics, and\nthe results of simple modelling, we suggest that SN 2012ca is more likely\nassociated with a core-collapse SN. This would imply that the observed set of\nsimilar SNe to SN 2012ca is in fact originated by two populations, and while\nthese are drawn from physically distinct channels, they can have\nobservationally similar properties. \n\n"}

The latter implies that the star formation\nrate increases systematically during the early stages of evolution, and occurs\nvia filamentary flows onto \"hubs\" of higher density, mass, and velocity\ndispersion, and culminates a few Myr after than the small-scale collapses have\nstarted to form stars.

We say that a habitable planet has resilient habitability if it\nis able to avoid ejections and collisions and its orbit remains inside the\nhabitable zone. Here we model the orbital evolution of rocky planets in\nplanetary systems where giant planets become dynamically unstable. We measure\nthe resilience of habitable planets as a function of the observed, present-day\nmasses and orbits of the giant planets. We find that the survival rate of\nhabitable planets depends strongly on the giant planet architecture.

This correlation, if confirmed, points towards the idea\nthat relativistic jets may be powered by the rotational energy of black holes.\nIn order to examine this further, we perform general-relativistic radiative\ntransport calculations on magnetically arrested accretion flows, which are\nknown to produce powerful jets via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We find\nthat the X-ray and gamma-ray emission strongly depend on spin and inclination\nangle.

Such observers see\ndeeper into the hot, dense, highly-magnetized inner disk region. This effect is\nlargest for rapidly rotating black holes due to a combination of frame dragging\nand decreasing horizon radius. While the X-ray emission is dominated by the\nnear horizon region, the near-infrared radiation originates at larger radii.\nTherefore, the ratio of X-ray to near-infrared power is an observational\nsignature of black hole spin. \n\n"}

The evolution of barred galaxies is much more irregular, especially at\nhigh stellar masses. In these galaxies, the bar drives a substantial amount of\ngas toward the centre, resulting in a high SFR, and producing a starburst in\nthe most massive galaxies. Most of the gas is converted into stars, and gas\nexhaustion leads to a rapid drop of star formation after the starburst. In\nmassive barred galaxies (stellar mass M* > 2x10^10 Msun) the large amount of\ngas funnelled toward the centre is completely consumed by the starburst, while\nin lower-mass barred galaxies it is only partially consumed. Gas concentration\nis thus higher in lower-mass barred galaxies than it is in higher-mass ones.\nEven though unbarred galaxies funnelled less gas toward their centre, the lower\nSFR allows this gas to accumulate. At late times, the star formation efficiency\nis higher in barred galaxies than unbarred ones, enabling these galaxies to\nmaintain a higher SFR with a smaller gas supply. Several properties, such as\nthe global SFR, central SFR, or central gas concentration, vary monotonically\nwith time for unbarred galaxies, but not for barred galaxies.

Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a\ndistinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.\nWe demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural\noutcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical\nsignificance, but that the quiescent population requires additional\nastrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution\nbased on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local\ngalaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the\nevolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the\ndepletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The\nquiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas\nhas fallen below a threshold for disk stability.

Considering the type of cloud core where a globular cluster might\nhave formed, we follow the evolution and enrichment of the gas and the time\ndependence of stellar mass. A key assumption is that interactions between\nmassive stars are important at high density, including interactions between\nmassive stars and massive star binaries that can shred stellar envelopes.\nMassive-star interactions should also scatter low-mass stars out of the\ncluster. Reasonable agreement with the observations is obtained for a cloud\ncore mass of ~4x10^6 M_sun and a density of ~2x10^6 cm^{-3}. The results depend\nprimarily on a few dimensionless parameters, including, most importantly, the\nratio of the gas consumption time to the lifetime of a massive star, which has\nto be low, ~10%, and the efficiency of scattering low-mass stars per unit\ndynamical time, which has to be relatively large, such as a few percent. Also\nfor these conditions, the velocity dispersions of embedded globular clusters\nshould be comparable to the high gas dispersions of galaxies at that time, so\nthat stellar ejection by multi-star interactions could cause low-mass stars to\nleave a dwarf galaxy host altogether.

Incorporating anisotropic thermal conduction requires to\nalso treat parabolic terms arising from the diffusion operator. An explicit\ntreatment of parabolic terms will considerably reduce the simulation time step\ndue to its dependence on the square of the grid resolution ($\\Delta x$) for\nstability. Although an implicit scheme relaxes the constraint on stability, it\nis difficult to distribute efficiently on a parallel architecture. Treating\nparabolic terms with accelerated super-time stepping (STS) methods has been\ndiscussed in literature but these methods suffer from poor accuracy (first\norder in time) and also have difficult-to-choose tuneable stability parameters.\nIn this work we highlight a second order (in time) Runge Kutta Legendre (RKL)\nscheme (first described by Meyer et. al. 2012) that is robust, fast and\naccurate in treating parabolic terms alongside the hyperbolic conversation\nlaws. We demonstrate its superiority over the first order super time stepping\nschemes with standard tests and astrophysical applications.

The plasma in these environments is often so hot that\nsynchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) radiative cooling becomes important. In\nthis paper we investigate the general thermodynamic and radiative properties\n(and hence the observational appearance) of an optically thin relativistically\nhot plasma stirred by driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and cooled by\nradiation. We find that if the system reaches a statistical equilibrium where\nturbulent heating is balanced by radiative cooling, the effective electron\ntemperature tends to attain a universal value $\\theta = kT_e/m_e c^2 \\sim\n1/\\sqrt{\\tau_T}$, where $\\tau_T=n_e\\sigma_T L \\ll 1$ is the system's Thomson\noptical depth, essentially independent of the strength of turbulent driving or\nmagnetic field. This is because both MHD turbulent dissipation and synchrotron\ncooling are proportional to the magnetic energy density. We also find that\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) cooling and perhaps a few higher-order IC\ncomponents are automatically comparable to synchrotron in this regime. The\noverall broadband radiation spectrum then consists of several distinct\ncomponents (synchrotron, SSC, etc.), well separated in photon energy (by a\nfactor $\\sim \\tau_T^{-1}$) and roughly equal in power.

Various physical variables have different\ncorrelation lengths in the warm phase: $40 pc$, $50 pc$, and $60 pc$ for random\nmagnetic field, density, and velocity, respectively, in the midplane. The\ncorrelation time of the random velocity is comparable to the eddy turnover\ntime, about $10^7 yr$, although it may be shorter in regions with higher star\nformation rate. The random magnetic field is anisotropic, with the standard\ndeviations of its components $b_x/b_y/b_z$ having approximate ratios\n$0.5/0.6/0.6$ in the midplane. The anisotropy is attributed to the global\nvelocity shear from galactic differential rotation, and locally inhomogeneous\noutflow to the galactic halo.

One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU\nOri-type stars (FUors) are thought to be the visible examples for objects in\nthe high accretion state. FUors are often surrounded by massive envelopes,\nwhich replenish the disk material and enable the disk to produce accretion\noutbursts. However, we have insufficient information on the envelope dynamics\nin FUors, about where and how mass transfer from the envelope to the disk\nhappens. Here we present ALMA observations of the FUor-type star V346 Nor at\n1.3 mm continuum and in different CO rotational lines. We mapped the density\nand velocity structure of its envelope and analyze the results using channel\nmaps, position-velocity diagrams, and spectro-astrometric methods. We found\nthat V346 Nor is surrounded by gaseous material on 10000 au scale in which a\nprominent outflow cavity is carved. Within the central $\\sim$700 au, the\ncircumstellar matter forms a flattened pseudo-disk where material is infalling\nwith conserved angular momentum. Within $\\sim$350 au, the velocity profile is\nmore consistent with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 0.1\n$M_{\\odot}$.

Using\n  exoplanet transits to analyze 3-D stellar atmospheres Abstract: CONTEXT: High-precision stellar analyses require hydrodynamic modeling to\ninterpret chemical abundances or oscillation modes. Exoplanet atmosphere\nstudies require stellar background spectra to be known along the transit path\nwhile detection of Earth analogs require stellar microvariability to be\nunderstood. Hydrodynamic 3-D models can be computed for widely different stars\nbut have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface\nfeatures. Model predictions include spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and\nwavelength shifts, and their center-to-limb changes across stellar disks. AIMS:\nTo observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly\nresolved stellar surfaces, which are free from the effects of spatial smearing\nand rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to\nsynthetic profiles from 3-D models. METHODS: During exoplanet transits,\nsuccessive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy\nbetween various transit phases provides spectra of small surface segments\ntemporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1% of\nany main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very\nprecise observations. Realistically measurable quantities are identified\nthrough simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines. RESULTS: In normal\nstars, line profile ratios between various transit phases may vary by some\n0.5%, requiring S/N ratios of 5,000 or more for meaningful spectral\nreconstruction. While not yet realistic for individual spectral lines, this is\nachievable for cool stars by averaging over numerous lines with similar\nparameters. CONCLUSIONS: For bright host stars of large transiting planets,\nspatially resolved spectroscopy is currently practical. More observable targets\nare likely to be found in the near future by ongoing photometric searches. \n\n"}

We use a set of\nhydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in\ncollapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host\nprotostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without\nradiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic\nfeedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface\ndensity and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas\nfrom the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of\nspiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative\nfeedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is\nepisodic. We also investigate whether mass estimates from position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams are accurate for early-phase discs. We find that the protostellar\nsystem mass (i.e. the mass of the protostar and its disc) is underestimated by\nup to 20%, due to the impact of an enhanced radial pressure gradient on the\ngas. The mass of early-phase discs is a significant fraction of the mass of the\nprotostar, so position-velocity diagrams cannot accurately provide the mass of\nthe protostar alone. The enhanced radial pressure gradient expected in young\ndiscs may lead to an increased rate of dust depletion due to gas drag, and\ntherefore to a reduced dust-to-gas ratio. \n\n"}

IGR J14488-5942 and AX J1700.2-4220 show strong modulation at\nperiods of 49.6 and 44 days, respectively, which are interpreted as orbital\nperiods of Be star systems.

The strongest peak in the power spectrum is at a period\nnear 150 days, but this conflicts with a determination of a period of 118.5\ndays by La Parola et al. (2014).

Abstract: The cause of hot Jupiter radius inflation, where giant planets with $T_{\\rm\neq}$ $>1000$ K are significantly larger than expected, is an open question and\nthe subject of many proposed explanations. Rather than examine these models\nindividually, this work seeks to characterize the anomalous heating as a\nfunction of incident flux, $\\epsilon(F)$, needed to inflate the population of\nplanets to their observed sizes. We then compare that result to theoretical\npredictions for various models. We examine the population of about 300 giant\nplanets with well-determined masses and radii and apply thermal evolution and\nBayesian statistical models to infer the anomalous power as a function of\nincident flux that best reproduces the observed radii. First, we observe that\nthe inflation of planets below about $M=0.5 \\;\\rm{M}_\\rm{J}$ appears very\ndifferent than their higher mass counterparts, perhaps as the result of mass\nloss or an inefficient heating mechanism. As such, we exclude planets below\nthis threshold.

On a GPU, GALARIO is 150 faster\nthan standard Python and 10 times faster than serial C++ code on a CPU. Highly\nmodular, easy to use and to adopt in existing code, GALARIO comes as two\ncompiled libraries, one for Nvidia GPUs and one for multicore CPUs, where both\nhave the same functions with identical interfaces. GALARIO comes with Python\nbindings but can also be directly used in C or C++. The versatility and the\nspeed of GALARIO open new analysis pathways that otherwise would be\nprohibitively time consuming, e.g. fitting high resolution observations of\nlarge number of objects, or entire spectral cubes of molecular gas emission. It\nis a general tool that can be applied to any field that uses radio\ninterferometer observations.

We do not consider sophisticated dust evolution models,\nrestricting ourselves with the standard astrochemical assumption of $0.1~\\mu $m\ndust. We find that CO is indeed the best molecular tracer for total gas mass,\ndespite the fact that it is not the main carbon carrier, provided reasonable\nassumptions about CO abundance in the disk are used.

In the\ngreen valley we find sSFR profiles that are suppressed with respect to\nstar-forming galaxies of the same mass at all galactocentric distances out to 2\neffective radii.

We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large\nsample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC\ndefinitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the\nextremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the\ncriteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the\nCC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed\nfractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result\nis partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed\ngas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative\nagreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the\nsimulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs\nappears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the\nfraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are\nmore relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting\nCCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC\ncriteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is\ndependent on the CC criteria. We conclude that the thermodynamic structure of\ngalaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG shares many similarities with observations, but\nachieving better agreement most likely requires modifications of the underlying\ngalaxy formation model. \n\n"}

Developing the weak field\napproximation, we find that the here derived equation of motion corresponding\nto Newton's equation also contains a small outwards acceleration term. The new\nterm is particularly significant for very low density systems.\n  A modified virial theorem is derived and applied to clusters of galaxies. For\nthe Coma and Abell 2029 clusters, the dynamical masses are about a factor of 5\nto 10 smaller than in the standard case. This tends to let no room for dark\nmatter in these clusters. Then, the two-body problem is studied and an equation\ncorresponding to the Binet equation is obtained. The results are applied to the\nrotation curve of the outer layers of the Milky Way.

By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity.

The presence of the\nSagittarius (Sgr) stream in the HSC fields produces a notable excess of stars\nat the apocentre of the leading arm (~50-60 kpc).

The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears as the best\nparametrisation by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra\nof brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. In particular, it reproduces the\nL-T transition, due to the condensation of silicate and iron clouds below the\nvisible/near-IR photosphere. It also reproduces the reddening observed for\nlow-gravity objects, due to an increase of cloud optical depth for low gravity.\nIn addition, we found that the cloud greenhouse effect shifts chemical\nequilibriums, increasing the abundances of species stable at high temperature.\nThis effect should significantly contribute to the strong variation of methane\nabundance at the L-T transition and to the methane depletion observed on young\nexoplanets.

It has been suggested\nthat the strength of the low-ionization lines, R_2, N_2, and S_2 may be\nincreased (relative to Balmer lines) in (some) spaxel spectra of the MaNGA\nsurvey due to a contribution of the radiation of the diffuse ionized gas.\nConsequently, the abundances derived from the spaxel spectra through\nstrong-line methods may suffer from large errors. We examined this expectation\nby comparing the behaviour of the line intensities and the abundances estimated\nthrough different calibrations for slit spectra of HII regions in nearby\ngalaxies, for fibre spectra from the SDSS, and for spaxel spectra of the MaNGA\nsurvey. We found that the S_2 strength is increased significantly in the fibre\nand spaxel spectra. The mean enhancement changes with metallicity and can be as\nlarge as a factor of 2. The mean distortion of R_2 and N_2 is less than a\nfactor of 1.3. This suggests that Kaufmann et al.'s demarcation line between\nAGNs and HII regions in the BPT diagram is a useful criterion to reject spectra\nwith significantly distorted strengths of the N_2 and R_2 lines. We find that\nthe three-dimensional R calibration, which uses the N_2 and R_2 lines, produces\nreliable abundances in the MaNGA galaxies. The one-dimensional N2 calibration\nproduces either reliable or wrong abundances depending on whether excitation\nand N/O abundance ratio in the target region (spaxel) are close to or differ\nfrom those parameters in the calibrating points located close to the\ncalibration relation.

The MCs are formed self-consistently within their\nlarge-scale galactic environment following the non-equilibrium formation of\nH$_2$ and CO including (self-) shielding and important heating and cooling\nprocesses. The MCs inherit their initial level of turbulence from the diffuse\nISM, where turbulence is injected by SN explosions. However, by systematically\nexploring the effect of individual SNe going off outside the clouds, we show\nthat at later stages the importance of SN driven turbulence is decreased\nsignificantly. This holds for different MC masses as well as MCs with and\nwithout magnetic fields. The SN impact also decreases rapidly with larger\ndistances.

Both PAH/TIR\nand dust-to-burst stellar mass ratios are seen to decrease with post-burst age,\nindicative of the accumulating effects of dust destruction and an incipient\ntransition to hot, early-type ISM properties.

Most of the earlier explanations for the\n\"paradox\" appealed to SNR environmental factors, such as inhomogeneous $p$/He\nmixes in the shock upstream medium, variable ionization states of He, or a\nmulti-SNR origin of the observed spectra.

In this paper, we show by self-consistent hybrid\nsimulations that such special conditions are not vital for the explanation of\nthe cosmic ray rigidity spectra. In particular, our simulations prove that an\nSNR shock can modify the chemical composition of accelerated cosmic rays by\npreferentially extracting them from a homogeneous background plasma without\nadditional, largely untestable assumptions.

We prove analytically this density\nprofile is the result of the scale-free nature of the gravitational collapse.\nTherefore, it should emerge in many different situations as long as gravity is\ndominating the evolution for a period that is comparable or longer than the\nfree-fall time, and this does not necessarily imply an isothermal model, as\nmany have previously believed.\n  To describe the collapse process, we construct a model called the\nturbulence-regulated gravitational collapse model, where turbulence is\nsustained by accretion and dissipates in roughly a crossing time. We\ndemonstrate that a $\\rho \\sim r^{-2}$ profile emerges due to the scale-free\nnature the system. In this particular case, the rate of gravitational collapse\nis regulated by the rate at which turbulence dissipates the kinetic energy such\nthat the infall speed can be $20 - 50 \\%$ of the free-fall speed(which also\ndepends on the interpretation of the crossing time based on simulations of\ndriven turbulence).

We use a formalism that treats the system as\ntwo electromagnetic regions, where the efficiency of the energy transmission\nbetween one region (the stellar wind at the planetary orbits) to the other (the\nplanetary ionospheres) depends on the relation between the conductances and\nimpedances of the two regions.

We also found that the analytic\ndecay law obtained by Hindmarsh was in good agreement with simulations of\nbiased potentials, but not of biased initial conditions, and suggested that the\ndifference was related to the Gaussian approximation underlying the analytic\nlaw. Here we extend our previous work in several ways. For the cases of biased\npotential and biased initial conditions we study in detail the field\ndistributions in the simulations, confirming that the validity (or not) of the\nGaussian approximation is the key difference between the two cases. For\nanisotropic walls we carry out a more extensive set of numerical simulations\nand compare them to the canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model for domain\nwalls, finding that the model accurately predicts the linear scaling regime\nafter isotropization. Overall, our analysis provides a quantitative description\nof the cosmological evolution of these networks. \n\n"}

We\nselect from the catalogue only halo GCs, identifying a total of 34 GCs spanning\n$2.0 < r < 21.1$ kpc, and use their 3D kinematics to estimate the anisotropy\nover this range to be $\\beta = 0.46^{+0.15}_{-0.19}$, in good agreement, though\nslightly lower than, a recent estimate for a sample of halo GCs using HST PM\nmeasurements further out in the halo.

We perform a numerical linear stability analysis using the\nLEOPARD solver (Astfalk & Jenko 2017), which allows for arbitrary gyrotropic\ndistribution functions in a magnetized plasma.

The small Lya peak separation of\n$220\\pm20$ km/s implies a low HI column density and an ionising photon escape\nfraction of ~15-30 %, providing the first direct evidence that such galaxies\ncontribute actively to the reionisation of the Universe at z>6. Based on simple\nestimates, we find that COLA1 could have provided just enough photons to\nreionise its own ~0.3 pMpc bubble, allowing the blue Lya line to be observed.\nHowever, we also discuss alternative scenarios explaining the detected double\npeaked nature of COLA1. Our results show that future high-resolution\nobservations of statistical samples of double peaked LAEs at z>5 are a\npromising probe of the occurrence of ionised regions around galaxies in the\nEoR. \n\n"}

Proton shell effects and neutron-matter\n  constraint Abstract: Observations of soft X-ray transients in quiescence suggest the existence of\nheat sources in the crust of accreting neutron stars. Heat is thought to be\nreleased by electroweak and nuclear processes triggered by the burying of ashes\nof X-ray bursts. The heating is studied using a fully quantum approach taking\nconsistently into account nuclear shell effects. We have followed the evolution\nof ashes made of $^{56}$Fe employing the nuclear energy-density functional\ntheory. Both the outer and inner crusts are described using the same\nfunctional, thus ensuring a unified and thermodynamically consistent treatment.\nTo assess the role of the neutron-matter constraint, we have employed the set\nof accurately calibrated Brussels-Montreal functionals BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21\nand for comparison the SLy4 functional. Due to nuclear shell effects, the fully\naccreted crust is found to be much less stratified than in previous studies. In\nparticular, large regions of the inner crust contain clusters with the magic\nnumber $Z=14$. The heat deposited in the outer crust is tightly constrained by\nexperimental atomic mass data. The shallow heating we obtain does not exceed\n$0.2$~MeV and is therefore not enough to explain the cooling of some soft X-ray\ntransients. The total heat released in the crust is very sensitive to details\nof the nuclear structure and is predicted to lie in the range from $1.5$~MeV to\n$1.7$~MeV. The evolution of an accreted matter element and therefore the\nlocation of heat sources are governed to a large extent by the existence of\nnuclear shell closures. Ignoring these effects in the inner crust, the total\nheat falls to $\\sim 0.6$~MeV. The neutron-matter constraint is also found to\nplay a key role. The large amount of heat obtained by Steiner et al. (2012)\ncould thus be traced back to unrealistic neutron-matter equations of state. \n\n"}

The MAGIC telescopes\ncollected 75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1\nGeV was below 3x10-8cm-2s-1, which is the threshold adopted for the definition\nof a low gamma-ray activity state.

As a result, both Jovian and Neptunian Trojans share a common\norigin with the primordial disk population, whose other surviving members\nconstitute today's trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations.

Whilst there is strong\nevidence that the observed GWs are connected to the merger of two black holes\n(BH) or two neutron stars (NS), future detections may present a less consistent\npicture. Indeed, the possibility that the observed GW signal was created by a\nmerger of exotic compact objects (ECOs) such as boson stars (BS) or axion stars\n(AS) has not yet been fully excluded. For a detailed understanding of the late\nstages of the coalescence full 3D numerical relativity simulations are\nessential. In this paper, we extend the infrastructure of the numerical\nrelativity code BAM, to permit the simultaneous simulation of baryonic matter\nwith bosonic scalar fields, thus enabling the study of BS-BS, BS-NS, and BS-BH\nmergers.

An atmosphere reaches chemical equilibrium if\nthe rates of the forward and backward chemical reactions converge to the same\nvalue. However, there are atmospheric processes, such as atmospheric transport,\nthat destabilize this equilibrium. In this work we study the changes in\ncomposition driven by a 3D wind field in WASP-43b using our Global Circulation\nModel, THOR. Our model uses validated temperature- and pressure-dependent\nchemical timescales that allow us to explore the disequilibrium chemistry of\nCO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O and CH$_4$. In WASP-43b the formation of the equatorial jet\nhas an important impact in the chemical distribution of the different species\nacross the atmosphere.

Candidates from Continued Radial Velocity\n  Tests Abstract: Quasars whose broad emission lines show temporal, bulk radial velocity (RV)\nshifts have been proposed as candidate sub-parsec (sub-pc), binary supermassive\nblack holes (BSBHs). We identified a sample of 16 BSBH candidates based on\ntwo-epoch spectroscopy among 52 quasars with significant RV shifts over a few\nrest-frame years. The candidates showed consistent velocity shifts\nindependently measured from two broad lines (H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ or Mg${\\rm\n\\,II}$) without significant changes in the broad-line profiles. Here in the\nthird paper of the series, we present further third- and fourth-epoch\nspectroscopy for 12 of the 16 candidates for continued RV tests, spanning\n$\\sim$5--15 yr in the quasars' rest frames. Cross-correlation analysis of the\nbroad H$\\beta$ calibrated against [O${\\rm\\,III}]\\,\\lambda 5007$ suggests that 5\nof the 12 quasars remain valid as BSBH candidates. They show broad H$\\beta$ RV\ncurves that are consistent with binary orbital motion without significant\nchanges in the broad line profiles. Their broad H$\\alpha$ (or Mg${\\rm \\,II}$)\nlines display RV shifts that are either consistent with or smaller than those\nseen in broad H$\\beta$. The RV shifts can be explained by a $\\sim$0.05--0.1 pc\nBSBH with an orbital period of $\\sim$40--130 yr, assuming a mass ratio of\n0.5--2 and a circular orbit. However, the parameters are not well constrained\ngiven the few epochs that sample only a small portion of the hypothesized\nbinary orbital cycle.

Furthermore, these\ntransits will also probe the distribution of stellar activity across a star's\nsurface, and will help scrub out contamination from stellar activity on\nexoplanet transmission spectra and radial velocity spectra. This radio window\non exoplanets and their host stars is therefore a valuable complement to\nexisting optical tools. \n\n"}

Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and\ncentrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a\nprolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation. Ram pressure\nremoves the gas from the group UDGs when they are at pericentre, quenching star\nformation in them and making them redder. This generates a\ncolour/star-formation-rate gradient with distance from the centre, as observed\nin clusters. We find that ~20 per cent of the field UDGs that fall into a\nmassive halo survive as satellite UDGs. In addition, normal field dwarfs on\nhighly eccentric orbits can become UDGs near pericentre due to tidal puffing\nup, contributing about half of the group-UDG population.

The star formation history of DGSAT I\nseems to be extended, with a mean luminosity-weighted age of ~3 Gyr, in\nagreement with previous photometric studies. However, we find a very high\n[Mg/Fe] abundance ratio, which is extreme even in the context of the highly\nalpha-enhanced massive ellipticals and ultra-faint dwarfs.

The profile of the solid CO band reveals the\nimportance of thermal processing of the ice while the prominence of the XCN\nband attests to the importance of energetic processing of the ice by FUV\nradiation and/or energetic particles. In analogy to the processing of ices by\nembedded protostars in our Galaxy, we attribute the processing of the ices in\nthe center of NGC4945 to ongoing massive star formation.

This heating mechanism\nleads to spatially distributed and approximately symmetrical dissipation. The\nheating waves reach a given distance from the cluster center on a timescale\nshorter than the cooling time. This means that this heating mechanism has the\npotential of quenching cooling flows in a quasi-stable fashion. Moreover, the\nheating is gentle as no strong shocks are present in the simulations. We first\ninvestigated whether a single continuous episode of AGN activity can lead to\nadequate dissipation to balance cooling rates. These simulations demonstrated\nthat, whereas secondary waves generated by the interaction of the rising bubble\nwith the intracluster medium are clearly present, viscous heating associated\nwith the dissipation of these waves is insufficient to balance radiative\ncooling. It is only when the central source is intermittent that the viscous\ndissipation of waves associated with subsequent episodes of activity can offset\ncooling.

The main results are (1) the folded structure\n(direction reversals at the resistive scale, field lines curved at the scale of\nthe flow) persists from the kinematic to the nonlinear regime; (2) the field\ndistribution is self-similar and appears to be lognormal during the kinematic\nregime and exponential in the saturated state; and (3) the bulk of the magnetic\nenergy is at the resistive scale in the kinematic regime and remains there\nafter saturation, although the spectrum becomes much shallower. We propose an\nanalytical model of saturation based on the idea of partial\ntwo-dimensionalization of the velocity gradients with respect to the local\ndirection of the magnetic folds.

The intuitive explanation is that\nenergy dissipation by viscosity can drive an unstable spheroid to a stable,\ntriaxial configuration of lower energy - a Jacobi ellipsoid. But what about\nrapidly rotating compressible stars? Unlike incompressible stars, which contain\nno internal energy and therefore immediately liberate all the energy dissipated\nby viscosity, compressible stars have internal energy and can retain the\ndissipated energy as internal heat. Now compressible stars that rotate\nsufficiently rapidly and also manage to liberate this dissipated energy very\nquickly are known to be unstable to bar-mode perturbations, like their\nincompressible counterparts. But what is the situation for rapidly rotating\ncompressible stars that have very long cooling timescales, so that all the\nenergy dissipated by viscosity is retained as heat, whereby the total energy of\nthe star remains constant on a secular (viscous) evolution timescale? Are such\nstars also unstable to the nonlinear growth of bar modes, or is the viscous\nheating sufficient to cause them to expand, drive down the ratio of rotational\nkinetic to gravitational potential energy T/|W| ~ 1/R, where R is the\nequatorial radius, and turn off the instability before it gets underway? If the\ninstability still arises in such stars, at what rotation rate do they become\nunstable, and to what final state do they evolve? We provide answers to these\nquestions in the context of the compressible ellipsoid model for rotating\nstars. The results should serve as useful guides for numerical simulations in\n3+1 dimensions for rotating stars containing viscosity. \n\n"}

The sequence of minor\nand major mergers experienced by galactic halos in their hierarchical growth\naffects the merger history of MBHs embedded in their nuclei. So, if the\nformation route for the assembly of SMBHs dates back to the early universe, a\nlarge number of BH interactions is inevitable. Binary black holes coalescence\ntimescales can be long enough for a third BH to fall in and interact with the\ncentral binary. These BH triple interactions lead typically to the final\nexpulsion of one of the three bodies and to the recoil of the binary. Also,\nasymmetric emission of gravitational waves in the last stages of the black hole\nmerging can give a recoil velocity to the centre of mass of the coalescing\nbinary.

Following the vertical buckling instability,\nthe bars are known to weaken dramatically and develop a pronounced boxy/peanut\nshape when observed edge-on. Using high-resolution N-body simulations of\nstellar disks embedded in live axisymmetric dark matter halos, we have\ninvestigated the long-term changes in the bar morphology, specifically the\nevolution of the bar size, its vertical structure and exchange of angular\nmomentum. We find that following the initial buckling, the bar resumes its\ngrowth from deep inside the corotation radius and follows the Ultra-Harmonic\nresonance thereafter. We also find that this secular bar growth triggers a\nspectacular secondary vertical buckling instability which leads to the\nappearance of characteristic boxy/peanut/X-shaped bulges. The secular bar\ngrowth is crucial for the recurrent buckling to develop. Furthermore, the\nsecondary buckling is milder, persists over a substantial period of time, ~3\nGyr, and can have observational counterparts. Overall, the stellar bars show\nrecurrent behavior in their properties and evolve by increasing their linear\nand vertical extents, both dynamically and secularly. We also demonstrate\nexplicitly that the prolonged growth of the bar is mediated by continuous\nangular momentum transfer from the disk to the surrounding halo, and that this\nangular momentum redistribution is resonant in nature -- a large number of\nlower resonances trap disk and halo particles and this trapping is robust, in a\nbroad agreement with the earlier results in the literature. \n\n"}

Most of the\nrecent models for halting cooling in clusters have focused on AGN heating, but\nthe actual heating mechanism has remained mysterious. Here we present a\nframework for AGN heating derived from a Chandra survey of gas entropy profiles\nwithin cluster cores. This set of observations strongly suggests that the inner\nparts of cluster cores are shock-heated every ~10^8 years by intermittent AGN\noutbursts, driven by a kinetic power output of ~ 10^45 erg/sec and lasting at\nleast 10^7 years. Beyond ~30 kpc these shocks decay to sound waves, releasing\nbuoyant bubbles that heat the core's outer parts. Between heating episodes,\ncooling causes the core to relax toward an asymptotic pure-cooling profile. The\ndensity distribution in this asymptotic profile is sufficiently peaked that the\nAGN shock does not cause a core entropy inversion, allowing the cluster core to\nretain a strong iron abundance gradient, as observed. \n\n"}

The method of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides a rigorous\nmethod for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital parameters in a Bayesian\nframework (Ford 2005a). The main practical challenge for the general\napplication of MCMC is the need to construct Markov chains which quickly\nconverge.

Here we explain\none simple method for generating alternative CTPDFs which can significantly\nspeed convergence by one to three orders of magnitude.

Our\nformalism is applicable both to ordinary non-relativistic thermal gas, and to\nplasmas composed of CRs and thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytical\nsolution to the one-dimensional Riemann shock tube problem for a composite\nplasma of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods to study the properties of\nstructure formation shocks in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the\nLCDM model. We find that most of the energy is dissipated in weak internal\nshocks with Mach numbers M~2 which are predominantly central flow shocks or\nmerger shock waves traversing halo centres. Collapsed cosmological structures\nare surrounded by external shocks with much higher Mach numbers up to M~1000,\nbut they play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization. We\nshow that after the epoch of cosmic reionisation the Mach number distribution\nis significantly modified by an efficient suppression of strong external shock\nwaves due to the associated increase of the sound speed of the diffuse gas.\nInvoking a model for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find that the average\nstrength of shock waves responsible for CR energy injection is higher than that\nfor shocks that dominate the thermalization of the gas.

A promising\npossibility to explain these sources is given by \"in situ\" stochastic\nreacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster\nvolume during merger events. Cassano & Brunetti (2005) have recently shown that\nthe expected fraction of clusters with GRHs and the increase of such a fraction\nwith cluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a\nfraction of 20-30 % of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of\ncompressible modes. In this work we extend these calculations by including a\nscaling of the magnetic field strength with cluster mass. We show that the\nobserved correlations between the synchrotron radio power of a sample of 17\nGRHs and the X-ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent with, and\nactually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of the\nform B \\propto M^b, with b>0.5 and typical micro Gauss strengths of the average\nB intensity. The occurrence of GRHs as a function of both cluster mass and\nredshift is obtained. The most relevant findings are that the predicted\nluminosity functions of GRHs are peaked around a power P_{1.4 GHz} 10^{24}\nW/Hz, and severely cut-off at low radio powers due to the decrease of the\nelectron reacceleration in smaller galaxy clusters. We expect a total number of\nGRHs to be discovered at ~mJy radio fluxes of ~100 at 1.4 GHz. Finally, the\noccurrence of GRHs and their number counts at 150 MHz are estimated in view of\nthe fortcoming operation of low frequency observatories (LOFAR, LWA) and\ncompared with those at higher radio frequencies. \n\n"}

We define the\n\"surface filling factor\" to be the ratio of the area of causally connected\nregions that become active to the observable area of the shell. From the\nobserved variability in 52 BATSE bursts, we estimate the surface filling factor\nto be typically 0.005 although some values are near unity.

This ad-hoc requirement needs a very high\ndimensional operator to govern its decay and/or an extremely small coupling\nconstant. The natural lifetimes of such heavy objects are, however, microscopic\ntimes associated to the GUT energy scale (sim 10^{-28} sec. or shorter). It is\nat this energy scale (by the end of inflation) where they could have been\nabundantly formed in the early universe and it seems natural that they decayed\nshortly after being formed. \n\n"}

The interaction of\nobservers inside different throats occurs via tunnelling and is consequently\nweak. This provides a new mechanism for generating small numbers in Nature. We\napply it to the hierarchy problem, where supersymmetry breaking near the\nunification scale causes TeV sparticle masses inside the standard model throat.\nWe also design naturally long-lived cold dark matter which decays within a\nHubble time to the approximate conformal matter of a long throat. This may\nsoften structure formation at galactic scales and raises the possibility that\nmuch of the dark matter of the universe is conformal matter.
