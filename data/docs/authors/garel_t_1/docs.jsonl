In particular, the\nnumber of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse\nsize, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate.

Song {\\it et al.}\n(Nature {\\bf 433}, 392 (2005)) and studied more recently by F. Radicchi {\\it et\nal.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 101}, 148701 (2008)), but much simpler and easier\nto implement. In this first paper we apply RSR to critical trees and derive\nanalytical results consistent with numerical simulations. Critical trees\nexhibit three regimes in their evolution under RSR: (i) An initial regime\n$N_0^{\\nu}\\lesssim N<N_0$, where $N$ is the number of nodes at some step in the\nrenormalization and $N_0$ is the initial size. RSR in this regime is described\nby a mean field theory and fluctuations from one realization to another are\nsmall. The exponent $\\nu=1/2$ is derived using random walk arguments. The\ndegree distribution becomes broader under successive renormalization --\nreaching a power law, $p_k\\sim 1/k^{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma=2$ and a variance\nthat diverges as $N_0^{1/2}$ at the end of this regime.

Conventional BCS theory predicts that the\nkinetic energy of carriers increases in the transition from the normal to the\nsuperconducting state. However, substantial experimental evidence obtained in\nrecent years indicates that in at least some superconductors the opposite\noccurs.

In biology, intramolecular ET is commonly described as a\ndiffusive hopping process, according to the semi-classical theories of Marcus\nand Hopfield.

Here, we extend the semi-classical model for biological\nET to incorporate both semi-classical and coherent quantum phenomena using a\nquantum master equation based on the Holstein Hamiltonian. We test our model on\nthe structurally-defined chain of FeS clusters in complex I.

Even if\none starts from a Cayley tree, the network of surviving renormalized clusters\nwill contain loops, so that no analytical solution can been obtained. Here we\nintroduce a modified procedure called 'Boundary Strong Disorder\nRenormalization' that preserves the tree structure, so that one can write\nsimple recursions with respect to the number of generations. We first show that\nthis modified procedure allows to recover exactly most of the critical\nexponents for the one-dimensional chain. After this important check, we study\nthe RG equations for the quantum Ising model on a Cayley tree with a uniform\nferromagnetic coupling $J$ and random transverse fields with support\n$[h_{min},h_{max}]$. We find the following picture (i) for $J>h_{max}$, only\nbonds are decimated, so that the whole tree is a quantum ferromagnetic cluster\n(ii) for $J<h_{min}$, only sites are decimated, so that no quantum\nferromagnetic cluster is formed, and the ferromagnetic coupling to the boundary\ncoincides with the partition function of a Directed Polymer model in a random\nmedium (iii) for $h_{min}<J<h_{max}$, both sites and bonds can be decimated :\nthe quantum ferromagnetic clusters can either remain finite (the physics is\nthen similar to (ii), with a quantitative mapping to a modified Directed\nPolymer model) or an infinite quantum ferromagnetic cluster appears.

This\nregime is dominated by the appearance of coherent multiphoton resonances in the\nnonlinear response of the resonator to the modulation. We determine simple\nexpressions for the photon noise spectrum and find that the multiphoton\nresonances also induces a multiple peak structure in that noise. When the\ncorresponding multiphoton Rabi oscillations are underdamped, zero temperature\nquantum fluctuations determine comparable populations of all quasienergy states\nwhich belong to a resonant multiphoton doublet. Most interestingly, the quantum\nfluctuations probe the multiphoton transitions by inducing several peaks in the\nnoise spectrum of the resonator observables. In particular, the noise of the\nphoton number contains complete information about the multiphoton states and\ntheir stationary populations via pairs of nearly symmetric peaks at opposite\nfrequencies. Their widths are determined by the damping of the Rabi\noscillations and their heights are proportional to the stationary nonequilbrium\npopulations. A finite detuning from a multiphoton resonance generates a\nquasielastic noise peak at zero frequency. In addition, we relate the\nstationary populations of the quasienergy states with an effective quantum\ntemperature and discuss the role of a finite temperature. \n\n"}

The nature\nof the escaping process of photons from these early galaxies is crucial to\nunderstanding galaxy evolution and the cosmic reionization. Here, we\ninvestigate the escape of Lya, non-ionizing UV-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600\nangstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l < 912 angstrom) from galaxies\nby combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensional\nmulti-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The galaxies are simulated in\na box of 5^3 h^-3 Mpc^3 with high resolutions using the Aquila initial\ncondition which reproduces a Milky Way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. We find\nthat the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complex\ndependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(Lya) and fesc(UV) appear to\nevolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxy\nproperties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, while\nfesc(Ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does not\nshow clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(Lya) correlates more strongly\nwith fesc(UV) than with fesc(Ion).

In this paper, we investigate a\nmerger model for the formation of LABs by studying Lya emission from\ninteracting galaxies at high redshifts by means of a combination of\nhydrodynamics simulations with three dimensional radiative transfer\ncalculations. Our galaxy simulations focus on a set of binary major mergers of\ngalaxies with a mass range of 3-7 *10^12 Msun in the redshift range of z ~ 3\n-7, and we use the newly improved ART^2 code to perform the radiative transfer\ncalculations which couple multi-wavelength continuum, ionization of hydrogen,\nand Lya line emission. We find that intense star formation and enhanced cooling\ninduced by gravitational interaction produce strong Lya emission from these\nmerging galaxies. The Lya emission appears to be extended due to the extended\ndistribution of sources and gas. During the close encounter of galaxy\nprogenitors when the star formation rate peaks at ~ 10^3 Msun/yr, our model\nproduces Lya blobs with luminosity of L ~ 10^42-10^44 erg/s, and size of D ~\n10-20 kpc at z>6 and D ~ 20-50 kpc at z ~ 3, in broad agreement with\nobservations in the same redshift range.

If the dust is locked up\ninside high-density clouds dispersed in an empty intercloud medium, the Lya\nphotons could scatter off of the surfaces of the clouds, effectively having\ntheir journey confined to the dustless medium.

Methods: Using our 3D Monte Carlo Lya radiation transfer code, we\nstudy the radiative transfer of Lya, UV and optical continuum photons in\nhomogeneous and clumpy shells of neutral hydrogen and dust surrounding a\ncentral source. Our simulations predict the Lya and continuum escape fraction,\nthe Lya equivalent width EW(Lya), the Lya line profile and their dependence on\nthe gas geometry and the main input physical parameters. Results: The ISM\nclumpiness is found to have a strong impact on the Lya line radiative transfer,\nentailing a strong dependence of the emergent features of the Lya line (escape\nfraction, EW(Lya)) on the ISM morphology. Although a clumpy and dusty ISM\nappears more transparent to radiation (both line and continuum) compared to an\nequivalent homogeneous ISM of equal dust optical depth, we find that the Lya\nphotons are, in general, still more attenuated than UV continuum radiation. As\na consequence, the observed Lya equivalent width (EWobs(Lya)) is lower than the\nintrinsic one (EWint(Lya)) for nearly all clumpy ISM configurations considered.\nThere are, however, special conditions under which Lya photons escape more\neasily than the continuum, resulting in an enhanced EWobs(Lya). The requirement\nfor this to happen is that the ISM is almost static (galactic outflows < 200\nkm/s), extremely clumpy (with density contrasts >10^7 in HI between clumps and\nthe interclump medium), and very dusty (E(B-V) > 0.30). When these conditions\nare fulfilled the emergent Lya line profile shows no velocity shift and little\nasymmetry.

We study the effect of the environmental\nanisotropy on the observed Lya emission by performing radiative transfer\ncalculations for models of neutral hydrogen clouds with prescriptions of\nspatial and kinematic anisotropies. The environmental anisotropy leads to\ncorresponding anisotropy in the Lya flux and spectral properties and induces\ncorrelations among them. The Lya flux (or observed luminosity) depends on the\nviewing angle and shows an approximate correlation with the initial Lya optical\ndepth in the viewing direction relative to those in all other directions. The\ndistribution of Lya flux from a set of randomly oriented clouds is skewed to\nhigh values, providing a natural contribution to the Lya equivalent width (EW)\ndistribution seen in observation. A narrower EW distribution is found at a\nlarger peak offset of the Lya line, similar to the trend suggested in\nobservation. The peak offset appears to correlate with the line shape (full\nwidth at half maximum and asymmetry), pointing to a possibility of using Lya\nline features alone to determine the systemic redshifts of galaxies.

If normalized to the size of the halo of the nearest central\ngalaxy, the median impact parameters for LL and DLA systems become ~1 and\n~10^-1 virial radii, respectively. At a given HI column density, the impact\nparameter increases with the mass of the closest galaxy, in agreement with\nobservations. We predict most strong HI absorbers to be most closely associated\nwith extremely low-mass galaxies, M_star < 10^8 M_sun and star formation rate\n<10^-1 M_sun/yr. We also find a correlation between the column density of\nabsorbers and the mass of the nearest galaxy. This correlation is most\npronounced for DLAs with N_HI > 10^21 /cm^2 which are typically close to\ngalaxies with M_star >~ 10^9 M_sun. Similar correlations exist between column\ndensity and other properties of the associated galaxies such as their star\nformation rates, halo masses and HI content. The galaxies nearest to HI\nabsorbers are typically far too faint to be detectable with current\ninstrumentation, which is consistent with the high rate of (often unpublished)\nnon-detections in observational searches for the galaxy counterparts of strong\nHI absorbers. Moreover, we predict that the detected nearby galaxies are\ntypically not the galaxies that are most closely associated with the absorbers,\nthus causing the impact parameters, star formation rates and stellar masses of\nthe observed counterparts to be biased high. \n\n"}

The cross-correlation is measured by stacking quasar absorption\nspectra shifted to the redshift of galaxies that are within a certain impact\nparameter bin of the quasar, after dividing by a quasar continuum model.

We present RHD\nsimulations of isolated galaxy disks of different masses with a resolution of\n18 pc. Besides accounting for supernova feedback, our simulations are the first\ngalaxy-scale simulations to include RHD treatments of photo-ionisation heating\nand radiation pressure, from both direct optical/UV radiation and\nmulti-scattered, re-processed infrared (IR) radiation. Photo-heating smooths\nand thickens the disks and suppresses star formation about as much as the\ninclusion of (\"thermal dump\") supernova feedback does. These effects decrease\nwith galaxy mass and are mainly due to the prevention of the formation of dense\nclouds, as opposed to their destruction.

Abstract: We discuss new Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic observations of four luminous\ngalaxies at z~7-9 selected to have intense optical line emission by\nRoberts-Borsani et al. (2016). Previous follow-up has revealed Lyman-alpha in\ntwo of the four galaxies. Our new MOSFIRE observations confirm that Lyman-alpha\nis present in the entire sample. We detect Lyman-alpha emission in COS-zs7-1,\nconfirming its redshift as z=7.154, and we detect Lyman-alpha in EGS-zs8-2 at\nz=7.477, verifying a tentative detection presented in an earlier study. The\nubiquity of Lyman-alpha in this sample is puzzling given that the IGM is likely\nsignificantly neutral over 7<z<9. To investigate this result in more detail, we\nhave initiated a campaign to target UV metal emission in the four Lyman-alpha\nemitters as a probe of both the radiation field and the velocity offset of\nLyman-alpha. Here we present the detection of intense CIII] emission in\nEGS-zs8-1, a galaxy from this sample previously shown to have Lyman-alpha at\nz=7.73. Photoionization models indicate that an intense radiation field and low\nmetallicity are required to reproduce the intense CIII] and optical line\nemission. We argue that this extreme radiation field is likely to affect the\nlocal environment, increasing the transmission of Lyman-alpha through the\ngalaxy. Moreover, the centroid of CIII] indicates that Lyman-alpha is\nredshifted from the systemic value by 340 km/s. This velocity offset is larger\nthan that seen in less luminous systems, providing an additional explanation\nfor the transmission of Lyman-alpha emission through the IGM. Since the\ntransmission is further enhanced by the likelihood that such systems are also\nsituated in the densest regions with the largest ionized bubbles, the\nvisibility of Lyman-alpha at z>7 is expected to be strongly\nluminosity-dependent, with the most effective transmission occurring in systems\nwith intense star formation. \n\n"}

We study in detail how\nionizing radiation can leak from high redshift galaxies.

While purely analytical models quickly become intractable\nhere, spatial-stochastic simulations can capture a wide range of biochemical\nprocesses with the necessary levels of detail. Here we discuss different\ntechniques for spatial-stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems, and\nexplain important precautions required to make them biochemically accurate and\nefficient.

We analyze their interplay using a weak-coupling renormalization\ngroup approach. In the clean case, the Coulomb interaction has been found to be\nmarginally irrelevant, leading to Fermi liquid behavior. We extend the analysis\nto incorporate the effects of disorder. The nodal line structure gives rise to\nkinematical constraints similar to that for a two-dimensional Fermi surface,\nwhich plays a crucial role in the one-loop renor- malization of the disorder\ncouplings. For a two-fold degenerate nodal loop (Weyl loop), we show that\ndisorder flows to strong coupling along a unique fixed trajectory in the space\nof symmetry inequiv- alent disorder couplings. Along this fixed trajectory, all\nsymmetry inequivalent disorder strengths become equal. For a four-fold\ndegenerate nodal loop (Dirac loop), disorder also flows to strong coupling,\nhowever the strengths of symmetry inequivalent disorder couplings remain\ndifferent. We show that feedback from disorder reverses the sign of the beta\nfunction for the Coulomb interaction, causing the Coulomb interaction to flow\nto strong coupling as well. However, the Coulomb interac- tion flows to strong\ncoupling asymptotically more slowly than disorder. Extrapolating our results to\nstrong coupling, we conjecture that at low energies nodal line semimetals\nshould be described by a noninteracting nonlinear sigma model. We discuss the\nrelation of our results with possible many-body localization at zero\ntemperatures in such materials. \n\n"}

The combination of a large field of view, high\nsensitivity, and wide wavelength coverage provides an order of magnitude\nimprovement in spectroscopically confirmed redshifts in the HUDF; i.e., 1206\nsecure spectroscopic redshifts for HST continuum selected objects, which\ncorresponds to 15% of the total (7904). The redshift distribution extends well\nbeyond z>3 and to HST/F775W magnitudes as faint as ~30 mag (AB, 1-sigma). In\naddition, 132 secure redshifts were obtained for sources with no HST\ncounterparts that were discovered in the MUSE data cubes by a blind search for\nemission-line features. In total, we present 1338 high quality redshifts, which\nis a factor of eight increase compared with the previously known spectroscopic\nredshifts in the same field. We assessed redshifts mainly with the spectral\nfeatures [OII] at z<1.5 (473 objects) and Lya at 2.9<z<6.7 (692 objects). With\nrespect to F775W magnitude, a 50% completeness is reached at 26.5 mag for ultra\ndeep and 25.5 mag for deep fields, and the completeness remains >~20% up to\n28-29 mag and ~27 mag, respectively. We used the determined redshifts to test\ncontinuum color selection (dropout) diagrams of high-z galaxies. The selection\ncondition for F336W dropouts successfully captures ~80% of the targeted z~2.7\ngalaxies. However, for higher redshift selections (F435W, F606W, and F775W\ndropouts), the success rates decrease to ~20-40%.

All these codes can return photometric redshifts with bias\n|Dzn|=|z-z_phot|/(1+z)<0.05 down to F775W=30 and spectroscopic incompleteness\nis unlikely to strongly modify this statement. We have, however, identified\nclear systematic biases in the determination of photometric redshifts: in the\n0.4<z<1.5 range, photometric redshifts are systematically biased low by as much\nas Dzn=-0.04 in the median, and at z>3 they are systematically biased high by\nup to Dzn = 0.05, an offset that can in part be explained by adjusting the\namount of intergalactic absorption applied. In agreement with previous studies\nwe find little difference in the performance of the different codes, but in\ncontrast to those we find that adding extensive ground-based and IRAC\nphotometry actually can worsen photo-z performance for faint galaxies.

A\ncrucial role is played by the fact that gap solitons may feature a negative\ndynamical mass, keeping their mobility in the OL. First, the respective system\nof coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) is reduced to a system of\nequations for envelopes of the lattice wave functions. Two generic dynamical\nregimes are revealed by simulations of the reduced system, viz., shuttle\noscillations of pairs of solitons with positive and negative masses, and\nsplitting of the pair. The co-accelerating motion of the interacting solitons,\nwhich keeps constant separation between them, occurs at the boundary between\nthe shuttle motion and splitting. The position of the co-acceleration regime in\nthe system's parameter space can be adjusted with the help of an additional\ngravity potential, which induces its own acceleration, that may offset the\nrelative acceleration of the two solitons, while gravity masses of both\nsolitons remain positive.

To this end, we consider bond-diluted\nlattices near the T=0 glass transition point $p^*$. This transition for\ndiscrete bond distributions occurs just above the bond percolation point $p_c$\nin each dimension. Numerics suggests that both points, $p_c$ and $p^*$, seem to\nshare the same $1/d$-expansion, at least for several leading orders, each\nstarting with $1/(2d)$. Hence, these lattice graphs have average connectivities\nof $\\alpha=2dp\\gtrsim1$ near $p^*$ and exact graph-reduction methods become\nvery effective in eliminating recursively all spins of connectivity $\\leq3$,\nallowing the treatment of lattices of lengths up to L=30 and with up to\n$10^5-10^6$ spins. Using finite-size scaling, data for the defect energy width\n$\\sigma(\\Delta E)$ over a range of $p>p^*$ in each dimension can be combined to\nreach scaling regimes of about one decade in the scaling variable\n$L(p-p^*)^{\\nu^*}$.

The cavity method is a technique that\nrecursively describes the property of a system with N+1 spins in terms of those\nof a system with N spins.

A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region\nof the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where\nthe behavior is most anomalous. We introduce Anderson's idea of the resonating\nvalence bond (RVB) and argue that it gives a qualitative account of the data.\nThe importance of phase fluctuation is discussed, leading to a theory of the\ntransition temperature which is driven by phase fluctuation and thermal\nexcitation of quasiparticles. We then describe the numerical method of\nprojected wavefunction which turns out to be a very useful technique to\nimplement the strong correlation constraint, and leads to a number of\npredictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper\ndeals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the\nRVB idea on a more formal footing.

A radical\nrevision of this picture argues that the excitations in low temperature glasses\nare deeply connected to the energy landscape of the glass when it vitrifies:\nthe excitations are not low excited states built on a single ground state but\nlocally defined resonances, high in the energy spectrum of a solid. According\nto a semiclassical analysis, the two level systems involve resonant collective\ntunneling motions of around two hundred molecular units which are relics of the\nmosaic of cooperative motions at the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The\ndensity of states of the TLS is determined by $T_g$ and the mosaic's length\nscale, which is a weak function of the cooling rate.

We find that the spin Hall\nconductance (SHC), extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit, remains finite in a\nwide range of disorder strengths for a closed system on torus. But there is no\nintrinsic spin Hall accumulation as induced by an external electric field once\nthe disorder is turned on. The latter is examined by performing a Laughlin's\nGedanken gauge experiment numerically with the adiabatical insertion of a flux\nquantum in a belt-shaped sample, in which the absence of level crossing is\nfound under the disorder effect. Without disorder, on the other hand, energy\nlevels do cross each other, which results in an oscillating\nspin-density-modulation at the sample boundary after the insertion of one flux\nquantum in the belt-shaped system. But the corresponding net spin transfer is\nonly about one order of magnitude smaller than what is expected from the bulk\nSHC.

Recently it has been observed numerically that an assembly\nof elastic particles has a critical behavior near the jamming threshold where\nthe pressure vanishes. At the transition such a system does not behave as a\ncontinuous medium at any length scales. When this system is compressed, scaling\nis observed for the elastic moduli, the coordination number, but also for the\ndensity of vibrational modes. In the present work we derive theoretically these\nresults, and show that they apply to various systems such as granular matter\nand silica, but also to colloidal glasses.

The time evolution of one-time quantities, such as the\nenergy density, and the detailed properties of two-time correlation and\nresponse functions are studied using a combination of theoretical approaches,\nincluding exact mappings of master operators and reductions to integrable\nquantum spin chains, field theory and renormalization group, and independent\ninterval and timescale separation methods.
