This is possible if\nthere is a disequilibrium between the DM particle creation and annihilation\nprocesses with the former process dominating, which creates an effective source\nterm with negative pressure. Comparing the predicted Hubble expansion of one of\nthe IDM models (the simplest) with observational data we find that the\neffective annihilation term is quite small, as suggested by a variety of other\nrecent experiments. \n\n"}

Geometrically correlating these\ntwo scales constrains the soft SUSY breaking parameters of the MSSM. In this\nscenario, the hidden SUSY breaking sector involves an anomalous U(1)\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry which forbids bare mu and B mu terms. This sector\ntypically breaks supersymmetry at the desired range of energy scales through a\nsimple stringy hybrid of a Fayet and Polonyi model. A variant of the\nGiudice-Masiero mechanism generates the value mu ~ 10^2 - 10^3 GeV when the\nhidden sector scale of supersymmetry breaking is F^(1/2) ~ 10^(8.5) GeV.\nFurther, the B mu problem is solved due to the mild hierarchy between the GUT\nscale and Planck scale. These models relate SUSY breaking with the QCD axion,\nand solve the strong CP problem through an axion with decay constant f_a ~\nM_(GUT) * mu / L, where L ~ 10^5 GeV is the characteristic scale of gaugino\nmass unification in gauge mediated models, and the ratio \\mu / L ~\nM_(GUT)/M_(pl) ~ 10^(-3).

{"id": "0809.5262", "contents": "Title: Direct Mediation, Duality and Unification Abstract: It is well-known that in scenarios with direct gauge mediation of\nsupersymmetry breaking the messenger fields significantly affect the running of\nStandard Model couplings and introduce Landau poles which are difficult to\navoid. This appears to remove any possibility of a meaningful unification\nprediction and is often viewed as a strong argument against direct mediation.\nWe propose two ways that Seiberg duality can circumvent this problem. In the\nfirst, which we call \"deflected-unification\", the SUSY-breaking hidden sector\nis a magnetic theory which undergoes a duality to an electric phase, with fewer\nelementary degrees of freedom coupled to the MSSM. This changes the\nbeta-functions of the MSSM gauge couplings so as to push their Landau poles\nabove the unification scale. We show that this scenario is realised for\nrecently suggested models of gauge mediation based on a metastable SCQD-type\nhidden sector directly coupled to MSSM. The second possibility, which we call\n\"dual-unification\", begins with the observation that, if the mediating fields\nfall into complete SU(5) multiplets, then the MSSM+messengers exhibits a fake\nunification at unphysical values of the gauge couplings. We show that, in known\nexamples of electric/magnetic duals, such a fake unification in the magnetic\ntheory reflects a real unification in the electric theory. We therefore propose\nthat the Standard Model could itself be a magnetic dual of some unknown\nelectric theory in which the true unification takes place. This scenario\nmaintains the unification prediction (and unification scale) even in the\npresence of Landau poles in the magnetic theory below the GUT scale. We further\nnote that this dual realization of grand unification can explain why Nature\nappears to unify, but the proton does not decay. \n\n"}

We show that in this\nmodel the known properties of vector unparticles -- the nontrivial phase of the\nCFT propagator, the necessity and dominance of contact interactions, the\nunitarity constraint on the conformal dimension of the operator, and the tensor\nstructure dictated by conformal symmetry -- follow by simple inspection of the\nbrane-to-brane propagator. The phase has a physical interpretation as\ncontrolling the rate of escape of unparticles into the extra dimension.\nRequiring the correct sign for the imaginary part of the longitudinal\npolarization of the propagator, we obtain the unitarity condition m_5^2 >= 0,\nwhich, unlike in the scalar case, is unchanged from flat space.

The gravity\ndual at zero temperature captures the logarithmic runnings of the coupling\nconstants at far IR and the almost conformal, albeit strongly coupled, behavior\nat the UV. The full UV completion of gauge theory is accomplished in the\ngravity side by attaching an AdS cap to the IR geometry described in our\nprevious work. Attaching such an AdS cap is highly non-trivial because it\namounts to finding the right interpolating geometry and sources that take us\nfrom a gravity solution with non-zero three-form fluxes to another one that has\nalmost vanishing three-form fluxes. In this paper we give a concrete\nrealisation of such a scenario, completing the program advocated in our earlier\npaper.

Sanchez stress among other points: (i) the primordial CMB\nfluctuations are almost gaussian, large primordial non-gaussianity and large\nrunning index are strongly disfavored. The primordial graviton ratio r is\npredicted in the effective theory of inflation to be between 0.021 and 0.053,\nat reach of the next CMB observations. (ii) Dark energy observations are\nconsistent with the cosmological constant. (iii) The cosmic ray positron excess\nrecently observed is explained by natural astrophysical processes. (iv) The\nheavy dark matter particle candidates ( > 1 GeV, wimps) became strongly\ndisfavored, while cored (non cusped) dark matter halos and light (keV scale\nmass) dark matter are being increasingly favored from theory and astrophysical\nobservations. The Daniel Chalonge Medal 2009 was awarded to Peter Biermann\nduring the Colloquium. Photos of the Colloquium are included. \n\n"}

These interactions are\ntypical of warm inflation microscopic model building. Two perturbative regimes\nare shown where well defined approximations for the spectral functions apply.\nOne regime is at high temperature, when the masses of both intermediate and\nradiation fields are less than the temperature scale and where the poles of the\nspectral functions dominate. The other regime is at low temperature, when the\nintermediate field masses are much bigger than the temperature and where the\nlow energy and low three-momentum regime dominate the spectral functions.

Abstract: It is an interesting question whether low energy degrees of freedom may be\nresponsible for early universe inflation. To examine this, here we present a\nsimple version of Higgs-inflation with minimal coupling to gravity and a\nquadratic inflationary potential. This quantitatively differs from the popular\nnon-minimally coupled models, although it is qualitatively similar. In all such\nmodels, new heavy fields must enter in order for the theory to be well behaved\nin the UV. We show that in all cases the Higgs self coupling lambda must be\nquite small in order to integrate out the heavy fields and use the resulting\nlow energy effective field theory of the Higgs to describe inflation. For\nmoderately sized lambda, the UV completion is required and will, in general,\ndetermine the inflationary regime. We discuss the important issue of the\narbitrariness of the Lagrangians used in all these setups by presenting a new\nclass of such models, including a supergravity version.

We argue that this is not a real property of the\nradiation at strong coupling, but an artifact of the backreaction calculation,\nwhich is unable to faithfully capture the space-time distribution of the\nradiation. This becomes obvious in the case of a decaying system ('virtual\nphoton'), for which the backreaction is tantamount to computing a three-point\nfunction in the conformal gauge theory, which is independent of the coupling\nsince protected by symmetries.

Typically, in such situations, the scalar power spectrum\nexhibits a burst of features associated with modes that leave the Hubble radius\neither immediately before or during the epoch of fast roll. Moreover, one also\nfinds that the power spectrum turns scale invariant at smaller scales\ncorresponding to modes that leave the Hubble radius at later stages, when slow\nroll has been restored. In other words, the imprints of brief departures from\nslow roll, arising out of sharp shapes in the inflaton potential, are usually\nof a finite width in the scalar power spectrum. Intuitively, one may imagine\nthat the scalar bi-spectrum too may exhibit a similar behavior, i.e. a\nrestoration of scale invariance at small scales, when slow roll has been\nreestablished. However, in the case of the Starobinsky model (viz. the model\ndescribed by a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in its slope)\ninvolving the canonical scalar field, it has been found that, a rather sharp,\nthough short, departure from slow roll can leave a lasting and significant\nimprint on the bi-spectrum.

Abstract: Recently there has been significant interest in the claim that dark matter\naxions gravitationally thermalize and form a Bose-Einstein condensate with\ncosmologically long-range correlation.

We point\nout that there is an essential difference between the thermalization and\nformation of a condensate due to repulsive interactions, which can indeed drive\nlong-range order, and that due to attractive interactions, which can lead to\nlocalized Bose clumps (stars or solitons) that only exhibit short range\ncorrelation. While the difference between repulsion and attraction is not\npresent in the standard collisional Boltzmann equation, we argue that it is\nessential to the field theory dynamics, and we explain why the latter analysis\nis appropriate for a condensate.

The magnitude of these signals depends on the number of light\ndegrees of freedom in the hidden sector, and on the temperature at which it\nkinetically decouples from the SM. We consider a simple model that realizes\nthis scenario, based on a framework in which the SM and hidden sector are\ninitially in thermal equilibrium through the Higgs portal, and show that the\nresulting signals are compatible with recent Planck results, while large enough\nto be detected in upcoming experiments such as CMBPol and CMB Stage-IV.\nInvisible decays of the Higgs into hidden sector states at colliders can offer\na complementary probe of this model. \n\n"}

Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a variant of supersymmetric hybrid inflation in which\nthe inflaton is a matter field (which can be charged under gauge symmetries)\nand inflation ends by a GUT-scale phase transition of a waterfall field. These\nfeatures make tribrid inflation a promising framework for realising inflation\nwith particularly close connections to particle physics. Superpotentials of\ntribrid inflation involve effective operators suppressed by some cutoff scale,\nwhich is often taken as the Planck scale. However, these operators may also be\ngenerated by integrating out messenger superfields with masses below the Planck\nscale, which is in fact quite common in GUT and/or flavour models. The values\nof the inflaton field during inflation can then lie above this mass scale,\nwhich means that for reliably calculating the model predictions one has to go\nbeyond the effective theory description. We therefore discuss realisations of\neffective theories of tribrid inflation and specify in which cases effects from\nthe messenger fields are expected, and under which conditions they can safely\nbe neglected. In particular, we point out how to construct realisations where,\ndespite the fact that the inflaton field values are above the messenger mass\nscale, the predictions for the observables are (to a good approximation)\nidentical to the ones calculated in the effective theory treatment where the\nmessenger mass scale is identified with the (apparent) cutoff scale. \n\n"}

One is\nthat DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most\nnatural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the\ndecaying particle.

This would provide an ideal candidate for a gauge singlet\nscalar alternative to Higgs Inflation, S-inflation. Here we discuss the\nrelevant results of S-inflation in the context of the 750 GeV resonance. In\nparticular, we show that a singlet scalar, if it is real, has a major advantage\nover the Higgs boson with regard to unitarity violation during inflation. This\nis because it is possible to restrict the large non-minimal coupling required\nfor inflation, $\\xi \\sim 10^5$, to the real singlet scalar, with all other\nscalars having $\\xi \\sim 1$. In this case the scale of unitarity violation\n$\\Lambda$ is much larger than the inflaton field during inflation. This\nprotects the inflaton effective potential from modification by the new physics\nor strong coupling which is necessary to restore unitarity, which would\notherwise invalidate the perturbative effective potential based on Standard\nModel physics. This is in contrast to the case of Higgs Inflation or models\nbased on complex singlet scalars, where the unitarity violation scale during\ninflation is less than or of the order of the inflaton field. Therefore if the\n750 GeV resonance is the inflaton, it must be a non-minimally coupled real\nsinglet scalar. \n\n"}

The baryon asymmetry is determined by\na competition between the helical hypermagnetic field, which sources baryon\nnumber, and the electroweak sphaleron, which tends to wash out baryon number.\nAt the electroweak crossover both of these processes become inactive; the\nhypermagnetic field is converted into an electromagnetic field, which does not\nsource baryon number, and the weak gauge boson masses grow, suppressing the\nelectroweak sphaleron reaction. An accurate prediction of the relic baryon\nasymmetry requires a careful treatment of the crossover. We extend our previous\nstudy [K. Kamada and A. J. Long, Phys. Rev.

This\ncoupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation,\nespecially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological\nconsequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally\nhelical.

The recent\nproposal that the endpoint of gravitational collapse can be a \"dark energy\nstar\" implies that the mass-energy of the nucleons undergoing gravitational\ncollapse can be converted to vacuum energy when one gets near to conditions\nwhere classical general relativity predicts that a trapped surface would form.\nThe negative pressure associated with a large vacuum energy prevents an event\nhorizon from forming, thus resolving the long-standing puzzle as to why\ngravitational collapse always leads to an explosion. An indirect consequence is\nthat the reverse process - creation of matter from vacuum energy - should also\nbe possible. Indeed this process may be responsible for the \"big bang\".

In this paper we examine whether such a\nmechanism can emerge in superstring derived free fermionic models. We observe\nthat certain three generation string solutions, though not all, lead to an\nanomalous U(1) which couples universally to all three families. The advantages\nof this three-family universality of $U(1)_A$, compared to the two-family case,\nproposed in earlier works, in yielding squark degeneracy, while avoiding\nradiative breaking of color and charge, are noted.

We show that the\nminimally bosonized SUSYQM can be obtained from Witten's SUSYQM by applying to\nit a nonlocal unitary transformation with a subsequent reduction to one of the\neigenspaces of the total reflection operator. The transformation depends on the\nparity operator, and the deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection,\nintimately related to parabosons and parafermions, emerges here in a natural\nway. It is shown that the minimally bosonized SUSYQM can also be understood as\nsupersymmetric two-fermion system. With this interpretation, the bosonization\nconstruction is generalized to the case of N=1 supersymmetry in 2 dimensions.\nThe same special unitary transformation diagonalises the Hamiltonian operator\nof the 2D massive free Dirac theory.
