However, applications of the Abel-Plana\nformula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the\neigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized\nthe Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature.

He found that if a stochastic\nhidden variable theory fulfils certain conditions, the inequality of Bell can\nbe violated. Moreover, Nelson was able to prove that this may happen without\nany instantaneous communication between the two spatially separated measurement\nstations. Since Nelson's article got almost overlooked by physicists, we try to\nreview his comments on Bell's theorem. We argue that a modification of\nstochastic mechanics published recently by Fritsche and Haugk can be extended\nto a theory which fulfils the requirements of Nelson's analysis. The article\nproceeds to derive the quantum mechanical formalism of spinning particles and\nthe Pauli equation from this version of stochastic mechanics. Then, we\ninvestigate Bohm's version of the EPR experiment. Additionally, other setups,\nlike entanglement swapping or time and position correlations, are shortly\nexplained from the viewpoint of our local hidden-variable model.

This is a\nvariant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased\ncoins to toss.

Operationally local transformations are parameterized\nonly by local variables, however in order to allow violation of the CHSH\ninequality a maximally entangled ancilla was necessary. The use of the\nentangled ancilla in this scheme caused the state under test to become\ndependent on the measurement choice one uses to calculate the CHSH inequality\nthus violating one of the assumptions used in deriving a Bell inequality,\nnamely the `free will' or `statistical independence' assumption.

Recent work has shown that by weakening the role of the\nmeasurement in preparing eigenstates of the variable it is in fact possible to\nmeasure all nonlocal observables instantaneously by exploiting entanglement.\nHowever, for these measurement schemes to succeed with certainty an infinite\namount of entanglement must be distributed initially and all this entanglement\nis necessarily consumed. In this work we sharpen the characterisation of\ninstantaneous nonlocal measurements by explicitly devising schemes in which\nonly a finite amount of the initially distributed entanglement is ever\nutilised. This enables us to determine an upper bound to the average\nconsumption for the most general cases of nonlocal measurements. This includes\nthe tasks of state verification, where the measurement verifies if the system\nis in a given state, and verification measurements of a general set of\neigenstates of an observable.

If the OTP is completely secret, the\nexpected time for an adversary to create a tag for a chosen message is\nexponential in the tag length. If, however, the OTP is partially known in each\nauthentication round, as is the case in practical QKD protocols, then the\npicture is different; the adversary's partial knowledge of the OTP in each\nauthentication round gives partial information on the secret hash function, and\nthis weakens the authentication in later rounds.

The time required for thermalization to occur in such\nmodels should reflect the relaxation times associated with classical black\nholes in general relativity. Moreover, the time required for a particularly\nstrong form of thermalization to occur, sometimes known as scrambling,\ndetermines the time scale on which black holes should start to release\ninformation. It has been conjectured that black holes scramble in a time\nlogarithmic in their entropy, and that no system in nature can scramble faster.\nIn this article, we address the conjecture from two directions. First, we\nexhibit two examples of systems that do indeed scramble in logarithmic time:\nBrownian quantum circuits and the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a sparse\nrandom graph. Unfortunately, both fail to be truly ideal fast scramblers for\nreasons we discuss. Second, we use Lieb-Robinson techniques to prove a\nlogarithmic lower bound on the scrambling time of systems with finite norm\nterms in their Hamiltonian.

The\nfactorization consists of a geometric operator (path-ordered magnetic\ntranslation), a dynamical operator generated by the usual time-independent\nLandau Hamiltonian, and a nonadiabatic operator that determines the transition\nprobabilities among the Landau levels. Since the path-ordered magnetic\ntranslation and the nonadiabatic operators are, up to completely determined\nnumerical phase factors, just ordinary exponentials whose exponents are\nexplicitly expressible in terms of the canonical variables, all of the factors\nin the factorization are explicitly constructed.

In this\nintroduction paper, at first, it is explicitly explained what is the main\nmisconception in the claim of the unconditional security for QKD theory. In\ngeneral terms, the cause of the misunderstanding on the security claim is the\nLemma in the paper of Renner. It suggests that the generation of the perfect\nrandom key is assured by the probability $ (1-d)$, and its failure probability\nis $d$. Thus, it concludes that the generated key provides the perfect random\nkey sequence when the protocol suceeds. So the QKD provides perfect secrecy to\nthe one time pad. This is the reason for the composition claim. However, the\nquantity of the trace distance (or variational distance) is not the probability\nfor such an event. If $d $ is not small enough, always the generated key\nsequence is not uniform. Now one needs the reconstruction of the evaluation of\nthe trace distance if one wants to use it. One should first go back to the\nindistinguishability theory in the computational complexity based, and to\nclarify the meaning of the value of the variational distance.

Classical theory, being\nfully deterministic, completely excludes fundamental randomness. On the\ncontrary, quantum theory allows for randomness within its axiomatic structure.\nYet, the fact that a theory makes prediction only in probabilistic terms does\nnot imply the existence of any form of randomness in nature. The question then\nremains whether one can certify randomness independent of the physical\nframework used. While standard Bell tests approach this question from this\nperspective, they require prior perfect randomness, which renders the approach\ncircular. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to certify full\nrandomness using almost perfect random bits. Here, we prove that full\nrandomness can indeed be certified using quantum non-locality under the minimal\npossible assumptions: the existence of a source of arbitrarily weak (but\nnon-zero) randomness and the impossibility of instantaneous signalling. Thus we\nare left with a strict dichotomic choice: either our world is fully\ndeterministic or there exist in nature events that are fully random.

This is a\none-dimensional, discrete analogy of the hydrogen negative ion H$^-$ problem.\nThere are several different types of bound states in this system, each of which\nappears in a specific region. For given $V$, there exists a (positive) critical\nvalue $U_{c1}$ of $U$, below which the ground state is a bound state.\nInterestingly, close to the critical value ($U\\lesssim U_{c1}$), the ground\nstate can be described by the Chandrasekhar-type variational wave function,\nwhich was initially proposed for H$^-$. For $U>U_{c1}$, the ground state is no\nlonger a bound state. However, there exists a second (larger) critical value\n$U_{c2}$ of $U$, above which a molecule-type bound state is established and\nstabilized by the repulsion. We have also tried to solve for the eigenstates of\nthe model using the Bethe ansatz. The model possesses a global $\\Zz_2$-symmetry\n(parity) which allows classification of all eigenstates into even and odd ones.\nIt is found that all states with odd-parity have the Bethe form, but none of\nthe states in the even-parity sector. This allows us to identify analytically\ntwo odd-parity bound states, which appear in the parameter regions $-2V<U<-V$\nand $-V<U<0$, respectively. Remarkably, the latter one can be \\textit{embedded}\nin the continuum spectrum with appropriate parameters. Moreover, in part of\nthese regions, there exists an even-parity bound state accompanying the\ncorresponding odd-parity bound state with almost the same energy. \n\n"}

The partial knowledge of the attacker is\nmeasured as the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and\nthe uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in QKD. We provide direct\nproofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in the\ninformation-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability\nas used in the Universal Composability (UC) framework.

For two-player nonlocal games, it is\nknown that both the classical and the non-signaling value of any game converges\nto zero exponentially fast under parallel repetition, given that the game is\nnon-trivial to start with (i.e., has classical/non-signaling value <1). Very\nrecent results show similar behavior for the quantum value of a two-player game\nunder parallel repetition. For nonlocal games with three or more players, very\nlittle is known up to present on their behavior under parallel repetition; this\nis true for the classical, the quantum and the non-signaling value.\n  In this work, we show a parallel repetition theorem for the non-signaling\nvalue of a large class of multi-player games, for an arbitrary number of\nplayers. Our result applies to all multi-player games for which all possible\ncombinations of questions have positive probability; this class in particular\nincludes all free games, in which the questions to the players are chosen\nindependently. Specifically, we prove that if the original game has a\nnon-signaling value smaller than 1, then the non-signaling value of the\n$n$-fold parallel repetition is exponentially small in $n$.\n  Our parallel repetition theorem for multi-player games is weaker than the\nknown parallel repetition results for two-player games in that the rate at\nwhich the non-signaling value of the game decreases not only depends on the\nnon-signaling value of the original game (and the number of possible\nresponses), but on the complete description of the game. Nevertheless, we feel\nthat our result is a first step towards a better understanding of the parallel\nrepetition of nonlocal games with more than two players. \n\n"}

In 1999, Peres conjectured\nthat Bell nonlocality is equivalent to distillability of entanglement. The\nintuition of Peres was that the non-classicality of an entangled state, as\nwitnessed via Bell inequality violation, implies that pure entanglement can be\ndistilled from this state, hence making it useful for most quantum information\nprotocols.

To\nfind out the result of a measurement on a particular circuit, we consider a\nweighted distribution of histories between some initial and final time, such\nthat each individually obeys ordinary quantum mechanics. The weight of a\nparticular history is given by a joint distribution over the values of a part\nof the system dubbed the time machine, at two chosen times.

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural\nmachine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be\njointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed\nrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of\nencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into\na fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this\npaper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in\nimproving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and\npropose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for\nparts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,\nwithout having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly.

Firstly, since the pure states are\nuncorrelated from the environment, the statement forms a no-go result against\nthe most straightforward device-independent protocol for randomness or secure\nkey generation against general no-signaling adversaries. It also leads to the\ninteresting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local\ncorrelations with the adversary.

In contrast, the best known parallel repetition theorem for the\nclassical value of two-player free games is $\\mathrm{val}(G^{\\otimes n}) \\leq\n(1 - \\epsilon^2)^{\\Omega(n/s)}$, due to Barak, et al. (RANDOM 2009). This\nsuggests the possibility of a separation between the behavior of entangled and\nclassical free games under parallel repetition.\n  Our second theorem handles the broader class of free games $G$ where the\nplayers can output (possibly entangled) quantum states. For such games, the\nrepeated entangled value is upper bounded by $(1 -\n\\epsilon^2)^{\\Omega(n/sk^2)}$. We also show that the dependence of the exponent\non $k$ is necessary: we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n \\geq 1$ such\nthat $\\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\\otimes n}) \\geq \\mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$.\n  Our analysis exploits the novel connection between communication protocols\nand quantum parallel repetition, first explored by Chailloux and Scarpa (ICALP\n2014). We demonstrate that better communication protocols yield better parallel\nrepetition theorems: our first theorem crucially uses a quantum search protocol\nby Aaronson and Ambainis, which gives a quadratic speed-up for distributed\nsearch problems. Finally, our results apply to a broader class of games than\nwere previously considered before; in particular, we obtain the first parallel\nrepetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players, and for\ngames involving quantum outputs. \n\n"}

Because no photon is\nexcited in each cavity, decoherence caused by the photon decay is suppressed\nduring the transfer. In addition, only one coupler qubit and one operational\nstep are needed and no classical pulses are used in this proposal, thus the\nengineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified.\nWe further give a numerical analysis, showing that high-fidelity transfer of a\nthree-qubit $W$ state is feasible within the present circuit QED technique.

We elucidate how the paradox\nmanifests as a limitation of semiclassical theory, rather than presents a\nconflict between fundamental principles. Two principal features of the\nfundamental and semiclassical theories address two versions of the paradox: the\nentanglement and typicality arguments. First, the physical Hilbert space\ndescribing excitations on a fixed black hole background in the semiclassical\ntheory is exponentially smaller than the number of physical states in the\nfundamental theory of quantum gravity. Second, in addition to the Hilbert space\nfor physical excitations, the semiclassical theory possesses an unphysically\nlarge Fock space built by creation and annihilation operators on the fixed\nblack hole background.

Potential applications of such\nquantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error\ncorrection, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom\nlasers, and superconducting quantum circuits.\n  A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear\nsystems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear\nsystem.

Applications Abstract: In this work, which is based on our previously derived theoretical framework\n[1], we apply the truncated Born-Bogoliubov-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY)\nhierarchy for ultracold bosonic systems with a fixed number of particles to two\nout-of-equilibrium scenarios, namely tunneling in a double-well potential and\nan interaction quench in a harmonic trap. The efficient formulation of the\ntheory provided in [1] allows for going to large truncation orders such that\nthe impact of the truncation order on the accuracy of the results can be\nsystematically explored. While the short-time dynamics is found to be\nexcellently described with controllable accuracy, significant deviations occur\non a longer time-scale for a sufficiently strong interaction quench or the\ntunneling scenario.

This paper builds\nupon the algorithmic insight that bitwidth of operations in DNNs can be reduced\nwithout compromising their classification accuracy. However, to prevent\naccuracy loss, the bitwidth varies significantly across DNNs and it may even be\nadjusted for each layer. Thus, a fixed-bitwidth accelerator would either offer\nlimited benefits to accommodate the worst-case bitwidth requirements, or lead\nto a degradation in final accuracy. To alleviate these deficiencies, this work\nintroduces dynamic bit-level fusion/decomposition as a new dimension in the\ndesign of DNN accelerators. We explore this dimension by designing Bit Fusion,\na bit-flexible accelerator, that constitutes an array of bit-level processing\nelements that dynamically fuse to match the bitwidth of individual DNN layers.\nThis flexibility in the architecture enables minimizing the computation and the\ncommunication at the finest granularity possible with no loss in accuracy.

The contributions of this work are threefold. First of all,\nwe build upon the abstract theory of boundaries and domain walls of topological\nphases of matter to comprehensively catalog the objects realizable in color\ncodes. Together with our classification we also provide lattice representations\nof these objects which include three new types of boundaries as well as a\ngenerating set for all 72 color code twist defects.

Secondly, we discover a number of interesting new applications of\nthe cataloged objects for quantum information protocols. These include improved\nmethods for performing quantum computations by code deformation, a new\nfour-qubit error-detecting code, as well as families of new quantum\nerror-correcting codes we call stellated color codes, which encode logical\nqubits at the same distance as the next best color code, but using\napproximately half the number of physical qubits.

We suppose the\ntwo atoms prepared in a correlated, symmetric or antisymmetric, state. Since\nthe atoms start from a nonequilibrium conditions, their interaction energy is\ntime dependent. We obtain, at second order in the atom-field coupling, an\nanalytic expression for the time-dependent resonance interaction energy between\nthe atoms. We show that this interaction vanishes when the two atoms are\noutside the light-cone of each other, in agreement with relativistic causality,\nwhile it instantaneously settles to its stationary value after time $t=R/c$\n($R$ being the interatomic distance), as obtained in a time-independent\napproach. We also investigate the time-dependent electric energy density in the\nspace around the two correlated atoms, in both cases of antisymmetric\n(subradiant) and symmetric (superradiant) states, during the dressing process\nof our two-atom system.

In the generic\ncase, the power of particle emission is found to be proportional to the inverse\nsquare of the remaining time to the Cauchy horizon (CH). The constant of\nproportion can be arbitrarily large in the limit to marginally naked\nsingularity. Therefore, the unbounded power is especially striking in the case\nthat an event horizon is very close to the CH because the emitted energy can be\narbitrarily large in spite of a cutoff expected from quantum gravity.

We show how the two\nmodes get entangled by evolution to produce a coherent superposition of vortex\nstates in general, and a single vortex state under certain conditions. The\ndegree of entanglement between the modes is measured by finding the explicit\nanalytical dependence of the Von Neumann entropy on the system parameters.

This means that the detailed\ntopology, both local and global, of the classical phase space may reveal, or\ninfluence, the entangling power of the quantum system. As it has been shown in\nthe literature, the bifurcation points, in autonomous dynamical systems, play a\ncrucial role for the onset of entanglement. Similarly, the existence of scars\namong the quantum states seems to be a factor in the dynamics of entanglement.\nHere we study these issues for a non-autonomous system, the Quantum Kicked Top,\nas a collective model of a multi-qubit system.

This\npaper answers the question: can descriptions such as these, of $\\rho_{ss}$ as a\nstationary ensemble of pure states, be physically realized? An ensemble of pure\nstates for a particular system can be physically realized if, without changing\nthe dynamics of the system, an experimenter can (in principle) know at any time\nthat the system is in one of the pure-state members of the ensemble. Such\nknowledge can be obtained by monitoring the baths to which the system is\ncoupled, provided that coupling is describable by a Markovian master equation.\nUsing a family of master equations for the (atom) laser, we solve for the\nphysically realizable (PR) ensembles.

We give the specific\ntransformations to i) the more general quadratic (TQ) Schr\\\"odinger equation\nand to ii) a different time-dependent oscillator (TO) equation. For each\nSchr\\\"odinger system, we give the Lie algebra of space-time symmetries, the\nnumber states, the coherent states, the squeezed-states and the time-dependent\n<x>, <p>, (\\Delta x)^2, (\\Delta p)^2, and uncertainty product. \n\n"}
