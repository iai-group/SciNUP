Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity\nnear the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected\nover a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or skew an apparent\ncorrelation where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright. Although\nsuch correlations may be obfuscated by a middle step where GRBs need to be\nbright enough to have their actual redshifts determined, it is found that the\nbias is generally pervasive. This result is derived here through simulations\nconvolving a wide variety of possible GRB brightnesses and spectra with the\nBATSE Large Area Detectors (LAD) detection thresholds. The presented analyses\nindicate that the rest-frame $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectrum peak energy of\nlong-duration GRBs, $\\epi$, is not a good cosmological standard candle without\nsignificant corrections for selection effects. Therefore, the appearance of\n$\\epi$ in seeming correlations such as the Amati ($E_{iso}-\\epi$), Ghirlanda\n($E_{\\gamma}-\\epi$), and $L_{iso}-\\epi$ relations is statistically real but\nstrongly influenced by so far uncalibrated GRB detector thresholds. \n\n"}

To minimize\nflavor violation, the fermion mass generation is still due to one light doublet\nscalar. One of the realizations is the Bosonic Technicolor model. In these\nscenarios, the Yukawa couplings between the light scalar and the standard model\nfermions are in general enhanced while the couplings between the light scalar\nand weak gauge bosons are reduced. Even though the flavor violation induced by\nthe neutral scalar at the tree level can be avoided, the charged scalar state\ninevitably mediate flavor changing neutral current processes. With the\nenhancement in the Yukawa couplings, one expects serious constraints of such\nmodels from flavor violating effects. We find that the most severe bound comes\nfrom neutral meson mixing of $B^{0}_{d}-\\bar{B^{0}_{d}}$. Large parameter space\nis excluded if the weak gauge boson mass generation is dominated by the\nfermophobic sector. However, the correlation between the Yukawa coupling and\ncharged scalar mass show that a factor of two enhancement in top Yukawa\ncoupling is still allowed for charged scalar heavier than 500 GeV.

We find that gluon fusion\ncan be suppressed by more than an order of magnitude when the scalar mass is\nbelow a few hundred GeV, while milder suppressions occur for larger scalar\nmasses or smaller couplings. Thus, the standard model extended with only one\nparticle can evade the full range of present LHC exclusion limits on the Higgs\nmass. The colored scalars, however, would be produced in pairs with a large\nrate at the LHC, leading to multi-jet final states to which the LHC experiments\nare now becoming sensitive. \n\n"}

For this purpose, we use a source of alpha particles in the NEXT-DEMO\ntime projection chamber, the large scale prototype of the NEXT-100 neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay experiment, in three different drift electric field\nconfigurations. We measure the ionization electron drift velocity and\nlongitudinal diffusion, and compare our results to expectations based on\navailable electron scattering cross sections on pure xenon. In addition, two\ntypes of measurements addressing the connection between the ionization and\nscintillation yields are performed. On the one hand we observe, for the first\ntime in xenon gas, large event-by-event correlated fluctuations between the\nionization and scintillation signals, similar to that already observed in\nliquid xenon. On the other hand, we study the field dependence of the average\nscintillation and ionization yields. Both types of measurements may shed light\non the mechanism of electron-ion recombination in xenon gas for highly-ionizing\nparticles.

The second method uses the experimentally reconstructed shape of the\n$\\sqrt{s'}$ spectrum to determine the Beamstrahlung component of the bias. The\nlast, recently proposed, collision-frame method relies on the reconstruction of\nthe collision-frame velocity to define the selection function in the collision\nframe both in experiment and in theory. Thus the luminosity expression is\ninsensitive to the difference between the CM frame of the collision and the lab\nframe. The collision-frame method is independent of the knowledge of the beam\nparameters, and it allows an accurate reconstruction of the luminosity spectrum\nabove 80 % of the nominal CM energy.

One of major challenges for a detector such as the proposed\nInternational Large Detector (ILD) is to provide excellent momentum resolution\nin a magnetic filed with small (but non-negligible) non-uniformity. The\nnon-uniform magnetic field implies deviation from a helical track and hence\nrequires the extension of a helical track model used for track fitting in a\nuniform magnetic field. In this paper, a segment-wise helical track model is\nintroduced as such an extension. The segment-wise helical track model\napproximates the magnetic field between two nearby measurement sites to be\nuniform and steps between the two sites along a helix. The helix frame is then\ntransformed according to the new magnetic field direction for the next step, so\nas to take into account the non-uniformity of the magnetic field. Details of\nthe algorithm and mathematical aspects of the segment-wise helical track model\nin a Kalman-filter-based track fitting in the non-uniform magnetic field are\nelaborated. The new track model is implemented and successfully tested in the\nframework of the Kalman filter tracking software package, KalTest, which was\noriginally developed for tracking in a uniform magnetic field. \n\n"}

Three of the ubiquitous jet-based observables---jet\nmultiplicity, summed scalar transverse momentum, and missing transverse\nmomentum---have event shape counterparts that are closely correlated with their\njet-based cousins. Due to their \"local\" computational structure, these jet-like\nevent shapes could potentially be used for trigger-level event selection at the\nLHC.

The experiment\nwill therefore have to cope with a much larger machine background than its\npredecessor Belle, in particular from events outside of the interaction region.\nWe present the concept of a track trigger, based on a neural network approach,\nthat is able to suppress a large fraction of this background by reconstructing\nthe $z$ (longitudinal) position of the event vertex within the latency of the\nfirst level trigger. The trigger uses the hit information from the Central\nDrift Chamber (CDC) of Belle II within narrow cones in polar and azimuthal\nangle as well as in transverse momentum (\"sectors\"), and estimates the\n$z$-vertex without explicit track reconstruction. The preprocessing for the\ntrack trigger is based on the track information provided by the standard CDC\ntrigger. It takes input from the 2D track finder, adds information from the\nstereo wires of the CDC, and finds the appropriate sectors in the CDC for each\ntrack. Within the sector, the $z$-vertex is estimated by a specialized neural\nnetwork, with the drift times from the CDC as input and a continuous output\ncorresponding to the scaled $z$-vertex. The neural algorithm will be\nimplemented in programmable hardware. To this end a Virtex 7 FPGA board will be\nused, which provides at present the most promising solution for a fully\nparallelized implementation of neural networks or alternative multivariate\nmethods.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion. This feature invokes fake CP-asymmetry\nlike the SM matter effect and can severely affect the leptonic CP-violation\nsearches in long-baseline experiments.

With the\napproximation that the production vertex of the Higgs boson and toponia is\ncontact, and neglecting the P-wave toponia, we analytically calculated the\ndensity matrix for the production and decay of the toponia. Under these\nassumptions, the production spectrum of the toponia is solely determined by the\nspin quantum number, therefore the toponia can be either singlet or triplet. We\nfind that the production rate of the singlet toponium is highly suppressed, and\nbehaves just like the production of a P-wave toponia. In the case of the\ntriplet toponium, three completely independent CP observables, namely azimuthal\nangles of lepton and anti-lepton in the toponium rest-frame as well as their\nsum, are predicted based on our analytical results, and checked by using the\ntree-level event generator. The non-trivial correlations come from the\nlongitudinal-transverse interferences for the azimuthal angles of leptons, and\nthe transverse-transverse interference for their sum. These three observables\nare well defined at the ILC, where the rest frame of the toponium can be\nreconstructed directly.

The main conclusions are as follows. 1) Larger, more\ncapable computing and data facilities are needed to support HEP science goals\nin all three frontiers: Energy, Intensity, and Cosmic. The expected scale of\nthe demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in\nsome cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data\nproduced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities\nand researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new\ntechniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes\nfrom HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and\nanalyze large and complex data volumes. Appropriately configured\nleadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling\nscientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC\nsimulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP\nexperiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate\ninterdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be\nrequired to meet HEP's research needs. To best use ASCR HPC resources the\nexperimental HEP program needs a) an established long-term plan for access to\nASCR computational and data resources, b) an ability to map workflows onto HPC\nresources, c) the ability for ASCR facilities to accommodate workflows run by\ncollaborations that can have thousands of individual members, d) to transition\ncodes to the next-generation HPC platforms that will be available at ASCR\nfacilities, e) to build up and train a workforce capable of developing and\nusing simulations and analysis to support HEP scientific research on\nnext-generation systems. \n\n"}

Unlike the WIMP-nucleon scattering, where current\nexperiments probe typical interaction strengths much smaller than the Fermi\nconstant, the scattering on electrons requires a much stronger interaction to\nbe detectable, which in turn requires new light force carriers. We account for\nsuch new forces explicitly, by introducing a mediator particle with scalar or\nvector couplings to dark matter and to electrons.

This will be done by constructing\nseveral single-mask triple-GEM detectors, using foils manufactured by\nTech-Etch, which follow the design used by the STAR Forward GEM Tracker (FGT).\nThese detectors will investigate ways in which to further decrease the material\nbudget and increase the efficiency of the detector by incorporating perforated\nKapton spacer rings rather than G10 spacing grids to reduce the dead area of\nthe detector. The materials and tooling needed to assemble the triple-GEM\ndetectors have been acquired. The GEM foils have been electrically tested, and\na handful have been optically scanned. We found these results to be consistent\nwith GEM foils produced by CERN. With the success of these initial tests,\nconstruction of the triple-GEM detectors is now under way. \n\n"}

In situ techniques exploit the transverse momentum balance\nbetween a jet and a reference object such as a photon, $Z$ boson, or multijet\nsystem for jets with $20 < p_{T} < 2000$ GeV and pseudorapidities of\n$|\\eta|<4.5$, using both data and simulation. An uncertainty in the jet energy\nscale of less than 1% is found in the central calorimeter region ($|\\eta| <\n1.2$) for jets with $100 < p_{T} < 500$ GeV. An uncertainty of about 4.5% is\nfound for low-$p_{T}$ jets with $p_{T} = 20$ GeV in the central region,\ndominated by uncertainties in the corrections for multiple proton-proton\ninteractions. The calibration of forward jets ($|\\eta| > 0.8$) is derived from\ndijet $p_{T}$ balance measurements.

Results are presented on the reconstruction of Michel\nelectrons produced by the decay at rest of cosmic-ray muons. Michel electrons\nare abundantly produced in the TPC, and given their well known energy spectrum\ncan be used to study MicroBooNE's detector response to low-energy electrons\n(electrons with energies up to ~50 MeV). We describe the fully-automated\nalgorithm developed to reconstruct Michel electrons, with which a sample of\n~14,000 Michel electron candidates is obtained. Most of this article is\ndedicated to studying the impact of radiative photons produced by Michel\nelectrons on the accuracy and resolution of their energy measurement. In this\nenergy range, ionization and bremsstrahlung photon production contribute\nsimilarly to electron energy loss in argon, leading to a complex electron\ntopology in the TPC. By profiling the performance of the reconstruction\nalgorithm on simulation we show that the ability to identify and include energy\ndeposited by radiative photons leads to a significant improvement in the energy\nmeasurement of low-energy electrons.

Determining the exact values of neutrino mass and mixing\nparameters is crucial to test neutrino models and flavor symmetries. In the\nfirst part of this review, we summarize the current status of neutrino\noscillation parameters.

We\nimplement the data from the reactor experiments KamLAND, Daya Bay, RENO and\nDouble Chooz as well as the long baseline data from MINOS, T2K and NOvA. If in\naddition to the standard interactions, neutrinos have subdominant Non-Standard\nInteractions (NSI) with matter, extracting the values of these parameters will\nsuffer from new degeneracies. We review such effects and formulate the\nconditions on the NSI parameters under which the precision measurement of\nneutrino oscillation parameters can be distorted.

In order to do\nthat we calculate the current CPT bound on all the neutrino mixing parameters\nand study the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to such an observable.\n  After deriving the most updated bound on CPT from neutrino oscillation data,\nwe show that, if the recent T2K results turn out to be the true values of\nneutrino and antineutrino oscillations, DUNE would measure the fallout of CPT\nconservation at more than 3$\\sigma$. Then, we study the sensitivity of the\nexperiment to measure CPT invariance in general, finding that DUNE will be able\nto improve the current bounds on $\\Delta(\\Delta m^2_{31})$ by at least one\norder of magnitude. We also study the sensitivity to the other oscillation\nparameters. Finally we show that, if CPT is violated in nature, combining\nneutrino with antineutrino data in oscillation analysis will produce imposter\nsolutions. \n\n"}

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC).

Novel technical results are\npresented to determine the performance of an estimator that corresponds to the\nsolution of an optimization problem in the context of astrometry. Using these\nresults we are able to place stringent bounds on the bias and the variance of\nthe estimators in close form as a function of the data. We confirm these\nresults through comparisons to numerical simulations under a broad range of\nrealistic observing conditions. The maximum likelihood and the weighted least\nsquare estimators are analyzed. We confirm the sub-optimality of the weighted\nleast squares scheme from medium to high signal-to-noise found in an earlier\nstudy for the (unweighted) least squares method. We find that the maximum\nlikelihood estimator achieves optimal performance limits across a wide range of\nrelevant observational conditions. Furthermore, from our results, we provide\nconcrete insights for adopting an adaptive weighted least square estimator that\ncan be regarded as a computationally efficient alternative to the optimal\nmaximum likelihood solution. We provide, for the first time, close-form\nanalytical expressions that bound the bias and the variance of the weighted\nleast square and maximum likelihood implicit estimators for astrometry using a\nPoisson-driven detector. These expressions can be used to formally assess the\nprecision attainable by these estimators in comparison with the minimum\nvariance bound. \n\n"}

In the\nHamamatsu SiPM the high-field region is located $0.5\\,\\mu$m below the surface,\nwhile the volume above is depleted almost until the surface. Furthermore, for\nthe Hamamatsu SiPM we find that charge carriers produced by optical-crosstalk\nphotons enter a cell below the avalanche region as opposed to an earlier device\nwhere most of the photons enter a cell from above. In the here tested Hamamatsu\ndevice the crosstalk photons probably absorb in the bulk and the generated\nholes diffuse into the active volume of the cell within 2\\,ns and initiate a\nbreakdown. The present paper is an attempt to spur further interest in the use\nof the bias dependence of the breakdown probability and establish it as a\nstandard tool not only to determine the location of the high-field region but\nalso to determine the origin of charge carriers relative to the high-field\nregion. With the knowledge of where the charges come from it should be possible\nto further improve the optical crosstalk, dark count, and afterpulsing\ncharacteristics of SiPM. \n\n"}

A superfluid helium target has\nseveral advantageous properties, including a light nuclear mass for better\nkinematic matching with light dark matter particles, copious production of\nscintillation light, extremely good intrinsic radiopurity, a high impedance to\nexternal vibration noise, and a unique mechanism for observing phonon-like\nmodes via liberation of $^4$He atoms into a vacuum (`quantum evaporation'). In\nthis concept, both scintillation photons and triplet excimers are detected\nusing calorimeters, including calorimeters immersed in the superfluid.

Such information could be useful in developing a\nstaged approach to the full collider project with an initial lower-cost version\nfocused on achieving some of the primary scientific objectives. Here we\ninvestigate the precision obtainable for the $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow Z h\n\\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^- X$ inclusive cross section and the Higgs boson mass\nusing the di-muon recoil method, considering a detector that has only an inner\ntracking system within a solenoidal magnetic field, surrounded by many nuclear\ninteraction lengths of absorbing material, and an outer muon identification\nsystem. We find that the sensitivity achievable in these measurements with such\na tracking detector is only marginally reduced compared to that expected for a\ngeneral purpose detector with additional electromagnetic and hadronic\ncalorimeter systems. The difference results mainly from multi-photon\nbackgrounds that are not as easily rejected with tracking detectors. We also\ncomment on the prospects for an analogous measurement of the inclusive cross\nsection $\\sigma( e^+ e^- \\to Z h \\to e^+ e^- X)$.

First, we perform an analysis of the Super Kamiokande and SNO data\nto investigate their sensitivity to such interactions.

Second, we suggest that the\nBorexino detector can provide good signatures for these non-standard\ninteractions. Indeed, in Borexino the shape of the recoil electron spectrum\nfrom the \\nu e \\to \\nu e scattering essentially does not depend on the solar\nneutrino conversion details, since most of the signal comes from the\nmono-energetic ^7Be neutrinos.

An experimental system built for this\npurpose collected and processed GPS data to automatically generate a times\nseries of the interferometric complex field (ICF). The ICF was analyzed off\nline and compared to a simple developed model that relates ICF coherence time\nto the ratio of significant wave height (SWH) and mean wave period (MWP). The\nanalysis using this model showed good consistency between the ICF coherence\ntime and nearby oceanographic buoy data. Based on this result, preliminary\nconclusions are drawn on the potential of coastal GNSS-R for sea state\nmonitoring using semi-empirical modeling to relate GNSS-R ICF coherence time to\nSWH. \n\n"}

New methods\nmust be developed to handle this data and make analysis at universities\npossible. Grid Computing is one method; however, the data must be cached at the\nvarious Grid nodes. We examine some storage techniques that exploit recent\ndevelopments in commodity hardware. Disk arrays using RAID level 5 (RAID-5)\ninclude both parity and striping.

{"id": "physics/9812027", "contents": "Title: Taber Vibration Isolator for Vacuum and Cryogenic Applications Abstract: We present a procedure for the design and construction of a passive,\nmultipole, mechanical high-stop vibration isolator. The isolator, consisting of\na stack of metal disks connected by thin wires, attenuates frequencies in the\nkilohertz range, and is suited to both vacuum and cryogenic environments. We\nderive an approximate analytical model and compare its predictions for the\nfrequencies of the normal modes to those of a finite element analysis. The\nanalytical model is exact for the modes involving only motion along and\nrotation about the longitudinal axis, and it gives a good approximate\ndescription of the transverse modes. These results show that the high-frequency\nbehavior of a multi-stage isolator is well characterized by the natural\nfrequencies of a single stage. From the single-stage frequency formulae, we\nderive relationships among the various geometrical parameters of the isolator\nto guarantee equal attenuation in all degrees of freedom. We then derive\nexpressions for the attenuation attainable with a given isolator length, and\nfind that the most important limiting factor is the elastic limit of the spring\nwire material. For our application, which requires attenuations of 250 dB at 1\nkHz, our model specifies a six-stage design using brass disks of approximately\n2 cm in both radius and thickness, connected by 3 cm steel wires of diameters\nranging from 25 to 75 microns. We describe the construction of this isolator in\ndetail, and compare measurements of the natural frequencies of a single stage\nwith calculations from the analytical model and the finite element package. For\ntranslations along and rotations about the longitudinal axes, all three results\nare in agreement to within 10% accuracy. \n\n"}
