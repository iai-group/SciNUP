At the order $\\cal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$,\ntwist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit\nthe Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon\nbremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon\nscattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark\n(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the\nratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is\nnot negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The\nmodifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark\nannihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)\ndistribution density in the medium.

In spite of\nthe fact that we used the simplified kernel, we believe that the main result of\nthe paper: the small ($\\leq 40%$) suppression of the inclusive productiondue to\nenergy conservation, reflects a general feature.

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts.

The matter comprised of\nhalf skyrmions has vanishing quark condensate but non-vanishing pion decay\nconstant and could be interpreted as a hadronic dual of strong-coupled quark\nmatter.

The\ntemperature, T, and chemical potential, mu, dependent parameters describing the\nrho-meson --its width, mass and leptonic decay constant-- are determined from\nfinite energy QCD sum rules. Results show that the rho-meson width increases\nwhereas its mass and leptonic decay constant decrease near the (chemical\npotential-dependent) critical temperature T_c(mu) for chiral symmetry\nrestoration/quark-gluon deconfinement. As a consequence, starting from T_c(mu),\nfor a short lived cooling the main effect is a broadening of the dimuon\ndistribution. However, when the evolution brings the system to a lower\nfreeze-out temperature, with the rho-meson parameters approaching their vacuum\nvalues, the dimuon distribution shows a broad peak centered at the vacuum\nrho-meson mass.

The model has a single free parameter that we fit to a single\nexperimental measurement. We then confront our model with experimental data on\nmany other jet observables, focusing here on boson-jet observables, finding\nthat it provides a good description of present jet data. Next, we provide the\npredictions of our hybrid model for many measurements to come, including those\nfor inclusive jet, dijet, photon-jet and Z-jet observables in heavy ion\ncollisions with energy $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ ATeV coming soon at the LHC.

First, we assume a\nconstant magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{m}$ and consider an ultrarelativistic\nideal gas equation of state. For a paramagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}>0$), the decay of the energy density slows down since the fluid gains\nenergy from the magnetic field. For a diamagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}<0$), the energy density decays faster because it feeds energy into\nthe magnetic field. Furthermore, when the magnetic field is taken to be\nexternal and to decay in proper time $\\tau$ with a power law $\\sim\\tau^{-a}$,\ntwo distinct solutions can be found depending on the values of $a$ and\n$\\chi_m$. Finally, we also solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamical equations for\none-dimensional Bjorken flow with a temperature-dependent magnetic\nsusceptibility and a realistic equation of state given by lattice-QCD data.

We\ncalculate the spectral functions $\\rho_{\\sigma, \\pi}(\\omega,\\, p)$ in the\nscalar ($\\sigma$) and pseudoscalar ($\\pi$) channels beyond the random phase\napproximation in the quark--meson model. At finite baryon chemical potential\n$\\mu$ with a finite quark mass, the baryon-number fluctuation is coupled to the\nscalar channel and the spectral function in the $\\sigma$ channel has a support\nnot only in the time-like ($\\omega\\,>\\,p$) but also in the space-like\n($\\omega\\,<\\, p$) regions, which correspond to the mesonic and the\nparticle--hole phonon excitations, respectively. We find that the energy of the\npeak position of the latter becomes vanishingly small with the height being\nenhanced as the system approaches the QCD critical point, which is a\nmanifestation of the fact that the phonon mode is the {\\em soft mode}\nassociated with the second-order transition at the QCD critical point, as has\nbeen suggested by some authors.

Decays of such a\nvector into a pair of SM particles, either fermions or EW bosons, are well\nstudied. Many of these models have an additional scalar, which can lead to (and\neven dominate in certain parameter regions) a novel decay channel for the heavy\nvector particles instead - into a SM EW boson and the scalar, which\nsubsequently decays into a SM EW boson pair. In this work, we focus on the\nscalar being relatively heavy, roughly factor of two lighter than the vector\nparticles, rendering its decay products well separated. Such a cascade decay\nresults in a final state with three isolated bosons. We argue that for this\n\"triboson\" signal the existing diboson searches are not quite optimal due to\ncombinatorial ambiguity for three identical bosons, and in addition, due to a\nrelatively small signal cross-section determined by the heaviness of the\ndecaying vector particle. In order to isolate the signal, we demonstrate that\ntagging all three bosons, followed by use of the full triboson invariant mass\ndistribution as well as that of appropriate subsets of dibosons, is well\nmotivated. We develop these general strategies in detail within the context of\na specific class of models that are based on extensions of the standard warped\nextra-dimensional scenario. We also point out that a similar analysis would\napply to models with an enlarged EW gauge sector in four dimensions, even if\nthey involve a different Lorentz structure for the relevant couplings. \n\n"}

{"id": "1712.00394", "contents": "Title: Chiral magnetic effect search in p+Au, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at RHIC Abstract: Metastable domains of fluctuating topological charges can change the\nchirality of quarks and induce local parity violation in quantum\nchromodynamics. This can lead to observable charge separation along the\ndirection of the strong magnetic field produced by spectator protons in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic\neffect (CME). A major background source for CME measurements using the\ncharge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\\Delta\\gamma$) is the intrinsic\nparticle correlations (such as resonance decays) coupled with the azimuthal\nelliptical anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In heavy-ion collisions, the magnetic field\ndirection and event plane angle are correlated, thus the CME and the\n$v_{2}$-induced background are entangled. In this report, we present two\nstudies from STAR to shed further lights on the background issue. (1) The\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ should be all background in small system p+Au and d+Au\ncollisions, because the event plane angles are dominated by geometry\nfluctuations uncorrelated to the magnetic field direction. However, significant\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ is observed, comparable to the peripheral Au+Au data, suggesting\na background dominance in the latter, and likely also in the mid-central Au+Au\ncollisions where the multiplicity and $v_{2}$ scaled correlator is similar.

The late-time transition in the spectral energy\ndistribution to near-infrared wavelengths was interpreted as indicating the\nproduction of lanthanide nuclei, with atomic mass number A>140. However,\ncompelling evidence for the presence of heavier third-peak r-process elements\n(e.g., gold, platinum) or translead nuclei remains elusive. At early times\n(~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble\nof beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense,\ngenerating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single\npower-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input\ncan possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays, 223Ra\n(half-life t_{1/2}=11.43d), 225Ac (t_{1/2}=10.0d, following the beta-decay of\n225Ra with t_{1/2}=14.9d), and the fissioning isotope 254Cf (t_{1/2}=60.5d),\nwhich liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency\nthan beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations of kilonovae which\nconstrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures of\nthese individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei. In\norder to constrain the bolometric light to the required accuracy, multi-epoch &\nwide-band observations are required with sensitive instruments like the James\nWebb Space Telescope.

As a consequence, the theoretical error is now starting to\nlag behind the experimental one, and a ceaseless effort is required to reduce\nthe theory uncertainty to match the precision of the data. At hadron colliders,\nQCD predictions are obtained by convoluting perturbative parton-level results\nwith non-perturbative PDFs, whose precise determination is crucial to reach\npercent-accurate theoretical predictions. At the parton level, cross sections\nare obtained through a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling. In some\ncases, large terms appear at all orders and spoil the convergence of the\nseries. The perturbative description is rescued by resumming the series to all\norders, thereby making theory calculations accurate in regions where a\nfixed-order treatment is not sufficient. In this thesis I first present two\nglobal PDF sets where fixed-order calculations are supplemented by threshold\nand high-energy resummation, respectively.

We find that there are different regimes for the event shapes,\ndepending on the size of the measured correlator observable, that require the\nuse of different EFT formulations, in which the quark mass and grooming\nparameters may be relevant or not. We use the EFT to resum large logarithms in\nthe energy correlator observable in terms of the momentum of a reconstructed\nheavy hadron to NLL$'$ accuracy and subsequently match it to a full QCD\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$ cross section, which we also compute. We compare our\npredictions to simulations in PYTHIA for $e^+e^-$ collisions. We find a good\nagreement with partonic simulations, as well as hadronic ones with an\nappropriate shape function used to describe nonperturbative effects and the\nheavy quark hadron decay turned off. We also predict the scaling behavior for\nthe leading nonperturbative power correction due to hadronization.\nConsequently, we can give a prediction for the energy correlator distribution\nat the level of the reconstructed heavy hadron. This work provides a general\nframework for the analysis of heavy quark jet substructure observables. \n\n"}

Jet substructure\ntechniques are increasingly used in experimental analyses by the LHC\ncollaborations, both in the context of searching for new physics and for\nStandard Model measurements. On the theory side, the quest for a deeper\nunderstanding of jet substructure algorithms has contributed to a renewed\ninterest in all-order calculations in QCD. This has resulted in new ideas about\nhow to design better observables and how to provide a solid theoretical\ndescription for them. In the last years, jet substructure has seen its scope\nextended, for example, with an increasing impact in the study of heavy-ion\ncollisions, or with the exploration of deep-learning techniques. Furthermore,\njet physics is an area in which experimental and theoretical approaches meet\ntogether, where cross-pollination and collaboration between the two communities\noften bear the fruits of innovative techniques. Despite the wealth of\nliterature on this topic, we feel that a comprehensive and, at the same time,\npedagogical introduction to jet substructure is still missing. This makes the\nendeavour of approaching the field particularly hard, as newcomers have to\ndigest an increasing number of substructure algorithms and techniques, too\noften characterised by opaque terminology and jargon.

It uses the real-time evolution\nof parton cascades in conjunction with a self-consistent hadronization scheme,\nas well as the development of hadron cascades after hadronization. The causal\nevolution from a specific initial state (determined by the colliding beam\nparticles) is followed by the time-development of the phase-space densities of\npartons, pre-hadronic parton clusters, and final-state hadrons, in\nposition-space, momentum-space and color-space. The parton-evolution is\ndescribed in terms of a space-time generalization of the familiar\nmomentum-space description of multiple (semi)hard interactions in QCD,\ninvolving 2 -> 2 parton collisions, 2 -> 1 parton fusion processes, and 1 -> 2\nradiation processes. The formation of color-singlet pre-hadronic clusters and\ntheir decays into hadrons, on the other hand, is treated by using a spatial\ncriterion motivated by confinement and a non-perturbative model for\nhadronization.
