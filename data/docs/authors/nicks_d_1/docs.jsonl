The radial and angular equations are coupled\nvia an angular eigenvalue, which is determined from the Chandrasekhar-Page (CP)\nequation. Obtaining accurate angular eigenvalues is a key step in studying\nscattering, absorption and emission of the fermionic field.\n  Here we introduce a new method for finding solutions of the CP equation.\nFirst, we introduce a novel representation for the spin-half spherical\nharmonics. Next, we decompose the angular solutions of the CP equation (the\nmass-dependent spin-half spheroidal harmonics) in the spherical basis. The\nmethod yields a three-term recurrence relation which may be solved numerically\nvia continued-fraction methods, or perturbatively to obtain a series expansion\nfor the eigenvalues.

Recent investigations show that their presence is not just\nconfined in the infrared, but that they appear in the effective action under\nthe most general kinematical conditions, even if they decouple in the infrared.\nFurther studies reveal that they are responsible for the non-unitary behaviour\nof these theories in the ultraviolet (UV) region.

How these\ncool outflows arise is still in question. Hot gas from supernovae has long been\nsuspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendency\nto destroy the cool gas as the latter is accelerated. We propose a modification\nof the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty.\n  Star formation is observed to take place in clusters; in a given galaxy, the\nbulk of the star formation is found in the ~20 most massive clusters. We show\nthat, for L* galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with M>10^6 M_sun\nis able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circular\nvelocity of the disk galaxy. This cool gas can travel above the galactic disk\nin less than 2 Myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.\nOnce above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, and\nsupernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, which\ndrive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. Because the\nradiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gas\nis more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction if\nthey do eventually encounter hot gas. Therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,\nradiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. We identify these\ncluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. Another implication of\nour model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, are\nable to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism. We\nfind that the critical star formation rates above which large scale cool\noutflows will be launched to be ~0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2, which is in good agreement\nwith observations. \n\n"}

Internal shocks propagating through a jet launched\nby a stellar implosion, are expected to amplify the magnetic field & accelerate\nelectrons. We explore the effects of density asymmetry & a quasi-parallel\nmagnetic field on the collision of plasma clouds. A 2D relativistic PIC\nsimulation models the collision of two plasma clouds, in the presence of a\nquasi-parallel magnetic field. The cloud density ratio is 10. The densities of\nions & electrons & the temperature of 131 keV are equal in each cloud. The mass\nratio is 250. The peak Lorentz factor of the electrons is determined, along\nwith the orientation & strength of the magnetic field at the cloud collision\nboundary. The magnetic field component orthogonal to the initial plasma flow\ndirection is amplified to values that exceed those expected from shock\ncompression by over an order of magnitude. The forming shock is\nquasi-perpendicular due to this amplification, caused by a current sheet which\ndevelops in response to the differing deflection of the incoming upstream\nelectrons & ions. The electron deflection implies a charge separation of the\nupstream electrons & ions; the resulting electric field drags the electrons\nthrough the magnetic field, whereupon they acquire a relativistic mass\ncomparable to the ions. We demonstrate how a magnetic field structure\nresembling the cross section of a flux tube grows in the current sheet of the\nshock transition layer. Plasma filamentation develops, as well as signatures of\northogonal magnetic field striping. Localized magnetic bubbles form. Energy\nequipartition between the ion, electron & magnetic energy is obtained at the\nshock transition layer.

Our analytical and numerical calculations show that, while some of\nthe assumptions underlying the standard evaporation paradigm are borne out,\nseveral are not. One of the anticipated properties we confirm is that the\nsemi-classical space-time is asymptotically flat at right future null infinity,\n$\\spr$, yet incomplete in the sense that null observers reach a future Cauchy\nhorizon in finite affine time. Unexpected behavior includes that the Bondi mass\ntraditionally used in the literature can become negative even when the area of\nthe horizon is macroscopic; an improved Bondi mass remains positive until the\nend of semi-classical evaporation, yet the final value can be arbitrarily large\nrelative to the Planck mass; and the flux of the quantum radiation at $\\spr$ is\nnon-thermal even when the horizon area is large compared to the Planck scale.\nFurthermore, if the black hole is initially macroscopic, the evaporation\nprocess exhibits remarkable universal properties.

The dense\ncores are identified in the simulated density data cube through a clumpfind\nalgorithm. We find that the core velocity dispersion does not show any clear\ndependence on the core size, in contrast to Larson's linewidth-size relation,\nbut consistent with recent observations. In the absence of a magnetic field,\nthe majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions. A\nmoderately-strong magnetic field reduces the dispersion to a subsonic or at\nmost transonic value typically. Most of the cores are out of virial\nequilibrium, with the external pressure dominating the self-gravity. The\nimplication is that the core evolution is largely controlled by the\noutflow-driven turbulence. Even an initially-weak magnetic field can retard\nstar formation significantly, because the field is amplified by the\noutflow-driven turbulence to an equipartition strength, with the distorted\nfield component dominating the uniform one. In contrast, for a\nmoderately-strong field, the uniform component remains dominant. Such a\ndifference in the magnetic structure is evident in our simulated polarization\nmaps of dust thermal emission; it provides a handle on the field strength.\nRecent polarization measurements show that the field lines in cluster-forming\nclumps are spatially well-ordered. It is indicative of a moderately-strong,\ndynamically important, field which, in combination with outflow feedback, can\nkeep the rate of star formation in embedded clusters at the\nobservationally-inferred, relatively-slow rate of several percent per free-fall\ntime. \n\n"}

We recover the sequence in\nassociation of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several\nindicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the\nstellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the\nthree SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and\noccur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter\nshowing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses\nthat are $\\sim$0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of\nold stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time\ndistribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our\nsample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts.\nSince both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN\nrate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts,\nand reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from\nvery old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive\ngalaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass\ngalaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia\nhosts.

Therefore\nthe ratio between the number of CC~SNe and SNe~Ia is expected to increase with\ndecreasing the galaxy mass.

Focusing the study to the\nlarge and small cosmic time $t$ limits, we were able to find which $F(R)$\ngravities can generate the matter bounce Hubble parameter. In the case of small\ncosmic time limit, which corresponds to large curvature values, the $F(R)$\ngravity is $F(R)\\sim R+\\alpha R^2$, which is an inflation generating gravity,\nand at small curvature, or equivalently, large cosmic time, the $F(R)$ gravity\ngenerating the corresponding limit of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, is\n$F(R)\\sim \\frac{1}{R}$, a gravity known to produce late-time acceleration.

Our analysis is\nbased on the idea that the P_T-integrated and the P_T-differential cross\nsections can be treated as two different observables. The colour-octet NRQCD\nparameters needed to predict the P_T-integrated yield can thus be extracted\nfrom the fits of the P_T-differential cross sections at mid and large P_T. For\nthe first time, the total cross section is evaluated in NRQCD at full NLO\naccuracy using the recent NLO fits of the P_T-differential yields at RHIC, the\nTevatron and the LHC. Both the normalisation and the energy dependence of the\nJ/psi, psi' and Upsilon(1S), we obtained, are in disagreement with the data\nirrespective of the fit method. The same is true if one uses CEM-like\ncolour-octet NRQCD parameters. If, on the contrary, one disregards the\ncolour-octet contribution, the existing data in the TeV range are well\ndescribed by the alpha_s^3 contribution in the colour-singlet model --which, at\nalpha_s^4, however shows an unphysical energy dependence. A similar observation\nis made for eta(c,b). This calls for a full NNLO or for a resummation of the\ninitial-state radiation in this channel. In any case, past claims that\ncolour-octet transitions are dominantly responsible for low-P_T quarkonium\nproduction are not supported by our results. This may impact the interpretation\nof quarkonium suppression in high-energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions. \n\n"}

Integrating out the fermion degrees of\nfreedom introduces twenty-four fermion determinants. These multiply the\nGaussian functional measures of the Maxwell, $Z$, $W$ and Higgs fields to give\nan effective functional measure. Suppose the functional integral over the\nMaxwell field is attempted first. This paper is concerned with the large\namplitude behavior of the Maxwell effective measure. It is assumed that the\nlarge amplitude variation of this measure is insensitive to the presence of the\n$Z$, $W$ and $H$ fields; they are assumed to be a subdominant perturbation of\nthe large amplitude Maxwell sector. Accordingly, we need only examine the large\namplitude variation of a single QED fermion determinant. To facilitate this the\nSchwinger proper time representation of this determinant is decomposed into a\nsum of three terms. The advantage of this is that the separate terms can be\nnon-perturbatively estimated for a measurable class of large amplitude random\nfields in four dimensions. It is found that the QED fermion determinant grows\nfaster than $\\exp \\left[ce^2\\int\\mathrm d^4x\\, F_{\\mu\\nu}^2\\right]$, $c>0$, in\nthe absence of zero mode supporting random background potentials. This raises\ndoubt on whether the QED fermion determinant is integrable with any Gaussian\nmeasure whose support does not include zero mode supporting potentials.\n  Including zero mode supporting background potentials can result in a decaying\nexponential growth of the fermion determinant. This is \\textit{prima facie}\nevidence that Maxwellian zero modes are necessary for the non-perturbative\nquantization of QED and, by implication, for the non-perturbative quantization\nof the electroweak model. \n\n"}

We therefore look at\nthe experimental spectra of flavorless light mesons to see if such a scheme,\nwhere some of the states are placed on open string trajectories and some on\nclosed ones, can fit known experimental data. We look at the f_0 (J^PC = 0^++)\nand f_2 (2^++) resonances.

A key\ndifficulty is that these maps are collective, emergent phenomena that cannot be\nreduced to a simple combination of inputs provided by individual neurons. In\nthis paper we suggest computational frameworks for integrating the spiking\nsignals of individual cells into a spatial map, which we call schemas.

Specifically, the phases of the QAM modulated data symbols\nare manipulated before transmission in order to make them more immune to the\nrandom rotational effects of phase noise. At the receiver, a two-stage detector\nis implemented, which first detects the amplitude of the transmitted symbols\nfrom a nonlinear combination of the received signal amplitudes. Then in the\nsecond stage, the detector performs phase detection. The studied signaling\nmethod does not require transmission of any known symbols that act as pilots.\nFurthermore, no phase noise estimator (or a tracker) is needed at the receiver\nto compensate the effect of phase noise. This considerably reduces the\ncomplexity of the receiver structure. Moreover, it is observed that the studied\nalgorithm can be used for the setups where a common local oscillator or\nseparate independent oscillators drive the radio-frequency circuitries\nconnected to each antenna. Due to the differential encoding/decoding of the\nphase, weighted averaging can be employed at a multi-antenna receiver, allowing\nfor phase noise suppression to leverage the large number of antennas. Hence, we\nobserve that the performance improves by increasing the number of antennas,\nespecially in the separate oscillator case. Further increasing the number of\nreceive antennas results in a performance error floor, which is a function of\nthe quality of the oscillator at the transmitter. \n\n"}

Another possible reason is the problem of the\nSPH method, which might give too much \"protection\" to cold clumps because of\nthe unphysical surface tension induced at contact discontinuities. In this\npaper, we apply the density independent formulation of SPH (DISPH), which can\nhandle contact discontinuities accurately, to simulations of a cluster of\ngalaxies, and compare the results with those with the standard SPH.

On\none hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the\nstate of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel\ncauses information loss, as it makes the state information available at the\ncontroller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition\nbehavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given\nevent-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing\ninformation carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can\nbe stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical\nthreshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization\nand the required rate grows. When the loss of information due to the\ncommunication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by\nthe triggering events, the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the\nplant, and we obtain the same rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate\ntheorem. When the delay is larger than this threshold, the required rate\nbecomes larger than that required by the data-rate theorem.

Our analysis relies on deep VLT/X-Shooter long-slit\nspectra, along with newly developed stellar population models, allowing for\n[Na/Fe] variations, up to 1.2dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity,\nand IMF slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent\nspectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the\nfirst time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of\nmassive early-type galaxies, finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe], in the range\n0.5-0.7dex, and a bottom-heavy IMF.

In the one dimensional\ncase that we consider here, our methods require only $C^3$ regularity of the\nmaps in the IFS. The key idea, which has been known in varying degrees of\ngenerality for many years, is to associate to the IFS a parametrized family of\npositive, linear, Perron-Frobenius operators $L_s$. The operators $L_s$ can\ntypically be studied in many different Banach spaces. Here, unlike most of the\nliterature, we study $L_s$ in a Banach space of real-valued, $C^k$ functions,\n$k \\ge 2$. We note that $L_s$ is not compact, but has essential spectral radius\n$\\rho_s$ strictly less than the spectral radius $\\lambda_s$ and possesses a\nstrictly positive $C^k$ eigenfunction $v_s$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_s$. Under\nappropriate assumptions on the IFS, the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant\nset of the IFS is the value $s=s_*$ for which $\\lambda_s =1$. This eigenvalue\nproblem is then approximated by a collocation method using continuous piecewise\nlinear functions. Using the theory of positive linear operators and explicit a\npriori bounds on the derivatives of the strictly positive eigenfunction $v_s$,\nwe give rigorous upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension $s_*$, and\nthese bounds converge to $s_*$ as the mesh size approaches zero. \n\n"}

The weights are determined by the outer layer of a deep neural network,\ntrained by minimizing the negative log likelihood. This generalizes the popular\nquantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with\nsquare and non-overlapping kernels.

These flows are\nrarefied, within the slip and transitional flow regimes, which are beyond many\ntraditional computational fluid dynamic simulation schemes, such as those based\non the continuum flow assumption. The flows are very slow and thus many\ntraditional particle simulation methods suffer large statistical noises. The\nadopted method is a combination of particle and gas kinetic methods and it can\nsimulate micro-flows properly. The simulation results of mass flow rates have\nexcellent agreement with experimental measurements. In another case of 2D\nchannel, the DSBGK comparisons with the DSMC result and the solution of Shakhov\nequation are also in very good agreement.

Using the IGIMF theory to constrain\n  the thin-disk star formation history and mass Abstract: The observed present-day stellar mass function (PDMF) of the solar\nneighborhood is a mixture of stellar populations born in star-forming events\nthat occurred over the life-time of the thin disk of the Galaxy. Assuming stars\nform in embedded clusters which have stellar initial mass functions (IMFs)\nwhich depend on the metallicity and density of the star-forming gas clumps, the\nintegrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) can be calculated. The shape of the IGIMF\nthus depends on the SFR and metallicity. Here, the shape of the PDMF for stars\nmore massive than $1\\,M_\\odot$ in combination with the mass density in low-mass\nstars is used to constrain the current star-formation rate (SFR), the star\nformation history (SFH) and the current stellar plus remnant mass ($M_*$) in\nthe Galactic thin disk. This yields the current SFR, $\\dot{M}_*=\n4.1^{+3.1}_{-2.8}~M_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$, a declining SFH and\n$M_*=2.1^{+3.0}_{-1.5}\\times 10^{11}M_\\odot$, respectively, with a V-band\nstellar mass-to-light ratio of $M_*/L_V=2.79^{+0.48}_{-0.38}$.These values are\nconsistent with independent measurements.

We find that the frequency of the kHz QPO is approximately anti-correlated\nwith the 2--5 keV X-ray count rate associated with the mHz QPO. The average kHz\nQPO frequency varies by about 0.6 Hz (0.07%) during a mHz QPO cycle over which\nthe average 2--5 keV count rate varies by about 60 c/s (4%). This is opposite\nto the frequency-count rate correlation observed in the same data on longer\ntime scales and hence constitutes the first example of a sign reversal in the\nfrequency-flux correlation related to the origin of the flux. Such a sign\nreversal is predicted by the radiative disk truncation model for the case where\nthe flux variations originate on the neutron star but are not due to disk\naccretion rate fluctuations. The results support the nuclear burning\ninterpretation of the mHz QPO, and the interpretation of the kHz QPO frequency\nas an indicator of the orbital frequency at the inner edge of the accretion\ndisk. The varying radiative stresses on the inner disk exerted by the flux due\nto the quasi-periodic nuclear burning lead to changes in the inner disk radius\nand hence to the observed anti-correlation between kHz QPO frequency and X-ray\ncount rate. There is a time lag of about ten seconds of the X-ray count rate\nrelative to the kHz QPO frequency in terms of the anti-correlation we found\nbetween these two quantities, which could be caused by the propagation of the\nnuclear burning front on the neutron star away from the equatorial region. \n\n"}

Three distinct physical\nprocesses are noted. The characteristic mass for most star formation is\nidentified with the thermal Jeans mass in the molecular cloud core, and this\npresumably leads to the middle mass range by the usual collapse and accretion\nprocesses. Pre-stellar condensations (PSCs) observed in mm-wave continuum\nstudies presumably form at this mass. Significantly smaller self-gravitating\nmasses require much larger pressures and may arise following dynamical\nprocesses inside these PSCs, including disk formation, tight-cluster ejection,\nand photoevaporation as studied elsewhere, but also gravitational collapse of\nshocked gas in colliding PSCs. Significantly larger stellar masses form in\nrelatively low abundance by normal cloud processes, possibly leading to steep\nIMFs in low-pressure field regions, but this mass range can be significantly\nextended in high pressure cloud cores by gravitationally-focussed gas accretion\nonto PSCs and by the coalescence of PSCs. These models suggest that the\nobserved variations in brown dwarf, solar-to-intermediate mass, and high mass\npopulations are the result of dynamical effects that depend on environmental\ndensity and velocity dispersion. They accommodate observations ranging from\nshallow IMFs in cluster cores to Salpeter IMFs in average clusters and whole\ngalaxies to steep and even steeper IMFs in field and remote field regions. They\nalso suggest how the top-heavy IMFs in some starburst clusters may originate\nand they explain bottom-heavy IMFs in low surface brightness galaxies. \n\n"}

Evans & Witt (2003) recently suggested that smooth\nmultipole perturbations can provide a reasonable alternative to CDM\nsubstructure in some but not all cases. We generalize their method in two ways\nso as to determine whether multipole models can explain highly anomalous\nsystems. We carry the multipole expansion to higher order, and also include\nexternal tidal shear as a free parameter. Fitting for the shear proves crucial\nto finding a physical (positive-definite density) model. For B1422+231, working\nto order k = 5 (and including shear) yields a model that is physical but\nimplausible. Going to higher order (k >~ 9) reduces global departures from\nellipticity at the cost of introducing small scale wiggles near the bright\nimages. These localized undulations are more pronounced in B2045+265, where k ~\n17 multipoles are required to smooth out large scale deviations from elliptical\nsymmetry. Such modes surely cannot be taken at face value; they must indicate\nthat the models are trying to reproduce some other sort of structure. Our\nformalism naturally finds models that fit the data exactly, but we use\nB0712+472 to show that measurement uncertainties have little effect on our\nresults. Finally, we consider the system B1933+503, where two sources are\nlensed by the same foreground galaxy. The additional constraints provided by\nthe images of the second source render the multipole model unphysical.

These processes tend to decrease at low voltage, and thus may\naccount for the observed reduction of the resistance.

A\ncorrespondingly refined definition of asymptotic flatness at both spatial and\nnull infinity is given, including that the conformal boundary is locally a\nlight cone, with spatial infinity as the vertex. It is shown how to choose the\nconformal factors so that this asymptotic light cone is locally a metric light\ncone.

We derive the\nphase space Wigner function for the output state conditioned on photo detection\nevents that are not necessarily simultaneous, and we maximize its overlap with\nthe desired photon number state by choosing the optimal temporal output state\nmode function. We present a detailed numerical analysis for the case of\ntwo-photon state generation from a parametric oscillator driven with an\narbitrary intensity below threshold, and in the low intensity limit, we present\na formalism that yields the optimal output state mode function and fidelity for\nhigher photon number states. \n\n"}
