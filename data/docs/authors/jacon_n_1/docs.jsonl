This is a step to use representation theory to automatically\nextract combinatorial structures from (monoid) algebras, often in the form of\nposets and lattices, both from a theoretical and computational point of view,\nand with an implementation in Sage.\n  Motivated by ongoing work on related monoids associated to Coxeter systems,\nand building on well-known results in the semi-group community (such as the\ndescription of the simple modules or the radical), we describe how most of the\ndata associated to the representation theory (Cartan matrix, quiver) of the\nalgebra of any J-trivial monoid M can be expressed combinatorially by counting\nappropriate elements in M itself. As a consequence, this data does not depend\non the ground field and can be calculated in O(n^2), if not O(nm), where n=|M|\nand m is the number of generators.

The link and standard (cell) modules that appear in numerous\nphysical applications are defined and a natural bilinear form on the standard\nmodules is used to characterize their maximal submodules. When this bilinear\nform has a non-trivial radical, some of the standard modules are reducible and\n$TL_n$ is non-semisimple. This happens only when $q$ is a root of unity. Use of\nrestriction and induction allows for a finer description of the structure of\nthe standard modules.

Following an old suggestion of Clozel, recently realized by\nHarris-Lan-Taylor-Thorne for characteristic 0 cohomology classes, one realizes\nthe cohomology of the locally symmetric spaces for $\\GL_n$ as a boundary\ncontribution of the cohomology of symplectic or unitary Shimura varieties, so\nthat the key problem is to understand torsion in the cohomology of Shimura\nvarieties.\n  Thus, we prove new results on the $p$-adic geometry of Shimura varieties (of\nHodge type). Namely, the Shimura varieties become perfectoid when passing to\nthe inverse limit over all levels at $p$, and a new period map towards the flag\nvariety exists on them, called the Hodge-Tate period map. It is roughly\nanalogous to the embedding of the hermitian symmetric domain (which is roughly\nthe inverse limit over all levels of the complex points of the Shimura variety)\ninto its compact dual. The Hodge-Tate period map has several favorable\nproperties, the most important being that it commutes with the Hecke operators\naway from $p$ (for the trivial action of these Hecke operators on the flag\nvariety), and that automorphic vector bundles come via pullback from the flag\nvariety. \n\n"}

More generally the\ncoefficients of Hauptmoduln are graded traces $T_g$ of $g \\in M$ acting on $V$.\nSimilar phenomena have been shown to hold for the Matthieu group $M_{24}$, but\ninstead of modular functions, mock modular forms must be used.

For instance, a bounded t-structure gives rise to an\nabelian subcategory of T, while a bounded co-t-structure gives rise to a\nso-called silting subcategory.\n  This brief survey will emphasise three philosophical points. First, bounded\nt-structures are akin to the canonical example of \"soft\" truncation of\ncomplexes in the derived category. Secondly, bounded co-t-structures are akin\nto the canonical example of \"hard\" truncation of complexes in the homotopy\ncategory.\n  Thirdly, a triangulated category T may be skewed towards t-structures or\nco-t-structures, in the sense that one type of structure is more useful than\nthe other for studying T.

As a consequence, we obtain a characterization of c-matrices\nfor any quiver mutation-equivalent to a type A Dynkin quiver.\n  Our model is developed using the dual tree of a polygonal subdivision. Given\nsuch a tree, we introduce a simplicial complex of noncrossing geodesics\nsupported by the tree which we call the noncrossing complex. The facets of the\nnoncrossing complex may be given the structure of an oriented flip graph.\nSpecial cases of the oriented flip graphs that may be expressed in this way\ninclude the Tamari order, type A Cambrian orders, oriented exchange graphs for\nquivers mutation-equivalent to a path quiver.

We show that over finite\ndimensional algebras, representations with finitely many orbits, or finitely\nmany invariant subspaces, or distributive coincide, and further coincide with\nthin modules in the acyclic case. Incidence algebras produce examples of such\nmodules, and we show that algebras which are locally hereditary, and whose\nprojective are distributive, or equivalently, which have finitely many ideals,\nare precisely the deformations of incidence algebras, and they are the finite\ndimensional algebra analogue of Pr${\\rm \\ddot{u}}$fer rings. New\ncharacterizations of incidence algebras are obtained, such as they are exactly\nalgebras which have a faithful thin module. A main consequence is that \"every\nthin module comes from an incidence algebra\": if $V$ is either a thin module\nover a finite dimensional algebra $A$, or $V$ is distributive and $A$ is\nacyclic, then $A/{\\rm ann}(V)$ is an incidence algebra and $V$ can be presented\nas its defining representation.

This paper uses uniform (and non-uniform)\nexpressions to define what is believed to be the usual intersection homology\n(and its local-global variant) of a convex polytope (or a projective toric\nvariety).

We apply $\\alpha$-induction and, developing\nfurther some ideas of Ocneanu, we define chiral generators for the double\ntriangle algebra. Using a new concept of intertwining braiding fusion\nrelations, we show that the chiral generators can be naturally identified with\nthe $\\alpha$-induced sectors. A matrix $Z$ is defined and shown to commute with\nthe S- and T-matrices arising from the braiding. If the braiding is\nnon-degenerate, then $Z$ is a ``modular invariant mass matrix'' in the usual\nsense of conformal field theory. We show that in that case the fusion rule\nalgebra of the dual system of $M$-$M$ morphisms is generated by the images of\nboth kinds of $\\alpha$-induction, and that the structural information about its\nirreducible representations is encoded in the mass matrix $Z$.
