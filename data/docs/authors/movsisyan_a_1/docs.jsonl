We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going\nbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the\nobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a\ncompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\\epsilon^4)$, in\nthe form of an Effacement Principle.

The\nnarrowband radio interference is digitally filtered out and the dispersive\neffect of the Earth's ionosphere is compensated for. A trigger system is\nimplemented to search for short pulses.

Calorimetric neutrino\nmass experiments measure all the energy released in a beta decay except for the\nenergy carried away by the neutrino, therefore removing the most severe\nsystematic uncertainties which have plagued the traditional and, so far, more\nsensitive spectrometers. Calorimetric measurements are best realized exploiting\nthe thermal detection technique. This approach uses thermal microcalorimeters\nwhose absorbers contain a low transition energy Q beta decaying isotope. To\ndate the two best options are 187Re and 163Ho.

{"id": "1101.2691", "contents": "Title: Axion Dark Matter Detection with Cold Molecules Abstract: Current techniques cannot detect axion dark matter over much of its parameter\nspace, particularly in the theoretically well-motivated region where the axion\ndecay constant f_a lies near the GUT and Planck scales. We suggest a novel\nexperimental method to search for QCD axion dark matter in this region. The\naxion field oscillates at a frequency equal to its mass when it is a component\nof dark matter. These oscillations induce time varying CP-odd nuclear moments,\nsuch as electric dipole and Schiff moments. The coupling between internal\natomic fields and these nuclear moments gives rise to time varying shifts to\natomic energy levels. These effects can be enhanced by using elements with\nlarge Schiff moments such as the light Actinides, and states with large\nspontaneous parity violation, such as molecules in a background electric field.\nThe energy level shift in such a molecule can be ~ 10^-24 eV or larger. While\nchallenging, this energy shift may be observable in a molecular clock\nconfiguration with technology presently under development. The detectability of\nthis energy shift is enhanced by the fact that it is a time varying shift whose\noscillation frequency is set by fundamental physics and is therefore\nindependent of the details of the experiment. This signal is most easily\nobserved in the sub-MHz range, allowing detection when f_a is > 10^16 GeV, and\npossibly as low as 10^15 GeV. A discovery in such an experiment would not only\nreveal the nature of dark matter and confirm the axion as the solution to the\nstrong CP problem, it would also provide a glimpse of physics at the highest\nenergy scales, far beyond what can be directly probed in the laboratory. \n\n"}

Here, I examine the prospects for reconstructing the\nlocal speed distribution of WIMPs in addition to WIMP particle-physics\nproperties (mass, cross sections) from next-generation cryogenic and\nliquid-noble direct-detection experiments. I find that the common method of\nfixing the form of the velocity distribution when estimating constraints on\nWIMP mass and cross sections means losing out on the information on the speed\ndistribution contained in the data and may lead to biases in the inferred\nvalues of the particle-physics parameters.

Moreover, one can use Bayesian model-selection criteria to\ndetermine if a theoretically-inspired functional form for the speed\ndistribution (such as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) fits better than an\nempirical model. The shape of the degeneracy between WIMP mass and cross\nsections and their offset from the true values of those parameters depends on\nthe hypothesis for the speed distribution, which has significant implications\nfor consistency checks between direct-detection and collider data.

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet.

We apply this formalism to\nsimplicial gravity and (Euclidean) Regge calculus, in particular.

As a result, the hypersurfaces evolve in a discrete\n`multi-fingered' time through the full Regge solution. Pachner moves are an\nelementary and ergodic class of homeomorphisms and generically change the\nnumber of variables, but can be implemented as canonical transformations on\nnaturally extended phase spaces.

This raises the\nquestion of whether there are interesting deca-TeV models for which the LHC may\nfind direct clues. A possible scenario for such physics is a 5D warped model of\nfermion masses and mixing, with Kaluza-Klein masses m_KK ~ 10 TeV, allowing it\nto avoid tension with stringent constraints, especially from flavor data.\nDiscovery of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, for which there are some hints\nat ~125 GeV at the LHC, would also require the KK masses to be at or above 10\nTeV. These warped models generically predict the appearance of a much lighter\nradion scalar. We find that, in viable warped models of flavor, a radion with a\nmass of a few hundred GeV and an inverse coupling of order m_KK ~ 10 TeV could\ntypically be accessible to the LHC experiments -- with sqrt(s) = 14 TeV and 100\nfb^-1 of data. The above statements can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to 4D\ndual models, where conformal dynamics and a dilaton replace warping and the\nradion, respectively.

In such a scenario, while the stau is the\nnext-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), the charginos and the other\nneutralinos as well as sleptons of the first two families are also likely to be\nnot too far above the mass bounds laid down by the Large Electron Positron\n(LEP) collider. As the branching ratios of decays of the charginos and the\nnext-to-lightest neutralino into staus are rather large, one expects\nsignificant rates of tau-rich final states in such a case. With this in view,\nwe investigate the same-sign ditau and tri-tau signals of this scenario at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) for two MSSM benchmark points corresponding to\nlight neutralino dark matter.

To minimize this effect, we consider two models of\nparticle production in a sector that is only gravitationally coupled to the\ninflaton.

There is a significant excess of data events\nwith respect to the background estimation in the mass range 115<m_H<140\nGeV/c^2, which causes our observed limits to not be as stringent as expected.\nAt m_H=120 GeV/c^2, the p-value for a background fluctuation to produce this\nexcess is \\sim1.5x10^-3, corresponding to a local significance of 3.0 standard\ndeviations.

In these theories, there is not only a Higgs-like boson but\npartner Higgs scalars transforming under representations of custodial SU(2),\nleading to a rich phenomenology. These theories serve as a consistent\ntheoretical and experimental framework to explain enhanced couplings to gauge\nbosons, including fermiophobic Higgses. We focus on the phenomenology of a\nneutral scalar partner to the Higgs, which is determined once the Higgs\ncouplings are specified. Depending on the parameter space, this partner could\nhave i) enhanced fermion and gauge boson couplings and should be searched for\nat high mass (> 600 GeV), ii) have suppressed couplings and could be searched\nfor at lower masses, where the Standard Model Higgs has already been ruled out,\nand iii) have fermiophilic couplings, where it can be searched for in heavy\nHiggs and top resonance searches.

In comparison, the cross section for the ground-state $\\Lambda$\nproduction $\\pi^- + p \\to K^0 + \\Lambda$ is also shown. We suggest that the\ninternal quark configuration of $\\Lambda (1405)$ should be determined by the\nasymptotic scaling behavior of the cross section. If it is an ordinary\nthree-quark baryon, the scaling of the cross section is $s^{8} d\\sigma\n/dt=$constant, whereas it is $s^{10} d\\sigma /dt=$constant if $\\Lambda (1405)$\nis a five-quark hadron, where $s$ and $t$ are Mandelstam variables.

Using the Unruh-DeWitt detectors we find an adiabatic\nexpansion of the detection properties along linear trajectories with slowly\nvarying acceleration in Minkowski, which allows us to calculate the spectrum\ndetected, finding the thermal spectrum as the zeroth order contribution. Using\nthe ETF we study the perception of Hawking radiation by observers following\nradial trajectories outside a Schwarzschild black hole. One of the most\nimportant results is that, in general, free-falling observers crossing the\nevent horizon do detect some radiation, even when the field is in the Unruh\nvacuum state, due to a Doppler blue-shift that diverges at the horizon. We give\na general expression for the ETF, which has a clear interpretation in terms of\nwell-known physical phenomena. We discuss which contribution to the perception\ncomes from the radiation emitted by the black hole, and which contribution is\ndue to the Unruh effect caused by the movement of the observer. We conclude\nthat the Unruh effect is not only due to the observer's proper acceleration and\ncannot even be defined locally, but is due to the observer's acceleration with\nrespect to the asymptotic region. We apply the ETF to the analysis of different\nphysical situations, in particular to a possible buoyancy scenario near the\nhorizon due to Hawking radiation pressure.

These include additional friction effects, nonstandard dispersion\nrelations involving a massive graviton, a modified speed, and a small-scale\nmodification.

We study the response\na bank of compact binary inspiral templates has to these two families of\nglitches when they are used to match-filter data containing any of these\nglitches. Two important characteristics of this response are the distributions\nof the signal-to-noise ratio and the timelag of individual templates. We show\nhow these distributions differ from those when the detector data has a real CBC\nsignal instead of a glitch. We argue that these distinctions can be utilized to\ndevelop useful signal-artifact vetos that add negligibly to the computational\ncost of a CBC search. Specifically, we show how $f_0$ of a glitch can be used\nto set adaptive time-windows around it so that any template trigger occurring\nin that window can be quarantined for further vetting of its supposed\nastrophysical nature. Second, we recommend focusing efforts on reducing the\nincidence of glitches with low $f_0$ values because they create CBC triggers\nwith the longest timelags. This work allows us to associate such triggers with\nthe glitches which otherwise would have escaped attention. \n\n"}

First, the detection of one or a few\nphotons may be technologically easier. Second, since no electric field is\nrequired to detect the photons, there may be far fewer dark counts mimicking a\nDM signal. We discuss various target choices, but focus on calculating the\nexpected dark matter-electron scattering rates in three scintillating crystals,\nsodium iodide (NaI), cesium iodide (CsI), and gallium arsenide (GaAs).

One can assume that either the asymptotic freedom\nor the extremely short time of flight of high energy protons through each other\nare in charge of such a surprising effect.

In\nparticular, while the compositeness is unity for energy-independent\ninteractions, it deviates from unity for energy-dependent interactions, which\ncan be interpreted as a missing-channel contribution. In this manuscript, we\nshow the formulation of the two-body wave function from the scattering\namplitude, evaluate the compositeness for several dynamically generated\nresonances such as $f_{0} (980)$, $\\Lambda (1405)$, and $\\Xi (1690)$, and\ninvestigate their internal structure in terms of the hadronic molecular\ncomponents. \n\n"}

Despite its utility, it is not\ninfrared and collinear (IRC) safe, so perturbative calculations are limited to\nstudying the energy evolution of multiplicity moments. While IRC-safe\nobservables, like jet mass, are perturbatively calculable, their distributions\noften exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their quark/gluon discrimination power\nis limited by the ratio of quark to gluon color factors. In this paper, we\nintroduce new IRC-safe counting observables whose discrimination performance\nexceeds that of jet mass and approaches that of track multiplicity. The key\nobservation is that track multiplicity is approximately Poisson distributed,\nwith more suppressed tails than the Sudakov peak structure from jet mass. By\nusing an iterated version of the soft drop jet grooming algorithm, we can\ndefine a \"soft drop multiplicity\" which is Poisson distributed at\nleading-logarithmic accuracy. In addition, we calculate the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to this Poisson structure. If we allow\nthe soft drop groomer to proceed to the end of the jet branching history, we\ncan define a collinear-unsafe (but still infrared-safe) counting observable.\nExploiting the universality of the collinear limit, we define generalized\nfragmentation functions to study the perturbative energy evolution of\ncollinear-unsafe multiplicity. \n\n"}

We focus in detail on the question of how quark matter appears in\nneutron stars, and how it affects the equation of state. After discussing the\ncrust and liquid nuclear matter in the core we briefly review aspects of\nmicroscopic quark physics relevant to neutron stars, and quark models of dense\nmatter based on the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio framework, in which gluonic processes\nare replaced by effective quark interactions. We turn then to describing\nequations of state useful for interpretation of both electromagnetic and\ngravitational observations, reviewing the emerging picture of hadron-quark\ncontinuity in which hadronic matter turns relatively smoothly, with at most\nonly a weak first order transition, into quark matter with increasing density.\nWe review construction of unified equations of state that interpolate between\nthe reasonably well understood nuclear matter regime at low densities and the\nquark matter regime at higher densities. The utility of such interpolations is\ndriven by the present inability to calculate the dense matter equation of state\nin QCD from first principles. As we review, the parameters of effective quark\nmodels -- which have direct relevance to the more general structure of the QCD\nphase diagram of dense and hot matter -- are constrained by neutron star mass\nand radii measurements, in particular favoring large repulsive density-density\nand attractive diquark pairing interactions. We describe the structure of\nneutron stars constructed from the unified equations of states with crossover.\nLastly we present the current equations of state -- called \"QHC18\" for\nquark-hadron crossover -- in a parametrized form practical for neutron star\nmodeling. \n\n"}

These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color\nexchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving\npartons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute\nthe short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color\nEvaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at\nlarge distances. The combined CGC+ICEM model provides a quantitative\ndescription of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ data in proton-proton (p+p) collisions\nfrom both RHIC and the LHC.

This formulation is closely related to the so-called Jacobi\ndeterminant, but the van Vleck determinant has somewhat nicer analytic\nproperties and wider and deeper theoretical base in the general relativity,\nquantum physics, and quantum field theory communities.

In particular,\nthe binary pulsar observation of heavy neutron stars requires appropriately\nstiff dense matter in order to counter gravitational collapse, at variance with\nthe predictions of many phenomenological quark models. On the other side, the\nLIGO observations favor a softer EoS therefore providing a lower bound to the\nequation stiffness. We introduce a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) description of\nthe neutron star's high baryon density regime where the pressure and energy\ndensity distributions are directly obtained from the matrix elements of the QCD\nenergy momentum tensor. Recent ab initio calculations allow us to evaluate the\nenergy-momentum tensor in a model independent way including both quark and\ngluon degrees of freedom. Our approach is a first effort to replace quark\nmodels and effective gluon interactions with a first principles, fully\nQCD-based description.

It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

We find that the running of the spectral index is fully\ndetermined by the rate of the energy transfer from the inflationary background\nfield to its fluctuations via particle creation processes as well as the\ndynamics of the background field itself. Furthermore, the amplitude of the\nfield fluctuations turns out to be scale-dependent due to the off-equilibrium\nevolution. As a consequence, the scale-dependence of fluctuations yields a\ncorrelation between the phase space modes of energy density perturbations,\nwhile the one-point function of the fluctuations in each Hartree mode is still\nGaussian. More importantly, the mode-mode correlation of the primordial\nperturbations depends upon the dynamics of the self-interaction {\\it as well\nas} the initial conditions of the inflation. Hence, we propose that the running\nspectral index and the correlation between phase-space modes would be two\nobservable fossils to probe the epoch of inflation, even beyond. \n\n"}

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff\nconsistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy\nvariation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses\nnear the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance\nwith holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square\nroot of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only\nundetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give\nearly deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of\nfurther improvement of the model is also briefly indicated. \n\n"}

An\nimportant consequence of this non-uniqueness is that even though the full\nbrane-bulk systems in all such formulations are completely equivalent,\nimportant differences can arise were one to truncate different formulations by\nthrowing away the associated `bulk' terms.

From these quantities two complementary\nobservables can be constructed, one for discriminating between b->ulnu\ntransitions and background and the other for constraining the shape function.\nUsing this technique the uncertainties in |Vub| from the shape function may be\nsignificantly reduced. \n\n"}

The chi_PT effective Lagrangian, using data\nfrom radiative pion beta decay, predicts the pion electric and magnetic\npolarizabilities alpha = -beta = 2.7 +- 0.4. The polarizabilities deduced by\nAntipov et al. in their low statistics Primakoff experiment (~ 7000 events)\nwere about three times larger than this prediction. For pion polarizability,\ngamma-pi scattering will be measured in CERN COMPASS via radiative pion\nPrimakoff scattering (pion Bremsstrahlung) in the nuclear Coulomb field: pi + Z\n--> pi' + gamma + Z; equivalent to gamma + pi --> gamma + pi Compton scattering\nfor laboratory gamma's of order 1 GeV incident on a target pi at rest. The pion\npolarizabilities are determined by their effect on the shape of the measured\ngamma-pi Compton scattering angular distribution. One can expect from COMPASS a\ntotal measurement uncertainty for alpha, of order 0.4. New high precision pion\npolarizability measurements via radiative pion scattering data from COMPASS\nwill provide important new tests of the QCD chiral dynamics polarizability\nprediction. \n\n"}

In this article we try to give a\ncomprehensive overview of the subject. We start with a general introduction to\ncalorimetry where the basic elements that characterize the development of\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers are discussed. Then we describe in detail\nthe operation principle and the properties of calorimeters equipped with quartz\nfibers. The main advantages of this type of calorimeters are the radiation\nhardness, the fast response and the compact detector dimensions, features that\nderive from the quartz material and the specific mechanism of operation. A\nsection is devoted to presenting the quartz fiber calorimeters that have been\nbuilt or planned to in various experiments to operate as centrality detectors,\ntrigger detectors, luminosity monitors or general purpose very forward\ncalorimeters. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0703039", "contents": "Title: TMVA - Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis Abstract: In high-energy physics, with the search for ever smaller signals in ever\nlarger data sets, it has become essential to extract a maximum of the available\ninformation from the data. Multivariate classification methods based on machine\nlearning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses. Also\nthe multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent\nyears. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to\nfurther gain in performance. Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA\nis a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification\nalgorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all\navailable classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly\ninterfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression\nof a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user\ninterfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling\nallowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods. A generalised boosting\nmethod is the first realisation benefiting from the new framework. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0302061", "contents": "Title: Relativistic, Causal Description of Quantum Entanglement and Gravity Abstract: A possible solution to the problem of providing a spacetime description of\nthe transmission of signals for quantum entangled states is obtained by using a\nbimetric spacetime structure, in which quantum entanglement measurements alter\nthe structure of the classical relativity spacetime. A bimetric gravity theory\nlocally has two lightcones, one which describes classical special relativity\nand a larger lightcone which allows light signals to communicate quantum\ninformation between entangled states, after a measurement device detects one of\nthe entangled states. The theory would remove the tension that exists between\nmacroscopic classical, local gravity and macroscopic nonlocal quantum\nmechanics. \n\n"}
