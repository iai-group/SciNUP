The\nviral capsid is modeled as a hollowed sphere. The attraction between RNA\nmolecules and the inner viral capsid is assumed to be non-specific and occurs\nat the inner capsid surface only. For small capsid attraction, it is found that\nmonomer concentration of RNA molecules is maximum at the center of the capsid\nto maximize their configurational entropy. For stronger capsid attraction, RNA\nconcentration peaks at some distance near the capsid. In the latter case, the\ncompetition between the branching of RNA secondary struture and its adsorption\nto the inner capsid results in the formation of a dense layer of RNA near\ncapsid surface.

If both walls are of the\nsame kind, this effect leads to a distortion of the phase diagram of the system\nin thin film geometry, in comparison with the bulk, analogous to the phenomenon\nof \"capillary condensation\" of simple fluids in thin capillaries.

Much of this\nexcitement has centred on the claim that a certain class of quantum dimer\nmodel, defined on a bipartite lattice, can support a quantum U(1)-liquid phase\nwith deconfined fractional excitations in three dimensions. These fractional\nmonomer excitations are quantum analogues of the magnetic monopoles found in\nspin ice.

We find that, for\n{\\mu}_c = 0.75 +/- 0.04, the model undergoes a first-order quantum phase\ntransition from an ordered \"R-state\" into an extended quantum U(1)-liquid\nphase, which terminates in a quantum critical \"RK point\" for {\\mu}=1.

In\nthis paper, we study continuous quantum phase transitions out of the CFL state\nand into a Landau Fermi liquid, in the limit of no disorder and fixed particle\nnumber. This transition can be induced by tuning the bandwidth of the Landau\nlevel relative to the interaction energy, for instance through an externally\napplied periodic potential. We find a transition to the Landau Fermi liquid\nthrough a gapless Mott insulator with a Fermi surface of neutral fermionic\nexcitations. In the presence of spatial symmetries, we also find a direct\ncontinuous transition between the CFL and the Landau Fermi liquid. The\ntransitions have a number of characteristic observable signatures, including\nthe presence of two crossover temperature scales, resistivity jumps, and\nvanishing compressibility.

Here we offer such connection, presenting evidence\nthat SChSB in QCD proceeds via the appearance of modes exhibiting dynamical\ntendency for local chiral polarization. These modes form a band of finite width\nLambda_ch (chiral polarization scale) around the surface of otherwise\nanti--polarized Dirac sea, and condense.

Here we use a coarse-grained model to explore the\nhybridization kinetics of DNA oligomers, finding that strand association\nproceeds through a complex set of intermediate states. Successful binding\nevents start with the formation of a few metastable base-pairing interactions,\nfollowed by zippering of the remaining bonds. However, despite reasonably\nstrong interstrand interactions, initial contacts frequently fail to lead to\nzippering because the typical configurations in which they form differ from\ntypical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium ensemble.\nTherefore, if the association process is analyzed on the base-pair (secondary\nstructure) level, it shows non-Markovian behavior.

The notion of spectral commutativity means\nthat the eigenvalue density of a product ABC... of such matrices is independent\nof the order of matrix multiplication, for example the matrix ABCD has the same\neigenvalue density as ADCB. In turn, the notion of self-averaging means that\nthe product of n independent but identically distributed random matrices, which\nwe symbolically denote by AAA..., has the same eigenvalue density as the\ncorresponding power A^n of a single matrix drawn from the underlying matrix\nensemble. For example, the eigenvalue density of ABCCABC is the same as of\nA^2B^2C^3. We also discuss the singular behavior of the eigenvalue and singular\nvalue densities of isotropic matrices and their products for small eigenvalues\n$\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$. We show that the singularities at the origin of the\neigenvalue density and of the singular value density are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence in the limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$: the eigenvalue density of\nan isotropic random matrix has a power law singularity at the origin $\\sim\n|\\lambda|^{-s}$ with a power $s \\in (0,2)$ when and only when the density of\nits singular values has a power law singularity $\\sim \\lambda^{-\\sigma}$ with a\npower $\\sigma = s/(4-s)$.

The sample space of such walks with $n$ edges is the\n$(2n-3)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of equilateral closed polygons in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. We study closed random walks using the symplectic geometry of\nthe $(2n-6)$-dimensional quotient of the manifold of polygons by the action of\nthe rotation group $\\operatorname {SO}(3)$. The basic objects of study are the\nmoment maps on equilateral random polygon space given by the lengths of any\n$(n-3)$-tuple of nonintersecting diagonals. The Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg\ntheorem shows that the image of such a moment map is a convex polytope in\n$(n-3)$-dimensional space, while the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem shows that the\npushforward measure on this polytope is Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^{n-3}$.\nTogether, these theorems allow us to define a measure-preserving set of\n\"action-angle\" coordinates on the space of closed equilateral polygons. The new\ncoordinate system allows us to make explicit computations of exact expectations\nfor total curvature and for some chord lengths of closed (and confined)\nequilateral random walks, to give statistical criteria for sampling algorithms\non the space of polygons and to prove that the probability that a randomly\nchosen equilateral hexagon is unknotted is at least $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Our methods also apply to\nopen random walks in certain types of confinement, and in general to walks with\narbitrary (fixed) edgelengths as well as equilateral walks. \n\n"}

One such\nmotif, which has been used extensively in structures such as polyhedral cages,\ntwo-dimensional arrays, and ribbons, is a bulged duplex, that is two helical\nsegments that connect at a bulge loop. We use a coarse-grained model of DNA to\ncharacterize such bulged duplexes. We find that this motif can adopt structures\nbelonging to two main classes: one where the stacking of the helices at the\ncenter of the system is preserved, the geometry is roughly straight and the\nbulge is on one side of the duplex, and the other where the stacking at the\ncenter is broken, thus allowing this junction to act as a hinge and increasing\nflexibility. Small loops favor states where stacking at the center of the\nduplex is preserved, with loop bases either flipped out or incorporated into\nthe duplex. Duplexes with longer loops show more of a tendency to unstack at\nthe bulge and adopt an open structure. The unstacking probability, however, is\nhighest for loops of intermediate lengths, when the rigidity of single-stranded\nDNA is significant and the loop resists compression.

In particular,\nparticles can be allowed to tunnel out of the trap by applying a magnetic-field\ngradient that effectively lowers the potential barrier. The result is a tunable\nopen quantum system that allows detailed studies of the tunneling mechanism.

We use a representation of the problem via the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma\nmodel in the limit $N \\rightarrow 1$ to determine the stability of this\ncritical point. First we prove that the DS critical exponents are robust, so\nlong as the polymer does not cross itself: they can arise in a generic lattice\nmodel, and do not require fine tuning. This resolves a longstanding theoretical\nquestion. However there is an apparent paradox: two different lattice models,\napparently both in the DS universality class, show different numbers of\nrelevant perturbations, apparently leading to contradictory conclusions about\nthe stability of the DS exponents. We explain this in terms of subtle\ndifferences between the two models, one of which is fine-tuned (and not\nstrictly in the DS universality class). Next, we allow the polymer to cross\nitself, as appropriate e.g. to the quasi-2D case.

We analyze such quantum\ncomputing by allowing coupling to external modes, under the condition that the\nexternal influence must be soft-enough in order not to offset the basic\nproperties of the system. We derive model-independent bounds on some crucial\ntime-scales, such as the times of gate operation, decoherence, maximal\nentanglement and total scrambling. We show that for black hole type quantum\ncomputers all these time-scales are of the order of the black hole half-life\ntime.

It not\nonly plays a key role in investigating the holographic duality between a\nstrongly interacting quantum system and a gravitational system, but also\ndiagnoses the chaotic behavior of many-body quantum systems and characterizes\nthe information scrambling. Based on the OTOCs, three different concepts --\nquantum chaos, holographic duality, and information scrambling -- are found to\nbe intimately related to each other. Despite of its theoretical importance, the\nexperimental measurement of the OTOC is quite challenging and so far there is\nno experimental measurement of the OTOC for local operators. Here we report the\nmeasurement of OTOCs of local operators for an Ising spin chain on a nuclear\nmagnetic resonance quantum simulator. We observe that the OTOC behaves\ndifferently in the integrable and non-integrable cases. Based on the recent\ndiscovered relationship between OTOCs and the growth of entanglement entropy in\nthe many-body system, we extract the entanglement entropy from the measured\nOTOCs, which clearly shows that the information entropy oscillates in time for\nintegrable models and scrambles for non-intgrable models.

To address this, recent work in information\ntheory has produced a sound measure of network-wide \"integrated information,\"\nwhich can be estimated from time-series data. But, a computational hurdle has\nstymied attempts to measure large-scale information integration in real brains.\nSpecifically, the measurement of integrated information involves a\ncombinatorial search for the informational \"weakest link\" of a network, a\nprocess whose computation time explodes super-exponentially with network size.\nHere, we show that spectral clustering, applied on the correlation matrix of\ntime-series data, provides an approximate but robust solution to the search for\nthe the informational weakest link of large networks.

In this paper, we discuss\n\"finite-size\" criteria for having a spectral gap in frustration-free spin\nsystems and their applications. We extend a criterion that was originally\ndeveloped for periodic systems by Knabe and Gosset-Mozgunov to systems with a\nboundary. Our finite-size criterion says that if the spectral gaps at linear\nsystem size $n$ exceed an explicit threshold of order $n^{-3/2}$, then the\nwhole system is gapped. The criterion takes into account both \"bulk gaps\" and\n\"edge gaps\" of the finite system in a precise way.

The temperature dependence of the scattering at the\ncharge and orbital wavevectors, and of the lattice constants, was characterized\nthroughout the ordered phase of each sample. It was found that the charge and\norbital order wavevectors are commensurate with the lattice, in striking\ncontrast to the results of earlier electron diffraction studies of samples with\n$x$=0.5. High momentum-transfer resolution studies of the x=0.4 and 0.5 samples\nfurther revealed that while long-range charge order is present, long-range\norbital order is never established. Above the charge/orbital ordering\ntemperature T$_o$, the charge order fluctuations are more highly correlated\nthan the orbital fluctuations. This suggests that charge order drives orbital\norder in these samples. In addition, a longitudinal modulation of the lattice\nwith the same periodicity as the charge and orbital ordering was discovered in\nthe x=0.4 and 0.5 samples. For x=0.25, only long-range orbital order was\nobserved with no indication of charge ordering, nor of an additional lattice\nmodulation. We also report the results of a preliminary investigation of the\nloss of charge and orbital ordering in the x=0.4 sample by application of a\nmagnetic field. Finally, the polarization and azimuthal dependence of the\ncharge and orbital ordering in these compounds is characterized both in the\nresonant and nonresonant limits, and compared with the predictions of current\ntheories.

They wriggle; they do not thrash. We\ndescribe a simple algorithm that can be used to incorporate wriggling in Monte\nCarlo simulations of protein folding. We have tested this wriggling algorithm\nagainst a code in which the dihedral angles are varied independently\n(thrashing). Our standard of success is the average root-mean-square distance\n(rmsd) between the alpha-carbons of the folding protein and those of its native\nstructure.

Such systems were recently studied by Atomic Force\nMicroscopy [M. Chakrapani et al., e-print cond-mat/0112255]. The gel is\nrepresented by a frustrated, triangular network of nodes connected by springs\nof random equilibrium lengths. The nodes represent crosslinkers, and the\nsprings correspond to polymer chains. The boundaries are fixed at the bottom,\nfree at the top, and periodic in the lateral direction. Voids are introduced by\ndeleting a proportion of the nodes and their associated springs. The model is\nnumerically relaxed to a representative local energy minimum, resulting in an\ninhomogeneous, ``clumpy'' bulk structure. The free top surface is defined at\nevenly spaced points in the lateral (x) direction by the height of the topmost\nspring, measured from the bottom layer, h(x). Its scaling properties are\nstudied by calculating the root-mean-square surface width and the generalized\nincrement correlation functions C_q(x)= <|h(x_0+x)-h(x_0)|^q>. The surface is\nfound to have a nontrivial scaling behavior on small length scales, with a\ncrossover to scale-independent behavior on large scales. As the vacancy\nconcentration approaches the site-percolation limit, both the crossover length\nand the saturation value of the surface width diverge in a manner that appears\nto be proportional to the bulk connectivity length.

In both cases the first two moments of the distribution are\nchosen to be J_0=-1, Delta J=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the Potts\nspins can occur. We find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glass\nsusceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, and\nthat the specific heat has only a smooth Schottky-like peak. These results can\nbe understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters of\nspins. Hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at any\nnonzero temperature. Consistent with these findings, only very minor size\neffects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the models\nremain very short.

Two\nexisting algorithms have been used to find community structure, one involving\nremoving edges with high betweenness, the other involving optimization of the\nmodularity.

Within the effective mass free-electron approximation, the scattering\nmatrix for the system has been formulated by means of a time-dependent mode\nmatching method. Some interesting properties of the electron transmission for\nthe system have been shown through a few groups of numerical examples. It is\nfound that in the case of the comparative stronger field amplitude and the\nfrequency resonant with the two lowest lateral energy levels in the impurity\nregion, the field-induced intersubband transition dominates the process as if\nwithout the impurity. And there is a step-arising on the transmission as a\nfunction of the incident electron energy.

We\nshow that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking\ndetermine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the\nDirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of\nthe QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these\neigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with\nthe global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such\neigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume. The\nspectral density for larger eigenvalues (but still well below a typical\nhadronic mass scale) also follows from the same low-energy effective partition\nfunction.

Moreover, this theory should have an additional formal structure of\na family of differentials. Roughly speaking, the triply graded theory by itself\ncaptures the large N behavior of the sl(N) homology, and differentials capture\nnon-stable behavior for small N, including knot Floer homology. The\ndifferentials themselves should come from another variant of sl(N) homology,\nnamely the deformations of it studied by Gornik, building on work of Lee.\n  While we do not give a mathematical definition of the triply graded theory,\nthe rich formal structure we propose is powerful enough to make many\nnon-trivial predictions about the existing knot homologies that can then be\nchecked directly. We include many examples where we can exhibit a likely\ncandidate for the triply graded theory, and these demonstrate the internal\nconsistency of our axioms.

These experiments rely on a model of the polymer\nforce-extension behavior to calibrate the experiments; typically the\nexperiments use the worm-like chain (WLC) theory for double-stranded DNA and\nRNA. This theory agrees well with experiments for long molecules. Recent\nsingle-molecule experiments have used shorter molecules, with contour lengths\nin the range of 1-10 persistence lengths. Most WLC theory calculations to date\nhave assumed infinite molecule lengths, and do not agree well with experiments\non shorter chains.

In this paper, we\nshow that this isomorphism is incorrect and define a semi-directed random\nnetwork we call the epidemic percolation network that is exactly isomorphic to\nthe SIR epidemic model in any finite population. In the limit of a large\npopulation, (i) the distribution of (self-limited) outbreak sizes is identical\nto the size distribution of (small) out-components, (ii) the epidemic threshold\ncorresponds to the phase transition where a giant strongly-connected component\nappears, (iii) the probability of a large epidemic is equal to the probability\nthat an initial infection occurs in the giant in-component, and (iv) the\nrelative final size of an epidemic is equal to the proportion of the network\ncontained in the giant out-component.
