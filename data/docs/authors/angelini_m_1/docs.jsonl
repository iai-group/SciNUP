Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the problem of finding\nground-state configurations is a non-polynomial problem computationally, such\nthat efficient approximation algorithms are called for. Here, we employ the\nrecently developed genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to investigate the\nnature of the zero-temperature phase of the bimodal XY spin glass in two\ndimensions.

Here we demonstrate that\ngravitational fugacity can be described as the functional of the LV ratio,\nwhich means that the LV ratio is a key ingredient estimating the particle\nactivities against gravitational potential. We also demonstrate that LV\nrelation is attained if the LV ratio exceeds the crticaial value $b=1$\neverywhere in the bound region during the violent relaxation process. The local\nregion which does not meet this criterion can be trapped into the pre-saturated\nstate. However, small phase-space perturbation can bring the inactive part into\nthe LV critical state. \n\n"}

It is shown that subdiffusive rectification\ncurrents, defined through the mean displacement and subvelocity $v_{\\alpha}$,\n$<\\delta x(t)>\\sim v_{\\alpha} t^{\\alpha}/ \\Gamma(1+\\alpha)$, emerge\nasymptotically due to the breaking of the detailed balance symmetry by driving.\nThe asymptotic exponent is $\\alpha$, the same as for free subdiffusion,\n$<\\delta x^2(t)>\\propto t^\\alpha$.\n  However, a transient to this regime with some time-dependent $\\alpha_{\\rm\neff}(t)$ gradually decaying in time, $\\alpha\\leq \\alpha_{\\rm eff}(t)\\leq 1$,\ncan be very slow depending on the barrier height and the driving field\nstrength.

We describe this method\nin detail; a system's probability distribution is represented by a matrix\nproduct state (MPS) of finite dimension and then its time-evolution is\nefficiently simulated by repeatedly updating and approximately re-factorizing\nthis representation. We examine the use of MPS as an approximation method,\nlooking at parallels between the interpretations of applying it to quantum\nstate vectors and probability distributions. In the context of stochastic\nsystems we consider two types of factorization for use in the TEBD algorithm:\nnon-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which ensures that the approximate\nprobability distribution is manifestly non-negative, and the singular value\ndecomposition (SVD). Comparing these factorizations we find the accuracy of the\nSVD to be substantially greater than current NMF algorithms.

The density of defects after the sweep\ncan be conveniently described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In particular, the\nnumber of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse\nsize, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate. The analytical predictions are\nverified numerically by integrating the Langevin equations of motion of the\nions, in presence of a time-dependent transverse confinement.

The above findings are a natural backdrop for\nintroducing a decoder for graph-based codes that we will call symbolwise\ngraph-cover decoding, a decoder that extends our earlier work on blockwise\ngraph-cover decoding. Both graph-cover decoders are theoretical tools that help\ntowards a better understanding of message-passing iterative decoding, namely\nblockwise graph-cover decoding links max-product (min-sum) algorithm decoding\nwith linear programming decoding, and symbolwise graph-cover decoding links\nsum-product algorithm decoding with Bethe free energy function minimization at\ntemperature one. In contrast to the Gibbs entropy function, which is a concave\nfunction, the Bethe entropy function is in general not concave everywhere. In\nparticular, we show that every code picked from an ensemble of regular\nlow-density parity-check codes with minimum Hamming distance growing (with high\nprobability) linearly with the block length has a Bethe entropy function that\nis convex in certain regions of its domain. \n\n"}

The focus is on a number of known centrality\nmeasures, which inherit the connections established for similarity matrices.\nThese measures are based on the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix,\npath enumeration, as well as on the stationary state, stochastic matrix or mean\nfirst-passage times of a random walk.

Exact results are obtained for the scaling\nfunctions of the finite-size contributions to the free energy density. With\nxi_> the largest and xi_< the smallest bulk correlation length at a given\ntemperature near criticality, we find that the dependence of these functions on\nthe ratio xi_< / xi_> and on the angle parameterizing the orientation of the\ncorrelation volume is of geometric rather than dynamic origin. Since the\nscaling functions are independent of the particular microscopic realization of\nthe anisotropy within the two-dimensional Ising model, our results provide a\nlimited verification of universality. We explain our observations by\nconsidering finite-size scaling of free energy densities of general weakly\nanisotropic models on a d-dimensional film, i.e., in an L x infinity^(d-1)\ngeometry, with bc in the finite direction that are invariant under a shear\ntransformation relating the anisotropic and isotropic cases.

For\nelastic interfaces at (or above) their (internal) upper critical dimension d >=\nd_uc (d_uc = 2, 4 respectively for long-ranged and short-ranged elasticity) we\nshow that the field theory for the center of mass reduces to the motion of a\npoint particle in a random-force landscape, which is itself a random walk (ABBM\nmodel). Furthermore, the full spatial dependence of the velocity correlations\nis described by the Brownian-force model (BFM) where each point of the\ninterface sees an independent Brownian-force landscape. Both ABBM and BFM can\nbe solved exactly in any dimension d (for monotonous driving) by summing tree\ngraphs, equivalent to solving a (non-linear) instanton equation. This tree\napproximation is the mean-field theory (MFT) for realistic interfaces in\nshort-ranged disorder. Both for the center of mass, and for a given Fourier\nmode q, we obtain probability distribution functions (PDF's) of the velocity,\nas well as the avalanche shape and its fluctuations (second shape).

Using a renormalization group approach, we solve the time\nevolution of random Ising spin chains with generic interactions starting from\ninitial states of arbitrary energy.

Nevertheless, it is traditional to aggregate\nmultilayer networks into a single weighted network in order to take advantage\nof existing tools. This is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely\nproblematic, as important information can be lost as a result. It is therefore\nimportant to develop multilayer generalizations of network concepts. In this\npaper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize the idea of transitivity to\nmultiplex networks. By focusing on triadic relations, which yield the simplest\ntype of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation of clustering\ncoefficients to multiplex networks.

In the presented study, four different types of BGRWs\nand an algorithm based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic were\nconsidered. Regarding the BGRWs, the precise configurations of the lattice\nwalks constructed during the numerical simulations were influenced by two\nparameters: a disorder parameter rho that controls the amount of negative edge\nweights on the lattice and a bias strength B that governs the drift of the\nwalkers along a certain lattice direction.

Therefore we develop a new approach to study the equilibrium\nbehaviour of the system, by classifying the measurements as a function of a\nconditioning variate. We propose a finite-size scaling analysis based on the\nprobability distribution function of the conditioning variate, which may\naccelerate the convergence to the thermodynamic limit. In this way, we find a\nnon-trivial spectrum of behaviours, where a part of the measurements behaves as\nthe average, while the majority of them shows signs of scale invariance. As a\nresult, we can estimate the temperature interval where the phase transition in\na field ought to lie, if it exists. Although this would-be critical regime is\nunreachable with present resources, the numerical challenge is finally well\nposed. \n\n"}

In some cases,\nthese networks may have multiple kinds of interactions, such as distinct types\nof social ties or distinct types of financial liabilities; furthermore, nodes\nmay respond in different ways to in influence from their neighbors of multiple\ntypes. To start to capture such settings in a stylized way, we generalize a\nthreshold cascade model to a multiplex network in which nodes follow one of two\nresponse rules: some nodes activate when, in at least one layer, a large enough\nfraction of neighbors are active, while the other nodes activate when, in all\nlayers, a large enough fraction of neighbors are active. Varying the fractions\nof nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Near the\ninhibition regime, global cascades appear discontinuously as the network\ndensity increases; however, the cascade grows more slowly over time.

A population may be composed\nof organisms or particles or any members of a set to which we can assign\nprobabilities. A metric may be biological fitness or physical energy or the\noutput of an arbitrarily complicated function that assigns quantitative values\nto members of the population. The first part of the Price equation describes\nhow directly applied forces change the probabilities assigned to members of the\npopulation when holding constant the metrical values of the members---a fixed\nmetrical frame of reference. The second part describes how the metrical values\nchange, altering the metrical frame of reference.

In this paper, we apply simulated annealing, a metaheuristic\nalgorithm for general optimization problems, to sparse approximation in the\nsituation where the given data have a planted sparse representation and noise\nis present. The result in the noiseless case shows that our simulated annealing\nworks well in a reasonable parameter region: the planted solution is found\nfairly rapidly. This is true even in the case where a common relaxation of the\nsparse approximation problem, the $\\ell_1$-relaxation, is ineffective.

In this paper we extend the basic theory of\ncolor-avoiding percolation that was published in [Krause et. al., Phys. Rev. X\n6 (2016) 041022]. We explicitly account for the fact that the same particular\nlink can be part of different paths avoiding different colors. This fact was\npreviously accounted for with a heuristic approximation. We compare this\napproximation with a new, more exact theory and show that the new theory is\nsubstantially more accurate for many avoided colors. Further, we formulate our\nnew theory with differentiated node functions, as senders/receivers or as\ntransmitters. In both functions, nodes can be explicitly trusted or avoided.\nWith only one avoided color we obtain standard percolation. With one by one\navoiding additional colors, we can understand the critical behavior of color\navoiding percolation. For heterogeneous color frequencies, we find that the\ncolors with the largest frequencies control the critical threshold and\nexponent. Colors of small frequencies have only a minor influence on color\navoiding connectivity, thus allowing for approximations. \n\n"}

However, due to the\nlack of energy conservation and heating effects, non-trivial (e.g.,\ntopological) many-body states in periodically driven (Floquet) systems are\ngenerally metastable. Therefore it is necessary to find strategies for\npreparing long-lived many-body states in Floquet systems. We develop a\ntheoretical framework for describing the dynamical preparation of states in\nFloquet systems by a slow turn-on of the drive. We find that the dynamics of\nthe system is well approximated by the initial state evolving under a slowly\nvarying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, provided the ramp speed\n$s \\gg t_*^{-1} \\sim e^{-{\\mathcal{C} \\frac{\\omega}{J}}}$, the inverse of the\ncharacteristic heating time-scale in the Floquet system. At such ramp speeds,\nthe heating effects due to the drive are exponentially suppressed. We compute\nthe slowly varying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, and show that\nat the end of the ramp it is identical to the effective Hamiltonian of the\nunramped Floquet system, up to small corrections of the order $O(s)$.\nTherefore, the system effectively undergoes a slow quench from $H_0$ to $H_{\\rm\neff}$. As an application, we consider the passage of the slow quench through a\nquantum critical point (QCP), and estimate the energy absorbed due to the\nnon-adiabatic passage through the QCP via a Kibble-Zurek mechanism.

B 95, 155129 (2017)] has argued\nthat many-body localization (MBL) is unstable in two and higher dimensions due\nto a thermalization avalanche triggered by rare regions of weak disorder. To\nexamine these arguments, we construct several models of a finite ergodic bubble\ncoupled to an Anderson insulator of non-interacting fermions. We first describe\nthe ergodic region using a GOE random matrix and perform an exact\ndiagonalization study of small systems. The results are in excellent agreement\nwith a refined theory of the thermalization avalanche that includes transient\nfinite-size effects, lending strong support to the avalanche scenario. We then\nexplore the limit of large system sizes by modeling the ergodic region via a\nHubbard model with all-to-all random hopping: the combined system, consisting\nof the bubble and the insulator, can be reduced to an effective Anderson\nimpurity problem. We find that the spectral function of a local operator in the\nergodic region changes dramatically when coupling to a large number of\nlocalized fermionic states---this occurs even when the localized sites are\nweakly coupled to the bubble. In principle, for a given size of the ergodic\nregion, this may arrest the avalanche.

Thus, the main effect of the back-action is to renormalize the critical\nbubble size. \n\n"}

Ensembles were introduced in XIX century to bridge that\nchasm between continuous motion of phase space points in Newtonian dynamics and\nstasis of thermodynamics: While states of individual classical systems\ninevitably evolve, a phase space distribution of such states -- an ensemble --\ncan be time-independent.

The main difficulty for going beyond the mean-field\ntreatment comes from the presence of diverging point-to-set spatial\ncorrelations.

In particular, we focus on the\nregularized and unregularized OTOCs, defined as $Tr[\\sqrt{\\rho} A(t)\n\\sqrt{\\rho} A^\\dagger(t)]$ and $Tr[\\rho A(t)A^\\dagger(t)]$ respectively (where\n$A(t)$ is the anti-commutator of fermion field operators and $\\rho$ is the\nthermal density matrix). The calculation of the rate of OTOCs' exponential\ngrowth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals, but\nhere it involves two replicas of the system (two \"worlds\"). The intra-world\ncontributions reproduce the dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the\ncorrelator), while the inter-world terms provide a term of the opposite sign\nthat exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and unregularized OTOCs\ngrow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding\nmany-body Lyapunov exponents are different. For the regularized correlator, we\nreproduce an earlier perturbation theory result for the Lyapunov exponent that\nsatisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound.

That interest can be estimated through\ndifferent indicators: increase in the number of books published on the topic,\nincrease in the subscriptions to specialized journals. Moreover, the well-known\nempirical rule according to which the volume of sales is growing during a bull\nmarket finds a natural interpretation in this framework: sales increases in\nfact reveal and pinpoint the progress of the bubble's diffusion throughout\nsociety. We also present a simple model of rational expectation which maps\nexactly onto the Ising model on a random graph. The indicators are then\ninterpreted as ``thermometers'', measuring the balance between idiosyncratic\ninformation (noise temperature) and imitation (coupling) strength. In this\ncontext, bubbles are interpreted as low or critical temperature phases, where\nthe imitation strength carries market prices up essentially independently of\nfundamentals. Contrary to the naive conception of a bubble and a crash as times\nof disorder, on the contrary, we show that bubbles and crashes are times where\nthe concensus is too strong. \n\n"}

We study in detail the effect of a \\emph{single} chipping site on\nthe steady state in arbitrary dimensions, with and without bias. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the system can exist in one of the following phases -- (a)\nPinned Aggregate (PA) phase in which an infinite aggregate (with mass\nproportional to the volume of the system) appears with probability one at the\nchipping site but not in the bulk.

Hence, the percolating clusters, which are fractal\nwith dimensionality d=91/48, have antiferromagnetic long-range order. This\nimplies that the order-disorder transition driven by site dilution occurs\nexactly at the percolation threshold and that the exponents are classical. The\nsame conclusion is reached for the bond-diluted system. The full sublattice\nmagnetization versus site-dilution curve is obtained in terms of a\ndecomposition into a classical geometrical factor and a factor containing all\nthe effects of quantum fluctuations. The spin stiffness is shown to obey the\nsame scaling as the conductivity of a random resistor network. \n\n"}

A\nsecond order phase transition belonging to the universality class of dynamic\nisotropic percolation lies between endemic or pandemic behavior of the process.\nWe generalize the general epidemic process by introducing a fourth kind of\nindividuals, viz. individuals which are weakened by the process but not yet\ninfected. This sensibilization gives rise to a mechanism that introduces a\nglobal instability in the spreading of the process and therefore opens the\npossibility of a discontinuous transition in addition to the usual continuous\npercolation transition. The tricritical point separating the lines of first and\nsecond order transitions constitutes a new universality class, namely the\nuniversality class of tricritical dynamic isotropic percolation. Using\nrenormalized field theory we work out a detailed scaling description of this\nuniversality class.

Recently it has been observed numerically that an assembly\nof elastic particles has a critical behavior near the jamming threshold where\nthe pressure vanishes. At the transition such a system does not behave as a\ncontinuous medium at any length scales. When this system is compressed, scaling\nis observed for the elastic moduli, the coordination number, but also for the\ndensity of vibrational modes. In the present work we derive theoretically these\nresults, and show that they apply to various systems such as granular matter\nand silica, but also to colloidal glasses.

The size\ndistribution follows a power-law for large enough fragments. We address the\nquestion of a possible crossover to a second, different power-law for small\nenough fragments. Two series of experiments were performed. The first uses a\ntraditional film photographic camera, and the picture is later treated on a\ncomputer in order to count the fragments and classify them according to their\nsizes. The second uses a modern digital camera. The first approach has the\nadvantage of a better resolution for small fragment sizes. The second, although\nwith a poorer size resolution, is more reliable concerning the counting of all\nfragments up to its resolution limit. Both together clearly indicate the real\nexistence of the quoted crossover.\n  The model treats the system microscopically during the tiny time interval\nwhen the initial drop collides with the floor. The drop is modelled by a\nconnected cluster of Ising spins pointing up (mercury) surrounded by Ising\nspins pointing down (air). The Ising coupling which tends to keep the spins\nsegregated represents the surface tension. Initially the cluster carries an\nextra energy equally shared among all its spins, corresponding to the coherent\nkinetic energy due to the fall. Each spin which touches the floor loses its\nextra energy transformed into a thermal, incoherent energy represented by a\ntemperature used then to follow the dynamics through Monte Carlo simulations.\nWhenever a small piece becomes disconnected from the big cluster, it is\nconsidered a fragment, and counted.

Nevertheless, we find excellent quantitative agreement\nwith the simulations in a large parameter regime, extending remarkably far\ntowards strong fields (large supersaturations) and correspondingly small\nnucleation barriers. The original KJMA theory permits direct measurement of the\norder parameter in the metastable phase, and using the extension to correlation\nfunctions one can also perform separate measurements of the nucleation rate and\nthe average velocity of the convoluted interface between the metastable and\nstable phase regions. The values obtained for all three quantities are verified\nby other theoretical and computational methods. As these quantities are often\ndifficult to measure directly during a process of phase transformation, data\nanalysis using the extended KJMA theory may provide a useful experimental\nalternative. \n\n"}

Such\nan assembly is minimally connected: the ratio of constraint equations to\ncontact forces approaches unity for a large assembly. However, the bead\npositions in a finite subregion of the assembly are underdetermined. Thus to\nmaintain equilibrium, half of the exterior contact forces are determined by the\nother half. We argue that the transmission of force may be regarded as\nunidirectional, in contrast to the transmission of force in an elastic\nmaterial. Specializing to sequentially deposited beads, we show that forces on\na given buried bead can be uniquely specified in terms of forces involving more\nrecently added beads. We derive equations for the transmission of stress\naveraged over scales much larger than a single bead. This derivation requires\nthe Ansatz that statistical fluctuations of the forces are independent of\nfluctuations of the contact geometry. Under this Ansatz, the\n$d(d+1)/2$-component stress field can be expressed in terms of a d-component\nvector field. The procedure may be generalized to non-sequential packings.

We investigate the behavior of the\nsteady-state distributions of money, commodity and total wealth, as the\ndynamics of trading or exchange of money and commodity proceeds, with local (in\ntime) fluctuations in the price of the commodity. These distributions are\nstudied in markets with agents having uniform and random saving factors. The\nself-organizing features in money distribution are similar to the cases without\nany commodity (or with consumable commodities), while the commodity\ndistribution shows an exponential decay. The wealth distribution shows\ninteresting behavior: Gamma like distribution for uniform saving propensity and\nhas the same power-law tail, as that of the money distribution, for a market\nwith agents having random saving propensity. \n\n"}

I\nrepresent the population structure by a contact-graph where vertices represent\nagents and edges represent disease transmission channels among them. The\npopulation heterogeneity is taken into account by the agent's subdivision in\ntypes and the mixing matrix among them. I introduce a type-network\nrepresentation for the mixing matrix allowing an intuitive understanding of the\nmixing patterns and the analytical calculations. Using an iterative approach I\nobtain recursive equations for the probability distribution of the outbreak\nsize as a function of time. I demonstrate that the expected outbreak size and\nits progression in time are determined by the largest eigenvalue of the\nreproductive number matrix and the characteristic distance between agents on\nthe contact-graph. Finally, I discuss the impact of intervention strategies to\nhalt epidemic outbreaks. This work provides both a qualitative understanding\nand tools to obtain quantitative predictions for the spreading dynamics on\nheterogeneous populations. \n\n"}

This area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non-critical\nharmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension, for general\nfinite-ranged harmonic interactions, regions of arbitrary shape and states of\nnonzero temperature. For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the\nKlein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be\nstated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 060503 (2005)]. These higher dimensional analogues of the\nanalysis of block entropies in the one-dimensional case show that under general\nconditions, one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non-critical\nharmonic many-body systems. The proofs make use of methods from entanglement\ntheory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.\nDisordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of\nexamples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area\nlaw can be proven to hold. We finally consider the scaling of classical\ncorrelations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice\nsystem with a modified interaction. We briefly comment on a general\nrelationship between criticality and area laws for the entropy of entanglement. \n\n"}

The\nquantum phase flow curves obey the quantum Hamilton's equations and play the\nrole of characteristics. At any fixed level of accuracy of semiclassical\nexpansion, quantum characteristics can be constructed by solving a coupled\nsystem of first-order ordinary differential equations for quantum trajectories\nand generalized Jacobi fields. Classical and quantum constraint systems are\ndiscussed. The phase-space analytic geometry based on the star-product\noperation can hardly be visualized. The statement \"quantum trajectory belongs\nto a constraint submanifold\" can be changed e.g. to the opposite by a unitary\ntransformation. Some of relations among quantum objects in phase space are,\nhowever, left invariant by unitary transformations and support partly geometric\nrelations of belonging and intersection. Quantum phase flow satisfies the\nstar-composition law and preserves hamiltonian and constraint star-functions. \n\n"}
