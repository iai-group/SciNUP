For a rooted tree,\nthere is also a natural global direction of edges towards the root. The number\nof edges pointing to a vertex is called its indegree. Thus the local (resp.\nglobal) indegree sequence $\\lambda = 1^{e_1}2^{e_2} \\ldots$ of a tree on the\nvertex set $\\set{1,2,\\ldots,n}$ is a partition of $n-1$.

We work in the general setting of\nderived algebraic geometry: our basic objects are derived stacks X and their\noo-categories QC(X) of quasicoherent sheaves. We show that for a broad class of\nderived stacks, called perfect stacks, algebraic and geometric operations on\ntheir categories of sheaves are compatible. We identify the category of sheaves\non a fiber product with the tensor product of the categories of sheaves on the\nfactors. We also identify the category of sheaves on a fiber product with\nfunctors between the categories of sheaves on the factors (thus realizing\nfunctors as integral transforms, generalizing a theorem of Toen for ordinary\nschemes). As a first application, for a perfect stack X, consider QC(X) with\nits usual monoidal tensor product. Then our main results imply the equivalence\nof the Drinfeld center (or Hochschild cohomology category) of QC(X), the trace\n(or Hochschild homology category) of QC(X) and the category of sheaves on the\nloop space of X. More generally, we show that the E_n-center and the E_n-trace\n(or E_n-Hochschild cohomology and homology categories respectively) of QC(X)\nare equivalent to the category of sheaves on the space of maps from the\nn-sphere into X.

This\nprovides concrete applications to the structure of Hecke algebras in geometric\nrepresentation theory. Finally, we explain how all of the above results can be\ninterpreted in the context of topological field theory. \n\n"}

First for curves which cannot be separated by 2 or fewer nodes, the\nso-called '2-inseparable' curves, the sepcanonical system is just the sections\nof the dualizing sheaf, which is not very ample iff $X_0$ is a limit of smooth\nhyperelliptic curves (such $X_0$ are called 2-inseparable hyperelliptics).\n  For general, 2-separable curves $X_0$ this assertion is false, leading us to\nintroduce the sepcanonical system, which is a collection of linear systems on\nthe '2-inseparable parts' of $X_0$, each associated to a different twisted\nlimit of the canonical system, where the entire collection varies smoothly with\n$X_0$.

They provide simple\nexamples of elliptic fibrations admitting a rich spectrum of singular fibers\n(not all on the list of Kodaira) without introducing singularities in the total\nspace of the fibration and therefore avoiding a discussion of their\nresolutions. We study systematically the fiber geometry of such fibrations\nusing Segre symbols and compute several topological invariants.\n  We present for the first time Sen's (orientifold) limits for D5 elliptic\nfibrations. These orientifolds limit describe different weak coupling limits of\nF-theory to type IIB string theory giving a system of three brane-image-brane\npairs in presence of a Z_2 orientifold. The orientifold theory is\nmathematically described by the double cover the base of the elliptic\nfibration. Such orientifold theories are characterized by a transition from a\nsemi-stable singular fiber to an unstable one.

Following an old suggestion of Clozel, recently realized by\nHarris-Lan-Taylor-Thorne for characteristic 0 cohomology classes, one realizes\nthe cohomology of the locally symmetric spaces for $\\GL_n$ as a boundary\ncontribution of the cohomology of symplectic or unitary Shimura varieties, so\nthat the key problem is to understand torsion in the cohomology of Shimura\nvarieties.\n  Thus, we prove new results on the $p$-adic geometry of Shimura varieties (of\nHodge type).

In the abelian surface case, the theory is parallel to the\nwell-developed study of the reduced Gromov-Witten theory of K3 surfaces. We\nprove complete results in all genera for primitive classes. The generating\nseries are quasimodular forms of pure weight. Conjectures for imprimitive\nclasses are presented. In genus 2, the counts in all classes are proven.\nSpecial counts match the Euler characteristic calculations of the moduli spaces\nof stable pairs on abelian surfaces by G\\\"ottsche-Shende. A formula for\nhyperelliptic curve counting in terms of Jacobi forms is proven (modulo a\ntransversality statement).\n  For abelian threefolds, complete conjectures in terms of Jacobi forms for the\ngenerating series of curve counts in primitive classes are presented. The base\ncases make connections to classical lattice counts of Debarre, Goettsche, and\nLange-Sernesi. Further evidence is provided by Donaldson-Thomas partition\nfunction computations for abelian threefolds. A multiple cover structure is\npresented.

We provide a criterion to determine whether two Azumaya\nalgebras with involutions extending $\\lambda$ are locally isomorphic, describe\nthe equivalence classes obtained by this relation, and settle the question of\nwhen an Azumaya algebra $A$ is Brauer equivalent to an algebra carrying an\ninvolution extending $\\lambda$, by giving a cohomological condition.
