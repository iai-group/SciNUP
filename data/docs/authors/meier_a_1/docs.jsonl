The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the\nself-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for\nGW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the\nevolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the\nsource. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration\nof the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be\nrelevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a\nradius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge\nbetween binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated\nGW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001.

Round-based Models for Quantum Distributed\n  Computing Abstract: Recently, several claims have been made that certain fundamental problems of\ndistributed computing, including Leader Election and Distributed Consensus,\nbegin to admit feasible and efficient solutions when the model of distributed\ncomputation is extended so as to apply quantum processing. This has been\nachieved in one of two distinct ways: (1) by initializing the system in a\nquantum entangled state, and/or (2) by applying quantum communication channels.\nIn this paper, we explain why some of these prior claims are misleading, in the\nsense that they rely on changes to the model unrelated to quantum processing.\nOn the positive side, we consider the aforementioned quantum extensions when\napplied to Linial's well-established LOCAL model of distributed computing.\n  For both types of extensions, we put forward valid proof-of-concept examples\nof distributed problems whose round complexity is in fact reduced through\ngenuinely quantum effects, in contexts which do not depend on the anonymity of\nnodes.\n  Finally, we show that even the quantum variants of the LOCAL model have\nnon-trivial limitations, captured by a very simple (purely probabilistic)\nnotion which we call \"physical locality\" (PLOCAL). While this is strictly\nweaker than the \"computational locality\" of the classical LOCAL model, it\nnevertheless implies that for many distributed combinatorial optimization\nproblems, such as Maximal Independent Set, the best currently known lower time\nbounds cannot be broken by applying quantum processing, in any conceivable way. \n\n"}

Quantum information theory has recently provided new ideas\nfrom which one could obtain physical axioms constraining the resulting\nstatistics one can obtain in experiments.

Using information on the transverse spatial distribution of partons\nobtained from hard exclusive processes in ep/gamma p scattering, we evaluate\nthe impact parameter distribution of pp collisions with a hard parton-parton\nprocess as a function of p_T of the produced parton (jet). We find that the\naverage pp impact parameters in such events depend very weakly on p_T in the\nrange 2 < p_T < few 100 GeV, while they are much smaller than those in\nminimum-bias inelastic collisions. The impact parameters in turn govern the\nobservable transverse multiplicity in such events (in the direction\nperpendicular to the trigger particle or jet). Measuring the transverse\nmultiplicity as a function of p_T thus provides an effective tool for\ndetermining the minimum p_T for which a given trigger particle originates from\na hard parton-parton process.

As it is well known, this intriguing, fundamental\nquantum condition is at the core of a famous argument conceived by Erwin\nSchroedinger, back in 1935. The main experimental challenge to the actual\nrealization of this object resides generally on the unavoidable and\nuncontrolled interactions with the environment, i.e. the decoherence leading to\nthe cancellation of any evidence of the quantum features associated with the\nmacroscopic system. The present scheme is based on a nonlinear process, the\n\"quantum injected optical parametric amplification\", that maps by a linearized\ncloning process the quantum coherence of a single - particle state, i.e. a\nMicro - qubit, into a Macro - qubit, consisting in a large number M of photons\nin quantum superposition. Since the adopted scheme was found resilient to\ndecoherence, the MQS\\ demonstration was carried out experimentally at room\ntemperature with $M\\geq $ $10^{4}$.

Furthermore we show that scenarios with mixed\nneutralino/axion dark matter are highly constrained by combined WMAP9, BBN and\nXe-100 constraints. In particular, supersymmetric models with a standard\noverabundance of neutralino dark matter are excluded for all values of the\nPeccei-Quinn breaking scale.

The second way is applicable to metric spaces\nwith selected indexed denumerable dense subsets.

The optimal qubit is found to have basis states defined\nas the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the lowest energy\nbonding and anti-bonding states of the DQD at zero bias. In contrast to charge\nqubits defined by the two localised ground states of the uncoupled DQD, this\nchoice of the basis causes the resulting dynamics to have a maximal overlap\nwith an idealised two-state model. Our optimal qubit basis states are not\nlocalised to a single quantum dot and, as such, initialising the qubit requires\na particular sequence of gate pulses to take the system from an initial\nfiducial state of the DQD to the logical $0$ or $1$.

A particular focus is put\non sub-cycle and single-cycle pulses and their utilization for coherent\ncontrol. The discussion is mostly limited to cases where the pulse duration is\nshorter than the characteristic time scales associated with the involved\nspectral features of the excitations. We work out that the pulse action amounts\nin essence to a quantum map between the quantum states of the system at an\nappropriately chosen time moment during the pulse. The influence of a\nparticular pulse shape on the post-pulse dynamics is reduced to several\nintegral parameters entering the expression for the quantum map. The validity\nrange of this reduction scheme for different strengths of the driving fields is\nestablished and discussed for particular nanostructures.

When quark loops are included, this prescription is however\ninconsistent, and the correct identification involves the renormalized pion\ndecay constant and the sigma pole mass. In the present article we investigate\nthe influence of the parameter-fixing scheme on the phase structure of the\nmodel at finite temperature and chemical potential. Despite large differences\nbetween the model parameters in the two schemes, we find that in homogeneous\nmatter the effect on the phase diagram is relatively small. For inhomogeneous\nphases, on the other hand, the choice of the proper renormalization\nprescription is crucial. In particular, we show that if renormalization effects\non the pion decay constant are not considered, the model does not even present\na well-defined renormalized limit when the cutoff is sent to infinity. \n\n"}

A notable exception were the algebraic algorithms over the field\nGF(2), for which no lower bound was known. Another, in some way even stronger,\napproach to graph isomorphism testing is based on solving systems of linear\nDiophantine equations (that is, linear equations over the integers), which is\nknown to be possible in polynomial time. So far, no lower bounds for this\napproach were known.\n  Lower bounds for the algebraic algorithms can best be proved in the framework\nof proof complexity, where they can be phrased as lower bounds for algebraic\nproof systems such as Nullstellensatz or the (more powerful) polynomial\ncalculus.

Dynamic evolution is in terms of the path\nparameter rather than the frame-dependent time coordinate. Further, the states\nof the theory are allowed to be off shell.

We introduce more in detail the context of constructive\nmathematics from different points of view, and we show how they are related to\nMarkov's principle. In particular, several realizability semantics are\npresented, which provide interpretations of logical systems by means of\ndifferent computational concepts (mainly, recursive functions and lambda\ncalculi). This field of research gave origin to the well known paradigm often\ncalled Curry-Howrd isomorphism, or also propositions as types, that states a\ncorrespondence between proofs in logic and programs in computer science. Thanks\nto this the field of proof theory, that is the metamathematical investigations\nof proofs as mathematical objects, became of interest for computer science and\nin particular for the study of programming languages. By using modern research\non the Curry-Howard isomorphism, we will obtain a more refined interpretation\nof Markov's principle. We will then use this results to investigate the logical\nproperties of systems related to the principle, and introduce a proof\ntransformation technique to interpret constructively some non-constructive\nproofs of arithmetic. \n\n"}

Recent studies have aimed at improving sensitivity through the\nuse of quantum error correction (QEC) to detect and correct any bit-flip errors\nthat may occur during the sensing period.

This is a consequence of the fact that the energy relaxation induces\nboth a phase-flip and a bit-flip noise where the former noise cannot be\ndistinguished from the relative phase induced from the target fields. However,\nwe have found that we can improve the sensitivity if we adopt postselection to\ndiscard the state when error is detected.

Using Olariu's characterization of paw-free\ngraphs, we show that $I(K_3+e)$ is definable by a first-order sentence of\nquantifier depth 3, where $K_3+e$ denotes the paw graph. This provides an\nexample of a graph $F$ with $W[F]$ strictly less than the number of vertices in\n$F$. On the other hand, we prove that $W[F]=4$ for all $F$ on 4 vertices except\nthe paw graph and its complement. If $F$ is a graph on $t$ vertices, we prove a\ngeneral lower bound $W[F]>(1/2-o(1))t$, where the function in the little-o\nnotation approaches 0 as $t$ inreases. This bound holds true even for a related\nparameter $W^*[F]\\le W[F]$, which is defined as the minimum $k$ such that\n$I(F)$ is definable in the infinitary logic $L^k_{\\infty\\omega}$. We show that\n$W^*[F]$ can be strictly less than $W[F]$. Specifically, $W^*[P_4]=3$ for $P_4$\nbeing the path graph on 4 vertices.\n  Using the lower bound for $W[F]$, we also obtain a succintness result for\nexistential monadic second-order logic: A usage of just one monadic quantifier\nsometimes reduces the first-order quantifier depth at a super-recursive rate. \n\n"}

States\nrepresented in this way, called Neural Network States (NNSs), were shown to\ndisplay interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture\nlong-range quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network\nrepresentation of a given state might be challenging, and so far this problem\nhas been addressed with stochastic optimization techniques. In this work we\nexplore a different direction. We study how the action of elementary quantum\noperations modifies NNSs. We parametrize a family of many body quantum\noperations that can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted\nBoltzmann Machines, by just adding hidden nodes and updating the network\nparameters. We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal\nquantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum\ncircuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden\nnodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the\ncircuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which was recently obtained\nwith different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no\ngeneral and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted\ndescription of quantum states. To circumvent this problem, we propose a\nstep-wise procedure based on the projection of Unrestricted quantum states to\nRestricted quantum states. In turn, two approximate methods to perform this\nprojection are discussed. In this way, we show that it is in principle possible\nto approximately optimize or evolve Neural Network States without relying on\nstochastic methods such as Variational Monte Carlo, which are computationally\nexpensive. \n\n"}

As in full observation, the strategy in the MDP\ncan depend on the state of the system, but similar to partial information, the\nstrategy needs to account for all the states at the same time. In this paper,\nwe focus on two safety problems that arise naturally in this context, namely,\nexistential and universal safety. Given an MDP A and a closed and convex\npolytope H of probability distributions over the states of A, the existential\nsafety problem asks whether there exists some distribution d in H and a\nstrategy of A, such that starting from d and repeatedly applying this strategy\nkeeps the distribution forever in H. The universal safety problem asks whether\nfor all distributions in H, there exists such a strategy of A which keeps the\ndistribution forever in H. We prove that both problems are decidable, with\ntight complexity bounds: we show that existential safety is PTIME-complete,\nwhile universal safety is co-NP-complete. Further, we compare these results\nwith existential and universal safety problems for Rabin's probabilistic\nfinite-state automata (PFA), the subclass of Partially Observable MDPs which\nhave zero observation.

A simple permutation trick\nin combination with a one-parameter expansion for a single topology, which is\nnow implemented to any order, eliminate rank-two Gram determinant instabilities\naltogether. Due to this any-order expansion, the numerical accuracy of the\nalgorithm can be determined with a rescaling test. The on-the-fly algorithm is\nfully implemented for double and quadruple precision, which allows for true\nquadruple precision benchmarks with up to 32 correct digits as well as a\npowerful rescue system for unstable points. We present first speed and\nstability results for these new features. The on-the-fly algorithm is part of\nthe forthcoming release of OpenLoops 2. \n\n"}

Performing the analysis in the R_n-R_c plane, which is\nvery suitable for monitoring various effects, we demonstrate that we may, in\nfact, move straightforwardly to the experimental region in this plane through\nan enhancement of the relevant EW penguin parameter q. We derive analytical\nbounds for q in terms of a quantity L, that measures the violation of the\nLipkin sum rule, and point out that strong phases around 90 deg are favoured by\nthe data, in contrast to QCD factorisation. The B -> pi K modes imply a\ncorrelation between q and the angle gamma that in the limit of negligible\nrescattering effects and colour suppressed EW penguins depends only on the\nvalue of L.

Unlike the standard scenario of PBH formation from string loops, in\nwhich the kinetic energy plays important role when strings collapse into black\nholes, the PBH formation may occur in our scenario after necklaces have\ndissipated their kinetic energy. Then, the significant difference appears in\nthe production ratio. In the standard scenario, the production ratio $f$\nbecomes a tiny fraction $f\\sim 10^{-20}$, however it becomes $f \\sim 1$ in our\ncase. On the other hand, the typical mass of the PBHs is much smaller than the\nstandard scenario, if they are produced in the same epoch.

Although the result obtained in this\npaper depends on the evolution of the dimensionless parameter $r$, the\nexistence of the winding state could be a serious problem in some cases.

We compare the performance of walk based classical\nand quantum algorithms and show that the latter run much quicker in general.\nLet $P$ be a symmetric Markov chain with transition probabilities $P[i,j]$, $(i\n,j\\in [n])$. Some elements of the state space are marked. We are promised that\nthe set of marked elements has size either zero or at least $\\epsilon n$. The\ngoal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds.\nOur model is a black box that can answer certain yes/no questions and can\ngenerate random elements picked from certain distributions.

Here we isolate the ingredients of\nthe theorem and provide generalisations of some of them with the aim of\nidentifying new classes of simulable quantum computations. In the usual\nconstruction, Clifford operations arise as projective normalisers of the first\nand second tensor powers of the Pauli group. We consider replacing the Pauli\ngroup by an arbitrary finite subgroup G of U(d). In particular we seek G such\nthat G tensor G has an entangling normaliser. Via a generalisation of the\nGottesman-Knill theorem the resulting normalisers lead to classes of quantum\ncircuits that can be classically efficiently simulated. For the qubit case d=2\nwe exhaustively treat all finite subgroups of U(2) and find that the only ones\n(up to unitary equivalence and trivial phase extensions) with entangling\nnormalisers are the groups G_n generated by X and the n^th root of Z. \n\n"}

The \"and then\"\nconnective is neither commutative nor associative. Many properties of this\nlogic are exhibited, and some small elegant subset is shown to imply all the\nproperties considered. No independence or completeness result is claimed.\nClassical physical systems are exactly characterized by the commutativity, the\nassociativity, or the monotonicity of the \"and then\" connective.

An essential part of the validation process for quantum mechanics\nis the development of a coherent theory of mathematics and quantum mechanics\ntogether. Such a theory should combine mathematical logical concepts with\nquantum mechanics. That this might be possible is shown here by defining truth,\nvalidity, consistency, and completeness for a quantum mechanical version of a\nsimple classical expression enumeration machine described by Smullyan. It is\nseen that for an interpretation based on a Feynman path sum over expression\npath states, truth, consistency, and completeness have different properties\nthan for the classical system. For instance the truth of a sentence S is\ndefined only on the paths containing S. It is undefined elsewhere. Also S and\nits negation can both be true provided they appear on separate paths. This\nsatisfies the definition of consistency. It is seen that validity and\ncompleteness connect the system dynamics to the truth of the sentences. It is\nproved that validity implies consistency. The requirements of validity and\nmaximal completeness strongly restrict the possible dynamics of the system.\nAspects of the existence of a valid, maximally complete dynamics are discussed.\nAn exponentially efficient quantum computer is described that is also valid and\ncomplete. \n\n"}
