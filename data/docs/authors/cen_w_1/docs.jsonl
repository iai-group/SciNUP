The amplitudes of charmless B decays can be decomposed into \"tree\" and\n\"penguin\" parts which are conventionally defined, not from the topology of the\ndominant diagrams, but through their associated CKM factors V_{ub}^* V_{uq} and\nV_{tb}^* V_{tq}, respectively, with q=d,s. We find that for B_{d,s} \\to \\pi^+\nK^- decays, the \"tree\" amplitude can be well estimated in QCDF with small\nerrors, as the endpoint singularities have been canceled to a large extent.\nWith this as the only input from QCDF and combined with flavor symmetry, the\nbranching ratio of B_s \\to \\pi^+ K^- are estimated to be significantly larger\nthan the CDF measurement. This contradiction could be solved if the form factor\nF^{B_s K} is smaller than the light cone sum rules estimation or the \"tree\"\namplitude has been over estimated in QCDF. The latter possibility could happen\nif charming penguins are nonperturbative and not small, as argued in soft\ncollinear effective theory.

Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and\nunambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana\nneutrino mass, m_bb. In order to make sense of how the different experimental\napproaches compare, we apply this recipe to a selection of proposals, comparing\nthe resulting sensitivities. We also propose a \"physics-motivated range\" (PMR)\nof the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different\nnuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in\nterms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,\nisotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass. For each\nproposal, both a reference and an optimistic scenario for the experimental\nperformance are studied. In the reference scenario we find that all the\nproposals will be able to partially explore the degenerate spectrum, without\nfully covering it, although four of them (KamLAND-Zen, CUORE, NEXT and EXO)\nwill approach the 50 meV boundary. In the optimistic scenario, we find that\nCUORE and the xenon-based proposals (KamLAND-Zen, EXO and NEXT) will explore a\nsignificant fraction of the inverse hierarchy, with NEXT covering it almost\nfully. For the long term future, we argue that Xe-based experiments may provide\nthe best case for a 1-ton scale experiment, given the potentially very low\nbackgrounds achievable and the expected scalability to large isotope masses. \n\n"}

The complete setup of the experiment consisted of a\nsilicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter, an analog scintillator-steel\nhadron calorimeter and a scintillator-steel tail catcher. Events collected\nusing pion beams in the energy range 8-100 GeV are selected and compared to the\nMonte Carlo simulations. While the leakage from the full setup is negligible,\nwhen removing the tail catcher information either partly or completely the\nenergy loss becomes significant and affects the performance. The average\nmeasured energy decreases below the expected beam energy and the resolution\ndeteriorates. A correction to the leakage was implemented for pions. The\nresults obtained show that the correction is powerful in restoring the mean\nvalue of the measured energy distributions back to the expected beam energy,\nwith an accuracy at the 1-2% level over the whole energy range. The relative\nimprovement on the resolution is about 25% at 80 GeV, decreasing at lower\nenergies together with the impact of the leakage. \n\n"}

We investigate the charge asymmetry in top pair +\njet production in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and with additional massive\ncolor-octet vector bosons. The total charge asymmetry at the LHC is suppressed\nby the large charge-symmetric background from gluon-gluon fusion. We show to\nwhat extent the asymmetry can be enhanced by suitable phase space cuts and, in\nparticular, elaborate on the kinematics of the hard jet in the top pair + jet\nfinal state. We demonstrate that in QCD, the asymmetry amounts to -1.5% for\ncentral jets without an excessive reduction of the cross section. By applying\nadditional kinematical cuts, the asymmetry can be enhanced to -4%, but at the\ncost of a strong reduction of the cross section. Massive color-octet states can\ngenerate sizeable effects in top pair + jet production, both on the charge\nasymmetry and on the cross section. The charge asymmetry probes both vector and\naxial-vector couplings to quarks.

Liquid xenon is widely considered to\nbe one of the best target media for detection of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particles which may form the galactic dark matter) using nuclear\nrecoils.

We ascribed this difference to a\nnon-unitary interaction of the produced final state rho_f(S) with a universal\nquantum environment in the Universe. This new kind of interaction must be a\npure dephasing interaction. If the quantum environment is to be an integral\npart of the Nature then its dephasing interactions must be fully consistent\nwith the Standard Model. In this work we impose on the dephasing interaction\nthe requirements of the conservation of the identities and four-momenta of the\nfinal state particles, Lorentz symmetry, P-parity and the conservation of total\nangular momentum and isospin.

By means of multidimensional fits, we\nderive the current preferred values of the high-energy neutrino flavor ratios,\nthe normalization and spectral index of the astrophysical fluxes, and the\nexpected atmospheric background events, including a prompt component. A crucial\nassumption resides on the choice of the energy interval used for the analyses,\nwhich significantly biases the results. When restricting ourselves to the ~30\nTeV - 3 PeV energy range, which contains all the observed IceCube events, we\nfind that the inclusion of the spectral information improves the fit to the\ncanonical flavor composition at Earth, (1:1:1), with respect to a single-energy\nbin analysis. Increasing both the minimum and the maximum deposited energies\nhas dramatic effects on the reconstructed flavor ratios as well as on the\nspectral index.

Extending the\nhigh-energy cutoff to fully cover the Glashow resonance region leads to a\nsofter spectrum and a preference for tau neutrino dominance, as none of the\nexpected electron antineutrino induced showers have been observed so far.

In general, SARAH can handle a wide range of models beyond\nthe MSSM coming with additional chiral superfields, extra gauge groups, or\ndistinctive features like Dirac gaugino masses. All of these models can be\nimplemented in a compact form in SARAH and are easy to use: SARAH extracts all\nanalytical properties of the given model like two-loop renormalization group\nequations, tadpole equations, mass matrices and vertices. Also one- and\ntwo-loop corrections to tadpoles and self-energies can be obtained.

We\nfirst show that the Standard Model (SM) Higgs Lagrangian is equivalent to the\nscale-invariant nonlinear chiral Lagrangian, which is further gauge equivalent\nto the scale-invariant HLS model, with the scale symmetry realized nonlinearly\nvia SM Higgs as a (pseudo-) dilaton. The scale symmetry forbids the new vector\nboson decay to the 125 GeV Higgs plus W/Z boson, in sharp contrast to the\nconventional \"equivalence theorem\" which is invalidated by the conformality.\nThe HLS forbids mixing between the iso-triplet technirho's, rho_{Pi} and\nrho_{P}, of the one-family walking technicolor (with four doublets\nN_D=N_F/2=4), which, without the HLS, would be generated when switching on the\nstandard model gauging. We also present updated analyses of the walking\ntechnrho's for the diboson excesses by fully incorporating the constraints from\nthe conformal barrier and the HLS as well as possible higher order effects:\nstill characteristic of the one-family walking technirho is its smallness of\nthe decay width, roughly of order Gamma/M_rho ~ [3/N_C x 1/N_D] x\n[Gamma/M_rho]_{QCD} ~ 70 GeV/2TeV (N_D= N_C=4), in perfect agreement with the\nexpected diboson resonance with Gamma<100 GeV.

The interpretation of the excess as a spin-zero s-channel\nresonance implies model-independent lower bounds on both its branching ratio\nand its coupling to photons, which stringently constrain dynamical models. We\nconsider both the case where the excess is described by a narrow and a broad\nresonance. We also obtain model-independent constraints on the allowed\ncouplings and branching fractions to final states other than diphotons, by\nincluding the interplay with 8 TeV searches. These results can guide attempts\nto construct viable dynamical models of the resonance. Turning to specific\nmodels, our findings suggest that the anomaly cannot be accounted for by the\npresence of only an additional singlet or doublet spin-zero field and the\nStandard Model degrees of freedom; this includes all two-Higgs-doublet models.\nLikewise, heavy scalars in the MSSM cannot explain the excess if stability of\nthe electroweak vacuum is required, at least in a leading-order analysis.

However, we provide an existence proof in the form\nof a model with vectorlike quarks with large electric charge that is\nperturbative up to the 100 TeV scale. For the narrow-resonance case a similar\nmodel can be perturbative up to high scales also with smaller charges.

To maximize the science return from such a rare\nevent, it is essential to have established classes of possible situations and\npreparations for appropriate observations. To this end, we use a long-term\nnumerical simulation of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) of a 17 solar-mass\nred supergiant progenitor to self-consistently model the multi-messenger\nsignals expected in GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic messengers. This\nsupernova model takes into account the formation and evolution of a\nprotoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction, and neutrino transport, all\nwithin a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation.

The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that\nthe volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma\neffect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the\nionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the\ninterior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the\nplasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero\nfield is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear\nrecoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes.

Recently, using an effective field theory approach,\nit was demonstrated that a new-physics model can simultaneously explain both\nthe $R_K$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}$ puzzles. There are two UV completions that can give\nrise to the effective Lagrangian: (i) $VB$: a vector boson that transforms as\nan $SU(2)_L$ triplet, as in the SM, (ii) $U_1$: an $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector\nleptoquark. In this paper, we examine these models individually. A key point is\nthat $VB$ contributes to $B^0_s$-${\\bar B}^0_s$ mixing and $\\tau \\to 3\\mu$,\nwhile $U_1$ does not.

Further, as LHC keeps excluding all expected candidates for\nnew physics, the need for a generic method/tool that is capable of finding the\nunexpected can not be understated.

In particular,\nthe role of color flow is now being explored through many different\nobservables; one such observable is nearly back-to-back hadron correlations in\nproton-proton collisions which are predicted to be sensitive to states that are\nentangled via their QCD color charge. The PHENIX detector at the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider is well suited to study potential effects from color flow.\nAngular correlations between nearly back-to-back hadrons or a direct\nphoton-hadron are measured to study the prediction of color entanglement or\nfactorization breaking. The correlations can be treated in a\ntransverse-momentum-dependent framework where sensitivity to non-Abelian\neffects from color are predicted. These measurements are the first ever to\nsearch for experimental evidence of these entangled states and will help\nestablish color flow in hadronic interactions as a new area of focus within QCD\nresearch. Results are presented for proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass\nenergies of 200 and 510 GeV and proton-nucleus collisions at nucleon-nucleon\ncenter-of-mass energies of 200 GeV.

We then investigate the\neffects of magnetic monopoles and instantons. First, we confirm the monopole\neffects as follows: (i) The monopole creation operator makes the monopoles and\nanti-monopoles in the QCD vacuum. (ii) A monopole and anti-monopole pair\ncreates an instanton or anti-instanton without changing the structure of the\nQCD vacuum. (iii) The monopole and anti-monopole pairs change only the scale of\nthe spectrum distribution without affecting the spectra of the Dirac operator\nby comparing the spectra with random matrix theory.

(v) The\nvalues of the chiral condensate, which are defined as negative numbers,\ndecrease. (vi) The light quarks and the pseudoscalar mesons become heavy.

The proliferation of these matrix elements complicates their extraction\nat $1/m_b^4$ and higher, thereby limiting the $V_{cb}$ extraction.\nReparametrization invariance links different operators in the Heavy-Quark\nexpansion thus reducing the number of independent operators at $1/m_b^4$ to\neight for the total rate. We show that this reduction also holds for spectral\nmoments as long as they are defined by reparametrization invariant\nweight-functions. This is valid in particular for the leptonic invariant mass\nspectrum ($q^2$), i.e. the differential rate and its moments. Currently,\n$V_{cb}$ is determined by fitting the energy and hadronic mass moments, which\ndo not manifest this parameter reduction and depend on the full set of 13\nmatrix elements up to $1/m_b^4$. In light of this, we propose an experimental\nanalysis of the $q^2$ moments to open the possibility of a model-independent\n$V_{cb}$ extraction from semileptonic decays including the $1/m_b^4$ terms in a\nfully data-driven way. \n\n"}

{"id": "astro-ph/9811350", "contents": "Title: Can a supernova be located by its neutrinos? Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

Still the flavor\ndependence of the nucleon's spin is a significant fundamental question that is\nnot understood. Experiments measuring the spin content of the nucleon have\nreported conflicting results on the amount of nucleon spin carried by strange\nquarks. Quasi-elastic neutrino scattering, observed using a novel detection\ntechnique, provides a theoretically clean measure of this quantity.\n  The optimum neutrino beam energy needed to measure the strange spin of the\nnucleon is 1 GeV. This is also an ideal energy to search for neutrino\noscillations at high $\\Delta m^2$ in an astrophysically interesting region.\nModels of the r-process in supernovae which include high-mass sterile neutrinos\nmay explain the abundance of neutron-rich heavy metals in the universe.

This indicates the presence of\ncollective effect which cannot be accounted for by the initial state collision\nbroadening of transverse momentum of produced hadrons, the basis of random walk\nmodel. \n\n"}

Abstract: Knowing whether a hadron is formed inside or outside the nuclear medium is\nvery important for correctly interpreting jet quenching in heavy-ion\ncollisions. The cleanest experimental environment to study the space-time\nevolution of hadronization is semi-inclusive DIS on nuclear targets. Two\nframeworks are presently competing to explain the observed attenuation of\nhadron production: quark energy loss, with hadron formation outside the\nnucleus, and nuclear absorption with hadronization starting inside the nucleus.\nI demonstrate that the observed approximate A^(2/3) scaling of experimental\ndata cannot conclusively establish the correctness of either energy loss or\nabsorption. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/0606058", "contents": "Title: Neutral current neutrino-nucleus interactions at intermediate energies Abstract: We have extended our model for charged current neutrino-nucleus interactions\nto neutral current reactions. For the elementary neutrino-nucleon interaction,\nwe take into account quasielastic scattering, Delta excitation and the\nexcitation of the resonances in the second resonance region. Our model for the\nneutrino-nucleus collisions includes in-medium effects such as Fermi motion,\nPauli blocking, nuclear binding, and final-state interactions. They are\nimplemented by means of the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU)\ncoupled-channel transport model. This allows us to study exclusive channels,\nnamely pion production and nucleon knockout. We find that final-state\ninteractions modify considerably the distributions through rescattering,\ncharge-exchange and absorption. Side-feeding induced by charge-exchange\nscattering is important in both cases. In the case of pions, there is a strong\nabsorption associated with the in-medium pionless decay modes of the Delta,\nwhile nucleon knockout exhibits a considerable enhancement of low energy\nnucleons due to rescattering. At neutrino energies above 1 GeV, we also obtain\nthat the contribution to nucleon knockout from Delta excitation is comparable\nto that from quasielastic scattering. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/0501071", "contents": "Title: 6D Ionization Muon Cooling with Tabletop Rings Abstract: Progress on six dimensional ionization muon cooling with relatively small\nrings of magnets is described. Lattices being explored include scaling sector\ncyclotrons with edge focusing and strong focusing, fixed field alternating\ngradient (FFAG) rings. Ionization cooling is provided by high pressure hydrogen\ngas which removes both transverse and longitudinal momentum. Lost longitudinal\nmomentum is replaced using radio frequency (RF) cavities, giving a net\ntransverse emittance reduction. The longer path length in the hydrogen of\nhigher momentum muons decreases longitudinal emittance at the expense of\ntransverse emittance. Thus emittance exchange allows these rings to cool in all\nsix dimensions and not just transversely. Alternatively, if the RF is located\nafter the ring, it may be possible to cool the muons by stopping them as they\nspiral adiabatically into a central swarm. As momentum goes to zero, the\nmomentum spread goes to zero. The resulting cooled muons can lead to an intense\nmuon beam which could be a source for neutrino factories or muon colliders. \n\n"}

The normalized 6D emittance of an ideal ring is decreased by a\nfactor of approximately 240, compared with a factor of only 15 for the linear\nchannel. We also examine such \\textit{real-world} effects as windows on the\nabsorbers and rf cavities and leaving empty lattice cells for injection and\nextraction.
