As such, it correlates strongly with observables\nin finite nuclei that depend on neutron-to-proton imbalance and the nuclear\nsymmetry energy that characterizes the equation of state of neutron-rich\nmatter. A rich worldwide experimental program involving studies with rare\nisotopes, parity violating electron scattering, and astronomical observations\nis devoted to pinning down the isovector sector of nuclear models. Purpose: We\nassess the theoretical systematic and statistical uncertainties of neutron-skin\nthickness and relate them to the equation of state of nuclear matter, and in\nparticular to nuclear symmetry energy parameters. Methods: We use the nuclear\nsuperfluid Density Functional Theory with several Skyrme energy density\nfunctionals and density dependent pairing. To evaluate statistical errors and\ntheir budget, we employ the statistical covariance technique. Results: We find\nthat the errors on neutron skin increase with neutron excess. Statistical\nerrors due to uncertain coupling constants of the density functional are found\nto be larger than systematic errors, the latter not exceeding 0.06 fm in most\nneutron-rich nuclei across the nuclear landscape. The single major source of\nuncertainty is the poorly determined slope L of the symmetry energy that\nparametrizes its density dependence.

Purpose: A relativistic energy density functional\n(EDF) is developed to address the complexity of such diverse nuclear systems.\nMoreover, a statistical perspective is adopted to describe the information\ncontent of various physical observables. Methods: We implement the model\noptimization by minimizing a suitably constructed chi-square objective function\nusing various properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. The minimization\nis then supplemented by a covariance analysis that includes both uncertainty\nestimates and correlation coefficients. Results: A new model, FSUGold2, is\ncreated that can well reproduce the ground-state properties of finite nuclei,\ntheir monopole response, and that accounts for the maximum neutron star mass\nobserved up to date. In particular, the model predicts both a stiff symmetry\nenergy and a soft equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter--suggesting a\nfairly large neutron-skin thickness in Pb208 and a moderate value of the\nnuclear incompressibility.

In spontaneous fission, half-lives are the main observables\nand quantum tunnelling the essential concept, while in induced fission the\nfocus is on fragment properties and explicitly time-dependent approaches are\nneeded. The cornerstone of the current microscopic theory of fission is the\nenergy density functional formalism. Its basic tenets, including tools such as\nthe HFB theory, effective two-body effective nuclear potentials,\nfinite-temperature extensions and beyond mean-field corrections, are presented\nsuccinctly. The EDF approach is often combined with the hypothesis that the\ntime-scale of the large amplitude collective motion driving the system to\nfission is slow compared to typical time-scales of nucleons inside the nucleus.\nIn practice, this hypothesis of adiabaticity is implemented by introducing (a\nfew) collective variables and mapping out the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation\ninto a collective Schr\\\"odinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet.\nScission configurations indicate where the split occurs. This collective\nSchr\\\"odinger equation depends on an inertia tensor that includes the response\nof the system to small changes in the collective variables and also plays a\nspecial role in the determination of spontaneous fission half-lives.

Their size is determined\nby two time scales: the equilibration time specifying the formation of a\nquark-gluon plasma, and the hadronization time, specifying the onset of\nconfinement.

For finite quantum systems\n(atoms, molecules, nuclei), the commonly used periodic or reflecting boundary\nconditions introduce spurious quantization of the continuum states and\nartificial reflections from boundary; hence, an incorrect treatment of\nevaporated particles. These artifacts can be practically cured by introducing\nabsorbing boundary conditions (ABC) through an absorbing potential in a certain\nboundary region sufficiently far from the described system. But also the\ncalculations of infinite matter (crystal electrons, quantum fluids, neutron\nstar crust) suffer artifacts from a finite computational box.

Although the two\nmethods should give the same results theoretically, qualitatively different\nresults have been reported. Recently, we pointed out that the separation of the\nground state from the excited states is crucial to obtain sensible results in\nthe former, while both states provide useful signals in the latter. In this\npaper, we identify the contribution of each state in the direct method by\ndecomposing the two-baryon correlators into the finite-volume eigenmodes\nobtained from the HAL QCD method. We consider the $\\Xi\\Xi$ system in the\n$^1$S$_0$ channel at $m_\\pi = 0.51$ GeV in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD using the\nwall and smeared quark sources. We demonstrate that the \"pseudo-plateau\" at\nearly time slices (t = 1~2 fm) from the smeared source in the direct method\nindeed originates from the contamination of the excited states, and the true\nplateau with the ground state saturation is realized only at t > 5~15 fm\ncorresponding to the inverse of the lowest excitation energy. We also\ndemonstrate that the two-baryon operator can be optimized by utilizing the\nfinite-volume eigenmodes, so that (i) the finite-volume energy spectra from the\nHAL QCD method agree with those from the optimized temporal correlator and (ii)\nthe correct spectra would be accessed in the direct method only if highly\noptimized operators are employed.

In the Landau gauge, the\nequations are free of renormalization constants, and the renormalization point\ndependence enters only through the renormalized coupling and the renormalized\npropagator functions. The structure of the equations enables us to devise novel\ntruncations with solutions that are multiplicatively renormalizable and agree\nwith the leading order perturbative results.

The common building block is the quark\nantiquark (or gluon-gluon) dipole cross section which is present in both DIS\nand pA processes.

Preceding\ncalculations in chiral effective field theories only employed pion and nucleon\ndegrees of freedom and were not able to reproduce the photon spectrum in the\npioneering experiment of radiative muon capture on the proton from TRIUMF. For\nthe past few years it has been speculated that the discrepancy between theory\nand experiment might be due to Delta(1232) related effects, which are only\nincluded via higher order contact interactions in the standard chiral approach.\nIn this report we demonstrate that this speculation does not hold true. We show\nthat contrary to expectations from naive dimensional analysis isobar effects on\nthe photon spectrum and the total rate in radiative muon capture are of the\norder of a few percent, consistent with earlier findings in a more\nphenomenological approach.

This leads to a step-like enhancement\nin the reaction rate.

The Brown-Rho scaling recently identified as\nthe parametric dependence intrinsic in the \"vector manifestation\" of hidden\nlocal symmetry theory of Harada and Yamawaki results from the first decimation.\nThis scaling governs dynamics down to the scale at which the Fermi surface is\nformed as a quantum critical phenomenon. The next decimation to the top of the\nFermi sea where standard nuclear physics is operative makes up the Fermi liquid\ndecimation. Thus nuclear dynamics is dictated by two fixed points, namely, the\nvector manifestation fixed point and the Fermi liquid fixed point. It has been\na prevalent practice in nuclear physics community to proceed with the second\ndecimation only, assuming density independent masses. We show why most nuclear\nphenomena can be reproduced by theories using either density-independent, or\ndensity-dependent masses, a grand conspiracy of nature that is an aspect that\ncould be tied to the Cheshire-Cat phenomenon in hadron physics. We identify\nwhat is left out in the Fermi liquid decimation that does not incorporate the\nCSD.

To investigate correlations and clusters beyond four-body, we employ,\ninstead, the configuration space two-variable integro-differential equations\n(IDEA) for $A$-body bound systems which are based on Hyperspherical Harmonics\nand the Faddeev decomposition of the wave function in two-body amplitudes.

Comparison of evolution of ideal and\nviscous fluid, both initialised under the same conditions e.g. same\nequilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, reveal that the\ndissipative fluid evolves slowly, cooling at a slower rate. Cooling get still\nslower for higher viscosity. The fluid velocities on the otherhand evolve\nfaster in a dissipative fluid than in an ideal fluid. The transverse expansion\nis also enhanced in dissipative evolution. For the same decoupling temperature,\nfreeze-out surface for a dissipative fluid is more extended than an ideal\nfluid. Dissipation produces entropy as a result of which particle production is\nincreased. Particle production is increased due to (i) extension of the\nfreeze-out surface and (ii) change of the equilibrium distribution function to\na non-equilibrium one, the last effect being prominent at large transverse\nmomentum. Compared to ideal fluid, transverse momentum distribution of pion\nproduction is considerably enhanced. Enhancement is more at high $p_T$ than at\nlow $p_T$. Pion production also increases with viscosity, larger the viscosity,\nmore is the pion production. Dissipation also modifies the elliptic flow.\nElliptic flow is reduced in viscous dynamics. Also, contrary to ideal dynamics\nwhere elliptic flow continues to increase with transverse momentum, in viscous\ndynamics, elliptic flow tends to saturate at large transverse momentum. The\nanalysis suggest that initial conditions of the hot, dense matter produced in\nAu+Au collisions at RHIC, as extracted from ideal fluid analysis can be changed\nsignificantly if the QGP fluid is viscous. \n\n"}

Potentials for the $\\eta$ and $\\omega$ mesons in\nthese nuclei are calculated in local density approximation, embedding the\nmesons in the nucleus described by solving the mean-field equations of motion\nin the QMC model. Our results suggest that one should expect to find $\\eta$-\nand $\\omega$-nucleus bound states in all these nuclei. \n\n"}

Subsequent dynamic and static effects are\nexplored. The treatment is based on a self-consistent microscopic approach\nusing the jellium approximation for the ionic background and the Kohn-Sham mean\nfield for the electrons. The microscopic origin of SM and its main features\n(structure of the mode in light and medium clusters, separation into low- and\nhigh-energy plasmons, coupling high-energy M1 scissors and E2 quadrupole\nplasmons, contributions of shape isomers, etc) are discussed. The scissors M1\nstrength acquires large values with increasing cluster size. The mode is\nresponsible for the van Vleck paramagnetism of spin-saturated clusters. Quantum\nshell effects induce a fragile interplay between Langevin diamagnetism and van\nVleck paramagnetism and lead to a remarkable dia-para anisotropy in magnetic\nsusceptibility of particular light clusters. Finally, several routes for\nobserving the SM experimentally are discussed. \n\n"}

A typical solution to the numerical burden is to use a special\nbasis-function set, which is tailored to the problem in question, for example,\nthe atomic orbital basis.

Following the bound-state energies to\nthe point where they cross thresholds gives very precise predictions of the\nmagnetic fields at which zero-energy Feshbach resonances occur. We have used\nthis to locate and characterize two very narrow Feshbach resonances in 3He-NH.\nSuch resonances can be used to tune elastic and inelastic collision cross\nsections, and sweeping the magnetic field across them will allow a form of\nquantum control in which separated atoms and molecules are associated to form\ncomplexes. For the first resonance, where only elastic scattering is possible,\nthe scattering length shows a pole as a function of magnetic field and there is\na very large peak in the elastic cross section. For the second resonance,\nhowever, inelastic scattering is also possible. In this case the pole in the\nscattering length is dramatically suppressed and the cross sections show\nrelatively small peaks. The peak suppression is expected to be even larger in\nsystems with stronger inelasticity. The results suggest that calculations on\nultracold molecular inelastic collisions may be much less sensitive to details\nof the potential energy surface than has been believed. \n\n"}
