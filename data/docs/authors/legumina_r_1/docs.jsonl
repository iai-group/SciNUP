In contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standard\nscenario, in which CR positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactions\nbetween the primary CR protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The positron\nexcess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay of\nweakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source of\npairs. The common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke new\nphysics or new astrophysical sources. However, this line of argumentation\nrelies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source\ndistribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can\nnaturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc\naway, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies\n(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nbefore reaching the solar vicinity.

We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect.

The BH accretion rate is highly time variable,\ngiven fixed conditions at ~kpc.

We show that these surveys will obtain the\ncosmic supernova rate by direct counting, in an unbiased way and with high\nstatistics, and thus will allow for precise predictions of the DSNB. Upcoming\nsky surveys will substantially reduce the uncertainties in the DSNB source\nhistory to an anticipated +/-5% that is dominated by systematics, so that the\nobserved high-energy flux thus will test supernova neutrino physics. The\nportion of the universe (z < 1) accessible to upcoming sky surveys includes the\nprogenitors of a large fraction (~ 87%) of the expected 10-26 MeV DSNB event\nrate. We show that precision determination of the (optically detected) cosmic\nsupernova history will also make the DSNB into a strong probe of an extra flux\nof neutrinos from optically invisible supernovae, which may be unseen either\ndue to unexpected large dust obscuration in host galaxies, or because some\ncore-collapse events proceed directly to black hole formation and fail to give\nan optical outburst. \n\n"}

The first light, typically a UV or X-ray flash, is\nfollowed by a broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiation\nthat leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. Motivated by recent detection of\nemission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock\nbreakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying\nspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal\nequilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We\nfind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs)\nand possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation\nis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,\nbefore the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical\nphase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher\ntemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium.

We have analyzed\narchival total flux-density variability at ten frequencies (408 MHz, 4.8 GHz,\n6.7 GHz, 8 GHz, 10.7 GHz, 14.5 GHz, 22 GHz, 37 GHz, 90 GHz, and 230 GHz)\ntogether with the archival high-resolution very long baseline interferometry\ndata at 15 GHz from the MOJAVE monitoring campaign. Using the Fourier transform\nand discrete autocorrelation methods we have searched for periods in the total\nflux-density light curves. In addition, spectral evolution and changes of the\nopacity have been analyzed. We found a period in multi-frequency total\nflux-density light curves of 7.9+-0.5 yrs. Moreover, a quasi-stationary jet\ncomponent C1 follows a prominent helical path on a similar time scale of 8\nyears.

The evolving, overall spectrum of the\nEBL is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. This\nis achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame K-band galaxy\nluminosity function up to redshift 4 (Cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with a\ndetermination of galaxy SED-type fractions. These are based on fitting SWIRE\ntemplates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshift\nrange from 0.2 to 1 from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International\nSurvey (AEGIS). The changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forming\ngalaxies, starburst galaxies and AGN galaxies in that redshift range are\nestimated, and two alternative extrapolations of SED-types to higher redshifts\nare considered. This allows calculation of the evolution of the luminosity\ndensities from the UV to the IR, the evolving star formation rate density of\nthe universe, the evolving contribution to the bolometric EBL from the\ndifferent galaxy populations including AGN galaxies and the buildup of the EBL.\nOur EBL calculations are compared with those from a semi-analytic model, from\nanother observationally-based model and observational data.

A merger of two WDs\nleads to a rapidly spinning WD with a rotational energy comparable to the NS\ncase.

This explains the surprisingly low\nattenuation observed for distant blazars, because the production of secondary\ngamma rays occurs, on average, much closer to Earth than the distance to the\nsource.

The second\none employs a Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model with\nparameters describing a phase transition to two-flavor quark matter at higher\ncritical densities.

Significantly, while many dark matter models feature a\nhelicity suppressed annihilation rate to fermions, bremsstrahlung process can\nremove this helicity suppression such that the branching ratios Br($\\ell \\nu W\n$), Br($\\ell^+\\ell^-Z$), and Br($\\bar\\nu \\nu Z$) dominate over\nBr($\\ell^+\\ell^-$) and Br($\\bar\\nu \\nu$).

If the system comprises a massive\nstar and a young non-accreting pulsar, their winds will collide producing\nbroadband non-thermal emission, most likely originated in the shocked pulsar\nwind. Thermal X-ray emission is expected from the shocked stellar wind, but\nuntil now it has neither been detected nor studied in the context of gamma-ray\nbinaries. We present a semi-analytic model of the thermal X-ray emission from\nthe shocked stellar wind in pulsar gamma-ray binaries, and find that the\nthermal X-ray emission increases monotonically with the pulsar spin-down\nluminosity, reaching luminosities of the order of 10^33 erg/s. The lack of\nthermal features in the X-ray spectrum of gamma-ray binaries can then be used\nto constrain the properties of the pulsar and stellar winds.

These calculations are done numerically using high-resolution\nrelativistic hydrodynamical afterglow blast wave simulations which include the\ntwo-dimensional dynamical features of expanding and decelerating afterglow\nblast waves.

These phenomena bring the star to\nevolve in the quite different (opposite) ways and should be taken into account\nat once, as the gravitational compression is considered. Under the above\ntransition, which is expected to occur within any supermassive neutron star\n(NS), the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum - a coherent state of gluon- and chiral\n$q\\bar q$-condensates - turns, first near the star center, into the \"empty\"\n(perturbation) subhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, pre-existing (very high)\nvacuum pressure falls there down rather abruptly; as a result, the \"cold\" star\nstarts collapsing almost freely into the new vacuum. If the stellar mass is\nsufficiently large, then this implosion is shown to result in an enormous\nheating within the star central domain (up to a temperature about 100-200 MeV\nor, maybe, even higher), what makes the pressure from within to grow up,\npredominantly due to degeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair\nproduction. Thus, a \"flaming wall\" could arise, which withstands the further\ncollapsing and brings the star off the irrevocable shutting into BH.

We obtain a \"phase diagram\" of the system as a function of binary\nparameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have\na different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in\nthe disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a\nsignificant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing\nof the gap. We find that this spillover occurs at an orbital separation as\nlarge as ~200 M_7^{-1/2} gravitational radii, where M = 10^7 M_7 Msun is the\ntotal binary mass. If the secondary is less massive than ~10^6 Msun, then the\ngap is closed before gravitational waves (GWs) start dominating the orbital\ndecay. In this regime, the disk is still strongly perturbed, but the piled-up\ngas continuously overflows as in a porous dam, and crosses inside the\nsecondary's orbit.

The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS).

Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it.

While\nrobust observational evidence for TeV sources at redshifts z>1 is lacking at\npresent, the growing number of TeV blazars with redshifts as large as z~0.5\nsuggests the possibility that the standard blazar models may have to be\nreconsidered. We show that TeV gamma rays can be observed even from a source at\nz>1, if the observed gamma rays are secondary photons produced in interactions\nof high-energy protons originating from the blazar jet and propagating over\ncosmological distances almost rectilinearly. This mechanism was initially\nproposed as a possible explanation for the TeV gamma rays observed from blazars\nwith redshifts z~0.2, for which some other explanations were possible. For TeV\ngamma-ray radiation detected from a blazar with z>1, this model would provide\nthe only viable interpretation consistent with conventional physics. It would\nalso have far-reaching astronomical and cosmological ramifications. In\nparticular, this interpretation would imply that extragalactic magnetic fields\nalong the line of sight are very weak, in the range 0.01 < fG < 10 fG, assuming\nrandom fields with a correlation length of 1 Mpc, and that acceleration of E>\n0.1 EeV protons in the jets of active galactic nuclei can be very effective. \n\n"}

We find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning of\ninfalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially\nfor models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear\nburning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock\nfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the\noxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a\ndiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models\nwith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out\nthat these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in\nboth 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer\nwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so\nthat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. The\nenergy difference is generally smaller (~0.1-0.2 times 10^51 erg) in 2D than in\n1D (at most ~0.6 times 10^51 erg). This is because neutrino-driven convection\nand the shock instability in 2D models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency,\nwhich makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to\n1D models.

Abstract: The progenitors of supernovae (SNe) type Ia are usually assumed to be either\na single white dwarf (WD) accreting from a non-degenerate companion (the SD\nchannel) or the result of two merging WDs (DD channel). However, no consensus\ncurrently exists as to which progenitor scenario is the correct one, or whether\nthe observed SN Ia rate is produced by a combination of both channels. Unlike a\nDD progenitor a SD progenitor is expected to emit supersoft X-rays for a\nprolonged period of time (~1 Myr) as a result of the burning of accreted matter\non the surface of the WD. An argument against the SD channel as a significant\nproducer of SNe type Ia has been the lack of observed supersoft X-ray sources\n(SSS) and the lower-than-expected integrated soft X-ray flux from elliptical\ngalaxies.\n  We wish to determine if it is possible to obscure the supersoft X-ray\nemission from a nuclear burning white dwarf in an accreting single degenerate\nbinary system. In case of obscured systems we wish to determine their general\nobservational characteristics.\n  We examine the emergent X-ray emission from a canonical SSS system surrounded\nby a spherically symmetric configuration of material, assuming a black body\nspectrum with T_BB=50 eV and L=10^38 erg/s.

This may explain the discrepancy of SSS compared to the SN Ia rate\ninferred from observations if the SD progenitor scenario contributes\nsignificantly to the SN Ia rate.

In this paper, we present results from large-scale population\nsynthesis models of binary populations in galaxies from z = 0 to 20.

We run a grid of 192 models, varying all the parameters known from\nprevious studies to affect the evolution of XRBs. We use our models and\nobservationally derived prescriptions for hot gas emission to create\ntheoretical galaxy X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for several redshift bins.\nModels with low CE efficiencies, a 50% twins mass ratio distribution, a steeper\nIMF exponent, and high stellar wind mass loss rates best match observational\nresults from Tzanavaris & Georgantopoulos (2008), though they significantly\nunderproduce bright early-type and very bright (Lx > 10d41) late-type galaxies.\nThese discrepancies are likely caused by uncertainties in hot gas emission and\nSFHs, AGN contamination, and a lack of dynamically formed Low-mass XRBs. In our\nhighest likelihood models, we find that hot gas emission dominates the emission\nfor most bright galaxies. We also find that the evolution of the normal galaxy\nX-ray luminosity density out to z = 4 is driven largely by XRBs in galaxies\nwith X-ray luminosities between 10d40 and 10d41 erg/s. \n\n"}

All this information is essential for understanding\nthe energetic particle acceleration that we discuss further in the review. For\ninstance, we show how fast and slow modes accelerate energetic particles\nthrough the second order Fermi acceleration, while density fluctuations\ngenerate magnetic fields in pre-shock regions enabling the first order Fermi\nacceleration of high energy cosmic rays. Very importantly, however, the first\norder Fermi cosmic ray acceleration is also possible in sites of magnetic\nreconnection. In the presence of turbulence this reconnection gets fast and we\npresent numerical evidence supporting the predictions of the Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999) model of fast reconnection. The efficiency of this process\nsuggests that magnetic reconnection can release substantial amounts of energy\nin short periods of time. As the particle tracing numerical simulations show\nthat the particles can be efficiently accelerated during the reconnection, we\nargue that the process of magnetic reconnection may be much more important for\nparticle acceleration than it is currently accepted.

If the jet\none-sidedness is due to relativistic beaming the depolarization asymmetry must\nbe due to an intervening Faraday screen. If it is intrinsic the depolarization\nasymmetry must be related to internal differences in the lobes. We assume in\nthis paper that the speed in the outer jet of several Fanaroff-Riley Class 1\n(FRI) sources exhibiting the L-G effect is close to the 0.1c reported by\nseveral other investigators. For these sources we find that the jet\none-sidedness cannot be explained by beaming and therefore must be intrinsic.\nIn these FRI sources the L-G effect must be due to differences that originate\ninside the lobes themselves. Although it is not known if the flow in the outer\njets of FRII sources also slows to this speed it is suggested that the\nexplanation of the L-G effect is likely to be the same in both types.

In this case,\nmodeling the inverse-Compton emission shows that the observed gamma-ray flux of\nthe source may in principle be produced within the lobes. This association\nwould imply that efficient in-situ acceleration of the radiating electrons is\noccurring and that the lobes are dominated by the pressure from the\nrelativistic particles.

The accreting matter is\nassumed to be non magnetized and, due to the high accretion rate, matter\npressure dominates over magnetic pressure. We find that an accretion envelope\ndevelops very rapidly and once it becomes convectively stable the magnetic\nfield is easily buried and pushed into the newly forming neutron star crust.\nHowever, for low enough accretion rates the accretion envelope remains\nconvective for an extended period of time and only partial submergence of the\nmagnetic field occurs due to a residual field that is maintained at the\ninterface between the forming crust and the convective envelope.

Pulsar acceleration implies a hard injection spectrum ($\\sim\nE^{-1}$) due to pulsar spin down and a maximum energy $E_{\\rm max} \\sim Z \\,\n10^{19}$ eV due to the limit on the spin rate of neutron stars. We have\npreviously shown that the escape through the young supernova remnant softens\nthe spectrum, decreases slightly the maximum energy, and generates secondary\nnuclei. Here we show that the distribution of pulsar birth periods and the\neffect of propagation in the interstellar and intergalactic media modifies the\ncombined spectrum of all pulsars.

The required\ninjected composition to fit the observed spectrum depends on the absolute\nenergy scale, which is uncertain, differing between Auger Observatory and\nTelescope Array.

Strong variability has been observed in\ngamma rays, with two major flaring episodes (2009 July and 2010 March) and a\nharder-when-brighter behaviour, quite common for FSRQs and\nlow-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs, in 2010 March. In the same way the SED of the\nsource cannot be modelled by a simple synchrotron self-Compton model, as\nopposed to many BL Lacs, but the addition of an external Compton component of\nseed photons from a dust torus is needed. The 230 GHz light curve showed an\nincrease simultaneous with the gamma-ray one, indicating co-spatiality of the\nmm and gamma-ray emission region likely at large distance from the central\nengine. The low, average, and high activity SED of the source could be fit\nchanging only the electron distribution parameters, but two breaks in the\nelectron distribution are necessary.

Aims: This paper shows that the sensitivity of the IceCube\nneutrino telescope in its 40-string configuration (IC-40) is already at the\nlevel of constraining the parameter space of purely hadronic scenarios of\nactivity of blazars. Methods: Assuming that the entire source power originates\nfrom hadronic interactions, and assuming that the models describe the data, we\nestimate the expected neutrino flux from blazars based on the observed\ngamma-ray flux by Fermi, simultaneously with IC-40 observations. We consider\ntwo cases separately to keep the number of constrainable parameters at an\nacceptable level: proton-proton or proton-gamma interactions are dominant.\nComparing the IC-40 sensitivity to the neutrino flux expected from some of the\nbrightest blazars, we constrain model parameters characterizing the parent\nhigh-energy proton spectrum. Results: We find that when pp interactions\ndominate, some constraints on the primary proton spectrum can be imposed.

When the\nrate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these\nbinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the\nneutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by\nthe detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron\nstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered\nmillisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may\ntemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.\nOnly indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here we\nreport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a\nneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar.

IGR J18245-2452 continuously\nswitches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in\nflux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These\nvariations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic\nspectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source\nchanges from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different\ncount rates and energies show a complex variability. These phenomena are not\nusually observed in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, at least not on such a\nshort time scale. Fast variability was also found in the ATCA radio\nobservations carried out for about 6 hours during the outburst at a frequency\nof 5.5 and 9 GHz. We interpret the variability observed from IGR J18245-2452 in\nterms of a \"hiccup\" accretion phase, during which the accretion of material\nfrom the inner boundary of the Keplerian disk is reduced by the onset of\ncentrifugal inhibition of accretion, possibly causing the launch of strong\noutflows. Changes across accretion and propeller regimes have been long\npredicted and reproduced by MHD simulations of accreting millisecond X-ray\npulsars but never observed to produce an extreme variability as that shown by\nIGR J18245-2452. \n\n"}

Large uncertainties\nabout the evolution of massive stars preclude definitive rate predictions for\nmergers of these massive black holes.

We consider that this survey, and many other archival\nlow-latitude (|gb|<30deg) pulsar surveys, have been searched for FRBs but\nproduced fewer detections than the comparatively brief Thornton et al.~search.\nSuch a rate dependence on Galactic position could provide critical supporting\nevidence for an extragalactic origin for FRBs.

We present two-dimensional axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations which start from a collapsar engine and evolve all\nthe way through the late afterglow phase. The resultant outflow includes a jet\ncore which is highly relativistic after breaking out of the star, but becomes\nbaryon-loaded after colliding with a massive outer shell, corresponding to mass\nfrom the stellar atmosphere of the progenitor star which became trapped in\nfront of the jet core at breakout.

If the seed magnetic fields have primordial origins, it is\nlikely that large-scale pervasive magnetic fields were present before the\nformation of the large-scale structure. On the other hand, if they were ejected\nfrom astrophysical bodies, they were highly localized in space at the time of\ninjection. In this paper, using turbulence dynamo models for high magnetic\nPrandtl number fluids, we find constraints on the seed magnetic fields. The\nhydrodynamic Reynolds number based on the Spitzer viscosity in the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) is believed to be less than $O(10^2)$, while the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber can be much larger than that. In this case, if the seed magnetic fields\nhave primordial origins, they should be stronger than $O(10^{-11})$G, which is\nvery close to the upper limit of $O(10^{-9})$G set by the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) observations.

In addition, the X-ray\nspectrum changes from a flat power-law spectrum during the rotation-powered\nstate to a steeper power-law spectrum in the LMXB state. We suggest that the\nhard X-rays are due to the intra-binary shock from the interaction between the\npulsar wind and the injected material from the low-mass companion star. During\nthe rotation-powered MSP state, the X-ray orbital modulation is due to Doppler\nboosting of the shocked pulsar wind. At the LMXB state, the evaporating matter\nof the accretion disk due to the gamma-ray irradiation from the pulsar stops\nalmost all the pulsar wind, resulting the disappearance of the X-ray orbital\nmodulation. \n\n"}

The physical mechanism responsible for the development of these\nexponentially growing instabilities is the superradiant amplification of\nbosonic fields confined between the black hole and the mirror. A remarkable\nfeature of this composed black-hole-mirror-field system is the existence of a\ncritical mirror radius, $r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$, which supports {\\it\nstationary} (marginally-stable) field configurations. This critical\n(`stationary') mirror radius marks the boundary between stable and unstable\nblack-hole-mirror-field configurations: composed systems whose confining mirror\nis situated in the region $r_{\\text{m}}<r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are stable\n(that is, all modes of the confined field decay in time), whereas composed\nsystems whose confining mirror is situated in the region\n$r_{\\text{m}}>r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are unstable (that is, there are\nconfined field modes which grow exponentially over time).

We have recently shown a possible origin of fast\nradio bursts ( FRBs ) by assuming that the axion stars are main component of\nhalos: FRBs arise from the collisions between the axion stars and neutron\nstars. It is remarkable that the masses of the axion stars obtained by the\ncomparison of the theoretical and observational event rates are coincident with\nthe mass $\\sim 10^{-12}M_{\\odot}$. In this paper, we describe our model of FRBs\nin detail. We derive the approximate solutions of the axion stars with large\nradii and constraint their masses for the approximation to be valid. The FRBs\nare emitted by electrons in atmospheres of neutron stars. By calculating the\noptical depth of the atmospheres, we show that they are transparent for the\nradiations with the frequency given by the axion mass $m_a$ such as\n$m_a/2\\pi\\simeq 2.4$GHz$(m_a/10^{-5}\\rm eV)$. Although the radiations are\nlinearly polarized when they are emitted, they are shown to be circularly\npolarized after they pass magnetospheres of neutron stars.

The presence of the finite bandwidths is a distinctive feature of our\nmodel and can be tested observationally. Furthermore, we show that similar FRBs\nmay arise when the axion stars collide with magnetic white dwarfs $B\\sim\n10^9$G.

Furthermore, we demonstrate how NJL and bag models in this\nregime follow from the more general and QCD based framework of Dyson-Schwinger\n(DS) equations in medium by assuming a simple gluon contact interaction. Based\non our simple and novel model, we construct quark hadron hybrid equations of\nstate (EoS) and study systematically chiral and deconfinement phase\ntransitions, the appearance of $s$-quarks and the role of vector interaction.\nWe further study these aspects for matter in beta-equilibrium at zero\ntemperature, with particular focus on the current ~2 solar masses maximum mass\nconstraint for neutron stars. Our approach indicates that the currently only\ntheoretical evidence for the hypothesis of stable strange matter is an artifact\nof tdBAG and results from neglecting the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. \n\n"}

Neutrons stars, with their metal-rich surfaces, are\npotentially interesting sources of such nuclei, but some open issues remain: 1)\nis it possible to extract these nuclei from the star's surface? 2) Do the\nnuclei survive the severe conditions present in the magnetosphere of the\nneutron star? 3) What happens to the surviving nuclei once they enter the wind\nthat is launched outside the light cylinder? In this paper we address these\nissues in a quantitative way, proving that for the most reasonable range of\nneutron star surface temperatures ($T<10^7\\,$K), a large fraction of heavy\nnuclei survive photo-disintegration losses.

In Tauris et al. (2013), it was demonstrated that\nhelium star companions to neutron stars (NSs) may experience mass transfer and\nevolve into naked ~1.5 M_sun metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass\nlimit. Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution\nleading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the\nbinary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron\ncore-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium\nejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or\nType Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star\ndonors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital\nperiods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also\ndiscuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -\nas well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the\nevolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN\nexplosion. We find that ultra-stripped SNe are possible for both EC SNe and Fe\nCCSNe, and that the amount of helium ejected is correlated with P_orb - the\ntightest systems even having donors being stripped down to envelopes of less\nthan 0.01 M_sun.

In particular, we note from simple ballistic\nconsiderations that greater apsidal precession in an orbit is the key to closer\nself-intersection. Thus larger values of $\\beta$, the ratio of the tidal radius\nto the pericenter distance of the initial orbit, are more likely to lead to\nhigher temperatures of more compact disks which are super-Eddington and\ngeometrically and optically thick.

In this paper we propose a mechanism exclusively\nbased on gravity rather than electromagnetic interaction. We show that it is\npossible to generate ultra-high-energy particles starting from particles with\nmoderate energies using the collisional Penrose process in an overspinning Kerr\nspacetime transcending the Kerr bound only by an infinitesimal amount, i.e.,\nwith the Kerr parameter $a=M(1+\\epsilon)$, where we take the limit $\\epsilon\n\\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider two massive particles starting from rest at\ninfinity that collide at $r=M$ with divergent center-of-mass energy and produce\ntwo massless particles.

{"id": "1601.06787", "contents": "Title: Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) Demographics Abstract: We survey the properties of stars destroyed in TDEs as a function of BH mass,\nstellar mass and evolutionary state, star formation history and redshift. For\nMbh<10^7Msun, the typical TDE is due to a M*~0.3Msun M-dwarf, although the mass\nfunction is relatively flat for $M*<Msun. The contribution from older main\nsequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From\nMbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a\nlarger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved\nstars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which\nis largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in\nany observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun\nBHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates. The typical fall back time is\nrelatively long, with 16% having Tfb<10^(-1) years (37 days), and 84% having\nlonger time scales. Many residual rate discrepancies can be explained if\nsurveys are biased against TDEs with these longer Tfb, which seems very\nplausible if Tfb has any relation to the transient rise time. For almost any BH\nmass function, systematic searches for fainter, faster time scale TDEs in\nsmaller galaxies, and longer time scale TDEs in more massive galaxies are\nlikely to be rewarded. \n\n"}

The WD and\nkinematic properties are consistent with the expectations for low-mass X-ray\nbinary evolution and disfavour a three-body formation channel.

This wind is the most convincing case for magnetic driving in\nblack hole binaries, as it has an inferred launch radius which is a factor of\n10 smaller than the thermal wind prediction. However, the optical and\nnear-infrared fluxes monotonically increase around the Chandra observation,\nwhereas the X-ray flux monotonically decreases from 10 days beforehand.

The former issue can be resolved\nby future observations. But the latter issue can be resolved now, if we pay\nattention to what is expected from theoretical considerations. The question of\nwhether a correlation has been found between the power outputs of few objects\nand the spins of their BHs is moot because BH beam power does not scale with\nthe square of the spin of the BH. We show that the theoretical BH beam power is\na strongly nonlinear function of spin that cannot be approximated by a\nquadratic relation, as is generally stated when the influence of the magnetic\nfield is not accounted for in the \\cite{bla77} model.

Meanwhile, recent\nhydrodynamical simulations have indicated that the accretion-induced collapse\nmay be avoided under certain conditions when double WDs merge violently.\nHowever, the properties of SNe Ia from this violent merger scenario are highly\ndependent on a particular mass-accretion stage, the so-called WD + He subgiant\nchannel, during which the primary WD is able to increase its mass by accreting\nHe-rich material from a He subgiant before the systems evolves into a double WD\nsystem. In this article, we aim to study this particular evolutionary stage\nsystematically and give the properties of violent WD mergers. By employing the\nEggleton stellar evolution code, we followed a large number of binary\ncalculations and obtained the regions in parameter space for producing violent\nmergers based on the WD + He subgiant channel. According to these simulations,\nwe found that the primary WDs can increase their mass by ~0.10-0.45 Msun during\nthe mass-accretion stage. We then conducted a series of binary population\nsynthesis calculations and found that the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from this\nchannel is about 0.01-0.4*10-3 yr-1.

Abstract: The sudden short duration decrease in cosmic ray flux is known as Forbush\ndecrease which is mainly caused by interplanetary disturbances. Generally\naccepted view is that the first step of Forbush decrease is due to shock sheath\nand second step is due to Magnetic Cloud (MC) of Interplanetary Coronal Mass\nEjection (ICME). However, there are few questions which needs detail\ninvestigation. (i) Does the complete (or part of) ICME shock or MC contribute\nin cosmic ray decrease? (ii) Is there any internal structure associated with\nthe ICMEs shock/MC which precisely contribute in decrease? To address these\nquestions we have studied a total of 18 large ($>=8 \\%$) Forbush decrease\nevents and associated ICMEs. Majority of events shows multi-steps Forbush\ndecrease profile.

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections.

If the\nenergy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a\nmagnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the\nintergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the\nrequired gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or\nextended emission of short gamma-ray bursts.

Most analyses have focused on the\nhigh-energy part of the spectrum, disregarding the GeV energy region where\ncosmic ray transport is harder to model and solar modulation comes into play.\nGiven the high quality of AMS measurements, it is timely to re-examine the\npositron anomaly over the entire energy range, taking into account transport\nprocesses so far neglected, e.g. convection or diffusive re-acceleration. We\ndevise a new semi-analytical method to take into account transport processes so\nfar neglected, but important below a few GeV. It is based on the pinching of\ninverse Compton and synchrotron energy losses inside the Galactic disc. It\nallows to carry out extensive scans over the cosmic ray propagation parameters,\nwhich we strongly constrain by requiring that the secondary component does not\novershoot the AMS measurements. Only models with large diffusion coefficients\nsurvive this test. The positron flux is a powerful and independent probe of\ncosmic ray propagation, complementary to the boron-to-carbon ratio.

The disc instability model (DIM) successfully explains why many\naccreting compact binary systems exhibit outbursts, during which their\nluminosity increases by orders of magnitude. The DIM correctly predicts which\nsystems should be transient and works regardless of whether the accretor is a\nblack hole, a neutron star or a white dwarf. However, it has been known for\nsome time that the outbursts of X-ray binaries (which contain neutron-star or\nblack-hole accretors) exhibit hysteresis in the X-ray hardness-intensity\ndiagram (HID). More recently, it has been shown that the outbursts of accreting\nwhite dwarfs also show hysteresis, but in a diagram combining optical, EUV and\nX-ray fluxes.\n  Aims. We examine here the nature of the hysteresis observed in cataclysmic\nvariables and low-mass X-ray binaries.\n  Methods. We use the Hameury et al.

Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted\nin an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here\nwe report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known\nrepeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric\nobservations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart.

The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with a power law\nwith $\\Gamma\\sim2$, providing a flux of $\\simeq4\\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-8 keV energy range and a luminosity of $L_{\\rm\nX}\\simeq3\\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a 2.6 kpc distance.

This\nsystem comprises with a young pulsar and a Be type star, which is similar to\nthe so-called gamma-ray binary PSR~B1259-63/LS2883. It is expected therefore\nthat PSR J2032+4127 shows an enhancement of high-energy emission caused by the\ninteraction between the pulsar wind and Be wind/disk around periastron. Ho et\nal. recently reported a rapid increase in the X-ray flux from this system. In\nthis paper, we also confirm a rapid increase in the X-ray flux along the orbit,\nwhile the GeV flux shows no significant change. We discuss the high-energy\nemissions from the shock caused by the pulsar wind and stellar wind interaction\nand examine the properties of the pulsar wind in this binary system. We argue\nthat the rate of increase of the X-ray flux observed by Swift indicates (1) a\nvariation of the momentum ratio of the two-wind interaction region along the\norbit, or (2) an evolution of the magnetization parameter of the pulsar wind\nwith the radial distance from the pulsar. We also discuss the pulsar wind/Be\ndisk interaction at the periastron passage, and propose the possibility of\nformation of an accretion disk around the pulsar.

Here we compare the X-ray properties of TDEs and AGN\nto determine a set of characteristics which would allow us to discriminate\nbetween flares arising from these two objects. We find that at peak, TDEs are\nbrighter than AGN found at similar redshifts.

Nevertheless, TDEs decay significantly\nmore monotonically, and their emission exhibits little variation in spectral\nhardness as a function of time. We also find that X-ray TDEs are less absorbed,\nand their emission is much softer than the emission detected from AGN found at\nsimilar redshifts. We derive the X-ray luminosity function (LF) for X-ray TDEs\nusing the events from Auchettl et al. (2017).

In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine\nmust bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most\nof these jets do not break out, and are instead \"choked\" inside the star, as\nthe central-engine activity time, $t_{\\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling\nthe long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for\ntheir central-engine activity times, $\\propto t_{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha}$ for $t_{\\rm\ne}>t_{\\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\\alpha\\sim4$) and a typical GRB\njet breakout time of $t_{\\rm b}\\sim 60\\text{ s}$ in the star's frame.

The slope of the spectrum below\nthe break agrees with the slope of the average cosmic-ray spectrum in the inner\npart of the disk of the Milky Way that was previously derived from the\nFermi/LAT gamma-ray data. We conjecture that it is this slope of 2.33 and not\nthe locally measured softer slope of 2.7-2.8 that is determined by the balance\nbetween a steady-state injection of cosmic rays with a power-law slope of 2-2.1\nthat is due to Fermi acceleration and the energy-dependent propagation of\ncosmic-ray particles through the turbulent interstellar magnetic field with a\nKolmogorov turbulence spectrum. The approximation of a continuous-in-time\ninjection of cosmic rays at a constant rate breaks down, which causes the\nsoftening of the spectrum at higher energies. \n\n"}

We use analytic solutions for generic spin\nprecession at 2PN order to derive Fourier series for the total and orbital\nangular momenta in which each term is a sinusoid with frequency $\\Omega -\nn\\omega$ for integer $n$.

Microscopic cosmic ray transport processes are\nfundamental for determining the efficiency of cosmic ray wind driving. Previous\nstudies focused on modeling of cosmic ray transport either via constant\ndiffusion coefficient or via streaming proportional to the Alfven speed.\nHowever, in predominantly cold, neutral gas, cosmic rays can propagate faster\nthan in the ionized medium and the effective transport can be substantially\nlarger; i.e., cosmic rays can decouple from the gas. We perform\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of patches of galactic\ndisks including the effects of cosmic rays. Our simulations include the\ndecoupling of cosmic rays in the cold, neutral interstellar medium. We find\nthat, compared to the ordinary diffusive cosmic ray transport case, accounting\nfor the decoupling leads to significantly different wind properties such as the\ngas density and temperature, significantly broader spatial distribution of\ncosmic rays, and larger wind speed. These results have implications for X-ray,\ngamma-ray and radio emission, and for the magnetization and pollution of the\ncircumgalactic medium by cosmic rays. \n\n"}

It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to\nsystematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of\nSNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We\nperformed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties\nof SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley\nrapid binary evolution code. We also considered the influence of different\nmetallicities on the final results. Results: From our simulations, we found\nthat no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a CO WD\nand a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time.\nThis scenario mainly contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long\ndelay times. The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and\na He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and\ncover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from\nthis scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities. \n\n"}

However, the merger environment is polluted by\ndynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate.

Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal\ncan reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be\nexplained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may\nleave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the\norigin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102. We show that a merger remnant would\nappear as a repeating FRB in a time scale of about 1-10 yrs, and expected\nproperties are consistent with the observations of FRB 121102.

We present a new\naccretion model for the moving-mesh code {\\sc arepo} that incorporates (i) mass\naccretion through a thin $\\alpha$-disc, and (ii) spin evolution through the\nBardeen-Petterson effect. We use a diverse suite of idealised simulations to\nexplore the physical connection between spin evolution and larger scale\nenvironment.

At scales above the ion Larmor radius,\nthe theory reduces to the pressure-anisotropic generalization of kinetic\nreduced magnetohydrodynamics (KRMHD) formulated by Kunz et al. (2015). At\nscales at and below the ion Larmor radius, three main objectives are achieved.\nFirst, we analyse the linear response of the pressure-anisotropic gyrokinetic\nsystem, and show it to be a generalisation of previously explored limits. The\neffects of pressure anisotropy on the stability and collisionless damping of\nAlfvenic and compressive fluctuations are highlighted, with attention paid to\nthe spectral location and width of the frequency jump that occurs as Alfven\nwaves transition into kinetic Alfven waves. Secondly, we derive and discuss a\ngeneral free-energy conservation law, which captures both the KRMHD free-energy\nconservation at long wavelengths and dual cascades of kinetic Alfven waves and\nion entropy at sub-ion-Larmor scales. We show that non-Maxwellian features in\nthe distribution function change the amount of phase mixing and the efficiency\nof magnetic stresses, and thus influence the partitioning of free energy\namongst the cascade channels. Thirdly, a simple model is used to show that\npressure anisotropy can cause large variations in the ion-to-electron heating\nratio due to the dissipation of Alfvenic turbulence. Our theory provides a\nfoundation for determining how pressure anisotropy affects the turbulent\nfluctuation spectra, the differential heating of particle species, and the\nratio of parallel and perpendicular phase mixing in space and astrophysical\nplasmas. \n\n"}

Compton\nechoes, an as yet undetected counterpart of GRBs, peak in X-rays and maintain a\nroughly constant flux for hundreds to thousands of years after the burst.\nThough too faint to be detected in typical cosmological GRBs, a fraction of\nclose by bursts with a sufficiently large energy output in X-rays, and for\nwhich the surrounding medium is sufficiently dense, may indeed be observed in\nthis way.

Since the amount of ionized material is controlled by the\ndynamics of the reverse shock, we find the DM changes more slowly than in\nprevious simpler work, which simply assumed a constant ionization fraction.\nFurthermore, the DM can be constant or even increasing as the supernova remnant\nsweeps up material, arguing that a young neutron star hypothesis for FRBs is\nnot ruled out if the DM is not decreasing over repeated bursts.

The thesis study is\nexpected to reveal salient properties of matter dynamics in affine spacetime\nand may reveal an intimate connection between vacuum state and metrical\ngravity. An interesting application of the framework is the inflationary\nregime, where it is shown that affine gravity prefers only a unique metric\ntensor such that the transition from nonminimal to minimal coupling of the\ninflaton is performed only via redefinition of the latter. This allows us to\navoid the use of the so called conformal frames.

The ALPino mass is sub-PeV and slightly ($\\Delta m/m\\sim 10^{-4}$)\nlarger than the gravitino mass, and thus the dark matter abundance does not\nalter virtually after the ALPino decays.

Here it is demonstrated that\nneutrinos may potentially be employed as stellar gyroscopes, if phases of\nactivity by the standing accretion-shock instability (SASI) affect the neutrino\nemission prior to the onset of the SN explosion. This is shown by comparing the\nneutrino emission properties of self-consistent, three-dimensional (3D) SN\nsimulations of a 15 M_sun progenitor without rotation as well as slow and fast\nrotation compatible with observational constraints. The explosion of the fast\nrotating model gives rise to long-lasting, massive polar accretion downflows\nwith stochastic time-variability, detectable e.g. by the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory for any observer direction. While spectrograms of the neutrino\nevent rate of non-rotating SNe feature a well-known sharp peak due to SASI for\nobservers located in the proximity of the SASI plane, the corresponding\nspectrograms of rotating models show activity over a wide range of frequencies,\nmost notably above 200 Hz for rapid rotation.

We show that this assumption is incorrect when the energy is injected\nin the form of energetic (i.e. energy much greater than the background CMB\ntemperature) particles. We evolve the electromagnetic cascades, from the\ninjection of high energy particles, in the expanding Universe and follow the\nnon-thermal component of CMB spectral distortions resulting from the\ninteraction of the electromagnetic shower with the background photons,\nelectrons, and ions. The electromagnetic shower loses a substantial fraction of\nits energy to the CMB spectral distortions before the energy of the particles\nin the shower has degraded to low enough energies that they can thermalize with\nthe background plasma. This spectral distortion is the result of the\ninteraction of non-thermal energetic electrons in the shower with the CMB and\nthus has a shape that is substantially different from the $y$-type or $i$-type\ndistortions. The shape of the final \\emph{non-thermal relativistic}\n($ntr$-type) CMB spectral distortion depends upon the initial energy spectrum\nof the injected electrons, positrons, and photons and thus has information\nabout the energy injection mechanism e.g. the decay or annihilation channel of\nthe decaying or annihilating dark matter particles.

The flaring behavior is\nrecurrent for at least two sources. If the flare represents a short period of\naccretion onto an IMBH during the periastron passage of a donor star on an\neccentric (i.e., repeating) or parabolic (non-repeating) orbit, we argue that\nthe flare's rise time corresponds to the duration during which the donor's\ntidally stripped mass joins a residual disk at the pericenter. This duration is\nin turn equal to three other time scales: the duration of stripping, the sound\ncrossing time of the donor, and the circular orbit time at the pericenter\nradius. Only a white dwarf can have a sound crossing time as short as one\nminute.

We favor an alternative scenario in which occasional polar alignments of\nthe magnetic field in the disk and corona cause the flux dips and formation of\nshocks in the jet. Similar to observations of Seyfert galaxies, intra-band time\nlags of flux variations are longer than predicted by the standard AD model.\nThis suggests that scattering or some other reprocessing occurs.

For each of the progenitors, results with fully\nmulti-dimensional (FMD) neutrino transport and with ray-by-ray-plus (RbR+)\napproximation are considered for two different grid resolutions. While the 9\nsolar-mass models develop explosions, the 20 solar-mass progenitor does not\nexplode with the employed version of simplified neutrino opacities. In all 3D\nmodels we observe the growth of substantial dipole amplitudes of the\nlepton-number (electron neutrino minus antineutrino) flux with stable or slowly\ntime-evolving direction and overall properties fully consistent with the LESA\nphenomenon. Models with RbR+ transport develop LESA dipoles somewhat faster and\nwith temporarily higher amplitudes, but the FMD calculations exhibit cleaner\nhemispheric asymmetries with a far more dominant dipole. In contrast, the RbR+\nresults display much wider multipole spectra of the neutrino-emission\nanisotropies with significant power also in the quadrupole and higher-order\nmodes. Our results disprove speculations that LESA is a numerical artifact of\nRbR+ transport. We also discuss LESA as consequence of a dipolar convection\nflow inside of the nascent neutron star and establish, tentatively, a\nconnection to Chandrasekhar's linear theory of thermal instability in spherical\nshells. \n\n"}

Relativistic electrons\nand positrons traveling in interstellar space lose energy much more rapidly\nthan more massive particles such as protons and nuclei, with a rate that grows\nquadratically with the particle energy $E$. One therefore expects that the\neffects of energy loss should leave observable signatures in the $e^\\mp$\nspectra, in the form of softenings centered at the critical energy $E^*$. This\nquantity is determined by the condition that the total energy loss suffered by\nparticles during their residence time in the Galaxy is of the same order of the\ninitial energy. If the electrons and positrons are accelerated in discrete\n(quasi) point--like astrophysical objects, such as Supernova explosions or\nPulsars, the stochastic nature of the sources should also leave observable\nsignatures in the $e^\\mp$ energy spectra and angular distributions above a\nsecond (higher) critical energy $E^\\dagger$, determined by the condition that\nparticles with $E \\gtrsim E^\\dagger$ can propagate only for a maximum distance\nshorter than the average separation between sources.
